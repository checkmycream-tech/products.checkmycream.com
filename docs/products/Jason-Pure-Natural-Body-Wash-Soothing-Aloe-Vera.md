      <li>As for the product itself, it does the job without irritating my skin, but it somehow has a strong odor I can only describe as sage?</li>

<li> and I&#x27;ve never been unhappy with anything that I&#x27;ve ever purchased by them.</li>
<li> When the package arrived, the bottle had leaked so badly that it had oozed throught the cardboard box - a lot.</li>

    <li> For anyone who has very sensitive skin this is a really good body wash.  I live in a small town so I only had one choice for body washes and decided to try this product and I am glad I did.  Now I have choices &amp; will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The body wash is great, but the new bottle it comes in is TERRIBLE! It leaks everywhere, and the lid will not stay shut. The old bottle with the pump was great. Please bring back the pump!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years. When the market stopped carrying it I was really excited to see it on amazon. Took forever for it to ship, but they had told me it would take a long time.

This body wash leaves my skin feeling very smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> good for asthmatics! fair price - I am a repeat user - if you have allergy or Asthma issues I recommend this</li>
    <li> Love this.  Gentle, cleans well, and unscented.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this for years, and then switched, and had to switch back. this makes your skin sooo soft! Nothing compares, and the scented ones are great too!!</li>
    <li> Just started using this. I was looking for a gentle product for sensitive skin, and I have not experienced any skin irritation so far whatsoever. I also like the fact that this company does not engage in animal testing. The pump is very convenient for showers.</li>
    <li> Leaves you clean and fragrance free. Absolutely no problem here, for a person with really serious chemical sensitivity problems. Couldn&#x27;t live without it. That goes for the Jason Fragrance Free Shampoo as well.</li>

    <li> Works well.  I have used Jason products for many years as I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps.  I think that I prefer at least lightly scented vs. fragrance free, but since I purchased 2 bottles, I will use it.  It have medical issues &amp; it does cleanse &amp; remove body odors well.</li>
    <li> Love it, except one of the bottles opened and spilled in the packaging.</li>
    <li> Really nice body wash, non irritating, and the best part there is almost no scent to it. Great for shaving.</li>

As for the product itself, it does the job without irritating my skin, but it somehow has a strong odor I can only describe as sage? Though it doesn&#x27;t contain sage, the smell has prevented me from using it - I smell like bread stuffing on Thanksgiving when I do. Not such a bad thing that there is so little left, but disappointed that this purchase was such a complete and messy waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not only is it fragrance free, it is also moisturizing, a must for Colorado&#x27;s dry climate.  Can not find it in any of the local stores.</li>
    <li> Great wash if you or someone you know has any skin allergies.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and sensitive skin - but I think I&#x27;m allergic to this. I couldn&#x27;t use it more than twice before I had problems.</li>
