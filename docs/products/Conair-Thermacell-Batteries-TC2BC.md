<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great quality just what I needed for my soldering iron. Will buy them again when I need more. Great price for two and better prices for more quantities.I recommend them to anyone who needs a thermacell for your device.</li>
    <li> So far all products have been fine.</li>
    <li> As advertised, No problems</li>
    <li> I like having a curling iron that doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in.  I can travel with it and the cartridges are easy to insert and remove.</li>
    <li> Great to know this product is available for refilling the curling iron.  These cells last a long time and are easy to store.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the butane cartridges for quite some time and glad I finally found them.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Came quick. Worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Item as listed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> works as well as one can expect.</li>
    <li> I had the travel curling iron years ago but  the base of it had cracked so the thermacell would not fit into it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my new curling iron.  I am finding that they last longer than other cartridges that I have used with my old iron.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these refills yet, but the one that came with styled works great and I&#x27;m sure these will too</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She  thought she could not fine the product anymore. She&#x27;s  been  using the produce for a quite some time.</li>
    <li> I was glad to have found these Conair Thermacell Refill Cartridges, since the stores in my area does not carry them. When they first arrived I thought they wound not work, they seemed too small. They fit perfectly and I am very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> The Conair Thermacell refills is exactly what I have been looking for and needed for awhile.</li>
    <li> I hate throwing out useful appliances and when I could not find refills at stores around me for my older Conair travel hot brush, I was afraid that is what I would be faced with.  I am delighted to find these replacements, and reasonably priced, too! I not only use the travel hot brush for travel, but use it at home as well. It is just marvelous for travel--so lightweight and practical.  Just remember to pack it in checked luggage.</li>
    <li> Work as they are supposed to. :)</li>
    <li> got her extra for her curling iron so she doesn&#x27;t run out</li>
    <li> I love, love, love thermacell cartridges to use in my appliances!!!!  Please never stop making them and always keep thermaCELL cartridges available so those of us who are hooked on cordless pleasure remain happy!!!</li>
    <li> the cartridges don&#x27;t last. They should come with 6 free and then sell the others at half price. But being able to curl your hair while gardening...priceless.</li>
    <li> these never let me down</li>
    <li> Bought Conair for my curling iron when I went on Vacation. Very usefull and takes up so little room in my luggage. I now use my curling iron at home..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to last very long ! Would not waste my money again ! I would buy the cheaper brand if I bought more.</li>
    <li> I could never find the refills, but of course you had them. I can curl my hair while my husband drives to any event. Also this is the only styling tool that hold curls in my hair, I got my first one in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t last as long as they say for &amp;#34;average use&amp;#34; they said a couple of months....They did fine for me but each only lasts about 2-3 weeks with daily use.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for yrs. Handy and can only fine on line.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use them yet but if they last as long as the ones I have in my&lt;br /&gt;Thermal curler you have got you a winner</li>
    <li> Arrived fast  They were what was expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Bought the actual curling iron over 20 years ago.  Thankful I was able to buy replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for some time so I was delighted to receive the cartridges........so handy for traveling.  no way</li>
    <li> It worked great! And it got very hot FAST! Perfect for my trip to Mexico (in a casita with no electricity).  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My refill cartridges fit my device perfectly and the they work great! Can&#x27;t beat the price. I will order again!! Thanks</li>
    <li> These cartridges are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this handy little gas powered curling iron from a local Wall Mart.  When she returned for more refill cart cartrages she found that they no longer carried them.  This is where Anazon steps in and saves the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She took back the new electric curling iron she did not need and now has the replacement cartrages she does need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with my Conair Butane curling iron.  Didn&#x27;t realize a cartridge lasts so long.....I probably won&#x27;t need another for 2 years or more. (I do like the curling iron, too)</li>
    <li> Great convenience for overseas travel so you don&#x27;t have to deal with various electrical adapters and converters. Lightweight easy to use</li>
    <li> Glad to find this hard to find item</li>
    <li> They are exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to be - last as long as any I&#x27;ve ever purchased - I love my butane curling iron for travelling</li>
    <li> This product was pictures with a brush attachment and it did not come with one!!!!  Very disappointed.  I will not trust this again!!!!</li>
    <li> They worked as advertised, great.  I purchased this curler many years ago and hope I can continue to acquire the cartridges.</li>
    <li> I have had the Conair Thermacell Curling Iron for many years and the stores stopped selling the cartridges.  I was so happy to find them on Amazon.  They were exactly what I needed.  Now I don&#x27;t have to get rid of my curling iron.</li>
    <li> Along with the Thermacell Iron, this was a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and, when she did, she said it looked as good as her stylist could do.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY THERMACELL CURLING IRON AND I BUY ALL OF MY SUPPLIES THROUGH amazon.com</li>
    <li> Works great.  Perfect size! I recommend this for the curling iron you want to take on the go with you!</li>
    <li> So good to have them on line, love my Conair portable curling iron.</li>
    <li> The cells lasted a long time and were very handy and travel efficient.</li>
    <li> These thermacells last for a least two months or more and on each use will stay well heated for a long length of time.  They heat up fast and will stay at an even temperature. I really like these as I get my money worth from each cell/cartridges.</li>
    <li> Used it in Europe and it was great. Did not have to worry about which adapter to use.</li>
    <li> I love this option for traveling!</li>
    <li> So happy to be able to get these cartridges for my hair straightener</li>
    <li> I hope they never discontinue these Thermacell refills. Travelling as much as I do, internationally, they are a God send. Don&#x27;t ever want to be without them! Try them, you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
    <li> I HAVE A CONAIR MINI CURLING IRON,WHICH MY HUSBAND PURCHASED IN HAWAII WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION. IT IS A WONDERFUL DEVICE,BUT NO WHERE COULD I FIND A CARTRIDGE,EXCEPT ON AMAZON. MY QUESTION IS WHY IS&#x27;NT CONAIR MAKING IT EASIER. IT WOULD LIKE BUYING A CAR, &amp;#34;oh i&#x27;m sorry mam it came with three wheals..and no we don&#x27;t make the fourth wheel anymore!! OKAY WHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO WITH THIS PRODUCT? THANK GOD FOR AMAZON OR MY HAIR WOULD LOOK LIKE HELL FOREVER.  BARBARA TURANO</li>
    <li> great  the are VERY hard to find in the stores can go without them</li>
    <li> Fit my Revlon camping/emergency curling iron well. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use them because the hand held curler didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> good product good service</li>
    <li> Thanks. I love using my Conair Curlers but couldnt find  the cartridges locally.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I needed and it works perfectly plus I received the item in a very short time. Will order more when I use these up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Conair cordless curling iron for years. Love it. Hope I can always count on you for cartridges.</li>
    <li> these are hard to find so was very happy to find them so my curling iron will be useable camping.</li>
    <li> I bought Connair thermacell refill because I need i them.  I live in Argentina, where I cannot get them, they do not exist.</li>
    <li> Would not heat the iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these online!</li>
    <li> What can I say, they work just fine as they always have! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Need these for my favorite curling iron.  Please keep the available.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT USED THIS PRODUCT YET AND IN THE PAST THEY WERE GREAT. NO [ROBLEM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them before, I can&#x27;t get them in store where I live, I love the cordless curling tongues, I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t more popular, great for taking on trips. I will be ordering more refills when these run out, It could be a while as they last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product and need it for my  Conair curler and it&#x27;s easy to fill.</li>
    <li> refills Are Necessary!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I hope CONAIR keeps this product in their line-up because my wife uses it all of the time.</li>
    <li> I love the cartridges. Eons ago I had a cordless iron &amp; I really used it a lot. We used to go camping a lot with children &amp; 4-wheel driving in the desert. We just sold our last 4-wheel drive 2 years ago. Needless to say I had way good use of it as did not need cordless really comes in&lt;br /&gt;handy &amp; it is nice to have extra cartridges.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product since it came on the market.  Is great for traveling, or at home for quick curls.  I&#x27;m still using my original iron and just keep buying refills.  Love it&#x27;s convenience of NO CORD to mess with......and it really gets HOT and curls well.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  My curling iron, requiring the cartridges, is small and convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> I have a Conair curling iron, bought many years ago, and was skeptical these would work, but they were perfect.</li>
    <li> Because it heats quickly and it&#x27;s easy to use.  It&#x27;s good for travel. The price is right. Does not need an electrical outlet</li>
    <li> love the item, just forgot how to install.I have an old Braun curling iron which uses the thermacell cartridges. Guess I need to lok up the curler now.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to see that these are still available.  I use my gas curling iron when I&#x27;m staying in a cabin on an island with no electricity.</li>
    <li> These are great and long lasting. Found out these are the same as the thermacells sold at Walmart for the mosquito thermacell. Can get unscented and don&#x27;t have to pay shipping...but I&#x27;m glad I got these. They will last me a long while</li>
    <li> I use these cartridges in my conair portable hair curling wand and it provides a lot of heat which makes the wand do it&#x27;s job.  The cartridge lasts a long time.  I&#x27;m so pleased that I found them on Amazon at a fair price and can use my curling wand again.  My local stores stopped carrying this item.  You can&#x27;t go wrong if this is the item you are looking for!.</li>
    <li> The conair refill cartridges arrived by the promised date. I&#x27;ve used Conair Thermacell Hair Curlers for 20-30 years. Ordering the refills is great because they&#x27;re seldom available in my city. Always on the go and this allows me to curl my hair ANYWHERE!</li>
    <li> The cartridges are pretty straight forward. They work easily and do the job of heating the curling iron. That&#x27;s all there is to it.</li>
    <li> I got the iron (2) was a mistake but after i used it i decided i would keep the 2nd one also. I took it to Paris. It was fantastic. I still have a little trouble getting it to turn on (my fault i&#x27;m sure)  but it makes a beautiful soft curl. I will take it to St. Maarten in February. I am giving the other one to my sister who also has curly hair but has a few unmanagable ones as i do. I let her try it and she liked it too. It was especially great because there were 6 of us sharing one bathroom so i needed to go elsewhere to do my hair. You know the plug outlets in Europe are not in the most practical place so not needing to plug in was an extra bonus. I just needed a mirror and we had one in the living area. Thank you for a great product that lives up to what it promised. This just doesn&#x27;t happen often enough. Sincerely Rebekah Kordisch.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted and it arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> I use a travel straightener/curler very compact &amp; these cartridges are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived as promised.&lt;br /&gt;If you travel a lot these are wonderful and the cartridges last quite a few weeks with daily use.</li>
    <li> No problems.  Get what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These work nicely.  Don&#x27;t have to mess with cords.</li>
    <li> Love my Conair curling iron and was glad to find them at such a good price and shipped quickly. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> i like this product, i have cordless curlers and i can&#x27;t seem to find ThermaCells in the stores.  So i ordered and i received very quickly.  It&#x27;s a great product especially for on the go use.  i can take to the gym and it doesn&#x27;t weigh you down.</li>
    <li> Love this for many reasons. We had lost electricity many times in our area and it sure came in handy . I have used my curling iron camping , many times. We are getting ready to do a big trip on camping and had to have refills .</li>
    <li> These cells are easy to use and fit my cordless curler and they work just fine and last a long time.</li>
    <li> they are the right ones. and are easy to pack</li>
    <li> The refills were just what I wanted. Thanks!</li>

    <li> My curling iron was quite old and was thrilled to find cartridges that still fit.</li>
    <li> I had a conair thermacell curling iron n we moved n lost it! Loved the iron n the cartridges! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Love using these. Good buy and heats fast.</li>
    <li> These fit my travel iron that I use on my moms haur in the nursing home. She is wheel chair bound and this is perfect for those quick touch ups.</li>
    <li> IF you purchase the Conair Thermacell curling iron----which works great----you will need these fuel cartridges to heat the curling iron.</li>
