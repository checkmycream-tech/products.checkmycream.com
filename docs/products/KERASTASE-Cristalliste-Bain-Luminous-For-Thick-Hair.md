      <li>It really cleans and lifts your hair beautifully.</li>
      <li>great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
      <li>It detangles much better than a drugstore conditioner, but in order to feel like my ends were being saturated, I had to use a lot, much more than I am accustomed to using with Kerastase.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied with my order.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance, love the feeling after washing my hair.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful for women with really long hair.</li>
      <li>The product was exactly as described, was brand new, &amp; in perfect condition!</li>
      <li>My hair is more manageable and has a smooth sleek look.  </li>
      <li>And they stay straight, even with the warm and humid Summer we&#x27;re having.</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo for long hair.</li>
      <li>The reviews were RIGHT!  </li>
      <li>Its claim is true.</li>
      <li>course they are more expensive, but it makes her happy!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not above &amp; beyond amazing</li>
      <li>Love L&#x27;Oreal Professional.</li>
      <li>this one has made no difference to the texture of my hair and it stragely (given the description) made my hair oily pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It is amazing for my long hair, keeps it growing health and shinning.</li>
      <li>is the first time I bought, not yet had time to see results, but I liked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kerastase does exactly what it promises.</li>
      <li>As with most Kerastase products, a little seems to go a long way, and it gives a good wash.</li>
      <li>Definitely a holy grail item and in my opinion worth the investment because I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I do of the cheap shampoos.</li>
      <li>I started using it after my last appt with my stylist and my color has faded significantly.  </li>
      <li>It is softly scented, and leaves my hair claen and shinny!!</li>
      <li>The Bain Cristal lathers a little bit more than the Oleo Relax, but not excessively.</li>
      <li>Dried, my roots and the upper half of the hair lengths admittedly looked very good, with a lot of lift, body, and shine, but the lower ends were not at all smoothed.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and no tangles!</li>
      <li>Really good with for my long and thick hair.</li>
      <li>With Oleo Relax I never had to use much in the way of styling products on the hair ends, but with Cristalliste I ended up needing product to calm them down.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and this product really helped.</li>
      <li>I have thick long hair, this shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve used and every time I use it my hair smells like I just left the salon for the next few days.</li>
      <li>I will go back to my old shampoo I was using before I bought this one.</li>
      <li>In the past Oleo Relax has been my favorite Kerastase line, but I have to be careful not to use too much of the masque near the roots because it will weigh the hair down and make it a bit oily.</li>
      <li>I have long, highlighted hair that is very thick, but has strands which are individually pretty fine, not coarse.</li>
      <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re new to Kerastase and have long, colored hair, I&#x27;d start by trying Oleo Relax.</li>
      <li>The very ends tend to get quite dry and unmangeable, but the roots are not at all dry.</li>

    <li> My salon used this on my hair and swore up and down that my hair needed this product. I bought it from Amazon.com as it is 1/2 the price. After a few weeks of use (I was my hair every 3rd day or so), it dried my hair out terribly. Maybe this shampoo works well with the 10 other products my hair dresser put on my head, but it doesn&#x27;t work well by itself. I will go back to my old shampoo I was using before I bought this one.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, it does help keep my hair from being inconsistent at the roots and ends. I would buy it again, however I recommend using a good conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> Love L&#x27;Oreal Professional. It is softly scented, and leaves my hair claen and shinny!! I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed. Excellent product. Leaves hair hydrated. I have long hair and this product really helped. Recommend. Try this. It s excellent.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Love the fragrance, love the feeling after washing my hair. Really good with for my long and thick hair. And they stay straight, even with the warm and humid Summer we&#x27;re having.</li>
    <li> NOT wroth the price at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews, but this shampoo gave me dandruff and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill never ever buy it again</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as described, was brand new, &amp; in perfect condition! I am completely satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> kerastase is king... all the shampoos each for  your indiviual condition are pro level and will do what they are suppose to do, find your hair type or problem, pay the money and have salon quality hair at home</li>
    <li> Love Kerastase! This product is wonderful for women with really long hair. It really cleans and lifts your hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> is the first time I bought, not yet had time to see results, but I liked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for long hair. My hair feels soft and no tangles! Very happy to have discovered this brand.</li>
    <li> This dried my hair out.  I also had to use a lot of it in order to get it to suds up.  I started using it after my last appt with my stylist and my color has faded significantly.  I haven&#x27;t had this issue with other high-end brands.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used other kerastase products and typically you notice the difference on your hair right away. this one has made no difference to the texture of my hair and it stragely (given the description) made my hair oily pretty quickly. rating this tougher because of the price you pay for the stuff.</li>
    <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
    <li> I have thick long hair, this shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve used and every time I use it my hair smells like I just left the salon for the next few days. Definitely a holy grail item and in my opinion worth the investment because I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I do of the cheap shampoos.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect for my hair. Doesn&#x27;t make it oil And keeps it hidratated without friizz. Perfect for fine hair...</li>
    <li> ...my girlfriend loves it!!! The differece between Kerastase products and others are visible and palpable!!&lt;br /&gt;Of course they are more expensive, but it makes her happy!!</li>
    <li> My hair it&#x27;s not the same...after i use this conditioner and shampoo too!&lt;br /&gt;Have more shine and more soft!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> It came in perfect conditions, as I ordered, and on time. It is amazing for my long hair, keeps it growing health and shinning.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair that reacts horribly to humidity. This is the best hair care product I&#x27;ve found for my hair.</li>
    <li> this is a good shampoo... leaves my hair clean. it&#x27;s not above &amp; beyond amazing but it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This product has been perfect for my type of hair.  I got a sample from a hairdresser and then bought this one.  It was great. Its claim is true. Long, thin hair.  It gives body and support to ends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Kerastase products in the past, including the Oleo Relax and Chroma Reflect lines. I have long, highlighted hair that is very thick, but has strands which are individually pretty fine, not coarse. The very ends tend to get quite dry and unmangeable, but the roots are not at all dry. In the past Oleo Relax has been my favorite Kerastase line, but I have to be careful not to use too much of the masque near the roots because it will weigh the hair down and make it a bit oily. When I went online to purchase recently, I was intrigued by this newer Cristalliste line because it is intended specifically for long hair. I purchased the Lait Cristal and the Bain Cristal for thick hair. The Bain Cristal lathers a little bit more than the Oleo Relax, but not excessively. As with most Kerastase products, a little seems to go a long way, and it gives a good wash. However, I am much pickier about conditioner, and the Lait Cristal, for thick hair, does not really seem to cut it. It detangles much better than a drugstore conditioner, but in order to feel like my ends were being saturated, I had to use a lot, much more than I am accustomed to using with Kerastase. Dried, my roots and the upper half of the hair lengths admittedly looked very good, with a lot of lift, body, and shine, but the lower ends were not at all smoothed. With Oleo Relax I never had to use much in the way of styling products on the hair ends, but with Cristalliste I ended up needing product to calm them down. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this purchase. Having already invested in a salon-sized bottle of the Bain and Lait, I may try adding the Lumiere Liquide serum and seeing if that will solve the issue with the ends. Overall, if you&#x27;re new to Kerastase and have long, colored hair, I&#x27;d start by trying Oleo Relax.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews - I thought I try it.  The reviews were RIGHT!  My hair is more manageable and has a smooth sleek look.  I highly recommend this line especially for people that have thick, coarse, and frizzy hair. KUDOS Kerastae!</li>
    <li> Kerastase does exactly what it promises. This is great for my hair type. The shine is awesome. A little goes a long way. Just do your homework and pick correctly for your hair type. Love this.</li>
