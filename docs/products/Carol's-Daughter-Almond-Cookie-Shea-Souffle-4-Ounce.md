### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOVE IT !!!!!</li>
      <li>Carol&#x27;s Daughter has the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>For now, I&#x27;m hooked on this wonderful lotion.</li>
      <li>Very good I use it every day.</li>
      <li>Almost every time I&#x27;ve put some of the Almond Cookie Souffle on, someone, including my spouse, will tell me how great it smells.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>i began to LOVE it!!</li>
      <li>This is a good thing bc</li>
      <li>However, it is more fragrant than the body butter and the aroma is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Always an amazing product</li>
      <li>and it makes me smell really nice.  </li>
      <li>i love this product because it has a nice fragence</li>
      <li>I love the almond cookie shea soufflé, I need some more.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I tried this as a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; more &amp;#34;spreadable&amp;#34; option than the almond cookie body butter which was a fave.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, the smoothness.</li>
      <li>Wish it was more amount of cream for the price you pay</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, but very rich and hydrating.</li>
      <li>Smell is light which I love.</li>
      <li>Plus, you don&#x27;t need to use much product to get good skin coverage.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice smell and made my skin soft.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure with the scent, but the more and more I used it</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent starts off a bit almond-like then fades quickly to a strong baby-powder scent.</li>
      <li>But the scent is so strong it makes my eyes water and burn.  </li>
      <li>The scent is fabulous.</li>
      <li>It has such a wonderful scent, especially if used after a nice shower/bath.</li>
      <li>This is another unique product.</li>
      <li>They were running a special</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t order it again unless there is a sale or special deal.</li>
      <li>This product goes on real smooth and makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is sweet, and intoxicating.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I like the product, and this seller shipped out fast!!</li>
      <li>but it is worth it</li>
      <li>I have purchased several of these almond products and love them all.</li>
      <li>This Carol&#x27;s Daughter product does keep you soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely yummy.</li>
      <li>I definitely plan to purchase more products in the future.</li>
      <li>I wish they&#x27;d introduce new scents.</li>
      <li>I only wished I checked Carol&#x27;s Daughter website first.</li>
      <li>I can only handle smelling so much of the Almond Cookie before I need a break for some days.</li>
      <li>If she wants comment on a product she should keep her comments only Pertaining to the products NOT on another person&#x27;s review</li>
      <li>However, I think since the souffle is lighter, it does not work as well as the body butter--it does not leave skin as soft and moisturized as the body butter.  </li>
      <li>This was an okay product, a little thick.</li>

<li> It lasts a long time too.</li>

    <li> i love this product because it has a nice fragence and it makes me smell really nice.  This product goes on real smooth and makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this cream (heavy, creamy, and oily) for after a bath on my legs (like using a dry oil).  But the scent is so strong it makes my eyes water and burn.  I don&#x27;t usually react to fragrances, but this one really burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent starts off a bit almond-like then fades quickly to a strong baby-powder scent. Use sparingly if you like that scent; if you don&#x27;t like it, then I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was wearing the almond cookie and my sister caught a swift of it and said oh, i want some because i want to smell just like you.</li>
    <li> Always an amazing product</li>
    <li> I can not get enough of Carol&#x27;s daughter! This is another unique product. Anyone should try this! Please try it!</li>
    <li> A friend was wearing this product; so, I followed her to find out what it was. I have purchased several of these almond products and love them all.</li>
    <li> I felt like Laura has VERY BAD TASTE!  If she wants comment on a product she should keep her comments only Pertaining to the products NOT on another person&#x27;s review HOW VERY RUDE I don&#x27;t know either person but felt Laura&#x27;s review shouldn&#x27;t have been posted! She shouldn&#x27;t be ALLOWED to review products in the future! What a TRULY RUDE PERSON!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, the smoothness. Wish it was more amount of cream for the price you pay but it is worth it, I just don&#x27;t use it everyday so it last me longer.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is sweet, and intoxicating. It lasts a long time too. Plus, you don&#x27;t need to use much product to get good skin coverage. I wish they&#x27;d introduce new scents. I can only handle smelling so much of the Almond Cookie before I need a break for some days. One with marshmallow, moringa, or gardenia perhaps.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; more &amp;#34;spreadable&amp;#34; option than the almond cookie body butter which was a fave.  However, I think since the souffle is lighter, it does not work as well as the body butter--it does not leave skin as soft and moisturized as the body butter.  However, it is more fragrant than the body butter and the aroma is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the almond cookie shea soufflé, I need some more. lol</li>
    <li> It has a very nice smell and made my skin soft. I only wish the product size was bigger for the amount of money you pay. I probably won&#x27;t order it again unless there is a sale or special deal.</li>
    <li> This cream is luscious!!! It&#x27;s not greasy, but very rich and hydrating. I have somewhat oily skin and some nights I put this on my face. The scent is fabulous. Absolutely yummy. Almost every time I&#x27;ve put some of the Almond Cookie Souffle on, someone, including my spouse, will tell me how great it smells. And it really moisturizes those dry hands and other areas as well if not better than any of the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried over the years, like Aveeno, Curel, etc. For now, I&#x27;m hooked on this wonderful lotion. Try it!</li>
    <li> Very good I use it every day. LOVE IT !!!!!</li>
    <li> When i used the product,everyone asked what is that smell. This is a good thing bc it smells like vanilla almond and it last a long time. Several people asked about the product and are considering purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This Carol&#x27;s Daughter product does keep you soft and smooth.  I usually use the Ecstasy scent, but thought I would try this one.  I do not like it as well.</li>
    <li> This smells just like the almond cookie. I only wished I checked Carol&#x27;s Daughter website first. They were running a special and I would have paid half of this sellers price. Otherwise, I like the product, and this seller shipped out fast!!</li>
    <li> This was an okay product, a little thick. Smell is light which I love. Would have given it 4 stars, but I think due to settlement of the product, the overall look in the jar was a little funny looking.</li>
    <li> It cleared up the rash.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure with the scent, but the more and more I used it i began to LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter has the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. It has such a wonderful scent, especially if used after a nice shower/bath. I definitely plan to purchase more products in the future.</li>
