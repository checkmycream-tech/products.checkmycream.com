      <li>Had I waited one more day, it would have arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more soon.</li>

      <li>I have no complaint about these tips they were all uniformed in size and the quality was great</li>
      <li>Overall, this works great for testing polish colors and nail art, just be sure you have a way to label your work that does not include writing on the stick.  </li>
      <li>Having these makes it so easy to see what colors of polishes I have.</li>
      <li>Will not break easily.</li>
      <li>so I could arrange and add sticks easily.</li>
      <li>What I needed to display colors easy</li>
      <li>Overall, good product if you aren&#x27;t looking for anything spectacular.</li>
      <li>Product works fine</li>
      <li>These are cheap, but they don&#x27;t act like it.  </li>
      <li>but I found that they didn&#x27;t all fit</li>
      <li>I in no way shape of form am a nail artist, but I do love nail art and when I do or see a design I really like, I love to keep a reminder of what I did for future use and these are great</li>
      <li>I dont like the screw that secure the fan.</li>
      <li>Love to swatch, love to play, thanks</li>
      <li>These swatch sticks are perfect to try out a new polish and help keep track of what is in your &amp;#34;stash.&amp;#34; If you are anything like me you acquire new polishes and want to try them right away, but may not want to remove whatever polish you just applied.</li>
      <li>These sticks allow you to test the color and the opacity quickly and easily, and then organize them however you&#x27;d like to you</li>
      <li>Luckily I bought 2 and didn&#x27;t use all 100 to fit</li>
      <li>Since I have so many, I&#x27;ll be adding them to a chain or a large ring instead of the screw that comes with it.</li>
      <li>I love these so much</li>
      <li>love these so much</li>
      <li>Completely a user error, but they still work well and are of pretty good quality.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re affordable and arrive quickly.</li>
      <li>The long part is a good place to write the colors.</li>
      <li>I have about 500 bottles of polish, so these are doing a great job for my little project.  </li>
      <li>Nice but cream colored not white</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it once you get it.</li>
      <li>it worth the money</li>
      <li>The sticks I received are more a clear, opaque cream/beige color.  </li>
      <li>However, they work well for my own personal use.</li>
      <li>Swatching is great for nail art or special effects on gel polish, because you don&#x27;t spend all that time doing it on your fingers only to dislike it and gel polish can&#x27;t be taken off like regular fingernail polish.</li>
      <li>There is just the right amount of space to write what the polish is on the stick</li>
      <li>I did email them and they responded right away.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with these.</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I will most likely order another set at some point.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I only wish it held more.  </li>
      <li>Most of the edges are jagged and need to be filed if you use them for display, I only use them for home use</li>
      <li>I chose white nail sticks because I felt like it would be better if I had something opaque to start with</li>
      <li>but I was aware it could be a while...</li>
      <li>Love these to catalog my nail polish - many colors look so different in the bottle than on actual swatches, so it&#x27;s very helpful.</li>
      <li>and this helps so much to see exactly how the color will look once on my nails rather than wasting the paint on my nail</li>
      <li>Looks exactly like on a picture, very helpful for me, as i work with clients and need some demonstration of colors i have</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and fast shipping said it woulD be delivered by may 14 but came April 27</li>
      <li>The fact that they are individual nails makes it easy to do nail art on them.</li>
      <li>I choose to keep them on large binder clips instead of the large screws that came with.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much nail polish I had since I&#x27;ve organized my nail polish container</li>
      <li>really like these practice nails.</li>
      <li>I really like these to swatch my polish inventory.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for the price. The screw isn&#x27;t really long enough.... kinda a tight fit</li>
    <li> These took what seems like eternity to arrive. I eventually forgot about them and now have no need for them!</li>
    <li> They are great I am using them to put jamberry nails on . To show customers what all the different wraps look like in person.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to swatch my nail polish colors and it is perfect. I have quite a few bottles of polish, at least a hundred based on how many swatches I now have. I arranged all of my colors by the rainbow and it came out the way that I had envisioned. I&#x27;m incredibly happy. The customer service from this seller was fantastic and I would definitely do business with them again. If I had it to do over again, I would&#x27;ve purchased clear instead of white because the DYMO labels I use to identify which polish color the swatch is are clear. I chose white nail sticks because I felt like it would be better if I had something opaque to start with so of use less polish to achieve opacity.</li>
    <li> Theyre advertised as White, but the product I received were off-white. But they worked for what I wanted them for.</li>
    <li> Nice but cream colored not white</li>
    <li> The sticks I received are more a clear, opaque cream/beige color.  Which I don&#x27;t mind because after painting a few, I feel they are more true to the actual nail, and what it looks like on my hand.  The ends are a little rough as stated by other reviews, but nothing that ruined the purpose of these, you could even file or clip it if it really snags.  I found that a sharpie did not write on this, it just didn&#x27;t dry and it smeared even after a few minutes of letting it sit.  A little disappointing, but I can use a sticky label to identify these.  I did not try to remove any of the polish, so not sure how they hold up to acetone or non-acetone polish remover.  Overall, this works great for testing polish colors and nail art, just be sure you have a way to label your work that does not include writing on the stick.  **UPDATE** I had to buy some ultra-fine tip sharpies for another project, and I went back and tried to write on the sticks again.  This time it did dry just fine, within 10 seconds you could handle without smearing.  I don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t work as well with the fat tip sharpie, but the fine tip worked great!  No need for labels now  :)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and fast shipping said it woulD be delivered by may 14 but came April 27 defiantly buy again</li>
    <li> I love this fingers stick display...it a good product!</li>
    <li> Great for practicing.  Also great to use for color display of your polishes.  The long part is a good place to write the colors.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail polish samples</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described, works with regular polish as well as gel polish (with gel I just use the polish and top coat, so far they have been okay without the base).  Shipping took a few weeks, but for how cheap in price these were it was worth the wait. I like to attach them with a round binder clip or chain over the screw attachment that comes with it. Some edges might need to be cleaned up and filed around the nail part. Beware, if you remove color from these sticks, polish remover does mess with the plastic a bit. If you want to use the sticks to write the names, keep polish off of the writing area.</li>
    <li> I missed that these are white, not clear. I&#x27;m using them for art samples instead of color swatches, since clear shows the color&#x27;s opacity in a way that white can&#x27;t. Arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> I bought these to paint my nail polish colors on so I have a visual display of what colors I have, but I didn&#x27;t realized that they were white until they showed up.  Completely a user error, but they still work well and are of pretty good quality.  My biggest complaint is that they took forever to arrive, as they shipped from China.  I would definitely prefer to get them from somewhere in the US.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the product. I received it way earlier than expected. The nail sticks are a cream color which was alright because it makes them a little more realistic. I had to file each of them one by one only because the nail being a little uneven was bothering me but they still work perfectly if you dont file them. You can use the nail &amp; screw it comes with to keep them all together but I found that they didn&#x27;t all fit so I went to buy rings for them but that is of course choice and preference.</li>
    <li> loves these it did all my colors with gel then in polishes its easier for my customers to see next is to do designs on these love it worth the money</li>
    <li> I really liked these fan shaped false nail to practice nail art and keep them as samples of what I did.  I in no way shape of form am a nail artist, but I do love nail art and when I do or see a design I really like, I love to keep a reminder of what I did for future use and these are great, they help me recreate them and I love that they are individual and not stuck together like the wheel false nails that don&#x27;t let you get around the edges freely.  Recommend these.</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed, I used them to test out marble nails before I do it on my own fingers. Swatching is great for nail art or special effects on gel polish, because you don&#x27;t spend all that time doing it on your fingers only to dislike it and gel polish can&#x27;t be taken off like regular fingernail polish. Most of the edges are jagged and need to be filed if you use them for display, I only use them for home use but if I was displaying my work such as if I was a professional these would not be acceptable, mine also didn&#x27;t come with a ring to hold it, and they were expensive- they have gone down in price since I ordered them (but I got them from a prime eligible seller with a bunch of other nail supplies and may have paid more because I ordered them through a prime eligible seller.)</li>
    <li> this is such a great price for these and so much easier to use than the round ones. you can take them off a stick at a time for easier use and label them with the polish colors, will be buying more of these</li>
    <li> These are nice nail tips, and they have a great length to them. The only thing I would change is the screw and bolt that holds all of them together. I changed it out with a large binder ring and it works great.</li>
    <li> love these so much I had to reorder them.  I didn&#x27;t order enough the first time.  Having these makes it so easy to see what colors of polishes I have.</li>
    <li> I got these fake nails for my girlfriend as a gift and she loved them. She has been using them for practice and creating different nails ideas.</li>
    <li> I needed something to paint all my polishes onto so that I didn&#x27;t have to test them out and remove the polish while hunting for the perfect shade. I have around 500 polishes and bought these white nail sticks and the clear ones for my glitter polishes. They are fairly strong and are great for display nails for all my polishes! They really help when Im trying to figure out how a glitter polish will look on a solid polish too...I just lay the nails on top of one another and voila! I have a pretty good idea of how the two will look together! The nail tips did need a bit of light filing to remove the small bits of excess plastic on them. They survived, without breaking off, through the filing and painting. I would say these are a MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> I bought these for nail swatching and they work perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t hold 50 stick.Luckily I bought 2 and didn&#x27;t use all 100 to fit</li>
    <li> perfect to keep track of all your nail polish</li>
    <li> came earlier them expected and looked just like they do in the photo. very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love these to catalog my nail polish - many colors look so different in the bottle than on actual swatches, so it&#x27;s very helpful. They&#x27;re also great for nail art. These ones are the same quality as every other version I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> very useful to make a display of your colors and designs, but some of them have the hole very narrow, so inserting them onto the screw is difficult.  plus, once you have all of them hanging from the screw, they become difficult to move.  They need a longer screw and with less threads.</li>
    <li> Excellent to do art nails. I dont like the screw that secure the fan.</li>
    <li> Love to swatch, love to play, thanks these are great.</li>
    <li> I ordered these in white, but received clear ones instead. I was quite disappointed :( as I already have clear ones from another order, &amp; was looking forward to being able to show my polish colors over a white background. Oh well....</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Shipping was long but I was aware it could be a while... Price was too good to pass up!</li>
    <li> I have about 500 bottles of polish, so these are doing a great job for my little project.  I&#x27;m painting each one with a sample of the polish, labeling it, then hanging them on binder o-rings with command hooks on the shelves where my polish is.</li>
    <li> I like these quite a bit but I prefer the clear ones.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually had time to apply the polish to these; however they came packaged decently and are as described on here. Will post some pictures once I get them swatched so everyone can see how they look done.</li>
    <li> Shipping took just about exactly as long as it states. Just under 3 weeks and there was no updated tracking available after it left. I did email them and they responded right away. Had I waited one more day, it would have arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that some people have complained about the shade of the plastic. I would call it a natural color, which is what I prefer. I don&#x27;t want white and I don&#x27;t want clear. I want to simulate as close as possible what it will look like on a natural nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and let me say that I ordered 8 of the 50 piece, and not a single one was cracked or broken or unusable. I did have to file the little nub off the tip, but that was super easy. Since I have so many, I&#x27;ll be adding them to a chain or a large ring instead of the screw that comes with it. Overall, I&#x27;m super pleased with these. MUCH better than the circle wheels I had been using.</li>
    <li> Ok, my grandkids used them</li>
    <li> I love these so much I had to come back and buy another! I didn&#x27;t realize how much nail polish I had since I&#x27;ve organized my nail polish container and this helps so much to see exactly how the color will look once on my nails rather than wasting the paint on my nail (in case I don&#x27;t like it and decide to take it off). I didn&#x27;t mind having to put each swatch on the screw and bolt it on. It&#x27;s pretty easy. Great for the price. It does stink that it takes so long to ship but it&#x27;s worth it once you get it. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product works fine I had to manually shape them due to rough edges</li>
    <li> These are great was able to swatch all my polishes and they look amazing! And they were great for soak off gel polishes too!</li>
    <li> These swatch sticks are perfect to try out a new polish and help keep track of what is in your &amp;#34;stash.&amp;#34; If you are anything like me you acquire new polishes and want to try them right away, but may not want to remove whatever polish you just applied. These sticks allow you to test the color and the opacity quickly and easily, and then organize them however you&#x27;d like to you can see at a glance what you have. I&#x27;ve already bought several additional sets so I always have a stash on hand!</li>
    <li> I really like these to swatch my polish inventory.  The polish swatches on the white ones match what they would look like on my nails a little more accurately than the clear ones.  I don&#x27;t use the nail.  I got the binder rings so I could arrange and add sticks easily.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like on a picture, very helpful for me, as i work with clients and need some demonstration of colors i have</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased SEVERAL of these to categorize my polish collection. They&#x27;re affordable and arrive quickly. This is the best idea I&#x27;ve been for having your nail polishes be on display.</li>
    <li> You may think that this item is not going to work well when you get it because you have to put it together yourself, but it does. This item came early and is not as white in the pictures as looks in the pictures, but that does not matter. Even though you have to put the fake nails on the screw, if you just spin the nail or push it will go down.</li>
    <li> Very handy to swatch all my nail colors on. Perfect for writing names on the stems and ability to reorganize by brand/color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this so I don&#x27;t have to pull out all my nail polish bottles when I do my nails. You have to put it together yourself but whatever you put a screw through the sticks and you&#x27;re done! (It does come with the hardware)</li>
    <li> Soooooo convenient....</li>
    <li> Very well made. Will not break easily. Great to display my polsh colors at the salon and not have the bottles sitting out taking up space.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I only wish it held more.  I put all my colors and all of their brands and names on the bar and it has been very nice to not have to go through everything every time I decide to do my nails.  The only thing I&#x27;d like that I think could make this better is a rubber stopper so that the bolt can&#x27;t come too loose.  This purpose can easily be served with a small rubber band.</li>
    <li> What I needed to display colors easy</li>
    <li> I  really like these practice nails. The fact that they are individual nails makes it easy to do nail art on them. I also use them to sample my nail polish. I use a metal curtain hooks or binder rings for display so I can hang them.</li>
    <li> I bought these to organize my nail polish collection. They work great to paint a sample and leave plenty of room to write the names of my colors. I choose to keep them on large binder clips instead of the large screws that came with.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to test if I like the opaque rather than the clear nail art tips. I have no complaint about these tips they were all uniformed in size and the quality was great but I just prefer the clear nail art tips.</li>
    <li> These are cheap, but they don&#x27;t act like it.  There is just the right amount of space to write what the polish is on the stick and there is a good amount of display for the polish.  This is a great way to show off all your colors.</li>
    <li> Love them for swatching my gel polishes.</li>
    <li> The name and description both say that these are white, what I received are an off white, yellow-y, cream color. However, they work well for my own personal use. I don&#x27;t particularly like the screw they sent to keep the sticks together, but it works for now. Overall, good product if you aren&#x27;t looking for anything spectacular.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I will most likely order another set at some point. The nail polish goes on them nicely.</li>
    <li> I have used these a lot so far. They are nice but after a few uses of removing the polish they get very thin.</li>
    <li> Item was much better than I expected it. The screw was just a little too short to fit all pieces on it but I still made it work. Will be ordering more soon.</li>
