<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My body tans very well, normally my face however does not. This lotion has helped tan my face tremendously. After only a few uses I noticed a big difference. It doesn&#x27;t have much scent so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. It also keeps it moisturized, which without this face lotion my face tended to be rather dry post tanning. A little goes a long way! After tanning 10 or so times with this I can&#x27;t even notice a dent in the bottle, still seems brand new and full. Awesome product, good price. Would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for some help tanning their face.</li>
    <li> Almost too fast. This stuff is worth the buy if you tan for sure, lasts a long time, instant resultssssss</li>
    <li> I like that this product doesn&#x27;t smell or clog my pores when I use it.      It does not have bronzer it in, either, which I prefer for my face. I want my face to have a more natural look to it &amp; I think bronzer can look kinda fake on your face if you&#x27;re using the wrong product or tan too much.  This creates a very natural tan &amp; I haven&#x27;t burned since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> This product in great. I use it every day on my face and chest area. I am very sensitive to lotions around my face area and this has not caused any reactions.. No hives, breakouts or &amp;#34;unsightly&amp;#34; blemishes. I now use it as my daily face lotion and would recommend this product. Also, I used it in a tanning bed and felt that it gave enough &amp;#34;uv block&amp;#34; that it stopped any &amp;#34;red face&amp;#34; to occur and still was able to have some color. well worth the price for a 4oz bottle.</li>
    <li> Just a lotion. Nothing to great it&#x27;s thin and when I used it I had to double apply or use my body lotion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luminary Face is way better</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin on my face and acne. I&#x27;m 26 years old and I feel ridiculous still fighting acne like a teen! This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve used that makes my skin look great! It moisturizes and firms the skin on my face. My complexion has never looked better! Plus it&#x27;s a tanning accelerant! My face never tans, but with this lotion it finally has some color. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great face lotion.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I used this in a tanning bed. I have always had a hard time tanning my face because I don&#x27;t do it often, but using this product my face almost caught up to the rest of my body in a matter of a week and did not feel dry after tanning at all. I also use this just as a normal moisturizer when I know I will be outside quite a bit with a little sunscreen mixed in and that has worked great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to darken their face. It did not make me break out at all (wore it all the time on a cruise in the Caribbean) and I am a 26 yo female prone to break outs!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin but this stuff is great, It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! I have only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t really say that it works as far as helping my face get tan, but it does make my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> this product is absolutely awesome..i have horrrible horrible allergies and irritation issues with all sorts of lotions if they touch my face at all but i absolutely loved this. it was really light but still browned me easily! i would deffinately reccommend it to anyone who doesnt want to break out from bronzers like Luminary, ect.</li>
    <li> Received product with 2additional surprise samples of other lotions and earlier than expected! I can&#x27;t wait to try them, they would have cost a lot at the salon. The lotion really is scent free, and for sensitive skin. I have used it several times now, in order to give a good review. My face was noticeably darker after just one use, but not greasy of irritated at all. I would recommend this and have already to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about four or five times now and my face is 10x darker and I haven&#x27;t broken out! My skin is always smooth now and has an even tan!</li>
    <li> It is what it is. Nothing to write home about. It helps keep your face moisturized and it&#x27;s for your face so it didn&#x27;t cause break outs like it does when I use regular tanning lotion on my face. I do feel that it actually hindered my face from tanning as good as it usually does. But it was the real deal, no imitation. Bought from Green Web Inc.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I&#x27;m qualified to rate this as a \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; lotion; I never really paid attention to the quality of my tan, since I was spending time in the bed for health reasons (psoriasis). When you tan for only 5-8 minutes at a time in a medium bed, I wouldn&#x27;t call bronzing your goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can tell you, as someone with sensitive skin AND psoriasis, is that this never ONCE:&lt;br /&gt;* irritated&lt;br /&gt;* itched&lt;br /&gt;* burned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it doesn&#x27;t have:&lt;br /&gt;* mineral oil (duh, it&#x27;s for tanning)&lt;br /&gt;* fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know how impossible it is to find a regular facial moisturizer, even for sensitive skin, without mineral oil? Nearly IMPOSSIBLE. I used this for both tanning AND my regular every day moisturizer with fantastic results. I highly recommend it, especially if you have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make your skin react. As with anything, if you have sensitive skin, you should test some first before doing your whole face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 months. I originally used it while tanning in a salon bed, but then I started tanning outside at the pool and used it. I do like this product a lot. My face gets a nice natural color using it indoors or outdoors. I can&#x27;t put regular tanning lotion on my face because my face breaks out very easily. With this product I don&#x27;t break out. My skin has improved since using this. It feels softer and my skin&#x27;s tone and texture have improved. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles yet, but I hope this product helps prevent them. I don&#x27;t tan year round, only during summer. This stuff is great. It has absolutely no smell and feels fresh and cool. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic too, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works good, but causes blemishes.</li>
    <li> This lotion was nothing special. I used it a few times and then stopped. It reminded me of something like cheap old body lotion. The smell was not good.</li>
    <li> Easy and pleasant Amazon transaction in every way. Great value!  Thanks again.  A+&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic is the key to this product.  Good results.  Recommend for the beginner and or advance tanner whom want&#x27;s to save face.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tanned with a specialized face tanner, then you&#x27;re in for a treat!  I would also highly recommend those interested in this product to look up Designer Skin Amazing Face.  It has bronzers in it which will not only accelerate your tan like this product, but it will also add color faster too.  The quick addition of color to the face is more critical than other parts, because we are always exfoliating.  This sloughs off our dead skin cells faster and therefore causes our body to renew the cells faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products recommended for those interested in this:  Designer Skin Amazing Face</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good lotion for your face. Keeps a tan longer but doesn&#x27;t really do a lot to GIVE a tan. I love the smell. I would recommend it, because it leaves your face feeling really soft.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really do much that I noticed but I don&#x27;t use a lot of lotion on my face it was good for the summer</li>
    <li> Literally my only issue with this is that it seriously had NO scent. Most people will probably like that about it since it&#x27;s a face lotion, but I just like stuff that smells good. It worked really well though as far as an even tone and color. It&#x27;s so light weight you could probably use it as a regular face lotion if you wanted.</li>
    <li> It does what it says! My face tanned much more quickly once I started using Saving Face. I have experienced zero irritation and I have VERY sensitive and allergic-to-everything skin. It has practically no scent and goes on silky smooth. So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> so far I have been using the lotion for about a week, twice I used it in a tanning bed and can already see my face getting noticably darker... i have very sensative skin and break out easily but so far this product has not caused any breakouts. barely has a scent i would compare it to yogurt or something. also love that a little goes a long way.. this lotion will last a while. the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because it is kind of hard to get out of the bottle. I wish it had a squeezy hole or something as it is kind of a pain getting the lotion out without putting a huge glob on my palm!</li>
    <li> I have never used tanning lotion on my face until now.  Wow- what a difference.  It&#x27;s not so much that it&#x27;s giving it a nice color as my face just looks healthier and clearer.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion for the face.  I have been using it for a couple a years.  Its gentle on the skin and I have sensitive skin.  It protects your face.</li>
    <li> I used to manage a tanning salon and this product always worked well.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cause acne.  A nice facial tanning lotion since it was designed for your face.</li>
    <li> My intention in buying this product was to darken the parts of my face that for some reason refuse to tan naturally, but over the course of a week there was no discernable difference in the shade or texture of my skin. Even as a moisturizer it was too thick and oily to use on acne-prone skin. For tanning the hard-to-tan places I recommend turning instead to Fake Bake, which when used correctly delivers a realistic artificial tan.</li>
    <li> Saving face actually makes my face pretty dark! It might even be a little darker than my body. Just what I was looking for but it gets four stars because it broke me out a little bit.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything special.  It looks and feels like a regular, cheap lotion.  There is not a brown pigment to the lotion, so I don&#x27;t trust that it is actually bronzing me while I tan.</li>
    <li> I was using luminary for face and I reached a plateau. I read the reviews for this product and I have to say after going to the tanning bed daily for two weeks using this product, I am still no darker. I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial tanner.  I usually struggle to tan my face, but noticed that I had color my first tanning session,  I have very sensitive skin, and I am also acne prone, but this lotion did not burn my skin or cause any breakouts! I will definitely continue to use this product and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this, it is one of my favorites. It does not have a scent and feels clean on your face not all oily. This is a really small bother, but a little goes a long way. Lasts me and my hubby months.</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure I got a fake. I&#x27;m not saying someone else will get the same if they order this but i&#x27;m thinking I did. I have used other face lotions before and they did just fine. I tried this 3 times in a 20 minute bed and everytime it burns my face. I make sure the yellow facial button is off and that I have it rubbed in well. I am not new to indoor tanning, I usually go a couple times a week. I might as well of rubbed vegetable oil on my face.</li>
    <li> This product has no perfumes or dyes and is free of things that can irritate one&#x27;s face. I&#x27;ve noticed after laying out in the sun that is product makes my skin glow. I usually layer this on with spf 50 sunscreen so I don&#x27;t get burned. I occasionally have acne and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin one bit. I&#x27;ve actually noticed that this has helped my skin become clearer. And I definitely see better results in the sun instead of going to a tanning salon. Also, a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Product advertised for sensitive skin, but this broke my face out after the first use. Only used once and will never use again.</li>
    <li> Goes on, absorbs, and dries to a silky finish, doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I can&#x27;t say how much it is helping my face tan, but I do think it does the conditioning job it claims to do, and there is no post tanning bed smell on my face after using it.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion, i have very sensitive skin and this gives me nice even color and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout or orange! A little goes a long way, 7 months later and I&#x27;m not even close to running out. Great lotion for the fair or sensitive skinned people of the world!</li>
    <li> Feels oily. I used it anyway and it broke me out really bad. Wasn&#x27;t right for my skin type I guess.</li>
    <li> this made my face break out and it clogged my pores. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and i thought this was good for delicate skin, but guess mine is too delicate. it really clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. Not oily for me and lasts all day. A little goes a long way. Does not make my face break out.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial tanning lotion. No grease, no outbreaks and makes face colors nice equal bronze.&lt;br /&gt;Reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it was send to me way over expiration date! Ordered in September and got one that was expired in May 2013.... Good thing Amazon is such a good trooper and I could send this lotion back. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> This does not break out my face and helps tan my face without the awkward orange color you can get with some bronzers. This is not a bronzer so you dont tan fast with this but it does help.</li>
    <li> I used to use this years ago when I used to tan. Feels great. My skin used to be oily and it never broke me out. My skin is now dry and this still does not break me out and my skin is very moisturized. This was the first thing I made sure to have on hand when I started to tan again----------actually the second-----tanning goggle to protect my eyes were the first.</li>
    <li> Love it...my face is sensitive and I didn&#x27;t break out from it...I got great color on my face</li>
    <li> I have dry facial skin that absorbs regular lotion quickly. This lotion is so hydrating that my face feels moisturized all day. I touch my face and its smooth. It is not greasy at all. It&#x27;s decadent!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great and it seemed like it was working.  Unfortunately I have really picky skin and it broke me out.  Really a shame because I love designer skin products and I know it would have worked.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would help me tan my face more (I go to a tanning salon) and it did NOTHING but make me redder than I already was getting in my cheeck area. I read the reviews on here FIRST and thought this would be good for me, but NOPE. I am now looking like I dipped my face in red paint. Thanks for wasting my money my Clinique moisturizer is a million x better than this stuff, oh well!!! WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Would purchase from this vendor again!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to use in a tanning salon, and I wasn&#x27;t too interested in all of the health benefits of it. I expected it to help me tan- and I think I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that my face is getting any tanner from using this product. -1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER.&lt;br /&gt;A very little bit of this lotion goes a long way! I see this bottle lasting months.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face feel AMAZING, and I use it daily as a moisturizer! (And when I tan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this because of the great reviews.  However, I got a bottle that expired almost a year ago - going to return.</li>
    <li> This lotion has best sort of a life changer. I put this on my face then add a thin layer of Girly Girl by Supre over it. I usually have quite a bit of acne, but this product clears my face completely. The only bad thing I can say is that a few hours after leaving the tanning bed, my face looks burnt. And I also payed $9 for this product elsewhere. I would buy it for $17 bc it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised with this lotion. Used it before indoor tanning a couple of times. Very moisturizing, without being very greasy. Didn&#x27;t break my skin out. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I don&#x27;t mind a fragrance, but not for the face. Spreads well, absorbs quickly and I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out. A real winner, in my books!</li>
    <li> Saving face has really saved my face. Sometimes when I go tanning in the booth I tan my face for a few min. This has really help keep my face from getting dry</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Not only does it not make me break out, but it also has helped me make my face considerably darker and it is so light feeling. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wash my face after tanning. It&#x27;s got almost no scent at all and what little scent there is, it&#x27;s gone by the time you get out of the bed. I also think this product has helped me from having my freckles tan with my face, before using this product I noticed my freckles were starting to get very dark and very unattractive. After using this product my freckles are MUCH less noticeable. I don&#x27;t think I will ever tan with out this product again. 5 stars!!!! Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is the best. My skin feels so moisturized even though I tan often. I recommend this to everyone at the salon. I love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered once before, had such good ratings I wanted to try it out.It worked pretty well for me as a tanner. I use it now just as a moisturizer in the morning. My skin usually breaks out when I begin using a new product, NOT WITH THIS ONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.</li>
    <li> I use a tanning bed with a special \\&quot;no-burn\\&quot; face lamp which emits less burning rays and is supposed to be lighter on your face and neck. Before buying this product, I just used regular indoor tanning lotion on my face and neck (underneath would be my face moisturizer with sunscreen in it, so I don&#x27;t know what good I was even doing)... I had no problems... I used this product one time and I burnt my neck and face pretty bad... I haven&#x27;t had the courage to use it again and I probably won&#x27;t. :(</li>
    <li> Look, baking in the sun/ tanning bed is bad for you. But if you&#x27;re going to do it... (and I will...) at least give it some moisture and anti-oxidants. I can be in the sun for several hours and my face still feels soft and healthy. I&#x27;ve used this in tanning beds as well. I ended up using it on my whole body when I ran out of body tanning lotion, and it felt great!</li>
    <li> As a person who suffers from acne and has extremly sensitive skin I was very skeptical. Basically, anything I put on my skin, save for a few products, cause me to breakout. I purchased this product because it was hyopallergenic and figured it was worth a shot. This is an excellent product that I would reccomend to anyone who need to increase the color on their face (which can be hard to tan!), but also has sensitive skin. I was able to get darker color on my face without colgging my pores like some of the body lotions do. The fact that the product contains no bronzers was a plus for me. You will really enjoy this lotion!</li>
    <li> Best facial tanner out there.  I have sensitive acne prone skin, but when I use this item I do not suffer from any breakouts!  It smells great, it isn&#x27;t greasy, this is literally the ONLY facial tanner I would ever considering using on my sensitive, acne prone face.</li>
    <li> This product is ok as it keep my face moist and smells great but it also left my face a little irritated.</li>
    <li> Provides great facial tan.</li>
    <li> Doesnt make my skin greasy or irritated! Would definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. I love it :)</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion!  My skin is very sensitive, and also acne prone.  This lotion has done a great job!  Love the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily or feel like it has a weird film like some other lotions have in the past!</li>
    <li> recommend this so your face doesn&#x27;t break out and also fast shipping</li>
    <li> doesnt make me break out.</li>
    <li> I am pretty fair skinned and I don&#x27;t tan very easy. The 4 or 8 minutes in a bed just weren&#x27;t doing it for me. So I tried going 12 minutes and my face would burn. Nothing else just my sensitive, freckled face. I felt like my face was holding me back from the nice, dark tan I wanted. So I decided to start using lotion on my face. Since I have a pretty dry face (Thanks to Proactive*) I figured a little moisture would help. I started by putting my regular body tanning lotion on, but it broke me out and left me feeling a little greasy. So I looked for facial tanning lotion for sensitive skin and this is what I got. I am SO glad I did. I go for 16 minutes in a bed now and my face doesn&#x27;t stay red anymore, JUST TAN. Not only did it help me not burn it&#x27;s an over-all great facial lotion. It left my face silky smooth without irritation or a break-out. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell like many lotions. In fact it doesn&#x27;t really have a scent at all. So no matter what kind of scents you like (or don&#x27;t like) you never have to worry about NOT liking the smell. Thanks Designer Skin! Great product :)</li>
    <li> Usually I do not use a lotion other than SPF, but I am glad I changed my mind. The top has changed and lotion is very easy to get out of bottle compared to prior top reviewed in past.</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t know how well the stuff works or not because I only got to use it two or three times before it got stolen to when I left it in the salon. It didn&#x27;t make me burn, so I look at that as a plus.  A face tanner shouldn&#x27;t be as heavy or powerful as the the tanning lotion you use on the rest of your body.  That&#x27;s just my opinion, so I like this product. Designer Skin hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, and I have used other products by them with great success.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shied away from facial lotions for years because it always seemed that no matter what--they would break me out. This one can be used for indoor or outdoor tanning and contains NO sunscreen. The formula is light and non-oily and 100% fragrance-free. I swear, I noticed a difference in my face after one use. One reviewer mentioned that she uses this as her daily lotion and I&#x27;m planning on trying the same thing :) I highly, highly recommend this product and I definitely plan on buying more products from Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> I have used other DS lotions in my occasional indoor winter tanning.  They seemed to stay on and work all day while still being light and not greasy.  This lotion falls far short of those. This smells, feels, and performs like an ultra cheap pharmacy brand lotion.  Maybe I got a knock off / refilled product from a corrupt seller.  Either way, I won&#x27;t be buying this again nor do I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> i like it for my face and i i would tell someone to try it and i want more of this item</li>
    <li> Tanned my (usually white) face very nicely. Now it matches the rest of my body! Love this stuff! Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This has really saved my face. I have sensitive skin and I only go to tanning beds when we are going to the beach. This product did great on my face with no breakouts.</li>
    <li> In the first day of use I got a really nice, dark tan. My skin feels soft and it glows. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Designer skin has another facial tanner called &amp;#34;Amazing Face&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a red bottle. The &amp;#34;Saving Face&amp;#34; does not have the awesome bronzing color that the &#x27;Amazing Face&#x27; provides. I&#x27;d choose &amp;#34;Amazing Face&amp;#34; over this one any day. Works ok, no bronzing effect.</li>
    <li> i use it all the time..it is as good as other facial tanning lotion i have used...i would recommend it for everyone...does not have a heavy feeling</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the ingredients and that is will help wrinkles, which are minimal on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am barely fair skinned and haven&#x27;t had acne since high school (25 yrs ago).  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this product made me break out with tiny pimples.  That was unfortunate because it absorbed into my skin quickly and smelled nice.  I didn&#x27;t use it in a tanning bed because I wanted to see how it would react to my skin prior.  I predict that along with my pimples, my face would also be burnt.  Hopefully the person I gave it to will have better luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate throwing money away on a product that doesn&#x27;t deliver what it promises.  Read the other reviews and take them to heart.  Also, this product does NOT contain any sunblock.  NONE.  Use with caution.</li>
    <li> love the way it makes my face sooooooo awsome</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference in the tan on my face compared to my body.</li>
    <li> Lightweight indoor and outdoor lotion for sensitive skin. The bottle will probably last me 3 to 4 summers. Love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion texture is great. I feel like my skin is so smooth after I use it.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent so it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation on my acne prone face.  I can&#x27;t tell if the lotion help anything in the process of brozing my skin though. My face could just be tanning due to the gradual progression of being in a tanning booth. Great value because a bottle will last you forever.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It does take a few weeks (about three) to notice a difference. It does not leave you face oily. You only need a small amount so the product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> . . . even in-doors. This stuff is liquid gold. It doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange, cause breakouts or annoy me with a sickly sweet smell. It does have a smell to it, but it is extremely subtle, more like plain yogurt, and fades quickly. I am extremely fair-skinned; I am not allowed in a tanning booth. Btw, there is always the all over sunless spray tanning option-people please, don&#x27;t do that to your skin, especially if it&#x27;s sensitive. It&#x27;s fun, looks great, (as long as you exfoliate first), and won&#x27;t give you cancer. It lasts longer, too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m climbing off the soap-box now to remind everyone how amazing this lotion is. I gently exfoliate my face first with a small loofah, then apply liberally, being extremely cautious to avoid my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If you are pasty white, it is not going to make you bronze or dark. That&#x27;s called magic. ;p However, it has given me (at long last) a healthy, radiant glow which I noticed during week one. It doesn&#x27;t look fake; it makes me not look sickly. Sometimes these products give me weird rashes (I can only use Cetaphil), but never this one. I am over-the-moon about this product. I have been using it as a base and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it never gets that cakey, orange crud on the top of the cap. It&#x27;s clean and lovely and will make your life better by making you feel more confident. It&#x27;s also  made my skin softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to check the expiry date.</li>
    <li> I am extremely sensitive skin, very dry and acne prone and easily get rashes. This did not irritate me at all! Does give you that extra color in a tanning bed. Not sure if it actually helps prevent wrinkles, if you&#x27;re getting UV rays, you&#x27;re going to get wrinkles no matter what.</li>
    <li> I really like this face lotion!  I use it both for my face and for my upper chest and I seem to tan more evenly that way.  I usually wash my face with an aloe wipie first and then apply the lotion.  I don&#x27;t break out, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy, and it soaks in fast.  I really like how it has no scent too.  My sister and her best friend are hopping on the tanning train and bought a bottle each after I told them how wonderful this face lotion is!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find a product that I could put on my face to help keep my skin healthy while tanning. It is hypoallergenic so it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out or feel heavy on my skin. With this product, you definitely get the most bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts. It has helped with tanning my face - my face doesn&#x27;t like to tan as easily as the rest of my body. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it.</li>
    <li> I used this once and after tanning, my face broke out so bad! Sticking to sunscreen for outdoor use...</li>
    <li> I like... makes skin soft but not a lot of color difference in my face yet...time will tell what the outcome will be..:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for right at a month in my salon&#x27;s bronzer bed. I was very pale when I first started. I bought this after about 2 weeks of tanning because my face wasn&#x27;t getting as dark as my body. It works good, my face hasn&#x27;t burned at all since using this and I did have to buy a darker makeup so that&#x27;s proof that it is working. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it.</li>
    <li> My skin felt tight and dry no matter how much I used. My skin did tan but I don&#x27;t feel like it moisturized my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive facial skin and have always had to have very strict skincare routines or my face will get painfully dry OR oily and acne-prone! I used to use to aveeno facial lotion for every-day use, which was ok but nothing special. I love tanning, not just for the tan (although that doesn&#x27;t hurt!) but also for SAD as well as excema issues and the girls at the tanning salon suggested this lotion... it&#x27;s amazing!!!! I use it all the time and not just when tanning and have ditched the aveeno. It never gets oily and works great alone or under makeup. My skin is clearer than ever. Makes my pores tiny and not to mention smells great. I&#x27;m sold for life!! :)</li>
    <li> Works great for the tanning bed. Good texture. No unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Expired. Decided to still try it but it changed nothing.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good product. I do see more color. It has not made me breakout or given me irritation on my face. I also put it on my neck because I have trouble tanning under my chin/neck. I do see more color.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion for my face since it doesnt have a scent to it. It goes on great and makes your skin feel soft</li>
    <li> This product works great and left my skin feeling smooth and bronzed. Before I just used regular moisturizer on my face before I tanned and Im really glad I have this now.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion a few days ago and WOW! I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times just as regular moisturizer, and it works great. I cannot wait to use this in the tanning bed! Makes my skin super soft, and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Really a great product :)</li>
    <li> Saving Face is a really good facial tanning accelerator. It doesn&#x27;t have any bronzers in it, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel oily like a lot of the facial moisturizers on the market. I just had my second child a month and a half ago, so I just got back to tanning. I don&#x27;t remember my face ever burning before with Saving Face, but this time (and it&#x27;s the exact same bottle I used right before I found out I was pregnant) my face burned. However- I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s from the Saving Face accelerator. I am also using a bleaching treatment at night on my face (part of my skin care regimen) that say&#x27;s on the bottle that it can make your face sensitive to sun and it could burn easily. So for the girls who have said they think that the Saving Face made them burn- maybe you should check your skin care products to see if any of them contain ingredients that make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Anyway, I would definitely buy this again because it does more than just tan my face- it actually moisturizes it and feels clean going on.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive facial skin. I get bright red patches on both sides of my nose and on my forehead that get very flaky, and if a product is going to cause breakouts, it&#x27;s going to be on my chin/upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has not caused any redness/flakiness, although I have broken out. However, I have also occasionally rubbed the leftovers of whatever tanning lotion I was using onto my face, so I cannot say for certain it was THIS that caused it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It HAS, however, gotten my face a lot closer in color to the rest of my body, so in its primary function (tanning your face) it works! I would definitely repurchase, since if it IS breaking me out, I can put some face wipes in my tanning bag and use them after exiting the bed.</li>
    <li> My face gets very dark after two uses! No harsh smell, very gentle, and really works! Plus anti aging benefits!</li>
    <li> I chose this lotion because I wanted something that would not cause my face to break out. It has worked so far. It feels very clean and leaves my skin feeling hydrated after tanning. Aside from how good it feels; I like that there is no color or smell to the lotion. Overall a great face lotion for tanning. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> NOWHERE IN THE INFO DID IT MENTION IT WAS FOR TANNING BED ONLY,, I NEVER TAN MY FACE SO THINKING IT WAS A SELF TINT BRONZER FOR FACE, I THOUGHT I COULD NATURALLY DARKEN MY FACE WITHOUT THE AGING UV LAMPS AND SUN. AS AN ESTHETICIAN I HAVE NO USE TO TAN MY FACE EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> New to Tanning and have sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and doesn&#x27;t small at all! I can already tell my skin is getting darker. Great price, and shipping speed!</li>
    <li> Great smelling and smooth over the skin. It lasts longer and seems to really do the job on my tan. I have used this many years ago. Good to see that they still have this facial lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my absolute favorite facial lotion. I HATE using anything on my face because I have sensitive-and oily skin. But it&#x27;s very harmful to tan with a naked face and with makeup caked on. I purchased this reading reviews and was still skeptical....but it is awesome! I use it for both tanning and just an everyday lotion before i put on my makeup. If you&#x27;re like me and have oily skin that can get dry in colder weather, get this. It will moisturize those dry spots and not make your face oily throughout the day. Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
    <li> If I even think about face lotion, I tend to break out. I was shocked and pleased after I risked an attempt at using this product. No break out! Some products say they&#x27;re hypo-allergenic but they lie. This is no lie. No Smell, no grease, no mess. A very good product.</li>
    <li> keeps even my fair skin hydrated and extreme color for a irish girl w freckles. no odor, recommend to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, this is the first facial accelerator/tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found with no scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pours. It allows my face to tan but also keeps it moist so I don’t leave feeling all dry or &amp;#34;leathery&amp;#34;. I would recommend to anyone not looking for a bronzer or has sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
</ol>
