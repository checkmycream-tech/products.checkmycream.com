      <li>What I did like is the fact that this produces a very nice lather and a good shave in a container that is sized for travel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried (e.g. TOBS), but is pleasant.</li>
      <li>It lathers well and smells good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good size for travel as well.</li>
      <li>Have a good day.</li>

      <li>But in the end you do get a good shave and lather</li>

      <li>Nice fragrance, quickly creates a great lather that results in an excellent shave.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this for my husband, for when he&#x27;s traveling, and he is very pleased with this soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good soap...smells nice and does its job.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Nice scent and foaming.</li>
      <li>My wife got me a Merkur Vision 2000 razor, a nice Kent badger brush and Edwin Jagger products for Christmas and let me tell you I will never use anything else ever again.</li>
      <li>Although this is a good shaving soap I think you can get something better for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>However, if you are looking for a nice mild shaving soap, this is a great option.</li>
      <li>Using my new razor and this soap gives me the best shave I have ever had.</li>
      <li>The soap lathers easily and gives a good setup for a shave.  </li>
      <li>As commenter SF notes on another review, this soap has a hint of sweet-smelling sandalwood and isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
      <li>Makes for a pretty good lather (not as good as some others I&#x27;ve had), but it does the job, and has a great clean sandalwood scent.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a good sandalwood shave soap with a travel case and this one looked pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have never used a shave soap I like better.</li>
      <li>Love the scent too.</li>
      <li>the scent is phenomenal, however the lather is lackluster.</li>
      <li>So much better than canned shave gels and creams.</li>
      <li>Pretty good lather.</li>
      <li>Probably, but there are so many fine, competitive products that I still want to try.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve converted over from the cheap plastic razors I have been looking for a shaving soap or cream I&#x27;d love...</li>
      <li>Very mild scent, protective, but</li>
      <li>comes easy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong smelling as the art of shaving sandlewood shave cream, but still has the scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine, well balanced soap...</li>
      <li>Smells great, a dime sized blob will whip into plenty of lather for several passes.</li>
      <li>This soap is surprisingly comfortable.</li>
      <li>so I thought it should be fantastic....</li>
      <li>The lather is rich, luxurious even.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the other brands of shave soap sold by Amazon, but Edwin Jagger sandalwood is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Too many other good reasons to buy.</li>
      <li>but it has a manly fresh smell that I really enjoy.</li>
      <li>My favorite shave soap, edging out D.R. Harris,Geo Trumpers and Proraso, some others that I really like.  </li>
      <li>I like the clean fresh scent as it lathers richly onto my manly face.  </li>
      <li>Lathers pretty easily -</li>
      <li>This is the very first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I did try this on it&#x27;s own in a bowl, and can get a decent lather, but it&#x27;s very thirsty and takes</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this, and the small size is great for traveling.</li>
      <li>My razor glides easily with the use of this shaving soap giving me a very close shave.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s so effective, that I&#x27;m debating whether to keep it as my standard or be inquisitive to see what else is out there.  </li>
      <li>I actually mixed it with an old puck of parker&#x27;s I had around - and the combination has been great.  </li>
      <li>This soap lathers great, lubricates very well, but it lacks slightly in the smell department.</li>
      <li>First solid shave soap i&#x27;ve purchased, but overall it smells good, is easy to lather up quickly, and i still have a lot of it left after many shaves.  </li>
      <li>Also, the small travel jar is great for travel.</li>
      <li>First I thought it was pricey</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s incredibly faint.</li>
      <li>I pretty well exclusively face lather.  </li>
      <li>Bought this item as my first Edwin Jagger product.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use; it fairly quickly makes very smooth and thick lather.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to like this far more than I actually did.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other creams/soaps in this price range, it just is not as good as the alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
      <li>On a positive note, my wife LOVES the scent.  </li>
      <li>The little plastic holder is nice though.</li>
      <li>The smell is very perfume-y and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used regular soap that made shaving just as smooth and had soap with a nicer scent.</li>
      <li>Really like the scent</li>
      <li>This lathers reasonably well and cushions quite well.</li>
      <li>travel tub is very convenient and does not leak.  </li>
      <li>I use some pacific shaving co. creme and its far superior to this, The small tub</li>
      <li>It is somewhat small when the soap cake is at full size, but it is easily cleaned and stored.</li>
      <li>the smaller size in to consideration and this is priced about the same as Trumper&#x27;s which I feel is just better</li>
      <li>I would have given it a five star rating, but the scent is not as strong as I expected.</li>
      <li>would be Taylor of Old Bond St, price is similar but EJ is half the size....and still not quite as good in slickness, cushion, or scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is very mild and a bit soapier than other Sandalwoods</li>
      <li>The travel tub makes its easy for me to bring my soap along with my other shaving supplies.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall not bad just not great either but priced like it should be better.</li>
      <li>My only real complaint is that it tends to dry out on my face more quickly than I&#x27;d like, but as I&#x27;ve begun shaving a bit faster and with more water between applications, it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another reviewer obviously did not like very much about this product.  </li>
      <li>Bowl has held up well in my travel kit so far.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not expecting this, you might even characterize it as &amp;#34;perfume-like&amp;#34;, though it&#x27;s definitely masculine.</li>
      <li>A little pricy for the size, but considering how little you need to produce rich lather, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>I get the easy thick lather of the parkers along with the added scent and slickness of the EJ.  </li>
      <li>I can barely smell If anything</li>
      <li>This stuff can create a nice slick lather, but it takes a lot... a lot of time, and some days it just plain won&#x27;t lather well.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t exactly make for applying the soap to the brush from the container without making a mess</li>
      <li>I, on the other hand, found the faint sandalwood fragrance to be rather pleasant --</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pretty good lather. Not vwry slick though. I mix with arko (arko on face and EJ in bowl) to add the slickness i want.</li>
    <li> Great product with timely service.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good sandalwood shave soap with a travel case and this one looked pretty good. However, when it arrived and I smelled the soap I didn&#x27;t smell any sandalwood at all. The smell is very perfume-y and not what I was looking for at all. The little plastic holder is nice though. I&#x27;ll probably buy a different soap and put it in the holder.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer obviously did not like very much about this product.  I, on the other hand, found the faint sandalwood fragrance to be rather pleasant -- but then I&#x27;m not big on scents.  What I did like is the fact that this produces a very nice lather and a good shave in a container that is sized for travel.  I dinged it one star because I thought it was a bit expensive for the size of the product.  Will I buy it again?  Probably, but there are so many fine, competitive products that I still want to try.</li>
    <li> My favorite shave soap, edging out D.R. Harris,Geo Trumpers and Proraso, some others that I really like.  Nice fragrance, quickly creates a great lather that results in an excellent shave.  Shipping  &amp; product condition were perfect.</li>
    <li> Smells great, makes a great foaming soap for a wonderful shave. So much better than canned shave gels and creams.</li>
    <li> Lathers good, smells good.  A little too &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Bought this item as my first Edwin Jagger product. It forms a thick lather, but definitely requires a shave mug or bowl. I would have given it a five star rating, but the scent is not as strong as I expected. However, if you are looking for a nice mild shaving soap, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving soap. Comes in a portable box. Quite convenient for travellers. Since it is not liquid it avoids you the fuss of airport security.</li>
    <li> This is the very first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  I think it&#x27;s so effective, that I&#x27;m debating whether to keep it as my standard or be inquisitive to see what else is out there.  It&#x27;s so easy to use; it fairly quickly makes very smooth and thick lather.  I&#x27;m quite impressed.</li>
    <li> Lathers pretty easily - travel tub is very convenient and does not leak.  Very mild scent, protective, but cheaper soaps seem to do just as well for me.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers great, lubricates very well, but it lacks slightly in the smell department. It smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s incredibly faint.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find anything that Edwin Jagger makes that is not pure quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lathers up great....smells incredible...I can only imagine what they shaving cream is like.</li>
    <li> Very Nice. Could be a little less pricey.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this far more than I actually did.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other creams/soaps in this price range, it just is not as good as the alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;Take the smaller size in to consideration and this is priced about the same as Trumper&#x27;s which I feel is just better all around.&lt;br /&gt;Next would be Taylor of Old Bond St, price is similar but EJ is half the size....and still not quite as good in slickness, cushion, or scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not bad just not great either but priced like it should be better.</li>
    <li> the scent is phenomenal, however the lather is lackluster. I use some pacific shaving co. creme and its far superior to this, The small tub it comes in doesn&#x27;t exactly make for applying the soap to the brush from the container without making a mess so I transfer it to my bowl, cover my brush tips and then place the bar back in the tub for storage. any other way just leaves the tub messy.</li>
    <li> I have never used a shave soap I like better.</li>
    <li> I use this shaving soap whenever I shave my face.  I like the clean fresh scent as it lathers richly onto my manly face.  My razor glides easily with the use of this shaving soap giving me a very close shave.  During my travels, I like to use the same routine as I do at home.  The travel tub makes its easy for me to bring my soap along with my other shaving supplies.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say I have only used Arko shaving stick during my DE safety razor adventures the past year. Since I&#x27;ve converted over from the cheap plastic razors I have been looking for a shaving soap or cream I&#x27;d love... I didn&#x27;t want to try one till my Arko shaving stick ran out which it did so I bought this! First I thought it was pricey but hey Edwin Jagger is a big name so I thought it should be fantastic.... I was WRONG. Although this is a good shaving soap I think you can get something better for a fraction of the price. The second thing is the scent... I don&#x27;t use aftershave but the sandalwood I can barely smell If anything... I don&#x27;t know if my product was defected but I will definitely NOT buy again for this price and a product like this. I should have went with TOBS sandalwood... But in the end you do get a good shave and lather comes easy but I was after the scent. The shaving bowel is a convenience for someone who doesn&#x27;t have one...will use till I finish it so it wouldn&#x27;t waste and switch to Tobs or Col Konk. I will update this review in a month maybe its just the winter here in Colorado lol. Have a good day.</li>
    <li> Makes for a pretty good lather (not as good as some others I&#x27;ve had), but it does the job, and has a great clean sandalwood scent.  Perfect travel shave soap.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing bad to say about this soap, but there&#x27;s nothing fantastic about it either. I&#x27;ve used regular soap that made shaving just as smooth and had soap with a nicer scent. I&#x27;ve also used worse.</li>
    <li> I get a good lather and the plastic tub with screw on lid is excellent for travel. I used it on vacation and I also use it when I go to train for the National Guard. The tub holds up well to being crammed into my shower kit and stuffed in to my assault pack. Really like the scent</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good soap...smells nice and does its job. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t lather very well. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> The Edwin Jagger stuff is excellent!! The soaps, creams, and lotions are soy based and totally FREE of all the carcinogenic crap and fillers that other manufacturers use. Also, the stuff smells GREAT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, a dime sized blob will whip into plenty of lather for several passes.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat this product. Shaving for over twenty two years. I have very thick beard. Travel size and last a long time. Too many other good reasons to buy. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and foaming. Approved!</li>
    <li> First solid shave soap i&#x27;ve purchased, but overall it smells good, is easy to lather up quickly, and i still have a lot of it left after many shaves.  It&#x27;s not as strong smelling as the art of shaving sandlewood shave cream, but still has the scent.</li>
    <li> Great soap with excellent lather. A little pricy for the size, but considering how little you need to produce rich lather, it&#x27;s worth it.  Love the scent too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the other brands of shave soap sold by Amazon, but Edwin Jagger sandalwood is by far the best. The lather is rich, luxurious even. Also, the small travel jar is great for travel. It is somewhat small when the soap cake is at full size, but it is easily cleaned and stored. My next soap purchase will definitely be Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> This stuff can create a nice slick lather, but it takes a lot... a lot of time, and some days it just plain won&#x27;t lather well.  On a positive note, my wife LOVES the scent.  I actually mixed it with an old puck of parker&#x27;s I had around - and the combination has been great.  I get the easy thick lather of the parkers along with the added scent and slickness of the EJ.  I pretty well exclusively face lather.  I did try this on it&#x27;s own in a bowl, and can get a decent lather, but it&#x27;s very thirsty and takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again, but don&#x27;t plan on using it solo.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband, for when he&#x27;s traveling, and he is very pleased with this soap. Thank you for your promptness in shipping and a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Hope it grows on me. Lathers well, smells not not really my taste. Bowl has held up well in my travel kit so far.</li>
    <li> My wife got me a Merkur Vision 2000 razor, a nice Kent badger brush and Edwin Jagger products for Christmas and let me tell you I will never use anything else ever again. As a Marine I must shave every day and for the longest time I used the Mach 3, then the Fusion Power with Gillette or Edge cream. Using my new razor and this soap gives me the best shave I have ever had. The sent of this product is great, not perfume like but it has a manly fresh smell that I really enjoy. I will use this till discontinued!</li>
    <li> This soap is surprisingly comfortable. It lathers well and smells good. My only real complaint is that it tends to dry out on my face more quickly than I&#x27;d like, but as I&#x27;ve begun shaving a bit faster and with more water between applications, it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re expecting a heavy woodland smell, you&#x27;re in the wrong place. As commenter SF notes on another review, this soap has a hint of sweet-smelling sandalwood and isn&#x27;t very strong. If you&#x27;re not expecting this, you might even characterize it as &amp;#34;perfume-like&amp;#34;, though it&#x27;s definitely masculine. It&#x27;s a fine, well balanced soap... if you like heavy wood, spice, and musk look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, though it&#x27;s only a couple of ounces, it lasts a very long time. It&#x27;s a good size for travel as well.</li>
    <li> This lathers reasonably well and cushions quite well. The scent is very mild and a bit soapier than other Sandalwoods I&#x27;ve tried (e.g. TOBS), but is pleasant. The container is alright, though I bought the medium GoTubb, into which the puck fits PERFECTLY as a travel soap solution. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this, and the small size is great for traveling.</li>
    <li> One tub lasts a long time.  The soap lathers easily and gives a good setup for a shave.  Defintaly a good value.</li>
