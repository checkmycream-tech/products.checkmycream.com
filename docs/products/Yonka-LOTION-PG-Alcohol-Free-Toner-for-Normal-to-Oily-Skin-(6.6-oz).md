    <li> This is one of the few products that has helped me with my oily skin.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s &amp; have developed oilier skin over the years, which has resulted in my being more prone to getting black heads on my nose &amp; chin.  This product helps stabilize my skin to reduce the oil production before it starts, resulting in less black heads.  Thank goodness!</li>

    <li> I love this product, have been using it for years. It moisturizes very well, and one bottle lasts for awhile.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin. Toners I&#x27;ve tried to use so far were no good. They made my skin look oily and tired.   This toner is not oily and has a wonderful, mild scent.   only problem I face is that I&#x27;m not used to spraying directly on my face. It startles me when I do so, even though I know what&#x27;s coming :)  and gotto close my eyes - coz of which I cannot see where I&#x27;m spraying... :)  Now I got used to it, and it has an advantage of not wasting the toner by feeding it to cotton balls...  I would recommend this product to oily/combination skin people who doesn&#x27;t mind spending a little extra bucks.</li>
    <li> An essential step in my skincare routine.  Not only do I use it after cleansing, but it is an absolute gem when used with the clay masques.  Five star product!</li>
    <li> This toner is GREAT, it is also great for men too since after shaving it does not burn or sting at all.  It is a mist you spray 6 times on your face and them lightly pat with a cleanser pad.  It has a light very pleasant scent and I bought it from Venice Beauty thru Amazon.  AS I said, it was rated by Town and Country magazine as being the BEST TONER in their latest issue of the TOP 25 NEW BEAUTY PRODUCTS.  I would Highly recommend this to anyone, its reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for years -- one of the best tonics out there. Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> love this product.  has a nice smell and is a great PH balance for my skin.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My esthetician gave me a small sample of this toner and I was converted immediately.  I promptly bought more.  The smell is amazing, it feels wonderful.  It can be a bit awkward if you&#x27;re accustomed to using cotton balls/pads for applying your toner.  If you do that with this product, you&#x27;ll waste it.  You simply mist and press it into your face with clean hands.  It makes my skin feel refreshed, morning and night.  If you&#x27;re buying this toner, I HIGHLY recommend buying one of the Yon-ka cleansers as well (I love the Gel Nettoyant).  They loosen dirt and makeup in record time and are very gentle.  And what&#x27;s the use in a great toner if you&#x27;re not getting it into the skin...?    It might help to know that I have finicky combination/sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.      Finally a product I love!</li>
    <li> I have loved this toner for over 10 years and it&#x27;s great to know that it hasn&#x27;t changed. It&#x27;s a fine mist</li>
    <li> Awesome.  This goes on so light and refreshing it&#x27;s a bit addictive.  I am liking it for the summer months to add some &amp;#34;spray on hydration for my face&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but I just love this Yonka Lotion and have been using it for years.  Every so often I change my facial skin routine and try different moisturizers and cleansers, etc.  But I always go back to using this Yonka Lotion.  It just seems to be the perfect step between cleansing my skin and applying a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by my facialist a few years ago when I was having a reaction to being at the beach.... This was like a miracle cure and continues to be a necessary product in my beauty routine. It saves my skin on a twice-daily basis by being gentle and preventing breakouts but is especially useful after hot yoga and Texas summer when my skin is put to the test.  I ran out of it or I used to travel without it and I saw a difference in a few days.</li>
    <li> Lightweight.  Non-irritating. Provides sufficient moisture.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and seems to tighten up your skin a bit.  Still, not impressed for the price.</li>
    <li> Great bargain and an especially great lotion which I have faithfully used for more than 2 decades.</li>
    <li> thia yonka lotion pg-alcholo free toner for normal to oily skin it&#x27;s perfect, not allergy for my skin and not make my skin to dry</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I was looking for and it arrived very quickly - much sooner than anticipated. And, the Yonka products are great. These are the only moisturizers and toners that don&#x27;t make me break out and like most people with adult skin issues, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of products.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 74 year old mother who has been using Yonka products for years! She simply loves them and her skin has always looked great!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now, and it is the best toner hands down. It&#x27;s gentle, yet effective. It calms, balances, and refreshes naturally.

    <li> This stuff is fabulous!  My skin looks so good since I started using Yonka products.  I spritz it on after a shower, then serum, and moisturizer.  Their stuff is a little pricey, but well worth it for my aging skin.  The glass spray bottle will last me a long time, so I love that too.</li>
