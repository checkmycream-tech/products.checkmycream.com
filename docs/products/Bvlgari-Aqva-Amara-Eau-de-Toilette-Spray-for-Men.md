      <li>Amazing perfume!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it smell good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda spicy fragrance,Smells so good.</li>
      <li>fragance make me feel so good and</li>
      <li>im glad it still smells as good as it did when i found it in a magazine</li>
      <li>Nice smells</li>
      <li>It goes great with a suit as one of my friends wore it to a wedding and got more compliments than a bride:)</li>
      <li>my friend recommend me to buy it , to be honest</li>
      <li>Exellent as described, fast shipping , Best fragrance for men, My Husbands favorite</li>
      <li>Love it :3</li>
      <li>Really love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s slightly more akin to something you&#x27;d expect from Varvatos.</li>
      <li>A lot of people love the smell of the product whenever I wear it</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
      <li>Quite nice, but the original Aqva fragrance is still the flagship of the Bvlgari line, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This new Aqva really does id&#x27;s best to modernize the outdoorsman, woodsy, scent &amp; it excels.  </li>
      <li>More citrusy than either Aqva Marine or the original Aqva.</li>
      <li>I imagine the great Italian designers, creating better than what this is.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even when my favorite is the original Aqva scent, this new one is a nice variation into this line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>the cologne itself, the scent is fairly unique and I&#x27;ve not smelled anything like it before.</li>
      <li>The product was as advertised with original packaging.</li>
      <li>Not so sure if it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
      <li>In closing, I&#x27;d call it a great new addition to the Aqva line, without overtaking the original in terms of overall desirability and longevity.</li>
      <li>It long lasting more than 5hours.it has all the factors of a good cologne.</li>
      <li>It is not for guys in twenties, it has a slightly more serious hint, it has a kind of mystical note that women cannot stop analyzing.</li>
      <li>, I also have the regular Aqva and love them both.</li>
      <li>but I feel it wears off fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells like the real thing.</li>
      <li>The sent product was legitimate and real.</li>
      <li>would like tho thanks the seller &#x27;365 Beauty&#x27;, for such an extraordinary service.</li>
      <li>The same cologne is $90 at Sephora so not a bad deal if you wanna use it as an evening cologne for 2-3 hours.</li>
      <li>I really like this new scent added to the Aqva line from Bvlgary.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an addition to the main Aqva fragrance, which I prefer.</li>
      <li>It was Legit but an older batch hence the fragrance won&#x27;t stay.</li>
      <li>It is fresh but not sporty, vanilla tone after a few hours but not too sweet.</li>
      <li>Though I wouldn&#x27;t rate this the best of the colognes that I&#x27;ve used, given that I enjoy the scent and the scent has gotten me some compliments, I would rank this a solid purchase.</li>
      <li>A bit more of a spicy fragrance than you ordinarily find with a Bvlgari scent.</li>
      <li>In last few years I have tried many perfumes, mainly because I work on a cruise ship and I have a chance to test a lot of stuff as soon as it is out.</li>
      <li>It has a fairly rapid dry down that leaves the citrus behind, while the more exotic/woodsy notes remain.</li>
      <li>Long lasting staying power &amp; sweet &amp; spice wood scent makes this a keeper.</li>
      <li>Bvlgari does it yet again with this complex bend of spice, woodsy tones and smooth undernotes of musk.</li>
      <li>but I got a strong citrus note that dried down into an earthy smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A lot of people love the smell of the product whenever I wear it</li>
    <li> Best Cologne out today!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;The color on the bottle peels off. I imagine the great Italian designers, creating better than what this is.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like the real thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift twice, and both times my friends got tons of compliments. It is not for guys in twenties, it has a slightly more serious hint, it has a kind of mystical note that women cannot stop analyzing. It is fresh but not sporty, vanilla tone after a few hours but not too sweet. It goes great with a suit as one of my friends wore it to a wedding and got more compliments than a bride:)</li>
    <li> Really love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;This fragance make me feel so good and the color so sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it :3</li>
    <li> Bvlgari does it yet again with this complex bend of spice, woodsy tones and smooth undernotes of musk. The product was as advertised with original packaging. My only issue is that the bottle must lie flat.</li>
    <li> Great scent at a great price, I also have the regular Aqva and love them both.</li>
    <li> This new Aqva really does id&#x27;s best to modernize the outdoorsman, woodsy, scent &amp; it excels.  Long lasting staying power &amp; sweet &amp; spice wood scent makes this a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love it&#x27;s fragrance. It&#x27;s kinda spicy fragrance,Smells so good.It long lasting more than 5hours.it has all the factors of a good cologne.</li>
    <li> It was Legit but an older batch hence the fragrance won&#x27;t stay. The same cologne is $90 at Sephora so not a bad deal if you wanna use it as an evening cologne for 2-3 hours.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Came in timely and priced perfect</li>
    <li> Last along time the scent!</li>
    <li> Amazing perfume! In last few years I have tried many perfumes, mainly because I work on a cruise ship and I have a chance to test a lot of stuff as soon as it is out. While I had my favorites, this one just blew them all out of the water. Absolutely great perfume and good for any occasion! Guys, trust me on this one - as cheesy as it sounds, it is true - you won&#x27;t leave ANY lady indifferent when she catches a whiff of this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering 2 this time as I just found out that current price on the ship I&#x27;m on is almost the twice of what it is on Amazon!</li>
    <li> my friend recommend me to buy it , to be honest I don&#x27;t feel that it smell good, I mean its very normal,</li>
    <li> Nice smells but I feel it wears off fast. Not so sure if it&#x27;s the real deal but it looks like it to me.</li>
    <li> too simple aroma and low duration and projection</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy anything else</li>
    <li> Exellent as described, fast shipping , Best fragrance for men, My Husbands favorite</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just in time for Christmas!</li>
    <li> A bit more of a spicy fragrance than you ordinarily find with a Bvlgari scent. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s slightly more akin to something you&#x27;d expect from Varvatos. It&#x27;s an addition to the main Aqva fragrance, which I prefer. More citrusy than either Aqva Marine or the original Aqva. It has a fairly rapid dry down that leaves the citrus behind, while the more exotic/woodsy notes remain. At least on my skin. Quite nice, but the original Aqva fragrance is still the flagship of the Bvlgari line, in my opinion. It&#x27;s been getting some attention as a possible unisex fragrance, even though it&#x27;s not marketed that way. In closing, I&#x27;d call it a great new addition to the Aqva line, without overtaking the original in terms of overall desirability and longevity.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Bvlgari cologne, I added this to my collection! I also recommend Bvlgari Agva, both are very great fragrances</li>
    <li> I really like this new scent added to the Aqva line from Bvlgary. Even when my favorite is the original Aqva scent, this new one is a nice variation into this line.&lt;br /&gt;I would like tho thanks the seller &#x27;365 Beauty&#x27;, for such an extraordinary service. My Order was placed last Friday, May 2nd, Shipped  in less than one hour (from a different state), and today Monday, May 5th, the package was (brand new sealed just as described) at my door in the afternoon. Fastest shipment EVER received...! Congratulations!</li>
    <li> An absolutely wonderful Spring/Summer scent. It lasts forever and has enough of a citrus kick to enegize me emotionally.</li>
    <li> Very nice, wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Just bought this for my husband, i absolutely love it!!!  im glad it still smells as good as it did when i found it in a magazine</li>
    <li> The seller of my purchase was DiscountPerfumes (and Fulfilled By Amazon). The sent product was legitimate and real. I wanted to point that out as reference for future customers who are looking to purchase the Aqva Amara cologne and are choosing between sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the cologne itself, the scent is fairly unique and I&#x27;ve not smelled anything like it before. I&#x27;m no expert on colognes but I got a strong citrus note that dried down into an earthy smell. Though I wouldn&#x27;t rate this the best of the colognes that I&#x27;ve used, given that I enjoy the scent and the scent has gotten me some compliments, I would rank this a solid purchase.</li>
