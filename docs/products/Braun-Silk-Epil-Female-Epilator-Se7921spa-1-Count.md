<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best ever invention for women:)&lt;br /&gt;It DOES remove very short hair, unlike older models (of 2005).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped the battery would last longer, it works 45mins for me.</li>
    <li> Not too happy with this purchase. It cuts more than it pulls out the hairs.</li>
    <li> Bougt one for my self and one for my mom&lt;br /&gt;Its great</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator for use on my legs and underarms.  I found it does not do a great job on my legs, and I have to repeatedly go over my legs to get all of the hairs (some are still left, even).  This is probably because I have very thin, fine leg hair.  On my underarms this product works great, though.  I use it about once a month and it has entirely eliminated the need for me to shave my underarms.  Occasionally, my skin will get &amp;#34;pinched&amp;#34; by the epilator and it will get stuck and cause my skin to bleed a bit, but this is a rare occurrence.  it was VERY painful the first time I epilated under my arms but after the first few initial times, it does not hurt.  It is well worth it to no longer have to shave my armpits and have light, smooth skin!  I do not find the exfoliating brush all that useful and have only used it a few times.</li>
    <li> For hair removal it does work but it still hurts. Despite all the methods they recommend the product doesn&#x27;t alleviate much pain. It does work though, I just wish it was a step up above other epilators. What&#x27;s cool about this model is the epilator head is removable and you can attach any other Braun head onto it like an additional shaving head or whatever else they offer. Quite a useful tool when you have a collection of different attachments. The epilator part although it works well, is not for me.</li>
    <li> Works better dry than wet. If you&#x27;ve waxed before, this epilator shouldn&#x27;t be too bad in regards to pain.  Light comes in very handy and  the detachable heads are great for packing less for travel.  Battery duration is also long lasting so you will not need to charge it as often.</li>
    <li> Did not grab all the hair. Even though it&#x27;s supposed to leave smoother skin, my skin feels rough like sand paper. Hair come back within a week</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an alternative to shaving. I decided to try an epilator for the first time and was a little scared of the pain. The first time I used it on my legs, the pain wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be. There was pain, but I loved the way that I didn&#x27;t have to do anything for days! I have only used this dry, so I don&#x27;t know if I will get better results when I try it wet. I can see fine blonde hairs especially on my knees, but you cannot feel them. When it was time to do this again, it did grab the shortest hairs and did not hurt nearly as much. So I decided to use this on my bikini line....PAINFUL!! I suffered thru it and do feel it was worth the pain. However, you can only go down so far as it starts grabbing your skin especially in areas where you cannot pull the skin taut (which by the way makes it so much less painful). I have only done this dry also. When I first did this, I was worried as it left these red bumps where the hair had been pulled out, however, the instructions say wait until overnight and they were right. After a full day had passed, it cleared up. The more you use it, the less it hurts. The results are so worth it. I also love the brush attachment. I used it on my face and all over my body. I think it is really helping to prepare my skin for the exfoliation. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the 110 volt units. It&#x27;s under powered</li>
    <li> i pay in get for my wife in her birthday she love it thanks braun and for every one in amazon thanks for your Excellent team and service and from success to success</li>
    <li> The spa brush is useless. It doesnt do anything to make ur skin better or to ingrown hair. Epilator is fairly good but i could buy only epilator for price much less than this. Do not buy this kit if ur main concern is just epilation, buy a single epilator and spa brush separate.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she really love it. it is working perfect as the advertisement describe and it has very nice and perfect design.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It is a little bit slow to epilate but the results are great. You have to spent some time doing it.</li>
    <li> Really professional - performe very good. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good productfair price</li>
    <li> The light is helpful, I like how it&#x27;s rechargeable, and the one I bought was actually for a friend. She liked using mine, so I bought one for her bday. She loves it. It beats shaving everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally feel like the slow speed works better than the fast one, and I like to go over the hair with the cap off during my second round.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving and waxing was too expensive and time consuming. This has been a HUGE money and time saver! In areas that had never been waxed before, such as my underarms, it was very painful at first. Over time, the pain has decreased, although my underarms still remain a little on the sensitive side. When the hair does grow back, it doesn&#x27;t grow in as thick as it used to, and the hairs themselves are finer and softer, which makes them far less irritating than they were when shaving--I don&#x27;t even notice right away when they grow back!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really nice epilator! It doesn&#x27;t pick up every single hair though but i love the fact that I can use it in the shower as well! i only hope that the next generation will have more features and pull more hairs out! hehe</li>
    <li> The braun silk epill exell was way better</li>
    <li> I bought this and worked great for the 4-6 times I used it (only used it about once a month). Now it broke. It gets caught on my skin and is very painful. Past my return period and nothing I can do.</li>
    <li> Using this for past 4 weeks and the product is going great so far. Very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to others</li>
    <li> Is good but expected more for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of product for hair removal for a number of years now (maybe 5?) so I have some experience with these kinds of devices. I long since stopped shaving my underarms because the stubble grows in faster than a man&#x27;s 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and is painful and this kind of hair removal solves that problem. As far as pain goes it&#x27;s not so much that I&#x27;m used to it as it is that hairs have different growth speeds and once you&#x27;re on a roll using it regularly you don&#x27;t have that many coming out at a time and it&#x27;s less painful for that reason. I was excited to see this product come out because it had some great features others have not had before, such as a light to see hard to view areas better and a detachable brush for exfoliation, as well as features some others have but I have not had before like the ability to use it without the cord and the ability to use it wet.  I just cannot understand why it only comes in one speed when on. I found that it broke rather than removed hair at the fast speed, which can lead to some painful ingrown hairs. Slower speeds give a device time to actually get a good hold lower down on the hair and remove it. I think there is a perception that it&#x27;s like ripping off a band-aid and that it should be done quickly to be less painful, but I find it less painful and more thorough with a slower speed. It&#x27;s not a bad product; it&#x27;s just not as good as it could be.</li>
    <li> After using the braun silk epil for many years ( I was in my teenage years when I first started) I must say they came a long way . Also My older model rotates much faster, this one gets the job done. The light on it is pretty bright and I am sure some people love it , for me personally I don&#x27;t like it that much. But I only used it one time and so far I saw lots of hair follicles with it ,which is a good thing, but I did saw a few without and this means the hair broke before it came out all the way ( and yes, I am a license cosmetologist for 20 years) . It goes much faster than my old one and I was done in no time. It can be overwhelming to choose which one is the right one for you, but I do recommend to invest in it and NOT getting a super cheap one ,you will end up being disappointed. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t use it plug in like my old one and I am sure I will run into the situation that I forget to charge it and got to wait an hour before use. I wish this is the part they would change on this product other than  that , I am very impressed with it and can only recommend it .</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just I needed 😊</li>
    <li> This epilator is awesome - I use it every week! It comes with a complete cleaning kit (brush, etc) and is very easy to use. I love that it comes with a built-in LED light... It illuminates previously hidden hairs and makes my hair removal simpler. Safe to use everywhere EXCEPT the face... Seriously, don&#x27;t use it on your face, it ripped a patch of my skin off! But for everywhere else... I&#x27;ve never had smoother arms, legs, or underarms :)</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator that I purchased, I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect at first but I now absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I got the product 6 months ago. I used a philips epiliator earlier but I discontinued it because it took really long. I have been waxing since then until I read good reviews about this product . So, I decided to give it a try.I am not a fan of using the device while taking a shower so that factor wasnt much of a deal. I liked the reviews and it fit my budget. Its sleek and easy to hold. While charging it, you need to make sure the plug goes and fits well in the device. In the begnning i had trouble because I thought it was charging but the wire had actually fallen off the device -it doesnt fit as snugly as it should. So ,i have learnt to lever it against a book, so it doesnt come off. Thats the only drawback. Its amazingly easy to use. Its did not hurt as much as my previous philips one used to. Its took a lot lesser time. Only area to be careful- ARMPITS. Use it for armpits once a week. If my hair grew too long,ouch ! but my arms and legs remain hair free for almost 2 weeks. But that of course is subjective. The cleaning part is also very easy. I just run it under the tap and use the brush to remove the hair, dry it and then pack it up! This is a huge improvement over my philips device in that it takes much shorter ( esp if you take off the cover.which you can once you learn to use the device well. Dont worry its not too hard.I havent been using the cover since the 3rd time), less painful , easy to clean. I have not used it on my face.So,i cannot comment on that.Its easy to carry as well. I am a small petite person. So, I just charge it and keep it in my travel bag. When i need to use it, it does last long enough for me to get my arms,legs and armpits done.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves hers, so I ordered this newer model for me.  I thought the accessories that came with it were different than I got.  If I were to order again, I would go one model down so I could have the attachments that can be used on the underarms and face.  Now...these things hurt.  BUT...this one goes in the shower, and that does seem to help.  It stays charged for a long time.  I like that I can clean it by running it in the water.  The exfoliator head...eh...I was more excited about it before I actually got it.  Having your hair ripped out hurts, but...it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using an epilator, and I used this for my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-guidelight&lt;br /&gt;-cordless&lt;br /&gt;-can use under water&lt;br /&gt;-easy to disassemble and clean&lt;br /&gt;-nice cleaning tools and storage bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-charge lasts 20-25 min at most, definitely NOT 40 min as advertised&lt;br /&gt;-the power level starts off at a certain level (only requiring you to epilate over a given area once), then after 1-2 min it drops and you must epilate over the same areas over and over to remove hairs because the power level is so weak&lt;br /&gt;-this only plucks about half of hairs from the root; it cuts the other half of hairs close to the surface&lt;br /&gt;-this does NOT pluck hairs that are 0.5 mm in length; in fact it will cut many longer hairs and leave them at 0.5-1 mm, unable to remove them no matter how many times you run the epilator over them&lt;br /&gt;-the massaging brush is too soft to exfoliate anything at all, better to use a loofah/manual brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;This is an average epilator, definitely not worth $100.  I might return this and get an Emjoi.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d say this, but once you start (and get used to) using a decent epilator, it&#x27;s almost impossible to go back to shaving and Braun makes some nice ones. I&#x27;ve used a few different models and this isn&#x27;t a lot different than the last couple, but it was my first wet/dry version and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend using the epilator in the shower (standing up) unless you&#x27;ve got fantastic balance and a super non-slip tub or shower, because even as used to it as I was, I still jumped a few times. I found sitting down to be the easiest way to use it, either immediately after a bath or on the edge of the tub during a shower. It didn&#x27;t work as well on dry-ish or moist skin following a shower/bath but did great on actual wet skin - after using it for a while, I actually prefer it to using the epilator on dry skin now (I have painfully dry skin though and your mileage may vary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pain factor is what keeps most people away from epilators. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s painless, but the pain varies depending on where you&#x27;re using it, what heads you&#x27;re using, what speed you&#x27;re using and of course, how sensitive you are. This is basically large-scale, fast tweezing and the first time, it stings. Cooling off with the included soothing pack, if you need it, helps, as does some cool lotion. It gets better - I barely notice it now and honestly, being able to go two-plus weeks without having to shave/epilate is worth five minutes of any sort of stinging.</li>
    <li> Have put off writing a review on this product; wanted to give my legs a chance to get used to the Epilator technology first. It&#x27;s been about 2 months now and although I still don&#x27;t experience a silky smooth closeness like you get with a razor, the hairs are coming in much finer and the is no pain while Epilating. I have another Epilator and this one is the better quality product by far. I love the idea of not needed to shave as the Epilator really gives you a much longer lasting effect that no razor can match. Quite pleased indeed.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my girlfriend first. It is awesome never felt such smooth legs before. Then I got one for my sister for her b day she loves it. Great job Braun</li>
    <li> This listing is misleading.  It does not come with all of the accessories shown in the pictures.  Included in this box are the epilator attachment, the exfoliator brush with attachment, a cover for the exfoliator, small cleaning brush, and a charging cord.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ,better than what i expected ,not painfull for me and very soft result ,3weeks now and i&#x27;m still feeling the softness&lt;br /&gt;fast delievery</li>
    <li> it hurts...but the products is great</li>
    <li> I have always wanted an epilator for myself but they are normally pricey. When I saw this, I was debating whether to make a purchase or not. I think I have made one of the wisest decisions when buying beauty products. This thing is amazing! No doubt it hurts a little the first few times of using it, but you will pretty much get used to it after awhile. I used it for my underarms and legs. One downside, not sure if it&#x27;s me, I couldn&#x27;t really use it to epilate in the shower. I could definitely use the massager/exfoliator, but when epilating, it didn&#x27;t quite work. Anyway, a good product with a decent price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but you have to be used to waxing. I have been waxing for many years so I don&#x27;t find it painful. I would say that it is less unpleasant than waxing. I do my whole legs and arms. it is time consuming [ about an hour ] but the $ savings are great.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love!  For years I have wanted to try an epilator for hair removal and I am so happy I did. Yeah, it is a little uncomfortable, but so worth it! I love how fast it works. I thought it worked a little better dry than wet but that could just be me. Try it, you might love it like me!</li>
    <li> This is just perfect! I&#x27;ve had a very old one and still happy with it but I&#x27;ve got this for my daughter. She couldn&#x27;t use it so I inherited it and loved it!!! It&#x27;s much painless then the old ones. No cable option is perfect! I recommend it to everybody. I can&#x27;t love without it!</li>
    <li> I had old version of that thingy works magic but it would zap me in the shower. So loving this new one plus the exfoliator. Fast shipping as well item brand new in box. Grabs hair fast love the light previous one didn&#x27;t have it so I missed couple of them. With this thing not a chance u miss anything!!! Love it</li>
    <li> I should have bought something cheaper. Did not see so many differences to the other ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tweezing/waxing maniac. Although it does hurt to wax, it doesn&#x27;t suck as much as having to shave all the time, so I prefer it over shaving. The downside to that is that it is so expensive. In my town, an underarm wax can cost $22 plus tip, and since the hair will grow back at different times you may end up wishing for another wax just a week later. You also have to wait until it&#x27;s long enough too. Since I was tired of the cost of waxing and I don&#x27;t mind the pain of waxing or plucking, I thought an epilator would be a good buy. I did a lot of research on each type and finally settled on this one about 6 months ago based on the positive reviews. I made the right choice, for sure, and it has paid for itself at least 5 times over by now.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*It is actually better not to let the hair grow long, so that means you don&#x27;t have to be hairy for long periods of time&lt;br /&gt;*You can do it at any given time, if there is anything to pull, which is way better than a once-per month trip to the waxer&#x27;s shop.&lt;br /&gt;*It doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad once you are consistent with it, just like with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;*It is fairly easy to clean and easy to recharge&lt;br /&gt;*The flashlight is a great tool to help see those hairs you would miss just off the ceiling lights.&lt;br /&gt;*You can use it almost anywhere, or anywhere you have help from another pair of unwary hands. Bikini line, chin, upper lip, underarm, leg, arm, you name it. My underarms and bikini line are my favorite places to use it.&lt;br /&gt;*You can use it in the shower&lt;br /&gt;*The battery lasts pretty long, like an hour&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*If you try to give yourself a brazilian wax with it by yourself, you are gonna have a bad time. I tried and failed. Luckily, the top part came off before it could do any damage, so it was really just a bit scary. It jammed when that happened, and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on, but I just plugged it in for a charge and it was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;*It hurts pretty bad. As opposed to waxing, which takes it all offin one go, it pulls hairs one at a time like tweezing, but at a fast pace. That means there is a lot of breath holding and holding of skin to keep it all tight because you don&#x27;t know when or how many hairs it will find and pull out. I suggest taking 600mg of Ibuprofen a half hour before you intend to do it... or maybe a few glasses of wine if you&#x27;d rather not use traditional drugs.&lt;br /&gt;*The hair will fly EVERYWHERE, but where else would it go, I guess?</li>
    <li> The product is great! I was expecting lots of pain but was willing to sacrifice for the convenience, but I barely felt it! It hurt on my underarms but by the second time I was already used to it. My legs were no problem at all! Still have not done any other body parts, but I will ;) My only complain is that now my legs are covered with ingrown hairs :( if anyone has any suggestions I&#x27;m open for it and would be greatly appreciated! I&#x27;m not sure that has anything to do with the product or epilating in general. I love the light on this thing very bright. Warning: the sound this thing makes when you turn it on will send chills down your spine; but that&#x27;s all it is just loud sound, its not painful just a little uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Though I bought this recently, the product has no problems, whatsoever. I am used to waxing my legs so the pain of tweeting is quite bearable.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. Does exactly what it says. buy this if you are looking for an easy hair removal option.The derm abrasion is OK.</li>
    <li> if you want to use advantages of this machine you need to buy extra heads for this machine, they are sold seperately not included in this set</li>
    <li> Beautiful and gentle on the skin and the capacity of the battery lasts for a long time and can be carried in a handbag</li>
    <li> I love this but I was thinking it was going to come with more parts other than that it&#x27;s a really good epilator it takes the hairs out fast I use it for my udder arms and legs so far I would try the bikini area but I feel it&#x27;s Gona be to painful.</li>
    <li> best epilator ever!! I´ve been used epilator for more than 20 years and this is the best of all by far!! love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is super quick and easy to use.  Light is great to help see the smaller hairs to enable a smooth result.</li>
    <li> Too painful for me, plus it doesn&#x27;t seem to get those finer hairs that waxing does. I thought this would be great because I&#x27;m always traveling &amp; don&#x27;t like going to new waxing salons without a good recommendation. The product is well built &amp; easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use it about once a week-- it still really hurts on my lower leg, but it does better on my upper leg.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, but most of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people have stated how much pain the Epilators cause. In my opinion I think waxing hurts worse than this Epilator, plus waxing is messy. The best way to use it is, not to use when the hair is too long. Shave first and when the hair is between 0.5 to 5 mm in length then use the Epilator. The Braun Silk Epilator comes with easy to read instructions and tips on how to best use this product. I personally love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave all the time now. The best thing is there isn&#x27;t any razor stubble like there is when shaving. The hair is slow to grow back because the Braun Silk gets it at the root. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gift receiver loves it and claims it works great!</li>
    <li> I sent this to my mom because she was unable to shave due to an accident.  She loved it so much i purchased it for myself.  The first time epilating is a little scary, but not as painful as i expected</li>
    <li> I love the Braun Epilator.  Where has this invention been all of my life.  This is the first one that I&#x27;ve tried, so I don&#x27;t know how it stacks up against others.  All I know is that it works wet or dry fantastically, is easy to clean, is easy to use, and I stay virtually hair free for weeks.  The only drawback was that the charger plug does not fit tightly into the system.  However, I think that it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with Braun.  Maybe I was just sold a defective product from the seller.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found an epilator yet that lives up to all its claims of removing even fine hair and keeping hair away for weeks but I suppose it could possibly be my hair type. In any case, this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned. It runs well, has a decent battery and gets all the coarse hairs with several passes.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that since its waterproof (a feature that I do find helpful) it can not be run while charging. So if your battery does get low there&#x27;s no plugging in &amp; keeping on.</li>
    <li> I love love love this silk epil9. First thing this product is made in Germany. I try to avoid buying product that made in China because I feel that the quality just isn&#x27;t there. I love that it come with an attachment brush head to help buff and smooth your skin. Since I started using the Braun silk9, I don&#x27;t need to use clarasonic brush anymore since this come with a brush head. Free up space in my shower! I also love that this come with three different guard heads. My favorite is the guard for facial hair removal. Make it so much more precise of where you want to remove the hair. Even though it said facial hair guard it work really well for bikini line!! This silk9 remove hair much better than my old Braun epilator. I find myself only need to do two circles and all the hair is out. With my old Braun I have to check for occasional stray hair left behind. The silk9 hair removing surface is so much wilder make it much less time consuming too! The BEST thing about this unit is te fact you can use them wet or dry!!!! The best time to remove your hair is in the shower because the water soften your skin and the heat help open up the pores make it a better hair extraction. I remember always wishing my old epilator could go in the shower and now it does!!! I really love this epilator and I already got my two girlfriends hooked! Tips for newbies who are new to epi: before your first session take one or two ibuprofen (this is the same recommendation for your first waxing btw) about 30 mins to an hour before. Try to keep your skin taunt. Move the epilator in circular motion to ensure the most hair being remove. Same as waxing, the pain will lessen as your body get use to the sensation which usually take only two sessions. After that it really is the most easiest and cheapest way to remove hair. Also your skin stay smooth for weeks. Can&#x27;t say that with shavinh now can&#x27;t ya!&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received this product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Braun is the best for things like this. It works great, easy to read instructions and it really does not fail. So I do recommend.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product , I&#x27;ve tried other epilators and been dissatisfied because they are too slow , lack pulling power and the batteries don&#x27;t last long enough. Not so with the silk epil 7 its just what you need and more.&lt;br /&gt;I get fantastic results with it and I would highly recommend it because it is a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing with it is the exfoliation attachment because it&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product as promised! it leaves my skin incredibly smooth.The battery lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Glad with the purchase.</li>
    <li> But I must of gotten a fluke.  I have owned brawn before with no issues, but this one won&#x27;t holed a charge.  :(</li>
    <li> It is not worth of money at all. It rarely does its job,  it has only 2 heads, so it&#x27;s impossible to do bikini with it at all, and I would not ever recommend buy it</li>
    <li> This is my 4th epilator.  They die.  The first one was the evil rotating spring style and these devices have morphed a lot since way back.  The epilator head is small but I have been epilating for so long that it works fine for the decreased amount of growth I am now left with.  The &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore but this one is more gentle than others I&#x27;ve used.  If you have very heavy growth, I would recommend one with a larger head.  It works well on underarms without grabbing which was something of a surprise.  As advertised, it does not do very well with longer hair  so be prepared to trim.  The very fine hairs on my knees did not respond as well as I had hoped.  Hope this is not TMI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surprise was the exfoliating head.  I haven&#x27;t used one in decades and had forgotten how nice it is to knock that top level of dead skin off to reveal smooth beneath.  I use it almost every day in the shower and this proves that the waterproof feature is valuable.  It&#x27;s very gentle but effective, especially on the legs.  I&#x27;m not sure how well the epilator would work wet so I didn&#x27;t try.</li>
    <li> Good for use all over the body. Easy to handle and clean. The spa attachment is not that useful or great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using braun epilators for over 10 years and this has been, by far, the better one until now. It&#x27;s faster, less painful and not as noisy as previous models I&#x27;ve tried, and once you&#x27;re able to use it under water it makes it more hygienic and much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> My old epilator finally died so I decided to try this product. I like this product allows to use both wet and dry so you don&#x27;t have to be in a shower room when it&#x27;s time to remove your unwanted hair...lol It&#x27;s perfect for me because I&#x27;m new mom and don&#x27;t have much time for myself. It&#x27;s really easy to use and has a small light to show the area clearly so you will have less chance to miss hairs. It&#x27;s not so cheap...but you get what you pay for:)</li>
    <li> Bottom line: This thing is great.  It is a bit uncomfortable to use the first time, but it gets easier.  If you can get a tattoo, you can easily use this thing.&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m glad it has: The exfoliation brush is really useful.  It keeps me from getting ingrown hairs and makes my legs even smoother.&lt;br /&gt;What I wish it had: It would be nice if there was a suction cup holder for the shower.  If I use it in the shower, I have to turn off the water in order to put it on the floor outside the shower without flooding my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent about two weeks researching epilators and reading hundreds of reviews and finally decided on the Braun Silk-epil 9.  It has a big head, different attachments that are useful, and can be used wet or dry.  I noticed that a lot of reviewers got it free, so I went to the BzzAgent site they reference, took some surveys, and thanks to my good karma, they sent me one to try out!  Score!  As soon as I got it, I scanned the instructions and held my breath as I held it up to my shin.  I was worried it was going to be really painful, but it was just like a rubber band snap.  It was a little uncomfortable, but not bad.  As I got closer to my ankles, it hurt a little bit, but nothing too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after successful use on my legs, I got cocky and decided to do my upper lip.  I put on the other cap and brought it up to my upper lip.  Oh mother of pearl!  I couldn&#x27;t do it.  I&#x27;ve never waxed my lip and wasn&#x27;t prepared for it.  Not sure if you remember the first time you plucked your eyebrows, but it was a similar sensation.  My eyes watered and I couldn&#x27;t go through with it.  I went online and did some research and saw that some people used lidocaine cream to numb the area.  I tried that on my upper lip and bikini line and didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  I&#x27;ve been using the exfoliating brush and haven&#x27;t had any ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve use the epilator a few more times since and it&#x27;s really not been bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution:  Ifyou have bug bites on your legs, be careful.  I didn&#x27;t realize that this little hair puller could also cut skin if it&#x27;s swollen from a bug bite.  That&#x27;s why I gave it four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this epilator.  I was completely prepared to buy it and, had I bought it instead of being awarded it, would have kept it.  I have no desire to go back to shaving, razor burn, and nicks on my legs!</li>
    <li> Good! It is better than what I thought ....... Can&#x27;t. Imagine it ! I love this thing, it helps me a lot!</li>
    <li> No words to describe how efficient as well as comfortable to remove hair with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the relatively short battery life but it is manageable.</li>
    <li> I have the updated version of this.  It&#x27;s the Braun Silk Epil 9 SkinSpa.  I think the technology has improved, as I find it much easier to remove all hair in the area.  I mainly use this on my legs and underarms.  I had the basic Silk epil 7 with the smaller head and felt like I needed to go over an area several times, which worried me - was I creating too much friction.  With the larger head and cleaner removal, I think that concern may be gone.  I also store the newer version in my shower, as I really like the body brush.</li>
    <li> I have dark thick hair and the braun epilator helps me extract the hair from its roots. I have tried several brands in this price range and none of them comes any close to the quality of braun.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the motorized wheels tend to wear out and you will need to replace your epilator once every 1.5-2 years.</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as I had hoped. After my first two times using this, it really didn&#x27;t hurt anymore--which is awesome, but my leg hairs are so fine the epilator can&#x27;t get them all most of the time. It&#x27;s good quality, but doesn&#x27;t work ideally for me.</li>
    <li> THE BRAUN IS UNIQUE. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, MY WIFE IS HAPPY WITH BRAUN SILK EPIL FEMALEEPILATOR SE7921SPA 1.</li>
    <li> I loved it at first, but only because I was able to stop buying razors when I should have in fact continued to buy them and never bought this item in the first place! This epilator leaves behind hairs like crazy! I can see a hair and repeatedly go over it and the epilator won&#x27;t grab it! I guess I&#x27;m going back to regular razors!</li>
    <li> Been using Braun epilators for 25 years .... Less pain with this one.</li>
    <li> it is easier to use than other epilators--the light also helps as you can see the hairs that need to be removed--but similar to other epilators in that you have to run it a few times to remove all the hairs</li>
    <li> I have been living on Braun Epilators since I was a teenager. This new advanced one is pretty awesome, especially the fact that it can be used during your shower. I shave my arms and legs with it. I also love the defoliator brush, I use it on my elbows, knees, and underarms while showering coz i suffer from skin darkness in these areas.....I simply love this epilator and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it.  She uses it in the shower and says it helps with the pain.</li>
    <li> works great, causes a little bit of pain the first time, but you do a small section, wait a few minutes and do more.. the 2nd time you use it - you barely notice anything.  Very good product with multiple uses..</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot shave as often as I like. Waxing has always been my preferred method. Due to my circumstances I can no longer get regularly waxed and found this alternative. It&#x27;s the best purchase I have made for hair removal. It does sting and hurt a bit if you aren&#x27;t used to waxing or plucking hairs, but the results are wonderful. The pain intensity is less than a waxing, but it is slight pain for longer. I stay hair free for about 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She says it&#x27;s too painful to use so she doesn&#x27;t. She&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s no fun at all.</li>
    <li> I am always too lazy to write a product review, but the braun epilator really deserves five stars. Best epilator ever! It works amazingly well! I highly recommend it. I am super hairy,  and I was always ashamed of wearing a bikini. But the Braun epilator has really changed my life forever! It is simply awesome. Even though it hurts very much and it is kind of expensive, it is really worthy and I will never regret buying this epilator. So happy I bought it! :D</li>
    <li> i have never waxed, only shaved and have used hair removal cream. Today was the first time i used an epilator. I ordered this product few days ago, choose the 1-2 days shipping for free due to Amazon Prime(free trial). It came on time and actually earlier than the expected time which was great.&lt;br /&gt;I love how quick and painless this product is. I thought it would hurt more because i did a trial using tweezers on my own but this epilator is even less painful than plucking it with a tweezer. The battery is also good. It lasted through the whole time while i epilated my arms, and legs. The only thing i would want to also include in this product is the different caps/heads for the epilator like the other Braun products for different areas of the body like for your face. the exfoliation brush is good, there&#x27;s a strong vibration but i wish it could rotate left and right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is going to be useful when spring and summer comes. I&#x27;m sure to be using this product for a long time from now.</li>
    <li> Once you get passed the pain, which unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t, it actually cuts away hair. The pain was just unbearable for me, imagine sharp blades rapidly going near your skin. However, once I sucked it up even for a few seconds, it cut the hair better than shaving. I&#x27;d say try it if you have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
    <li> Not only does it hurt a lot but it doesn&#x27;t work, it left stubble and didn&#x27;t feel silky smooth, it just felt like I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a week.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed, does not remove fine hair, leavivg behind little black dots. I&#x27;ve also noticed I&#x27;ve been getting more ingrown hairs since I started using it, and despite exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an epilator in years, I thought it was going to hurt a lot. But I was pleasantly surprised as it wasn&#x27;t very painful at all. I used it for my underarms and legs so far.</li>
    <li> I always use to wax my legs and hands. This product was Good as expected. only thing is it has more pain than wax</li>
    <li> FOLLOW UP REVIEW 1/3/2014 (Original review is below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was initially pretty happy with this epilator, I decided to return it after a few more trial runs. Overall, I was simply too afraid to use it! When I first tried it on my chest and sides of my face, it caused some pain &amp; irritation but not enough for me to panic. However after trying it on other parts, it left me not wanting to use it again. It was too painful and I could never picture myself wanting to use it on my whole leg, let alone both legs! Part of me wanted to keep it, since it did work and had some nice features, but overall it just wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/30/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wanting an epilator for quite a while and am happy that I finally purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit that I was pretty scared to use this - considering some of the reviews and the tweezers in general. Overall it wasn&#x27;t too bad. So far I have used it on my face and chest. It definitely caused some redness, especially on my chest, so I am glad I chose to use it at night before bed. It was easy to clean and I could tell that it took the hair out at the root. The light is nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that the booklet does not recommend using the exfoliator on your face, since that is something I was looking forward to.</li>
    <li> I have owned a few epilators, though not many.  I should start out by saying that epilation isn&#x27;t exactly my favorite hair removal method.  It is time-consuming (you have to go over areas several times), uncomfortable (don&#x27;t let anyone lie to you), and if you neglect to exfoliate, you will end up with ugly, painful, ingrown hairs, which can even scar if you don&#x27;t take care of them properly.  However, there is something very attractive about a hair removal method that you can do at home, won&#x27;t cost an arm an a leg (have you priced waxing lately?), and you don&#x27;t have to do it every day.  So if you haven&#x27;t been scared away, this epilator is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  MICROVIBRATIONS!!!  They are awesome!!!  They really do cut down on the discomfort.  It feels a bit weird at first, but it is a happy distraction from the root-ripping occurring in very sensitive areas!  It works well wet or dry, although I find I miss more spots if I use it in the bath/shower.  Enter the Smartlight!!!  Nothing gets by this thing.  Even in a well-lit environment, you can really miss a lot without this nifty light.  I also like the two-speed option . . . sometimes faster isn&#x27;t always better, especially in tender places.  Ditto to the exfoliating brush . . . don&#x27;t neglect to use it or something like it or you will pay with nasty, bumpy ingrown hairs.  My only gripe with this device is the battery life.  It would be nice to be able to finish the job in one sitting, and this falls short for me.  It lasts about 45 minutes on average . . . maybe a little longer on the slower speed.  With as many times as I have to go over areas to get everything the Smartlight illuminates and really do a good job, I maybe finish a leg and a half before it dies.  A little longer life would be appreciated.  Along the lines of battery life . . . it charges fairly quickly, so it&#x27;s not THAT awful to wait until the battery is charged again.  I recall reading reviews about the cord not plugging in securely to the device--on my device, I found you have to push quite firmly until you hear it snap in place . . . then it definitely stays put.  All-in-all, this is a pretty solid product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one for my wife, she had been using other, but they are not working well for her, but this one work well for her and she is loving it.</li>
    <li> It is still painful after using it for 4-5 times. But it works.</li>
    <li> Moves hair amazing, doesn&#x27;t let the hair grow back as fast as a shaver</li>
    <li> This is amazing product,I bought for my hair removing.i was waxing before buy this,that was not easy for me to do alone.this epilator take out smallest hair and i don t need to do it again and again</li>
    <li> I like this purchase! It has just the basic necessities to get rid of leg hair. Got it for my mother for mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> This is the only epilator I have used and I was a little scared to try an epilator but I could not afford waxing my legs once a month. The epilator pinches a little as is pulls out the hair but it is not painful. The best way to use it would be to shave on day one and then on day two exfoliate your legs really well and then use the epilator. The down side to using the epilator is that hair does not grow at the same speed so if you want silky soft legs you need to shave or use the epilator every day... and the epilator can take up to 1/2 to do both lower legs. After my first couple of uses I noticed that I had a lot of ingrown hairs, I was able to use tweezers to help them out and then use the epilator to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I do this that this epilator works well but I do find that I need to shave my legs if I am going to go to the beach or something. But other that the slowness I would recommend trying one!</li>
    <li> The results this epilator gives is amazing. I was quite surprised it worked so well.  I would recommend this to all women who want smooth legs.</li>
    <li> First of all let me start by saying I actually purchased this item and it was not given to me for review by any special programs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the product quality: I could not have asked for a more quality item. It functions well, has a sleek and attractive design, charges quickly, and is of excellent quality. The only neutral comment I have is that it turns on just a little bit too easily. There are safety tabs that surround the button, and it&#x27;s a twist action to turn it on, but I have no doubt that my children could easily turn this on. I have made sure to keep the brush head attached instead of the epilator, and keep it out of reach of the children. Also worth mentioning is the useful little light that helps you see a little bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by saying this, epilating will not be for everyone. My assess my pain tolerance at a mid-level, not especially high, but definitely not low, and I will say the first use was moderately painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this on underarms, and legs at this point and have used it twice in the 3 or so weeks I have had it. The second use was remarkably easier, and I breezed right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for those of you unfamiliar with epilating, this process can be painful but will definitely last longer than shaving, and for that I was willing to try it. I had previously tried the facial epilator made by Braun that I like, and so I knew a little bit of what to expect. Even knowing what to expect did not prepare me for my first attempt. If you have ever gotten a tattoo on your leg, I would liken the pain of epilating to the sensation that you feel after you&#x27;ve been having the lines drawn for about 20 minutes. It has moments of sharp pain, but for the most part it is just a constant scratchy prickling sensation. For the underarms, the pain is worse. Start with small sections and make sure to stretch the skin as best as possible. It took me a good 45 minutes the first time through (the battery was achamp, and showed no signs of weakness after this). I was happy with the results, and it lasted about 8-10 days before I felt the need to give it another go. My second time I breezed right through and finished it in about 20 minutes with much less pain and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I recommend this product for anyone who is tired of daily or every other day shaving and wants an easy at home alternative that lasts. If you are willing to have a bit of pain for the gain, then go for this all the way. You will get used to the pain and will thank yourself for the saved time.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Easy to hold. Has delivered to my expectations. I use this on my legs and underarms and found it to be great.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It work perfectly and I really like the underwater option. The only problem and that&#x27;s why I didnt give 5 star is that I could&#x27;t really &amp;#34;epilate&amp;#34; under water .(maybe a problem with my hair being to thin...) but it work perfectly once my legs are dry.</li>
    <li> I hate myself for buying this, but I don&#x27;t regret it one bit. While the concept sounds like some medieval torture device, I must say, it&#x27;s worth it. 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was sick and tired of paying insane prices for razor heads. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I always had to splurge and get the ~16-18 dollar packs of razors with some kind of soap on the razor head (Generally the Venus + Olay mix). Every time the soap ran out, I had to put on a new head - I was pretty much just throwing money at these companies. I was looking into cheaper alternatives, and then I found out about epilating. I bought this at around $75, and I figured even if it only lasted me a year or two, I was still saving money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie - this HURTS the first time you do it. Since I had been shaving for over 10 years, my skin was not at all prepared to have the hairs ripped out. But, I&#x27;ve had my epilator for about 2 weeks now, and it really does get easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that before the first time you epilate, you get the places you aim to epilate waxed at a salon. I wish I had done this, as this helps your skin get used to it all at once. When the hairs are pulled out, as opposed to being shaved, it takes much longer to grow back, and they also grow back thinner and finer. I&#x27;m not saying these hairs will be baby soft now, but they will be easier to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the best way to epilate. From my experience as a complete beginner, the wet/dry feature of this is what makes this process possible for me. Generally, what I have found to work is to epilate everything you want in the shower. I do legs, underarms, and some pubic area. So, when I&#x27;m in the shower, I&#x27;ll make sure the stream of water (try to do hot water while you are getting used to this) is over the place I am about to epilate, and then I&#x27;ll do a couple swipes. You probably won&#x27;t get all of the hair, but that&#x27;s okay - I&#x27;ve noticed it takes a few times to get it all. Then, the day after you have done this process, I recommend the next day epilating your legs while they are dry. The light feature on this epilator is SO convenient - it really helps you see any small hairs you might have missed. I recommend putting a towel down, putting a movie on, and focus on getting as much of the hair as you can. It&#x27;s going to sting, but not as much as you think it will while doing it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite how much of a pain it might seem at first, it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
    <li> A++++ quick shipping and perfect epilator</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I am pleased with the results.  It has eliminated the nicks on my legs that I would get when I used a razor and my legs stay smoother longer because the hair grows back finer and softer.</li>
    <li> Great made and works correctly it&#x27;s very nice and good shipping time&lt;br /&gt;i love it and would like to buy more for it in the future</li>
    <li> Like the freedom of no cord.  My hair is so fine it is kinda hard to get all.  But that&#x27;s what happens when you are not shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> My first epilator ever !!! Very easy to use and clean over all. It does hurt the first time but nothing compared to the smooth soft results it gives to your skin . I used it dry to make sure every tiny hair was removed and got exactly the result . Would highly recommend as the exfoliator is a great bonus and the light is very handy . I used it only for underarms and dint need to recharge battery. The hair dint grow back for unto 2 weeks so reduced my time overall a LOT !! Would highly recommend this one for sure .</li>
    <li> Works good. Fast if you are used to use a epilator. Charge last enough so you can use many times.</li>
    <li> I loved it. It is very usefull and high quality item. I am advicing it to everyone who looks for that kind of item.</li>
    <li> it is good product to remove very fin hair of your body and the exfoliation head it is good to remove the dead cells from your skin.</li>
    <li> I chose this epilator over the others because I liked that it included the exfoliating scrub. Like other reviewers said, the exfoliating was very light and didn&#x27;t seem to do much. It was my first experience with an epilator and it did not seem as painful to do my legs as the underarm. The underarm was tough and it didn&#x27;t seem to be able to catch all the hairs until I went in a different direction. Also, to relieve the pain, I used an icebag to cool down the irritation. Overall, it was worth it to buy because the hair didn&#x27;t grow back for a week/week and a half (shaving was every other day IF i wanted to be lazy).</li>
    <li> I thought it was gonna make wonders, but sadly it was not what it advertised to be.&lt;br /&gt;Im not giving up on it just yet.&lt;br /&gt;The product is not amazing, But it is not too bad.</li>
    <li> I have it for a year now - I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for years and I can say NO PAIN at all with this epilator in particular. The final result is a clean, soft skin, I loved it!</li>
    <li> Epilation does sting. the exfoliation is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Easy to care for and to use.  This is designed for macro work, not detail areas, and it does it well. All areas that it is used on is taken care of sufficiently if you follow proper preparation (hair length and running it various directions - its just tweezers after all, not a shaver) and the appliance itself does not irritate the skin.  My rating isn&#x27;t a 5 because of the noise and comparatively shorter battery performance. For actual work done, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> well my wife loves it lol</li>
    <li> I used this product maybe 5 or 6 times (and I never charged it until the battery drains) now even I charged it full, the battery drained in 2 minutes!!!!! I tried to return it but their policy won&#x27;t let me!! this is a complete disappointment!! ------------ edit after chat with amazon thank you amazon for helping me returning this item as a one time exception.. so 5 stars to amazon but zero star to Braun!</li>
    <li> Very nice unit and well made.  It does a great job on pulling out the hairs.  It does take some time to get all of the hairs,  but then again I wouldn&#x27;t want it to pull all of them at once in the same spot....as epilatating is slightly painful to begin with.  Though, don&#x27;t let that scare you off, as once you start epilatating your going to want to throw your razor out.&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is very compact and fits in my hands nicely.  The detachable head is great as it makes for easy clean up and maintenance.  Also, the built in light is genius,  as I can see all the smaller hairs that I would normally miss.  All in all this is a great unit for the $.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator from Amazon in a year. I got it because it has a wet/dry option and an exfoliator attachment unlike my first, an Emjoi model. This one is definitely more gentle but also less effective. It takes more passes and more time than the Emjoi model.&lt;br /&gt;  You should know a few things about epilating before investing in an expensive model if you&#x27;ve never tried it before. Firstly, six weeks of smoothness is a total lark. It must be done once a week to avoid unnecessary pain and pee a boo strays showing as plain as day. I could even see using twice a week if you have to have really perfect legs, say in the summer season. My hair is light but thick and upkeep is a must. Also you have to exfoliate religiously to avoid nasty red bumps and even then you&#x27;ll get them every so often. The brush attachment on this model really isn&#x27;t strong enough to do this job and I have to use bath gloves most days a week. If I do experience red bumps I will likely develop a scar because I&#x27;m very pale. So this is to be avoided at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this model is the attached light. It&#x27;s bright enough to illuminate strays so you see them before anyone else does.  It is gentle enough for all over body and face use so you can save a few bucks on waxing if you can do the upkeep yourself. It will pay for itself in a matter of weeks.  It takes patience and practice to use effectively and isn&#x27;t really a better option than shaving in terms of the time commitment.  It is cheaper though and less dangerous and can also take the place of waxing so it does make economic sense. The smoothness of shaving can&#x27;t be matched by an epilator, even immediately afterwards so you have to adjust to that as well. One of these days I&#x27;m gonna do laser therapy so I can avoid all the stinking upkeep in the first place.  Oh and mom was right...  It hurts to be beautiful. Go into it knowing its going to hurt at first but your tolerance will increase, especially if you do it weekly.</li>
    <li> Great, but misses finer hair.</li>
    <li> It misses some hair for some reason.  But overall good.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well. It does not get ALL the hair off, so its kind of worthless. Also, if you don&#x27;t use the brush head, your legs will be itchy with a bunch of ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Works great. I like the massaging head to prevent ingrown hairs. Hurts much less cause you can use it under running water.</li>
    <li> Once you get past the initial pain this is perfect NO SHAVING. I have been using this for over a year now and I love it.</li>
    <li> The product does what it is supposed to.  The light was really nice to show the hairs that you need to get on your legs and the battery lasts about an hour for me.  I gave it two stars, because I have used this every week for about 4 months and my legs just get really bumpy with ingrown hairs.  I even exfoliated my legs before hand with the exfoliator and a skin brush that I already had and it still made me bumpy.  I never used it in the shower.  It does a great job getting the hairs, but it is not for me.</li>
    <li> I have some previous models, but this one is buy far the best. Very easy to use and it seems that is less painful.</li>
    <li> Okay I want to just clarify a few things about this epilator. It is good and works well. BUT...................    This epilator comes with all the 5 attachments in the UK, but here in the US it does NOT. There is just the soft spa brush. I called the Braun customer care in the US because I was confused how the same product would be different here in the USA. This is what I was told...    Both the Braun 7921 Spa epilator and the Braun 7681 silk epil 7epilator models are exactly the same. Except the spa epilator comes with the spa brush(which is $ 18 if bought separately) and the the 7681 does not come with the brush. However, the 7681 comes with 5 different attachments, for the underarm, the shaver, face and so on. Check the product and you will understand. So, I&#x27;m confused why Braun is trying to sell us the exact same product, with two different numbers just because of the attachments.    So, in effect we can buy the 7681 and brush the extra brush(again a suggestion by someone at the Braun customer service), versus buying the 7921 spa without any of the 5 attachments except the brush which is quite useless. In all fairness the 7921 must cost way lesser than what we are charged because of the discrepancy in what it comes with.    Finally, check the reviews for the 7921 it has about 4.5 ish and the 7681 has 4. It is the SAME epilator, the reviews are not for the  attachments alone. A month ago the 7921 also had about 4 star in its reviews, and the price was $ 70.81, now they managed to get people to write better reviews for a product which is the same as the Braun 7681(which has 4 stars), and bumped up the price to $100 by increasing the review rating from 4 to 4.5.    I think Braun should be more honest in what it is doing by explaining that the two products are exactly the same except for the attachments instead of leading us to believe that the two are different. This is not what Braun is doing in Europe, then why try to do this to those of us in the USA??      Update!! 15th August 2014    When I wrote this review the rating became 4 stars. Two days after my review, three suspicious reviews have come up, please check the last three reviews. It has some random three people who just say excellent, etc and now the rating has bumped up again to 4.5. Irrespective of how the tool works, it&#x27;s really shocking to see the gimmicks the company is using to increase the rating. I actually like Braun, but I don&#x27;t like being manipulated!</li>
    <li> Good one to begin with as it is gentle comparatively but not very efficient even at higher speed mode. But I will keep it I think because of the other good features of Braun and will buy some other brand in next couple of years when I am more used to using epilators. Too expensive for the results you get. Doesn&#x27;t work good on small hairs. Exfoliator is good for mild exfoliation but not good enough to prevent in-grown hairs, the purpose it was built for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using it wrongly but I&#x27;m getting a lot of in grown hairs after using this.</li>
    <li> For me, it was a replacement for a really old Braun -  the new one appears to be less painful, and the brush head is really nice.</li>
    <li> good and I would recommend any body to order it</li>
    <li> Ladies this is the best thing I have found in years!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for beginners. But there is only one cap with this. Where in picture they have shown 4-5 cap.I tried to contact to the seller. But I couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Charging point is very loose so it&#x27;s is also little inconvenient. But manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this product is good</li>
    <li> Speed is a little too slow.  Overall I like the product though</li>
    <li> I have always been a shaver until I finally got tired of it and decided to try waxing. Contrary to my friends&#x27; opinion, I realized waxing was not that painful. (I have had 2 kids naturally...now nothing else can&#x27;t even hold a candle to that kind of pain!) I actually enjoyed the long gaps I could go between wax jobs. But then as I got more comfortable with waxing, I started wondering how there couldnt be a less messier way to get rid of body hair. And thats when I saw an epilator listing on amazon, appearing in related products. I went through almost all of the zillion reviews listed and that itself is a great tutorial if you want to get a product. In almost a couple days, I had compared, studied and made up my mind too! I finally bought Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator SE7921 and I can honestly say, that this is what I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product:&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It hurts, but more like a small electric current over your skin. I get angry red bumps, (which happened when I used to wax too) but I have sensitive skin and I am ok with it. It goes away in about 90 minutes and I apply Eucerin Calming lotion after I use Epilator. If you are prone to ingrown hair like me, then make sure you use a good exfoliating scrub/loofah/ the exfoliation system that comes with this pack once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried using it on my underarms (it definitely hurts more than the small electric current, and I have to use it in a gentle tapping motion rather than the sweep I do in my arms and legs)&lt;br /&gt;Pros: My skin is smoother because I exfoliate regularly now. My body hair is finer and takes at least 2 weeks to grow back to noticeable lengths. My underarms are softer and lighter because I have stopped shaving. Even the hair that grows back is less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention my little investment has paid off nicely, now that I dont have to buy wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am a happy customer. But since this product comes not so cheap, my advise would be to try this product once and see how you feel about it, and then buy it.</li>
    <li> I got tired of going to waxing appointments and found the Braun Epilator works great at home.  I use mine in the shower.  I found if I use the epilator more frequently than the once a month waxing appointments, the hair removal was not as painful and I don&#x27;t need to suffer thru hair grow out.  I also use the brush to wash my face.  It&#x27;s great at removing dead skin after using Retin A.</li>
    <li> I have coarse stubble since I&#x27;m Italian, and I was hoping this product would help remove hair on my legs, armpits, panty line etc. but even though it put me through a bit of annoying pain, I hardly got any results even after going over the same spots multiple times. I&#x27;m not sure I will keep the item since it probably won&#x27;t be of much use to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time using a product like this but I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use the exfoliating brush just on my face which is great for deep down cleaning.  And I have coarse hair on my legs and plenty of it. After using this for about a month the hair is finer and grows back slower. I especially like using it in the shower. It also works great for the face and neck on the annoying whiskers that pop up. It&#x27;s less painful than threading. I will continue to have my brows threaded but this product has eliminated the need for waxing and face threading.</li>
    <li> Works great love the feel of my legs , beats shaving anytime.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfy with this purchase. My skin does not get irritated and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> this is the best epilator i have ever had.  no, epilating is not comfortable.  but if done properly (exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate), it&#x27;s not painful.  with the braun silk, it&#x27;s not even what i would call uncomfortable.  well worth every cent!</li>
    <li> It is painful, but I think this is better than shaving.</li>
    <li> This item which I opened too late to return (3 days too late); charged but never turned on.  I can&#x27;t believe how many products lately I have purchased that do not WORK.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this much. It works almost as good as my $30 epilator but costs $100 one two</li>
    <li> This review comes from a first time epilator user. I did some research beforehand to try to understand what it is that this does. They are tiny tweezer-like arms that glide over the skin and pull hair from the root. I have tweezed before and know how painful that is. I bought this for facial hair removal. It works like intended, but not all my hairs are coarse and need to be plucked. This attempts to pick up each hair which is painful when only half need to be. I tried to ease into it and use it a few minutes every day, but still very painful. There are 2 settings, slow and fast, which are supposed to be less painful and more painful respectively. I can&#x27;t tell the difference. Overall it&#x27;s a good product. I wish I had a higher tolerance for pain so I could get more use out of it. So far I don&#x27;t want to use it that often.</li>
    <li> It is just okay. This is great for beginners. I gave it 4 stars because is does not cut the skin. It takes a while to fully epilate and it does not get all of the hairs.</li>
    <li> As long as you let your hair grow out a bit, about 2 centimeters then this works amazingly. Otherwise it can miss very short hairs and cause you to have to go over that area again, but still does a great job. The battery lasted me a leg and a half the first time I used it and I might be able to get both legs done in one life when I get more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Nope. No no no no no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively tough skin on my legs, as I pluck them fairly regularly and have a high pain threshold.&lt;br /&gt;I could.not.handle this!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating head, however, is great!</li>
    <li> She says it works better than the older one that she handed down to our niece. Nice to not see the halo of glowing fuzz when she is backlit.</li>
    <li> i use to have the same one, but the fact that this one can be used in the shower is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to women.</li>
    <li> Very misleading in the photos.  Look at the 5th photo in the all media.  It shows more heads and attachments.  you don&#x27;t get these attachments with this device.  Thank you Amazon for confusing the consumer into making me think I was getting more than I really was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please fix which media photos you show, that was really unfair and incorrect.</li>
    <li> This thing works very well.  I can&#x27;t use No-No type products because I have light hair on light skin.  Not a problem with this epilator.  Like any tweezer epilator it does hurt a bit.  This particular one is very well made and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I was hoping to replace a 10+ years old Philips epilator but no luck.  There is a guard and it doesn&#x27;t seems to pick up the hairs efficiently.  If you take the guard off, it pinches the skin.  Returned the product.</li>
    <li> I have only one regret with this purchase; That I didn&#x27;t make it sooner! I tortured myself for years with an antique or perhaps antiquated Emjoi epilator. Ouch!  When it finally gave out, I did my research and bought this one. Let me tell you- this is NOT your mother&#x27;s epilator! This is fantastic! It&#x27;s much faster, gets the tiniest of hairs and the pain is much, much less! This model has a light to help get every hair and can even be used in the shower if you so choose. It&#x27;s top quality and looks good too! If you have never used an epilator, there will be some pain the first few times, (let&#x27;s be honest beauty isn&#x27;t pain free) but it diminishes with each use and it&#x27;s so worth it!  Hair removal every 4-6 weeks vs every day? That&#x27;s a &amp;#34;no brainer&amp;#34;! It&#x27;s less painful than waxing, definitely less messy and easy to do yourself, in the comfort of your own home! It doesn&#x27;t get better than that!&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with it! It works like a dream. My only regret is not buying it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;100% Satisfied and hair free. LOL</li>
    <li> Despite what some of the reviews says.. This thing hurts like a bitch  weather you&#x27;re in the shower or not.&lt;br /&gt;Not for the tender skinned.&lt;br /&gt;Also, would have to make several passes to get all the follicles.</li>
    <li> You definitely don&#x27;t need the exfoliater portion. And one of the other braun options doesn&#x27;t have this so its cheaper. Other than that, it works exactly as you would expect it to. You experience the amount of pain you would expect when you have hundreds of tiny hairs ripped out simultaneously. But you are rewarded with silky smooth skin (mixed in with a little bit of blood, sweat and tears).</li>
    <li> Hurt&#x27;s like heck but it works if you can stand it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. My daughter uses it and is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure but I feel this is just okay.  I&#x27;ve had this for several months and feel that it&#x27;s a bit slow.  I also don&#x27;t like the fact that you can only use it when it is unplugged.</li>
    <li> it  is very very good and useful thing, it removes hair  fast and the brush  is really effective . it  has good light and u can see hair better</li>
    <li> Extra heads not included as picture shows</li>
    <li> Epilator definitely works to tweeze hairs but the longer the hair the more painful the sensation.  Once you get started it&#x27;s easier to keep up with the growth.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and it was for a reasonable price. I recommend this brand over the others~</li>
    <li> This is a nice epilator, however it takes forever to remove all of the hair... then it stays smooth maybe a few days longer than shaving... all in all, when I have the time, I like to use. I end up shaving most of the time though. I also only used the exfoliator once. it was nice. Just time consuming</li>
    <li> Gives me lots of ingrown. I started waxing it&#x27;s much better</li>
    <li> good and worth  purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for all clients.</li>
    <li> NEVER EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product a year and two months ago. However, it doesn&#x27;t work now. I contacted to Braun. They told me that it has just one year guarantee and I have to pay for it&#x27;s repair. Never buy this product. It&#x27;s too expensive and just work for one year!!!! I had a philip epilator and worked with that for more than 5 years and still it works perfectly. I just wanted to have a new epilator. That&#x27;s why I did this big mistake and bought Braun epilator.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks big time. I originally bought the 30 dollar Phillips plug in epilator and it does a FAR better job than this piece of garbage. It is not worth the money. Half the time it cuts the hair and does not pull it out, the other half of the time it totally misses the hair. I would not recommend this product at all. I only wish I had not thrown away the box so I could possibly send it back. I thought by spending extra money and all the rave reviews I would get a better epilator than the Phillips one, boy was I wrong. Biggest waste ever.</li>
    <li> It hurt like hell, left &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; burn, and the hair was stubbly. I also tried this under my arms and my skin went nuts and broke out in a rash. I do have sensitive skin, so this product isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Was extremely pleased that I chose this epilator to purchase. Epilating has not been the perfect solution to hair removal I had hoped for, but if you&#x27;re going to buy an epilator, I highly recommend this one. I&#x27;ve found it very effective and it runs smoothly and quietly. A charge lasts about 40 minutes as stated. Does it remove hairs as small as a grain of sand as it claims? Some, but not all. I myself have issues with dead skin cells building up on my legs in some spots no matter how much I exfoliate. So hairs are visible, but no epilator or razor can get to them and my legs are never completely smooth. Not sure how many people have a similar issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want to try epilating or already do and are looking for a new one, try this one; not sure you could do better. If you are looking for a cheaper model, don&#x27;t waste your money on one that does not have a light or a pivoting head like this one. These two features are invaluable. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the ones that say they&#x27;re &amp;#34;curved like a woman&#x27;s body.&amp;#34; We also have a lot of straight parts!! The pivoting head on this one adapts to both. The exfoliating brush is also a great bonus. Hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> Best epilator I bought!  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Slight improvement to previous version, I have like Braun Epil products and have used them for years. Especially like the new light feature and the contour shape. Haven&#x27;t tried the face scrub brush yet.</li>
    <li> Ow. Ow ow ow. It sure does pull hair! I find the exfoliating brush doesn&#x27;t do too much for me, and I have very sensitive skin. After epilating, I get red bumps that last a full 24 hours at least. It stays smooth for a very long time and helps make shaving 10 times easier. It&#x27;s extremely painful on my armpits, but for some reason is worse on the left side than the right. I noticed my armpits bleed a little, probably because the skin is thinner there. The pain was worth it in the end (for the right side only, LOL) because it got rid of quite a bit of the grey cast I had for MONTHS. Hair grew back, but it was definitely more sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a girl who uses this on her pubic area. I can&#x27;t even do my bikini, ouch. I was only able to use this right on the boney, flat part of the pubic area haha. Very rough with my skin (but that could be the reason it worked so well for my armpits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it on my legs is fine! :) I avoid my knees because I have mild hemophilia and I do not want to bleed there. I&#x27;d rather be fuzzy.</li>
    <li> I would say the product did not meet my expectations.  It was to painful to use.</li>
    <li> it works, but not as well as expected. My 20$ cheep epilator works about 5x better than this.</li>
    <li> I recently started epilating and i am really impressed. Battery backup is really good and i have used it multiple times now and i am still not out of charge.</li>
    <li> The best epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. Thx</li>
    <li> I find it works better without the protector, it hurts me, but I don&#x27;t think I have a high pain tolerance. I don&#x27;t find that it works on stubble, I have to wait a few days after shaving to use this.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot. Much better than old model of Braun - picks very short hair, less pain. And polishing brush is amazing fixture!</li>
    <li> I have the Braun’s  2 in one face cleanser and epil. I love it! I got it from bzxagent.com and I would totally recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> brand new works well.</li>
    <li> I love it and I bought for my friend as a gift as well. She is thanking me everyday now! You can use it when you are taking a shower, before or after. It is up you because it is waterproof.  It is also fast and time efficient.</li>
    <li> It did not remove all of the hair. I was not the thing that I expected</li>
    <li> Great epilator, very easy to use and definitely less painful than the one I had purchased 5 years ago. For those not used to epilator, it does hurt a little bit (after all, you are pulling hair away from your skin) but it is more uncomfortable than really painful; using it under the shower helps to reduce the discomfort (and, as usual, stretch your skin). The results are definitely worth it: smooth skin for 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> This epilator works well and was everything I wanted. I did determine that after using epilation as a hair removal method I found that I preferred to use a shower scrub instead of the exfoliator it comes with. I would highly recommend purchasing this epilator.</li>
    <li> theres no mention about how painful it is and it doesnt exactly remove all hairs properly.&lt;br /&gt;it also drys out my skin</li>
    <li> After years of shaving, waxing and plucking I have finally found the solution to staying hair free without stubble, bruises or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of this type of product and assumed that it would be more like an electric shaver and really not be any different in terms of how long my legs would stay smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had tried one years ago. I have sensitive skin and hair regrowing after shaving was causing a great deal of irritation. Because my hair seemed to grow back in a day (maybe I&#x27;m part Wolfman) I was shaving every day and because of the blunt ends my skin was itchy and uncomfortable nearly all the time. Underarms were always carrying nicks from razors. Waxing was better because the regrowth didn&#x27;t cause itching. But it was time consuming, very messy and at times I actually bruised my skin by pulling the strips too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I used the Braun Epilator I felt this sense of relief that I had finally, finally, finally solved that issue! It does take a few passes to get some of the hairs but it is still less time consuming than waxing. And I have NO irritation afterward at all. Smooth skin that lasts. I do have to use the epilator 2-3 times a week to stay hair-free since hair grows at different rates. You can let all the hair grow out and then epilate to keep from having to repeat use, but I&#x27;m fine with using it multiple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do make sure to moisturize to reduce ingrown hairs as this can be a problem any time the hair is pulled from the roots (as in waxing). Immediately after epilating, I use a cream or oil specifically formulated for use after waxing to minimize any chaffing in the area and keep the skin soft. And I use Tend Skin a day after epilating as I did with waxing which works for me to keep ingrown hairs from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing is that I have already saved money by not having to buy more razor cartridges (very expensive for a good razor) or waxing supplies. And I&#x27;m not continually cleaning up wax spots in my bathroom or putting little pieces of tissue on bleeding nicks from razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is a great touch on this epilator. My eyesight isn&#x27;t what it once was so unless I have bright sunlight it is difficult to see where I may have missed hair. With the light, I can epilate at night with just the bathroom light because the light on the Braun shines directly in the area you are working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have been concerned in the past that this would be too painful to use on a regular basis, but after the bruising, chafing and irritation I was getting with waxing and shaving, it wasn&#x27;t a concern any longer. I shouldn&#x27;t have worried about it. I don&#x27;t consider this to be painful at all. It will probably be a little uncomfortable for someone who hasn&#x27;t waxed or epilated before, but the sensitivity should go away with use based on the information provided. And you need to be careful using this in areas where your skin is loose. The skin needs to be stretched taut as indicated in the directions for use or you can catch some skin in the epilator. I only had to do this once to remember because that did smart a little.  I have only used the exfoliator head once and it was almost too gentle, but is a nice option to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried this and you have similar problems with fast hair regrowth and irritation from shaving and waxing, I personally recommend this as a solution.upplies.

    <li> This is the first time I own an Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried to use one of those, many years ago, it was so painful that I figured Epilators were just not for me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried to use them again. I did a lot of research and ended up buying the Braun Silk Epil. I use it on my legs on a regular basis. No more shaving or waxing! And the skin feels really soft afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;As for the bikini line and under arms it is just too painful for me but I guess it varies from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;Still, really glad that I bought it!</li>
    <li> We got the product without one Sliver Epilator &amp; 2 Plastic caps.&lt;br /&gt;so didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife. She said it pulls the hair and makes the area sore. It might be easier if used after a shower. She says a razor is still her favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used previous generations pf Braun Silk Epil and they were working nicely. This one makes hair grow under skin like hell!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She loves not having to shave her legs everyday.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy as I have the older model (which I love and used for years), but I am very happily pleased, it IS better than my old one, it is much quicker and powerful and does remove hair better. I even like the little light which I thought would be gimmicky but actually its pretty helpful.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and as described.  I find it still leaves the small hairs, so I don&#x27;t think the estimation is quite correct, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Silk Epilator over the summer and it worked great for me! I enjoyed the smooth close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, not really a shave but a hair pull. It does cause some pain and discomfort, but the first run is the hardest. After that, less hair less pain, less often you have to use it to remove hair. It worked properly for about two months, then the internal charger stopped working, I would charge it for hours and the device would shave great for about a minute then die on me. I would let it die completely and charge it for only an hour and still the same, it would die within seconds. Did anyone else have this problem? I ended up returning it to Amazon and am awaiting a refund.</li>
    <li> I thank it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
    <li> I love this product! It hurts in sensitive areas, but I am so happy with the results afterwards</li>
    <li> The Epilator works perfectly.  The only dislike is the recharge connector does not stay on the epilator.  Need to find a stable place to make sure the connector cord remain on the epilator.</li>
    <li> I miss my old Braun silk. I had to take the top protector off to use this. It takes extra long to do any areas on my body. It&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
    <li> Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator Se7921spa does a good job of epilation, but what I really like about it is the exfoliation attachment.  The soft exfoliation brush works well, even on sensitive facial skin, provided that you add quite a bit of creamy soap or lotion to the brush and a splash of water to skin, before you begin.  The exfoliator attachment also works well to smooth rough skin areas, such as elbows and heels.  The wet/dry Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator Se7921spa is versatile, and can be used in the shower or out and the handy light allows for easy viewing of even fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a dual purpose epilator/exfoliator, look no further.</li>
    <li> I  like this product. this is my second one. it is giving the best results , plus its on a good price. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun epilators for years now.  I have tried different models and they have seen how much they&#x27;ve improved in the last 10 years.  For those who are new to epilators, I will encourage you to hang in there, you will get used to the little pinches and the rewards are worth the try and time spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This particular epilator comes with 2 heads.  The heads are interchangeable with other silk epil 7 series which is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to see this.  The regular epilator head works well on the legs and I have to use the slow speed on my underarms (fast speed would cause my pores to bleed a little).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the brush head worked best with some exfoliating scrub.  The fact that this model is cordless (like others in the 7 series) and can be used wet or dry, are some of the best features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the charging time, it definitely varies.  I let the epilator run out of battery completely to see how long it would take to charge.  It only took a couple of hours to fully charge.  Since I have used epilators (on and off) for years, the hair on my legs is pretty thin so, it doesn&#x27;t take more than 15 minutes of shaving especially with this new model.  I use epilators maybe once or twice a month so the battery lasts a while.  Heads up, you cannot use the epilator while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend any model of the 7 series depending on your budget.  Very effective, the best out there.  Maybe later, Braun can sell different head adaptors for the 7 series.  That would be cost effective and practical.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Braun Epilators and this new one, tops them all.  I was surprised that they could actually improve what they had, but the addition of the exfoliating brush is a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Less pain than other brands&lt;br /&gt;* Nice color&lt;br /&gt;* Can be used wet/dry&lt;br /&gt;* The light really makes a difference to see hairs&lt;br /&gt;* exfoliating brush makes your legs really smooth.  It can also be used for rough heals, elbows, or dry winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Epilating in general - Your hair grows back softer and with few hairs.  Over time, very little grows back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Not as gentle on underarms as other epilators I use&lt;br /&gt;* Epilating in general can take some time, along with the exfoliating after to prevent ingrown hairs. (but with epilating, once you do it on a regular basis, you don&#x27;t have to do it as often as shaving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Braun!  Another great epilator.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because this product is deff not for me, but may be ok for others. I have been shaving for the past 20 years and thought I would try this as a change of pace. I have really coarse ethnic hair so I was a little leary at first, but since I have several tattoos I figured I could tough it out. I read the instructions on the item very closely and followed them exactly. Even so: This was hands down one of the most painful things I&#x27;ve had to endure. Even on the highest setting it was unable to get much of my hair and it was terrible feeling the epilator struggling to pull the same hairs out over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: This is not for everyone!! If you have really strong, coarse hair stay away! Laser treatments were way less painful for me.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt like most epilators. It holds a charge for a very long time as well.</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before and thought this offer would be a good way to try it. I have fine hair and a high pain threshold (not just my opinion; docs have said the same). I understand what the product is supposed to do and this epilator does an okay job. The hair removal where I tried it was moderate. It looks smooth but it doesn&#x27;t feel smooth. In another area, the sensation was like tiny shocks, to the point where I had to stop the attempt. In another spot the discomfort of the epilation itself wasn&#x27;t enough to stop but afterward it felt a bit like a brushburn for some time (over an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that the product is a quality epilator. It&#x27;s well constructed, sleek, non-slip, and simple to use. The only complaint about the device itself is that the charge cord tends to slip out more easily than I&#x27;d expect. Luckily the charge is fast and lasts a long time. The instructions are also very simple; it would be difficult to use it incorrectly. My favorite feature is the light, which allows a quick use during a commercial break any time of day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue trying the product, as it probably takes a while to get used to the idea and sensation. I would like to give 2 stars because my honest opinion is \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it.\\&quot; (see ETA below). However I&#x27;m rating three stars as my reaction to the product is more about myself than the product and what it does. I&#x27;m also taking into account my opinion of the device itself. My advice is that if you&#x27;re interested in epilators and are new to them, you might want to try (if you can) before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: Used this again in a new spot days ago and still have visible skin irritation (to the point where people ask me what happened). Will not be using again and am knocking my review down to two stars as it&#x27;s shown consistent poor results (hair removal was spotty). It actually damaged my skin this time and a simple hair remover should not do that IMO. I have no issues with hair removal and have everything from tweezing to to waxing to electrolysis and never had this happen. Once or twice, maybe a fluke due to where I used it. Now I know it&#x27;s the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also neglected to mention the spa brush attachment. It was so underwhelming, I forgot.</li>
    <li> While this does pull out the hair...im left unsure whether it plucks or cuts the hair... most times i have to go over the same area 3 times to ensure all the hair is removed. I cannot guarantee it plucks the hair like it is suppsed to. If it lasts for 3 years only then will i consider it an investment.</li>
    <li> ouch..... but it definitely works!! Not so sure about it removing hair as short at 0.5mm though..... didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> No words to describe the awesomeness of this product. To all women and men who were involved in the process of constructing this machine you are awesome! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was also quick and all set.</li>
    <li> It is one of the better epilators I have used, and I highly recommend buying from Amazon, and purchasing a warranty as well. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> This works better than my cheaper epilator and it&#x27;s nice to have something I can use in the shower. It&#x27;s slightly more effective than the one that I had before because it gets better angles. I find it much easier to get around to using it on my legs when I can just do it in a long shower on a Sunday! The light is helpful for looking back over for missed hairs, especially if your shower is dark. It&#x27;s not perfect on my underarms when wet - works fairly well when dry, though! Overall, very solid epilator. I haven&#x27;t used the exfoliator attachment at all yet so not sure if I should have spent more to get that but it does what it needs to do pretty well.</li>
    <li> Ok, yes it hurts, but they warn you it does. still cant get past my knees going up my leg but thats ok i&#x27;ll get there. After 1 use hair showed a drastic decrease in growth i was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush i had such huge problem with ingrowns and every blade i&#x27;ve ever tried chews up my sensitive skin, so this is probably my favorite part of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than 8 months and it no longer works. I&#x27;ve used epilators for many years and all the others have lasted over 10 years. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I love that this is cordless! Holds a charge for probably an hour of constant running. The brush is ok, seems like an extra add on. Wish they would&#x27;ve added on a interchangeable razor head like other Brauns!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 10 years, and Braun is the best!</li>
    <li> I wish I bought this years ago!  I hate shaving but I hate stubble more.  I was shaving every. single. day.  Decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  The pain is minor, though I do recommend doing sensitive areas underwater.  I use maybe once a week and do nothing in between!  Afterwards, some Bliss body butter and I&#x27;m smooth and silky.  The only negative I have is that the brush doesn&#x27;t seem effective at exfoliation.  If you want to save a few $, buy the one without.  Otherwise, I love it!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about this purchase only because I have high expectations and did not want to be disappointed. Well, I am not! :) This product is fantastic, even comes with a built-in light. It does exactly what it says it will do. I have used it both in and out of the shower and using it in the shower definitely makes it less painful. I highly reccomend this product. One last note, I am a long time user of epilators and I read on a previous review that the user had removed the guide/safety cover on the unit and was able to achieve a closer and smoother result. This is absolutely true, however I will only reccomend this to experienced users. Lastly, please remember to pull the skin for better results.</li>
    <li> Love it, very good quality product, you can really go wrong with Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a relative and though I&#x27;ve not used it, she&#x27;s told me that you can&#x27;t better than this. However her only complaint was it looks smaller in person than it does online. One of the pros is the handle. It&#x27;s an absolutely amazing hold and the brush really feels good on skin. Her only problem with it was that it didn&#x27;t pull out the tiniest of hairs like the epilator claims to do.</li>
    <li> The best epilator ever!</li>
    <li> I have the Braun 7181 model and am a huge fan of exfoliation. If you&#x27;re new, please know that it hurts the most in the beginning but does get better with each epilation. The battery lasts a little over 45 min. and charges quickly. It has the same light like in previous model and is really helpful to see the tiny hairs. The hair growth does lessen over time and the skin fells really smooth as long as you take care of the ingrown hair. That said, my big complaint with the previous model were the ingrown hairs even after scrubbing. The  exfoliating brush for that purpose is certainly a nice touch albeit an expensive one. I took away a star because I felt that they should include more epilation heads like the previous model or keep this at a lower price point. If you have the previous model, it certainly isn&#x27;t worth the upgrade just for the brush. However, if its time for an upgrade, get this and you can use the old epilators heads with this.</li>
    <li> This is my third Epilator, and my favorite one yet.  I HATE shaving, and I can&#x27;t get laser removal done because my hair is blonde and fine (there is just a lot).  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s time that is making them better; but, this takes the hair off so well that I have to go back over and get what I missed.  The first time is a little painful; but, once that first run is done, and you keep up with it (once or twice a week) you will be very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> this is my first epilator. and it really hurts. now i only can use it for my legs. i am getting all small red dots on my arms after applying this epilator. however i love the brush attached.</li>
    <li> I love this Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator!  It made my wife&#x27;s legs so smooth!  Yes, my wife let me epilate her legs.  I started by reading the directions, which were very easy to follow.  Charging it up took one hour and I knew it was fully charged because the charging light shone a steady green.  First, I exfoliated her legs. She sat on a stool and stretching her legs out rested her feet on the counter.  I attached the exfoliation brush and set it to sensitive skin and gently ran the brush over her legs.  She said it actually felt very nice.  I recharged the epilator after the exfoliating and cleaned the brush in water.  Then, per the directions, we waited a day before I epilated her legs.  I attached the epilator head and with her legs stretched out and feet balanced on the counter I turned the epilator to sensitive skin and began.  This epilator even has a little headlight!  The epilator head even pivots!  Then, slowly and steadily, I ran the epilator over her legs.  She said it didn&#x27;t hurt.  This epilator is very thorough and removes the hair fast!  I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area, it removed the hairs the first time.  It left the skin very smooth!  She loves it and so do I!  Who knows, I may let her run it next time.  This epilator is very easy to use and clean, and it charges up fast!  I highly recommend the Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator!</li>
    <li> I ordered this epilator for my wife, and she has had an opportunity to use it a few times.  Here is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A while ago, I began using a less-expensive epilator.  I was not very happy with the results.  Then I began using the Braun Silk Epil.  In short, this one is amazing.  It gets the short hairs, and is very convenient and comfortable to use.  It is just as effective as waxing, but with less pain.  There is some pain, of course, because that is unavoidable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun has a rechargeable battery, instead of a power cord, which makes it much easier to use.  And it&#x27;s great that the Braun can be used in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are clear and easy to understand, and the unit easily opens for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend the Braun Silk Epil for anyone who needs to use an epilator.</li>
    <li> i introduce this to a lot of friends</li>
    <li> The rating isn&#x27;t 5 stars because the battery won&#x27;t last more than 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;I would hope they improve this aspect.</li>
    <li> let me preface this by saying that i love epilators, and that my previos braun (a 100 series) served me well for over four years. when i decided it was time to replace it, i bought this epilator, which was everything i was looking for: cordless, rechargeable, wet/dry, interchangeable heads and sturdily built. imagine my surprise when, after a month and a half of use (and just outside of amazon&#x27;s return policy) the charger cord completely failed and now refuses to give my epilator any juice at all – which is exactly why i needed to replace my older epilator in the first place! i now have to purchase an expensive replacement part if i want to keep up my epilating, which i am not sure i will even do because, hey, if it breaks again that&#x27;s another chunk of cash i&#x27;m out of. i am frustrated and disappointed with the manufacturing quality i&#x27;ve received here. thanks for nothing, braun.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun Silk Epil for many many years. My old one that is still working is nearly 13 years old. I decided to buy a new one for my daughter. She is extremely happy as how painless and efficient this product is. This is a very reliable brand and will recommend it without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator for years and really enjoy using it.  It keeps the hair away much longer than shaving and makes life more carefree because you don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving everyday.  The epilator might pinch at first but you will get use to it quickly.  It is well worth the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator works really well on both your legs and under your arms.  The light helps guide you to the hair you haven&#x27;t removed.  I also like that this epilator is cordless.  I have never had a epilator that I could use in the shower and I love the convenience.  I would recommend if this is your first time using an epilator to use it in the shower first.  I have used it both ways and think they are great.  Use it whichever way you like best.  I like that this machine gives you that option. Because it&#x27;s cordless, you can use it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating feature is great, too. I have had a face exfoliater, but not one for the body and I love it. It&#x27;s perfect to use just before moisturizing.  I really think this helps with dry skin and also makes your skin feel smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who hates to shave but still wants good looking, smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I like it. Just found that the exfoliating head is not very effective as it did not seem to help with most of my ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> So painful. I returned it!</li>
    <li> I love that Braun Silk Epil Epilator.  I used it so far for legs only. I used to use waxing and shaving, after using this Braun Epilator I would not return to anything else. Using it was easy, fast, and actually hardly painful, just make sure you are pulling your skin a little bit, so it is easier for Epilator to contact with hair and do its job. I would certainly recommend that product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a month now and am new to epilation.  I love the light!  It really is a must have.  My legs are becoming more used to this process and it is true that it doesn&#x27;t hurt near as much.  I also ordered Burt&#x27;s Bees powder to make the hair stand up more prior to epilation.  I usually do it dry unless I happen to be in the shower which I don&#x27;t think the results are as good.  Then afterwards I use Rosemary tonic water with aloe to reduce the bumps.  My legs are getting more and more smooth.  At first I would notice many bumps and they are becoming less with a much smoother result.  My hair is very curly and therefore coarse.  So happy with the results as shaving grows back by evening time if I shave in the morning.  I still shave if I&#x27;m in a hurry but I like the choice!</li>
    <li> Meets and exceedes expectations! Easy to use/clean/store. The two speed settings allow for gentler or efficient hair removal. The first use hurts plenty (of course), but if you maintain regularly it&#x27;s incredibly mild. The exfoliating body brush makes it easy to keep ingrown hairs at bay. The light allows easy sighting of missed hairs and which direction they&#x27;re going. Can be used with or without the guard (be careful either way though). Is waterproof, which makes it easier to groom more sensitive areas (like underarms, YOUCH). Charge lasts a long time, but device will not turn on when plugged in which I assume is a safety feature of sorts. Great great great product! Did I mention it even looks nice? I didn&#x27;t know the handle had sparkles in the grip, very cute touch.</li>
    <li> This is the best epilator I&#x27;ve owned so far. It does a fantastic job on short hairs, and the light is very helpful in spotting tiny hairs to be removed. I also like the brush attachment which works well in the shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for those who just start an adventure with epilation, cause you can use it in water which makes the treatment less painful. However, I noticed that using it under the water isn&#x27;t as effective as on dry skin (it doesn&#x27;t remove short hair). Other than that it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> I find this epilator very good when it comes to the epilating head...takes very small hairs out in no time, but it is not worth paying the extra price for the brush...the brush is soft, it doesn&#x27;t rotate, just vibrates with a lot of noize, even if you use it under water you need to add some scrubbing lotions, otherwise it does nothing. You have to put presure on the brush to be able to feel any scrubing efect. I don&#x27;t like this additional gadget..I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have paid the extra money. Scrubing with a special glove and a good scrubing lotion far exeeds to effort you have to make when using this option with brown. Plus my hand hurts for the vibrations...but as I said let&#x27;s end up on a positive note...the epilator is fantastic...I have other 2 models from Braun which lasted more than 5 years each and I could still use them if I want...I am just snoby and want to update my collection ! :)</li>
    <li> the only downside is it can&#x27;t be used when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> Great! Warning: Do not put this near your crotch, that is all.</li>
    <li> Not very strong but still pulls hair. Good for beginners who may not be able to handle the pain of stronger epilators. Does become a little stronger on the second setting. Easy to clean. Has a light attached. Waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has little effect on preventing/getting rid of ingrown hairs, but does do a nice cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Does it hurt the first time or two? Yes. But after that, the pain is minimal to almost non existent. If you&#x27;ve ever been waxed before, this is not as painful. Keep in mind that what makes it so painful the first time or two is the concentration of hairs in a given area. Once that is thinned out (after the first or second use), the next time you use the epilator, you will experience less pain because there are less hairs to pluck. It is definitely worth the money and it pays for itself in just 2 to 3 months. I&#x27;ll never get waxed again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had used  previous models of Braun Silk Epil epilator and always was happy with the quality of the product and end result.&lt;br /&gt;The only weakness of this model is that you can not use it when it&#x27;s plugged in. Some times I had to interrupt an epilation while SIlk Epil would recharge. Maybe it&#x27;s earlier and cheaper models make the process a bit longer but there isn&#x27;t any drastic reasons to spend more money on this particular one.  Still, I think Braun is the best epilator on the market.</li>
    <li> Awesome product...it really works.</li>
    <li> After seeing the good reviews, I had high expectations for the product. However, I will now agree with all the other negative reviews and say that it is disappointing and isn&#x27;t worth 100 bucks. The only feature that makes it different from the other epilators is the exfoliation brush. As an epilator, it is very tedious and requires you to go over the same area multiple times to get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning the product and looking for another epilator that does a better job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to like these on any level.  Who likes the idea of ripping their hair out by the roots...ever!  But this is one of the most comfortable I&#x27;ve used.  And I haven&#x27;t picked up a razor in 15 years.  The only thing I done like, and this is consistent with all brands and models I&#x27;ve tried, is that they seem to become less effective after several uses.  If you catch skin the even sooner.  This one is no different.  However, my husband loves me using the brush attachment to massage his face and head.  Epilation and dermabrasion all in one tool!  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair so I&#x27;m highly prone to ingrown hairs. Additionally, I have very sensitive skin. Shaving would leave my legs covered in red bumps the first day and I can&#x27;t even imagine shaving again within the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried waxing my own legs and armpit, but it&#x27;s just hard to do your own armpits and I find waxing to be expensive and time consuming for legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went searching for other options. I decided to try an epilator. I started with my armpit (that may have not been the smartest thing) and it was pure torture. However, when I finally finished I was shocked by how smooth my armpit was. And there was no shadow! It looked so good and has lasted a lot longer than shaving, without the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I did my legs, which didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Once again smooth legs without the irritation. I&#x27;m totally sold on epilators. So a quick comment on this one. To be honest the exfoliator head doesn&#x27;t feel like it helps much and just irritates my skin. I would probably go with the other Braun epilator with the different heads for different parts of your body over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, this one is easy to clean and gets hairs that are shorter than 1/4&amp;#34; (though not too terribly much shorter). The battery really does last at least and hour and the light on it is very helpful. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Its fast to use this and clean this. Yes its a bit more painful then wax but good in case of urgency</li>
    <li> Works ok but I must admit seeing it drop fifty dollars immediately after I purchased it really upsets me! Are the sellers trying to upset their customers or what?</li>
    <li> I have been epilating me legs for a very long time &amp; have tried several different epilators over the years. I owned one of the earlier Silk Epil models before &amp; was very happy with it. Since I purchased that one in Europe I was unable to use it in the US which resulted in me purchasing a Remington epilator which I have been using for about two years now. I was never really happy with it, so when it started to give out on me I decided it was time to purchase a new one. I used the Braun Silk Epil the day it arrived &amp; I was very pleased with it. The massage rollers really do make a difference; even though I think I don&#x27;t feel the pain as much anymore, since I have been epilating for years now. I know some people gave this product bad reviews due to the pain, but regardless of which epilator you&#x27;ll use; it is going to hurt at first. Personally, I am really impressed with the performance of this particular Braun epilator. My legs stay smooth for about two weeks &amp; it gets a lot of the shorter hairs as well. I also used to have problems with ingrown hairs (while using my Remington epilator) &amp; it has gotten so much better since I started using the new one. I also like that it&#x27;s cordless &amp; the charging time is reasonable (it usually charges within an hour) &amp; I can get both of my legs done without having to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase it again &amp; recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome epilator! I love it! The best one I&#x27;ve used period. Great in the shower. It works!</li>
    <li> i got it one week ago , i bought it for my mom and she really likes it .. i&#x27;m happy too !</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this device because of the cost (~$110 8/14) &amp; had been using a battery operated smaller Emjoi for years. In comparison the Braun covers larger area, is stronger much more effective and takes less time.   I seldom use the spa head, and have found using the unit in the shower or tub makes hair removal more difficult. Probably because hair slippery from water/soap makes grasp of hair more difficult. I also remove the &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; head but have to be carful of pinching skin. Holding skin taught in certain areas where it&#x27;s lose prevents pinching.   Since purchase, I was prescribed Prednisone which has caused even more unwanted hair growth especially on my face and under the chin. This unit has been immensely Helpful and well worth the cost.   Each charge lasts ~15-20 minutes. Although the directions say to plug directly into an outlet, I&#x27;ve been plugged into a surge protector and all is well.   I Love My Braun!!!</li>
    <li> I thought I would use it instead of going to expensive laser hair removal salon , but NO !!!! Very dissappointed in this product&#x27;s promises .... Does not grabs every hair and leaves irritation even my skin is strong and could be tolerant to this procedure . Very painful and uncomfortable !!!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money !&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is the most savvy and old school !</li>
    <li> This version of Braun&#x27;s Silk Epil epilator leaves no hair behind no matter how short or fine.  I like every unwanted hair gone and this epilator makes that happen.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Some quick thoughts on this model specifically:&lt;br /&gt;* Removes smaller hairs (0.5mm) than older models, so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back&lt;br /&gt;* The \\&quot;massagers\\&quot; on the epilation head really do help&lt;br /&gt;* You can use it dry or completely-wet, but not damp (e.g., right after the shower won&#x27;t work)... and I must say that using it under running water dramatically reduces any discomfort, although it&#x27;s a bit harder to notice stray hairs&lt;br /&gt;* You can&#x27;t use it while plugged in (that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower!) but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge, you&#x27;ll have to toss the unit)&lt;br /&gt;* I wish this included a trimming head like other models, for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack (they have to be 7 mm or shorter before this will really pull them out)&lt;br /&gt;* This doesn&#x27;t include an attachment for facial hair like some do (which is OK)... just make sure that your epilator is clean if you&#x27;re going to use it on your face, because otherwise it will make you break out&lt;br /&gt;* The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed&lt;br /&gt;* The exfoliating brush is a nice touch, because epilating frequently leads to ingrown hairs. It says to use it a day or two before epilating, and it&#x27;s super-gentle... almost feels like it&#x27;s not doing anything, but I found it&#x27;s more effective and more comfortable (if more slow) than just using a loofah. The \\&quot;wait 2 days\\&quot; advice is good because otherwise your skin gets sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And some thoughts on epilation in general:&lt;br /&gt;* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again (assuming you do it at least once every 3 months!), the subsequent touch-ups really aren&#x27;t bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so. Face is also quite sensitive, though that probably varies by person, depending on how much tweezing you normally do.)&lt;br /&gt;* The first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you&#x27;ll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back but are still too small to get. It&#x27;s less of an issue with this epilator than others, and the hairs aren&#x27;t really visible. So if you think someone&#x27;s going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don&#x27;t bother doing anything for a month or so, you&#x27;ll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;* Remember that the exfoliation is important to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don&#x27;t turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you&#x27;ll have to do that anyway. And this unit&#x27;s exfoliator is more gentle than a loofah&lt;br /&gt;* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they&#x27;ll banish them but don&#x27;t? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)  This also helps with bikini-area bumps, but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade, so it&#x27;s fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time</li>
    <li> My wife has used a number of Braun Epilators over the years.  Her most recent one was a Braun Series 7- 7181 [[ASIN:B0077PLNB6 Braun Series 7-7181 Silk Epil Wet &amp; Dry Epilator 1 Count]] that proved to be a 5 star product.  This Braun Se7921 is identical to the 7181 except that it comes with a brush head attachment for exfoliation.  The price is about $20-30 dollars more than the 7181.  So is the extra cost worth it?  While the brush attachment does leave the skin on her legs looking more smooth, it really does not seem to be worth the price premium.  The Se7921 is an excellent epilator that is worthy of 5 stars but the extra price for the Brush attachment brings this down to 4 stars.  Save the money and get the 7181 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Positive Points: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent Epilator that is worthy of 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;- The 40 tweezer system and sonic massage really do lead to less painful epilation&lt;br /&gt;- Built in light is a great additional&lt;br /&gt;- Battery lasts a very long time between charges&lt;br /&gt;- True Wet/Dry system&lt;br /&gt;- Fast recharge time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Negative Points: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliation brush is not worth the $20-30 premium over the 7181 model&lt;br /&gt;- Epilation truly is more painful than shaving (though some say less than waxing)</li>
    <li> Pros:  Nifty brush attachment&lt;br /&gt;  Silk Epil 7 is a great epilator even without accessories&lt;br /&gt;  Brush attachment feels fantastic on tired feet&lt;br /&gt;  If you are prone to ingrown hairs, this might help exfoliate to keep them at bay.  YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;  Silk Epil 7 has a light to show you what you missed. Apparently, with my non-lit epilator, I was missing so much that I&#x27;m a bit embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;  Cordless (once charged) for your hair removal wanderlust.&lt;br /&gt;  Massaging rollers on the epilator head really do make it less uncomfortable (they seem to distract nerves just a little)&lt;br /&gt;  My hair grows in much finer and lighter in color. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Brush is only for the body NOT FOR USE ON THE FACE!&lt;br /&gt;  Brush is not friendly to my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;  Brush pops off too easily during use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice:  If you don&#x27;t have a Clarisonic brush (with the body brush head), you might like a motorized shower brush.  If you really don&#x27;t care about the brush, you might want to take a look at the other Silk Epil 7 packages out there.  Some of them have more or less accessories, and different price points that may be more or less appealing than this Spa package, some have facial hair attachments and some have an electric razor head/accessory.  It&#x27;s up to you.  I do recommend the Silk Epil 7 though, but Braun offers enough of a variety of packages that include the Silk Epil 7 that you can get exactly what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lengthier review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Spa\\&quot; Attachment:&lt;br /&gt;This is not my first epilator.  In fact, this is my second Braun Silk Epil 7 Epilator.  My previous one was not part of a \\&quot;SPA\\&quot; package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore the Silk Epil 7.  I used this model before I got the Spa set:  [[ASIN:B0077PLNB6 Braun Series 7-7181 Silk Epil Wet &amp; Dry Epilator 1 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love the epilator portion and think that the little \\&quot;headlight\\&quot; and the bumpy rollers make things more efficient and less uncomfortable (uncomfortable if you have previously epilated or painful if you are a newbie to mechanically ripping the hair out of your legs).  The Silk Epil 7 handle is comfortable to hold, it is wet/dry, though I do not like wet epilation (it just doesn&#x27;t do as thorough a job, for me as doing it dry).  I have tried other models from Braun and this one: [[ASIN:B004KMIZK6 Emjoi Optima Corded Epilator]] and at first I thought the Emjoi was the cat&#x27;s pajamas, but the Silk Epil 7 (and even the 5) is far superior in regards to features, discomfort, and efficiency.  I have not even looked at the Emjoi since making the move to the Braun hair rippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the brush/spa attachment:&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; brush head dresses up the body of the Silk Epil 7 so it sort of looks like one of those Clarisonic type brushes.  At first I was excited that this would replace my Clarisonic and be a space saving and effort saving 2-in-1 extravaganza.  Such is not the case.  The brush head/attachment for the Silk Epil 7 is strictly for body only and NOT FOR THE FACE.  The brush head is good for regular body brushing/exfoliating to help prevent ingrown hairs (something I have never had a problem with since I started using an epilator, but many people do have that problem and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure).  I wanted to use it all over, not just where I used the epilator, and it feels fairly strong and abrasive compared to the more gentle (and quiet!) sounds of my Clarisonic with body brush head.  I came out of the shower and was bright pink.  My sensitive skin does ok with the Clarisonic, and fine with an exfoliating washcloth but the Silk Epil brush left me bright pink and feeling like I spent the day at the beach.  It did, though, make my feet look quite smooth and the sonic vibration and brush were strong enough that my tired feet did feel pampered, though my legs looked about the same.  Perhaps other users find the brush more helpful if they use their Silk Epil 7 in the shower.  I prefer to epilate dry skin/dryhair, so the only reason I would take it in the shower is to exfoliate the rest of my body, rather than as an adjunct to exfoliation.  The brush assembly/attachment was not that friendly as far as being able to angle the whole device to exfoliate my back and the head kept popping off, which was rather annoying and made me think that it is meant more for just the legs (and if just for the legs it seems almost excessive, but some may benefit from the sonic brushing to prevent ingrown hairs- potentially...).hair, so the only reason I would take it in the shower is to exfoliate the rest of my body, rather than as an adjunct to exfoliation.

    <li> I am new to using an epilator but have used products such as Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover. It is unavoidable to be pain-free when removing body hairs. Once you are used to the little pricks, you will become immune to this prickly pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product when I am in the shower (wet) and out of the shower (dry). It is able to remove the intended body hairs in various parts of the body. I like the contour of the handle grip as well as it feels comfortable holding in my hand. To a new user, I will recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/29/2013:&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual does not state the electrical specifications. The white power plug has this listed \\&quot;Input 100-240Vac 50/60Hz  Output : 12Vdc\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have used Braun epilators for more than a decade. They are only slightly uncomfortable when I haven&#x27;t used one in a while and have a lot of stubble (weeks worth). I never realized that they work better on shorter hair, as the instructions for this model say, and indeed, they do. No saving up for one go. Not necessary to, anyway, since this is cordless, so I can just grab it for touch ups easily! I use the wipes that Amazon sells to go with it, and they seem to help, and follow with Paula&#x27;s Choice post shaving solution or Tend Skin to avoid ingrown hairs. I still get a few though, but this sure beats shaving nearly daily, or shelling out for a wax job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model is not only cordless, but has a nice large, flexible head that seems to be more effective than the previous models that looked like my dad&#x27;s old electric razor. The brush head cannot be used on your face, so I&#x27;ll keep my Clarisonic, but it did really polish up my legs, not visibly at first, but I noticed they didn&#x27;t feel dry and flaky later in the day, and the self-tanner looked really good the next day and lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product!</li>
    <li> Alittle painful and intimidating for the first couple uses not as much as waxing though. I completely recommend I love it and use it regularly now. Its cheaper then regular waxing or laser treatment</li>
    <li> good but still trying to get used to operating it. seems to be cutting the hair. different than the old version I had.</li>
    <li> Works well and fills sturdy</li>
    <li> It is very good, my wife uses it every time. It works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, she couldn&#x27;t use for underarms.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for the wife and she really likes it.  Tried one out of a trinket magazine and 1) it didn&#x27;t  work nearly as well and 2) fell apart quickly.  She really likes this one and shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> It needed more information in the description of the product, you assume that it includes more stuff, like it doesn&#x27;t have razer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to epilation (a couple of months in).  I tried an inexpensive, corded Remington, and after the initial painfest, decided I like this method of hair removal.  I was afraid of getting ingrown hairs, though, so the exfoliating brush on this Braun was appealing to me, as was its promise of removing hairs as short as .5 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly realized that the exfoliating brush is a joke.  They say it will \\&quot;exfoliate your skin 4X more effectively than manually scrubbing,\\&quot; which I imagined as being the mechanically spinning brush versus a typical manual exfoliation technique, such as scrubbing yourself with a loofah.  No, now I&#x27;m pretty sure they mean that this is four times as effective when it&#x27;s turned on as it would be if you just manually scrubbed the brush around without power.  So that&#x27;s not really saying much.  The bristles are very soft (I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use this on my face, not that it would be of any benefit), and even with holding the running appliance in the same spot for a long time, I couldn&#x27;t tell that it had done anything.  Afterwards, my skin felt no different.  It still felt bumpy from ingrown hairs.  I tried the brush wet, dry, with shower gel...it made no difference.  Then I put on my dollar-store shower gloves and gave my legs a brisk rubdown...problem solved.  The bristles, by the way, do NOT spin or rotate, nor does the head.  The whole thing just kind of shimmies.  It turns out that there is NO spinning action whatsoever.  So I pronounce the brush on this thing as a worthless gimic that drives up the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did find that this Braun removed shorter hairs than the Remington.  And because it is cordless, it was more convenient to use.  The battery holds a long charge (it never ran down on me), and now, using this Braun in conjunction with my shower gloves, I&#x27;m very pleased with the smoothness of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer suggested, I took off the pivoting head.  The \\&quot;massage\\&quot; function is also a joke(it makes absolutely no difference in the perception of pain), and the rollers on the head rattle disconcertingly (makes it sound like my father&#x27;s gas-powered lawn edger), and they interfere with the smooth movement of the device over your skin (you have to fight against the rollers, which make the device want to move in only one direction).  Removing the head also allowed me to remove much shorter hairs.  I was terrified at first, afraid it would allow the tweezers to pinch me, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem at all.  Well, not until I tried epilating my upper inner thighs, where yo-yo dieting and age have left the skin less than taut.  Yeouch!  When doing areas with looser skin, put the head back on!  And don&#x27;t forget to stretch that skin tight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to epilating, you may find the experience so painful that you wonder if it&#x27;s just from tweezing or if your skin is being pinched.  Trust me, you will KNOW.  Pinched skin will develop tiny little pinprick red spots (and may actually bleed).  Painfully epilated (but unpinched) skin might have a diffuse redness, but no pinpricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I&#x27;m surprised by how short of hairs this thing can get without pinching the skin.  I&#x27;m impressed with that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the wet/dry functionality to not be very helpful.  This thing just works better dry, plain and simple, and epilating wet (or submerged) was no less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the \\&quot;smartlight\\&quot; is kind of silly.  There is nothing \\&quot;smart\\&quot; about it.  It&#x27;s just a light.  But calling it \\&quot;smart\\&quot; makes it sound high-tech and worthy of a higher price.  I don&#x27;t think I really need it, but every now it illuminates some hairs I didn&#x27;t realize were there, so I guess it&#x27;s a feature worth having (but not overly so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this Braun was not worth its premium price, because the cost-inflating features just aren&#x27;t worth it.  I would recommend one of the cheaper Brauns that still feature the \\&quot;close-grip technology,\\&quot; perhaps something like the [[ASIN:B0077PLO60 Braun 5-5280 ]], which is currently about $30 less than I paid for this model, yet also has attachments you might actually find useful, such as a shaver and a trimmer cap.  You could do much worse than this Braun, and I must admit I&#x27;m very pleased with the end results, but I think most people choose this specific model for the exfoliating brush, which I found to be a mistake.</li>
    <li> Very good item&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using this for 3 weeks. She likes to use it under the shower. She said that it doesn&#x27;t really hurt. I  think it does a great job at pulling hair and if you do it regularly it does not hurt. We use it once a week. The battery stay charged for a long time. We used to wax. This is easy and is saving us a lot of money as waxing is really expensive. We pretty much are getting the same result as waxing.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed; because of lack of the separate head for bikini line epilation.</li>
    <li> I super like the light which allows you to be more efficient. It doesnot hurt that much :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any signifcant diffrence between speed I and speed II, but overall it seems ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that I need to recharge it for an hour in order to be able to use it for 40 minutes. Also, I cannot use it while charging.</li>
    <li> Still have to pluck, on face area, might work legs but I got for my face and it&#x27;s not working</li>
    <li> Being new to epilators I bought one and was underwhelmed, so I thought I&#x27;d try a few more and see if I could get any improvement. Enter the Braun Silk Epi, which is very highly rated so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. At first I thought it was amazing, less pain than the first one I tried, but I noticed the fine hairs weren&#x27;t actually being plucked, they were just shorter. Great, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m going for here. Not to mention the fact that there&#x27;s only the epilator head, and the brush head. There aren&#x27;t even any guards to make the epilator head smaller if I wanted to pluck less hairs at once, even thought the pictures CLEARLY show that there are guards for this epilator. I went over the same sections over and over again, and frequently nothing seemed to happen. I adjusted the pressure I was using, the speed, everything. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just breaking hairs off as opposed to actually doing anything. I also couldn&#x27;t find any of the hairs that it was supposedly plucking. With my other epilator I would frequently stop and clean it out because the roots were getting stuck to the guard because hair roots are sticky (for lack of a better word), with this one there was never any evidence of plucked hairs sticking, which leads me to believe it was only ever breaking the hair off as opposed to pulling it out by the root. The brush is nice, ergo the second star, but if you want the brush you might as well just pick up a separate brush and a different epilator. Oh, and forget about trying to epilate your arm pits, I tried every direction and went over the areas over, and over to little effect. I finally went back over the areas with my old epilator.</li>
    <li> It cannot get rid of all the hair roots and will leave some inside. Just so so</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before purchasing this product and eventually decided to try it. The first time you epilate, keep in mind that (1) your skin should be pulled taut, and (2) the pain you feel will be the worst of it. I liken the feeling to getting a tattoo. Subsequent touch-ups on growing hair hurts much less and less. This is a combination of having fewer hairs to remove and developing a tolerance for the epilation process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One key note: Monitor the price of this item. Over the few months during which I was considering my purchase, I noticed Amazon list this product for $75 to $105. If you&#x27;re not in a rush to buy, keep it in your cart for a while to benefit from price fluctuations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie...it hurts like hell the first time you use it! The pain lessens after the first use and it helps that the hair growth is not as bad the second time around. Definitely exfoliate and make sure the hair is shorter the first time you use it (that helps a lot!) Use a good lotion as well, I like GiGi Slow Growth. I&#x27;ve only had mine a week but it&#x27;s amazing how smooth my legs are, (I used to shave every other day due to stubble.) Get through the pain and you&#x27;ll get the results!</li>
    <li> The epilator is very good but the exfoliate part our brush is not good! Waste of money</li>
    <li> I have used for facial hair and on my legs.  Results are better than I expected ! Would definitely recommend .</li>
    <li> this little handy device changed my life! All kidding aside, when a girl has hairy legs, it can consume lots of time, money , run havoc on self confidence and inflict lots of pain, all in order to keep them smooth. I never was able to achieve smooth and silky effect with shaving or waxing, until this little device came along. I love it. One word of advice: have your legs waxed one last time before using this for the first time. It helped a lot with the pain factor, and now after several months of using it, I don&#x27;t feel any pain (just a tingling sensation) at all.</li>
    <li> I wish I read everything before i bought it&lt;br /&gt;It only has 2 options one for normal use one for cleansing the skin. But it works perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;Like any other braun</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator of one brand or another for over 10 years and I&#x27;ve never had one with the power this one has.  I use it on the lower setting but there&#x27;s really not much difference between the two speeds.  It works great on flatter areas like shins or thighs but I have to be VERY careful and hold my skin taut under my arms and in my bikini area.  The first time I used it I &amp;#34;pinched&amp;#34; my skin and had a blood blister for a few days.  It&#x27;s great for all lengths of hairs but works best on shorter ones.  I don&#x27;t think I really needed the exfoliating brush because it doesn&#x27;t really do much but it&#x27;s nice to have &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;. I think I&#x27;d only recommend this product for people who are very familiar with using an epilator.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun s epilators for over a decade !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the possibility of using it under water however when it needs to be charged you can&#x27;t use it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also it seems less powerful than the other model ,the non waterproof one.... At times It pinches the tender skin around the knee and it seems that is happening because it slows down.....</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom as a xmas present. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Rips my hair but it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> An epilator should remove hair with as little discomfort as possible and the Braun Silk Epil does the job.  It is small, compact and easy to travel with, a plus for people traveling on the road.  It is about the size of an electric razor and shaped to fit firmly and comfortably into your hand for great control and grip.  Overall recommended, by my spouse as it does not pull, scratch or knick.</li>
    <li> Normally I would replace a hair removal system when it got worn out, but every time Braun introduces a new epilator I&#x27;ve got to try it and I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed. This latest entry to the line is a winner providing long-lasting results and it is kind to sensitive skin. I&#x27;m sure some people complain of the pain associated with epilators in general, but I have yet to experience anything worse than an occasional slight pinch. After using the Braun Silk line, I would never go back to razors.</li>
    <li> Braun really disappointed me with this product. In comparison to other epilator sets they offer, this bundle only comes with the epilator handle, the main head, and the spa attachment. Comparing prices, you are paying practically $60 for the spa head. Do not waste your money on this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for the other sets braun offers with multiple other attachments. Trust me, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> My wife hates body hair, and shaving is tedious and waxing is expensive.  So if you want to save $ on waxing and aren&#x27;t ready yet for laser hair removal, this is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative with this is it takes time to get used to the pain, albeit temporary pain. My wife found less pain with leg hair, but more pain with underarm and her bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that it will ultimately lead to softer, smoother hair-free skin for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking to others who have used previous epilators, Braun has made tremendous improvements with this one.</li>
    <li> working great. not bad at all. battery does not last long. to be a perfect product it should also work plugged</li>
    <li> If you are a first timer, this might be some painful as it plug the whole hair out.  If your hair is long, it is harder for the machine to plug it, and takes even longer time to clean.</li>
    <li> I have previously reviewed the 7181 model very positively.  These two models are exactly identical, with the only difference being the &#x27;Spa&#x27; in the title and the rotating brush head attachment.  I am not re-reviewing the actual epilator because it is the exact same model.  I will re-post my original favorable review of that unit below after I have reviewed the changes in this Spa unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s Different: The word Spa on the packaging and the rotating brush head attachment that is supposed to smooth skin.  That is all!  Do I feel it is worth the extra bump in dollars?  No.  If you are the type that needs to have all the bells and whistles even though you will probably never use them after the first time, then go ahead; but if you are frugal and would rather exfoliate and smooth skin with a good wash and exfoliating gloves, them save the extra money and have a nice night of take-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the brush attachment to not sting when my legs are dry but sting and be extremely sensitive in the shower.  The brush actually feels stiffer when I use it during showering.  I have used the brush before and after epilating to the same end results.  I still have a lot of dry/dead skin and itchy legs.  I am still suffering from ingrown hairs and am hoping that if I continue to use the brush it will help me get on top of the dry skin issue.  Putting this brush to your face is not the most pleasant experience and I do not recommend it.  The bristles are just too stiff for that sort of application/use.  Using on other parts like your arms, feet and heels seems to be fine.  I did find that the stiffness of the bristles actually smoothed not only the balls of my feet but also heels.  Finally, I also used it on my shoulder and upper back area.  I really do wish that Braun would ship this model with a smaller attachment for face applications, considering that the price jumps considerably.  Included is a small 1 1/2 inch straight brush that can be used to &#x27;brush&#x27; away the hairs from the pivoting roller head and mechanism.  I implore Braun to hear my request and follow through with shipping a brush with longer and stiffer bristles that will not bend and collapse while attempting to brush away hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAJOR ISSUE and CON:  I have checked a few other reviews and find no complaints regarding the charging cord that supplies power to the unit.  From the moment that I unboxed the item, the charger continuously pops out!  C.O.N.S.T.A.N.T.L.Y.  As annoying as that was to type out, it is much more annoying to have to constantly replace the plug.  It does not stay in and is a very loose fit.  I am not sure if the unit that shipped was defective in this matter or not.  Forget walking by this thing... it will pop out.  Opening a drawer that this unit is resting on... pops out.  Look at it the wrong way... it pops out.  You can hold the unit in your hand while placing the charger and it will surely pop out.  I have lost precious charging hours because of this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this epilator and the model 7181 that was previously reviewed.  I just cannot justify spending so much more for a mere brush exfoliating attachment that cannot be used everywhere.  The charging cord lost the second star for me.  If you are in the market for a great epilator, then you have found one; just be aware that the more expensive choice is not always the best in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my original review for the 7181:  Both are identical in style, shape, color and mechanics.&lt;br /&gt;Ok... so those were not the exact expletives that were used at that very first moment. I have never used an epilator. This is my personal experience as an Epilating Virgin. I suffer from ingrown hairs on the outer part of my lower legs (below knee). I carefully unpacked the package, Braun epilation wipes, read the instructions/care manual and charged my new device for a bit. I couldn&#x27;t wait for too long so I cleaned my legs with the wipe. The wipe doesnothing but clean your legs and make them smell great. Seems a very &#x27;placeboish&#x27; product. I read up on online forums and took pain killers because it would supposedly reduce inflammation and pain later on. Now onto the epilating...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound when turned on is very nerve-wracking even on it&#x27;s low setting or as I refer to it as, \\&quot;chicken speed\\&quot;. It made me nervous and a bit uneasy, but I still braved on! OH MY!! Add a few expletives and constant, OUCHES, OH MY GOD, HOLY HELL and so on and you get my point. The kids came to my bedroom because they heard the commotion. Trying to describe it, I would say it feels like lightening rods. I believe that sensation is translating that way because you are tweezing 40 hairs at the same time. When you tweeze one leg hair you feel that momentary Peter Griffin moment of, \\&quot;Ahh SSSSS Ahh SSS\\&quot;. Multiply that by 40 times; hence my swearing as if I was being tazered. So there I was and five minutes later I was epilating up and down my leg like a pro and even going into the top speed. It no longer hurt! Who would have thought that the pain would subside? Rather that you could get used to that sensation. I moved to my knee and the pain came rushing back; knees are painful and continue to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience: Initially I was nervous, just from the sound of the whirring. I am so happy that I went through with it. Excitedly I looked at the calendar so that I could put into my review the exact number of days between epilation. I lost my epilator virginity on June 9th, 2012. Today is June 20th, 2012 and I have not epilated nor shaved my legs since that day. How do they feel? They feel like day number 3-4 after shaving (depending on how quickly your hair grows). This is insane and I only wish that I could have discovered this product sooner. I have stocked up on the Braun wipes even though I believe they didn&#x27;t do anything. Today I used it in the shower on my underarms. The pain was excruciating and I had a dot of blood without it catching the hair. I immediately stopped. It wasn&#x27;t worth it and I am not sure if the water makes it more difficult for the hair to be caught. The underarms will remain a strictly shaving region; as much as I loathe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type/Skin color&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and have very very fair skin that bruises easily. Waxing leaves me red for two days but the epilation went smoothly without any snags. A couple of hours later and my legs were not red and there were not any scabs. It does not help with the ingrown hairs and I have to still manually remove them. This has me motivated to pick up my exfoliation so that I could get to the bottom of those pesky ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and suggest sticking past the first few minutes. I am excited and my husband remarked how my legs felt great even though it has been so long since the last time. Do I have that freshly smooth waxed feeling? No, I don&#x27;t, but my legs have never been hair free and as smooth as this for 11 days.nothing but clean your legs and make them smell great. Seems a very &#x27;placeboish&#x27; product.

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried really hard to make myself like this product better.  I have a less advanced version of it, and I loved the idea of the spa skin treatment as an add-on.  And that part of this is great!  The brush does a super job, and my skin feels wonderful after using it.  It would almost be worth having for that alone.  However, I still can&#x27;t quite get the hang of the hair removal.  I&#x27;ve used every suggestion I can to reduce pain, but it still hurts a fair amount, and also I have trouble getting all the hair quite as well as I&#x27;d like to.  It works best on my legs, and hurts less there too, but under my arms?  That&#x27;s painful, and stays so for a while.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s anything particular to this model.  It&#x27;s more just the nature of the beast.  I do love the light---I can&#x27;t see how it would even be possible to use without that helping see what I&#x27;ve gotten or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d base my decision on whether to buy this on whether you like this type of hair removal or not.  If you do, this is a well designed model, it looks nice, it has the brush feature and the light---it&#x27;s a quality product.  But if you&#x27;ve tried other epilators and found them painful or hard to use, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d find this one any different in those features!</li>
    <li> First time epilator here, got this because shaved pits never look good.  Yes it does hurt at first (now I&#x27;m mostly used to it) but if you bought this without knowing that then you&#x27;ve really only yourself to blame.  I use it on my pits and legs and it&#x27;s pretty great, haven&#x27;t gotten brave enough to use it anywhere else, yet (:</li>
    <li> I simply loved the new model. Its easy to use and runs very smooth over skin. The exfoliater works great too. I would recommend everyone to buy it. Its a complete kit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good!  I like it so much.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I owned an earlier version and bought this as a replacement.  Seems to work even better.  Great razor and epilator.  Battery life is excellent.  I never bothered with the head that goes with the epilator on my prior one but this one works just as well with it on and feels good on the legs.</li>
    <li> I did not expect much from this but I&#x27;m totally in love with it since I got it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I always hated having to wait for my hair to grow long enough for waxing and I also hate to shave more than anything. Thanks to Silk Epil now I always have smooth legs. Sounds like a commercial but it&#x27;s so true!!! As soon as I see a few hairs growing a just take my Silk Epil and they&#x27;re gone! Even if they&#x27;re very short.&lt;br /&gt;It does give me some ingrown hair but not much, way less than wax if I have to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;It did hurt a little the first time but I think it was because my hair was kinda long. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all anymore after a couple months epilating with it.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;Also my hair is so so thin now!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for a friend and she loves it, was very excited and it seems that it is better than she was expecting it</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.  It&#x27;s more painful to use than the Emjoi Seal Wet/Dry Epilator, however it seems to get my skin a lot smoother than the other one does.  I&#x27;ve found it works well dry, or in the shower, with soapy skin.  (DO NOT USE ON DAMP SKIN!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets my skin fairly smooth, but not quite as smooth as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, my only complaint about this item (and the reason I&#x27;m knocking 2 stars off), is that it doesn&#x27;t stop if it catches the skin, like the Emjoi Seal Wet/Dry Epilator does.  I can use the other epilator in all the delicate nooks and crannies, and have no fear of rashes, nicks, or bleeding.  This one, on the other hand, has left me with some pretty nasty cuts in places that I won&#x27;t mention.  The obvious solution to the problem is to make sure you only use it on short hair, and to hold the skin very taut, before going over it.  But, sometimes you&#x27;re too lazy to trim the hair, or sometimes you don&#x27;t realize the skin isn&#x27;t taut enough, and it can leave some pretty nasty cuts on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re careful, and use it right, it does work well.</li>
    <li> After trying epilation for a few times using this device I have decided that I hate epilation.  It&#x27;s too painful, and leaves my skin red and raw.  The skin looks soft, but you can still feel the hair.  I&#x27;m not sure how this Braun Epilator compares to others, but it&#x27;s built with high quality, and has a solid feel in my hands.  I will not be using it again though, since I found it so enjoyable.  If you know you will use an Epilator, then this one seems like an excellent product.  However, since I&#x27;m not an expert, and probably won&#x27;t try epilation again, I&#x27;m not confident.  The three stars is simply because I found this product un-usable by me.  Too painful, and not worth it.  I&#x27;ll stick with my razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my dog chewed my Panasonic ES-WD51.  While I was initially ticked with her I now am grateful.  I spent more on this product but it is far superior.  I&#x27;m not sure in what way the technology is different but I find this to be much more comfortable than the previous epilator I had used.  The light is a must have for those of us with fair hair and skin.  With my previous model I sometimes missed patches.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought the newest Braun&#x27;s epilator, because my old one from Braun worked really great for more than 20 years. I&#x27;m very pleased with this new epilator, is even better than I was looking for. High quality and high performance.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Excellent item but the problem is the shipping company.. Thanks</li>
    <li> Used it on my face and broke out in razor bumps! Guess my skin was too sensitive. I&#x27;ll try in a different area next time. My daughter likes it though. A lot hairier than I am and works on her just fine.</li>
    <li> I HAVE been enjoying it! I can&#x27;t believe how smooth it leaves my legs!  It&#x27;s about 10 days since I last used it on my legs, and they feel as good as fairly soon after the old days of shaving.  The first time I used it, I got pretty good results, but the second time and since, it&#x27;s been much better, as I get the feel of the appliance.  It is so nice to be all done with a shower, then realize the old days of \\&quot;Oh man, I was going to shave, and I forgot!\\&quot; and dealing with that are done!  I can use the appliance ANY time, especially for a quick \\&quot;touch up.\\&quot;  OK, on with the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Silk-epil 7&lt;br /&gt;Skin Spa:  Epilation and Sonic Exfoliation System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--LOVE the light, which is bright enough to illuminate the area being worked on (with they had those on my old electric razor of long ago)&lt;br /&gt;--Feels comfortable in your hands--not too heavy, either&lt;br /&gt;--The safety issue--that you can&#x27;t use the appliance when charging, thereby greatly lessening the chance of shock---is very smart&lt;br /&gt;--Performance of epilator is fabulous---really gets to the smallest of hairs!&lt;br /&gt;--Love the fact that it can be used dry OR wet&lt;br /&gt;--Really detailed and accurate instructions, including simple illustrations&lt;br /&gt;--Have only used the exfoliator feature (the brush) once, but it is very nice to have--gentle on skin, but effective&lt;br /&gt;--Love the way the epilator pivots to move across body parts pretty easily&lt;br /&gt;--The carryall bag is great, as it holds everything in it---makes storage much easier (I didn&#x27;t notice that at first, and put it all back in the box, then had to find a place to store the box.  Second time, I saw the bag, all rolled up in plastic---\\&quot;Hello, what&#x27;s this?\\&quot;---and realized I could just keep the instruction sheet and ditch the bulky box!&lt;br /&gt;--It IS really gentle and comfortable to use---I was expecting even more tingling, or a little discomfort, but was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;--Recharges pretty quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Sometimes (esp. in the underarm area) the pivoting heads can \\&quot;catch\\&quot; and sort of lock up briefly on your skin. I think it&#x27;s due to not getting ALL deodorant residue off (which is sometimes hard to do with today&#x27;s antiperspirants).&lt;br /&gt;--Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t have as much hair anymore or not, but it&#x27;s a little tricky to tell if the epilator is truly free from hair residue. Have to assume it IS clean, if I followed their cleaning instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all!  As you can tell, I don&#x27;t have much I DON&#x27;T like about it.  Maybe they could include an exfoliator brush that IS approved for the face, so it could be a facial exfoliator as well as for the body?

    <li> This worked perfectly as an exfoliator (for body, not face---it&#x27;s too harsh for the face) but with the epilator I can go over the same area 10 times before one single hair is finally removed. And even so, when it would finally remove a hair, it would only kinda cut it, not totally remove it. For me, it is just too time consuming. Although it&#x27;s a great concept, I don&#x27;t find that any of these products work as well as shaving. I also find that you have to let your hair grow in the length of a caveman for it to even be effective, which is something I am just not willing to do. I personally did not care for it and wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it as far as an epilator goes.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this epilator and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> best epilator ever! takes away the smallest non visible hair! does not hurt anymore at all! also very good for brazilian are.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my close.&lt;br /&gt;It is useful and high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Received in perfect, new, excellent condition from Amazon.  This Braun Silk Epil was intended to replace my previous one from a few years back that I lost.  It is great! It hurts less than the other did, is quieter and I&#x27;m excited to try it in the shower (I&#x27;ve only used it dry) as well as to try the exfoliator which is a total bonus.  Worth the price of two leg waxes - highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says. I love it. Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.</li>
    <li> The product does not come with all the accessories pictured. Only the brush, brush cap and epilator head. Very misleading. I complained to Amazon about it, but they did nothing to fix the product images.</li>
    <li> my first epilator ever , don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price but i love it</li>
    <li> I was greatly disappointed with this epilator. After reading the reviews on Amazon I assumed I would be pleased after I used it in the shower, but I noticed that the epilator did not extract the hair. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> price found expensive after buying</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to. Ouch though.</li>
    <li> This is a brilliant product.  I have been waxing for a couple of years and so I am used to the discomfort of that activity.  Also my hairs are reasonably fine now.  I exfoliate regularly and use all the usual no-bump lotions and potions.  I thought I would give this a try because I have to let the hairs grow long enough for waxing and I don&#x27;t like the look or feel of that.  I used the product this morning, having received it yesterday and charged it overnight, the effect was astonishing.  It was not painful - the light illuminated hairs just like the advertising said it would as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never need to wax again and I will be able to be smooth and hair free.  I used it for under arm and it was the same story.</li>
    <li> I have previously used the Braun 7181 WD (orange colored) and was disappointed in it because I got a lot of ingrown hairs and the charge didn&#x27;t last long. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this epilator because I figured they are pretty much going to be the same, except this one has the exfoliating head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The battery seems to last much, much longer on this one. I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible because I figured they were the same. I use the brush before epilating and the day after and my skin is even smoother than usual with no ingrown hairs. At first I was annoyed that this one doesn&#x27;t come with the efficiancy cap for experienced users, but ended up finding that the included one works great. This one seems to work best with only water, but make sure you use the brush with soap before so the area is very clean. Overall I am pleased with this epilator and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only a few small cons to the product. This only comes with one head and the exfoliating brush. For the price, they just include a few different heads. For some reason though, Braun has decided to make multiple epilators that seem to be the same, but each comes with a different head, rather than just making one product that comes with all the different choices. In my opinion they are just doing this to make more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other cons were things that Braun has always done and doesn&#x27;t seem to want to change. For the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why braun refuses to make a cap for their epilators. They even made a cap for the brush, but not the epilator. They also give you a drawstring bag, rather than one with a zipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a corded version of the Braun Silk Epil for a few years now so I was super excited to try this cordless version. Truth be told, I haven&#x27;t used the rotating brush head yet, but I LOVE the epilator! They&#x27;ve made so many improvements to the design since I received my last one. The unit charges pretty quickly. I didn&#x27;t time it but it couldn&#x27;t have been more than 20 minutes after plugging it in from completely dead that I found it fully recharged. The contour of the unit is also improved, and I love the changes to the on/off dial. It was very easy to accidentally slide the on/off switch on my older model, but this requires two fingers so you won&#x27;t be accidentally turning it on or off when you don&#x27;t intend to. The new contouring head is also fantastic. The older model did not pivot with the contour of your legs, but this one works perfectly. The rounded epilator head is protected by the pivoting frame so that when it meets your skin, it is always in the right position. I had jabbed myself a few times with the older model as I was getting used to it. Not painful, but annoying and not effective. It&#x27;s impossible to do it wrong with this new pivoting head. Overall, I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s less painful than previous versions (and underarm hair is still excruciating and I will not do it!) but if you keep up with it every couple of days the pain is extremely minimal. The worst will be when you&#x27;ve let the hair grow out for a while and then do it all at once, and even then it&#x27;s bearable. I&#x27;m glad to see they removed the cold pack from this version because it never helped with the pain despite the claims that it would and the ice on my legs was more uncomfortable than the actual epilating. The weight is just right, not too heavy to fatigue your hands but not too light as to feel like you don&#x27;t have precise control. And of course, my skin stays smoother longer and epilating removes a lot of the dark spots that are left behind with regular shaving of my very fair skin. Definitely worth picking up for first timers or if you have an older corded version!Definitely worth picking up for first timers or if you have an older corded version!</li>
    <li> Love it! My old Braun Waterproof Epil expired... the exfoliant brush really helps keep skin smoother &amp; prevent ingrown hairs. This is def an improvement &amp; worth the upgrade.</li>
    <li> Well, if epilation is your preferred method of hair removal, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than the Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator.  This device charges up pretty quickly and can be used in the shower, because it&#x27;s cordless.  It comes with a head for exfoliation, which is great for polishing away dead skin, and a head for epilating away unwanted hair after you exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device takes about 5 hours to recharge once it has been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating can really hurt the first time you do it, but over time, you and your skin will toughen up and it won&#x27;t hurt as much.  Also, over time, the hair will grow back finer and more sparsely, which makes it even easier.</li>
    <li> I probably would have really liked the Braun Silk Epilator if I didn&#x27;t already have the [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]].  I purchased the Emjoi a little over 2 years ago, use it all the time, and LOVE it.  This 40 tweezer head Braun Epilator cannot even hold a candle to the Emjoi Emagine&#x27;s 72 tweezer head.  The Emjoi has 2-speed options, more power, moves smoother along the skin and removes more hair quicker ... and cost less.  The Emjoi, however, can only be used on dry skin and must be plugged it (as it does not operate on batteries).  Two things that did not matter to me since I would not use it in the shower or bath anyway.  In addition, the Emjoi does not have a sonic exfoliation attachment (which again is not an issue because I use a Clarisonic for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have never used an epilator, it is very uncomfortable (if not slightly painful) the first time.  And, your legs (for up to 12 hours) will look like they were stabbed repeatedly with an ice pick.  So do NOT epilate right before you need nice, smooth legs.  The first time also takes a considerable amount of time (i.e., an hour for both legs) to pull ALL of the hairs out.  You will also have to go over the same area repeatedly (as it&#x27;s not like shaving).  In addition, all of the hairs do not grow at the same rate/time, so your \\&quot;first\\&quot; time will involve doing it more than one day.  I&#x27;ve epilated with my leg hair both short and long.  Everyone says to do it with short hair, but personally, it goes much faster and is much easier with longer hair (and it really isn&#x27;t that much more painful).  Another thing, the epilator alone will never make your legs 100% smooth.  To get the 100% smoothness on your legs, you will need to epilate over a 1-3 day period and then shave the \\&quot;roughness\\&quot; from the little tiny microscopic hairs that remain.  Doing this will give you very smooth legs for at least a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different types of epilators over the past 15-20 years.  While I was usually happy enough with the results, I rarely used them since it always seemed like you had to wait until the hair got long enough for the unit to grip the hair in order to yank it out.  And rarely did I really want the hair on my legs to reach that amount of stubble.  Not to mention the pain that is involved with epilators.  Yes, I am a weenie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model of the Braun Silk Epil removes much shorter hair.  It claims to remove hair that is as short as a grain of sand (0.5mm).  I personally find it requires it to be a bit longer than that to grip; but it does do a much better job of reaching short hair than others I&#x27;ve tried.  It has a pivoting head which lets it work around all your body contours.  A light on the unit allows even the palest, finest hairs to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to hair removal, this epilator refines your skin.  A sonic massage system and high-density brush scrub away old skin cells.  This exfoliation helps to stimulate the regeneration of surface skin cells in order to create a smoother skin tone.  I do notice a bit of a smoother, more even skin tone on my legs now.  This sonic massage is my favorite part of the device...in part because I really don&#x27;t like the tweezing part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model can be used wet or dry and uses rechargeable batteries rather than a power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I find that it still hurts...although not nearly as much as it used to.  With regular use, the hairs on my legs have become fewer.  Plus, the already pale fine hair is becoming even thinner and weaker.  Braun claims that it will keep your body free of hair for up to 4 weeks.  I usually find it to be somewhere in the 2 to 3 week range for me.  Still, that&#x27;s nice for when you&#x27;re going on vacation or heading off to the beach for a week or two.  I allow the growth to get to the slight stubbly stage and then I&#x27;m perfectly smooth for a couple of weeks.of weeks.</li>
