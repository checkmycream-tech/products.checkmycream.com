      <li>so I was even more pleased that there were no side effects.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received a free sample of this product for review, but all opinions here are my own.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love the cream.</li>
      <li>I will reorder :)</li>
      <li>I am so very excited to see what my face will be like in a month after using this.</li>
      <li>(as I have oily skin) - this has impressed me and seems to really impreove the texture of my skin and fine lines, thanks for making it afforable---</li>
      <li>I have been using the Morning Light Retinol Cream for two weeks now; and I love how supple my face feels and glows in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I liked the feel of the cream and it seemed to help right away.</li>
      <li>Very nice quick absorbing cream.  </li>
      <li>A favorite result of using Morning Light is that my face has taken on a more healthy natural glow, which I absolutely love!  </li>
      <li>I received the product very quickly.</li>
      <li>I have used retinol cream before and found that the smell was kinda strong and it would burn.</li>
      <li>it must be the Morning Light eye gel and the Morning Light Retinol Cream.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a free bottle of this cream for review.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly like a serum but still has the luxury of a creme.</li>
      <li>I started using Morning Light Retinol Cream two weeks ago.</li>
      <li>My skin tone is more even and my face feels fresh all day.</li>
      <li>So far so good...</li>
      <li>I also have fair skin that can sometimes be sensitive, but did not experience any redness or irritation with the product.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ve always had good skin (no acne and very few wrinkles)</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this product my skin has significantly improved.</li>
      <li>and I gotta say, with original doubts in mind</li>
      <li>So far, I have been very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>As if the amazing product wasn&#x27;t enough, the customer service is top notch.</li>
      <li>I prefer using natural products such as minerals and this product fits perfectly in my regime.  </li>
      <li>I read that Vitamin C can inhibit the positive effects of retinol, so it might not help that my favorite wash is Avalon Organics Vitamin C wash that I use before applying this.</li>
      <li>This cream is non-greasy and light, which is important to me because my skin is sensitive to many products.</li>
      <li>It is a thick cream and moisturizes perfectly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think my wrinkles are any better, but maybe they are.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was light and non-greasy</li>
      <li>My skin feels hydrated all day with this cream and it does not have a strong smell at all (in fact I don&#x27;t really smell it at all).  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have broke out using many product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>: As others have complained, the pump isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients and they are hard to find at this price, but I would rather pay a bit more for better results.</li>
      <li>It takes a bit of blending, but when fully absorbed into skin, it does not leave a greasy residue or feeling.  </li>
      <li>I love the texture of this lotion...thick, but not heavy; hydrating,  but not greasy.</li>
      <li>In fact there are areas on my face that looked more sensitive before I started to use this cream</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is really &amp;#34;correcting&amp;#34; any fine lines at this point, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any more :)  </li>
      <li>Have used daily as directed for more than 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>so it is soft and wrinkle free.</li>
      <li>I ordered this retinol cream after a bit of research on Amazon as I saw that the ingredients in this product were identical to a much higher priced, 5-star retinol cream.  </li>
      <li>Which I did for the first two or three days .  </li>
      <li>the first night I used it, my skin looked tighter...</li>
      <li>Love the way made face feel and took years away will only be using this retinol cream from now on</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin, but most face creams I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I really like the silky and softness feeling of my skin.</li>
      <li>I really like these two products.</li>
      <li>I am really thinking I will no longer need to wear any type of foundation.</li>
      <li>I really like this Retinol Cream a LOT.</li>
      <li>And you can&#x27;t beat the price, so reasonable.</li>
      <li>I normally use tons!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using on my face for about two weeks now, and it has really helped with the dry, flaky skin and fine</li>
      <li>It seems to have shrunk the appearance of my pores already and am getting similar results to a far more expensive system hawked on tv by a famous model :)</li>
      <li>My tone seemed more even and  brighter and tight.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
      <li>I went for a facial yesterday, by someone who knows my skin, and she asked if I was using a Retinol product, as she could see the positive changes in my over all skin health.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the first things I noticed about this facial cream is how it instantly soothes and freshens my face. This cream is non-greasy and light, which is important to me because my skin is sensitive to many products. I also love that it includes Vitamin A and Aloe Vera as part of the ingredients. Cold weather can make even the best complexion a little dry, and this product gently hydrates and keeps my face feeling soft. A favorite result of using Morning Light is that my face has taken on a more healthy natural glow, which I absolutely love!  And, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time!  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what effect it has over the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> It did not help or hurt my skin. I love the ingredients and they are hard to find at this price, but I would rather pay a bit more for better results. I read that Vitamin C can inhibit the positive effects of retinol, so it might not help that my favorite wash is Avalon Organics Vitamin C wash that I use before applying this. I would say give this a shot and hope it works for you! It lasts a very long time, so I wouldn&#x27;t let the price deter you.</li>
    <li> Have used daily as directed for more than 3 weeks. I see no difference in my skin other than general hydration. Will not purchase more.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this product threw me for a loop!...the first night I used it, my skin looked tighter...but I thought I was just crazy and too hopeful. Second night, same experience. I am pleased to say, it just keeps getting better. The deep wrinkles in my forehead are much finer/smaller now...&amp; and my crow&#x27;s feet have flown the coop!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Morning Light Retinol Cream for two weeks now; and I love how supple my face feels and glows in the morning.  My skin appears firmer, pores and wrinkles are less noticeable and my color is brighter.  I prefer using natural products such as minerals and this product fits perfectly in my regime.  Yes! I recommend this product and will continue to purchase it in the future.  In fact, I just ordered the eye cream!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, but most face creams I&#x27;ve tried have left my skin feeling extremely greasy, and I HATE that feeling. This retinol cream from Morning Light Beauty is amazing. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated, but not greasy. It&#x27;s also a great value. The bottle is somewhat small, but you need a very small amount every day, since the cream is so thick. I&#x27;ve been using on my face for about two weeks now, and it has really helped with the dry, flaky skin and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a free sample of this product for review, but all opinions here are my own.</li>
    <li> I started using Morning Light Retinol Cream two weeks ago. The first thing I noticed was light and non-greasy this cream was. It goes on smoothly like a serum but still has the luxury of a creme. I have used Obagi in the past and didn&#x27;t like how thick and heavy it felt. I have acne and I was concerned that using this product in conjunction with an acne cleanser would cause extra dryness. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my skin remained soft and I didn&#x27;t experience the icky flaking like I normally do when I use salicylic acid based cleansers. Overall my skin feels smoother and hydrated! I will be ordering Morning Light again!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it a couple of days. I have used retinol cream before and found that the smell was kinda strong and it would burn. This one has no smell and does not burn. Hopefully, after a few wks I will see a marked difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Jewell</li>
    <li> I thought I must be crazy when the night after I used the product the first time I woke up and my complexion seemed different. My tone seemed more even and  brighter and tight. After the second night I knew I was not imaging things I definitely saw a difference in overall skin tone and my face seemed so moisturized. Today I am about a week in to using it. I woke up this morning and I had to barely use any liquid foundation. I had to use no concealer. I normally use tons! I am so very excited to see what my face will be like in a month after using this. I am really thinking I will no longer need to wear any type of foundation. I have very sensitive skin and have broke out using many product. This product has caused me no irritation or burning whatsoever. I could not be more thrilled!</li>
    <li> The pump does not work.  Have to use a q-tip to get the product out of the bottle.  Which I did for the first two or three days .  before I stop using it</li>
    <li> I used this one and put it away.  It&#x27;s way too think like there&#x27;s a lot of water in it.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this lotion...thick, but not heavy; hydrating,  but not greasy. Not only does a little go a long way, but my skin feel soft all day. And you can&#x27;t beat the price, so reasonable. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Love the way made face feel and took years away will only be using this retinol cream from now on</li>
    <li> Although I had preferred a cream I could wear all day- (as I have oily skin) - this has impressed me and seems to really impreove the texture of my skin and fine lines, thanks for making it afforable--- I will reorder :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about halfway through a bottle of this cream and I must say there is a noticeable difference in how my skin looks. It looks like it has plumped my skin so it is soft and wrinkle free. I especially noticed the wrinkle reduction on my brow where there was a deeper line that is now less noticeable. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any skin irritation from the retinol. In fact there are areas on my face that looked more sensitive before I started to use this cream and now my face is more evenly toned. I think the secret of this cream is the retinol and hyaluronic acid. Retinol is a vitamin A derivative that helps the skin produce more collagen. It seems to work well on my oily skin. It did however not make my skin less oily as some say it will. I&#x27;m happy with this cream and feel it brightens my skin and makes my face glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free bottle of this cream for review. This review is my honest experience.</li>
    <li> I use this for acne scars and it is magical. Scars I&#x27;ve had for years are disappearing. I&#x27;m hoping if I keep using it regularly it&#x27;ll completely erase my scars, although it seems for me to do that I&#x27;ll have to use it everyday and that is a little difficult. The cream is a little greasy for my skin so I only like to use it after my face gets very dry from my face wash. My mom noticed my skin clearing up and asked me what I was using. I told her this and ordered a bottle for her dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 days and I gotta say, with original doubts in mind, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this product. I don&#x27;t have hardly any wrinkles at age 36, but I did have some dark spots on my face and those little white bumps that appear under the eyes (sebaceous cysts). My dermatologist recommended that those little bumps be removed professionally, but for maintenance purposes that I should start using a retinol-a evening face cream. I decided to go with an over-the-counter product and settled on trying this based on all the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after 10 days, I have noticed that the dark pigmentation (liver spots?) have lightened considerably, and those tiny white bumps under my eyes have actually reduced! That made me pretty happy. As a side-note, after doing some research and finding out that Retinol-A was originally intended to remove warts, I did start swiping a little bit of the cream on a part of my arm that had a string of warts from an old cat scratch. I&#x27;ve had them for years and found them annoying, so figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. Well holy cow, this line of warts that was about 1\\&quot; in length has almost completely dissipated in the last 10 days. So cool!!&lt;br /&gt;I had read on some reviews of retinol-a products that some people experience redness on their face if they use it every night, but I&#x27;ve been using it every evening and have no redness whatsoever. To be fair, I&#x27;ve always had good skin (no acne and very few wrinkles) so I was even more pleased that there were no side effects. A+ product and I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;Con: As others have complained, the pump isn&#x27;t very good. By the 7th day I had issues with getting the cream to pump out, but it is very thick and a few taps on my countertop to draw the cream to the bottom of the bottle got the pump working again. Hopefully no more issues, but I&#x27;m not going to dock the stars for it... I love the cream.</li>
    <li> The pump on this face cream did not work from day one.  Unfortunately the shape of the container makes it very difficult to get anything out just by tapping it on your hand.  The product seems to do okay although I find it to be drying and need to apply a little moisturizer after it dries.  Not sure yet how much improvement I wil get because I am not a youngster.</li>
    <li> I really like this Retinol Cream a LOT. Unfortunately, I had a problem with the pump but  the company that makes this product are so unbelievably helpful. They surpassed my expectations of sincerity &amp; helpfulness. I would definitely recommend it !</li>
    <li> As other customers stated, the pump does not work. But the company followed up with me and sent me refund. Because of this, most likely i would try to buy another one after I use up other products I have purchased recently.</li>
    <li> My friend asked me the other day if I was wearing new makeup.  My response, &amp;#34;no, actually i don&#x27;t have much on today.&amp;#34;  She asked me again today,  Then it hit me...it must be the Morning Light eye gel and the Morning Light Retinol Cream.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve added to my &amp;#34;beauty regimen&amp;#34;. I noticed that my skin looks more even and dewy (not oily).  So far so good...I really like these two products. :-D</li>
    <li> I thought the price was too good to be true for a product that would make a difference.  I went for a facial yesterday, by someone who knows my skin, and she asked if I was using a Retinol product, as she could see the positive changes in my over all skin health.  I&#x27;m a senior and have always taken good care of my skin, I can honestly say this product does what it says.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this instead of eye serum.  I decided to keep it and give it a try.  What a wonderful accident!  It has turned in to a great night cream-feels nice on the skin but not greasy,  Would not hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This cream works great and I would have given it five stars if the pump would have worked.  I had to basically take it apart to get the cream out.  I would suggest using a different way of packaging the product the pump just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a promotional item. It is just OK. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I was able to see the difference on my face withing 3 weeks of usage. People are telling how beautiful is my skin(face). It&#x27;s souple n supple. I use it every night with my Nadinola. What a great combination.</li>
    <li> Worked well.  I liked the feel of the cream and it seemed to help right away.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I&#x27;m not sure why.  I don&#x27;t really think my wrinkles are any better, but maybe they are.  All I know for sure is, I use it every night.  I bought it for the vertical lines between my eyebrows.  I do think they look some better.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this retinol cream after a bit of research on Amazon as I saw that the ingredients in this product were identical to a much higher priced, 5-star retinol cream.  I had been using a Retinol serum, but needed to apply a moisturizer over that, so I decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone.  So far, I have been very pleased with this product.  It is light and you only need a small amount for your entire face and neck (maybe 2 small squirts). It takes a bit of blending, but when fully absorbed into skin, it does not leave a greasy residue or feeling.  I use it around my eye area without irritation or smudges appearing later in the day from eyeliner/mascara .  I&#x27;m not sure if it is really &amp;#34;correcting&amp;#34; any fine lines at this point, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any more :)  I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and since February of this year I have been on the attack to up my skin care routine and it is paying off.  I look much younger (fine lines on face, neck, lip area all diminished greatly) and I&#x27;m getting carded for alcohol again  :D  My skin feels hydrated all day with this cream and it does not have a strong smell at all (in fact I don&#x27;t really smell it at all).  I appreciate the quality ingredients and the lower price than other retinol creams...hoping it stays that way as I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of face creams and this one is by far the best. Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I hoped for fading of my spots on either side of my face.  What I got was some fading (not a month of use yet) and absolutely wonderful wrinkle removal on my forehead, around my eyes and on my upper lip!  Wow what a product.  Wish I had taken before and after pictures.  Great stuff!!!  Working for me!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice quick absorbing cream.  It does not break me out.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It is a thick cream and moisturizes perfectly. I wanted something that i could feel lasting on my skin and not a watery substance which evaporated instantly AND I FOUND IT. As if the amazing product wasn&#x27;t enough, the customer service is top notch. They really care about this product and want you to know how to use it properly. Well done all around and i am hooked!</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly. Have used it for three nights now and am also using it on my neck. It seems to have shrunk the appearance of my pores already and am getting similar results to a far more expensive system hawked on tv by a famous model :) I also have fair skin that can sometimes be sensitive, but did not experience any redness or irritation with the product.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I love this product! I have always struggled with minor acne, not bad enough to seek medical treatment, but bad enough that I almost always have several large pimples on my face. Since I&#x27;ve started using this product my skin has significantly improved. Totally happy!</li>
    <li> After using the product for about a month, I noticed that it made my face skin darker.  Before this I was using Strivectin.  I may have to go back to it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Have used twice now and can see a difference. My skin tone is more even and my face feels fresh all day. Love this and will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my Retinol cream, it is an amazing cream. I really like the silky and softness feeling of my skin. I also like the glow ofmy skin, I love this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased that this retinol  lotion  works so well.  Lightened some datk spots and has helped the texture of my skin. This is the best so far that I have ordered.</li>
    <li> As of today I feel my skin more brilliant and healthy. I have plans to continue purchasing this product.</li>
