      <li>This works better than anything.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually usually more mascara than I want, the &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; is not a joke.</li>
      <li>I just like the way my Maybelline mascara wears better.</li>
      <li>but it is my FAVORITE mascara, and the price just makes it better.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to have and at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>better than most out there</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not terribly upset.</li>
      <li>It is okay</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I use it all the time and it is my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>and this mascara doesn&#x27;t make any of those conditions any better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
      <li>If you want more volume, purchase away.</li>
      <li>(I am 55 and have been wearing mascara since I was 15, so you can guess how many I&#x27;ve tried) 1 coat is all it takes.</li>
      <li>This mascara is okay.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and the price</li>
      <li>I love mascara</li>
      <li>Maybe I will use it as a top coat.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite mascara, looks beautiful and stays put</li>
      <li>The best I have bought I a long while.  </li>
      <li>I like how easily this mascara applies and love the way it makes my lashes look.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or become sticky when you apply more than one coat, which is always important for me.</li>
      <li>It also removes easily at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and easy to take off.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this, since it was cheap and had some very good reviews, but I don&#x27;t see what the big fuss is all about.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras from drugstore to high end, searching for the perfect one, and I never thought I&#x27;d find my holy grail product for under $3!</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of mascara.  </li>
      <li>The price is great, but it didn&#x27;t work on my short lashes.</li>
      <li>I saw a tutorial where a makeup artists was using this mascara and her lashes looked fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>other wise amazing</li>
      <li>I find that this mascara does lengthen and volumize my lashes but it clumps very easily if you put too much on.</li>
      <li>its all really a pain to get off ( two important things for mascara for me!)</li>
      <li>First of all for the price, wow, this mascara is sensational.  </li>
      <li>Came quickly and was just as described.</li>
      <li>This mascara would work wonderfully on some people that already have nice eyelashes, but mine are short and thick and stubby.</li>
      <li>Definitely some of the longest lashes I have ever had with any mascara, however it smudged a bit more than I would like!</li>
      <li>The price is absolutely fantastic and it was shipped to me in a very timely manner.  </li>
      <li>and I think the product is worth its money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good price and does a nice job of coating and grabbing my thin lashes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, an excellent drugstore mascara and I highly recommend using it as a second mascara over another one for extra drama.</li>
      <li>It is very nice over every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried and adds extra oomph as a sort of &#x27;top coat&#x27;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quite good. I wish it were waterproof, but that&#x27;s my only complaint. It&#x27;s actually usually more mascara than I want, the &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; is not a joke. Good for going out at night etc.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far. No clumps, it really makes your lashes full and longer, but still the effect is natural. I loved it!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this mascara and it&#x27;s definitely not going to be the last. I can&#x27;t believe how well this works for the price. I bought this on a whim when I ran out of my last mascara and I&#x27;m very glad that I did. It lengthens very well (I have naturally long eyelashes, though), and it holds up throughout the day. By the end of the day, sometimes there are very minimal flakes - but I&#x27;ve purchased $20.00 mascara that flakes horribly. Again, I&#x27;m amazed that this mascara sells for so little.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara but it smudges a little.</li>
    <li> Big lashes lov it.  Fast ship.  Ty</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I put it on and instantly recognized a difference, thumbs up for this product! :)</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this, since it was cheap and had some very good reviews, but I don&#x27;t see what the big fuss is all about. There is nothing special about this, its just a plain and simple mascara!</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEE but not water proof my boyfriend &amp; I got in an argument and my mascara ran bad when I cried lol other wise amazing</li>
    <li> Dnt really like this mascara ive used for like a week and havent touched it every since maybe cus its to &amp;#34; wet &amp;#34; for my liking. After like a hour of use i notice some black on my under eye area.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara! One coat makes my lashes looks so long and voluminous! This mascara hasn&#x27;t rubbed off at all with me being outside in the heat all day. It also removes easily at the end of the day. Plus, it&#x27;s only 3 dollars! Such a steal!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mascara, looks beautiful and stays put</li>
    <li> First, let me say, I&#x27;ll spend whatever it takes to get the results I desire when it comes to my hair and my lashes, lol!  I searched and spent lots of money on high end mascara until I came across this bad boy based on online reviews.  It sells at walgreens for $2.99 so I thought, what the heck, give it a try.  We&#x27;ll let me tell you.....as long as this mascara is on the market I WILL NOT be spending $25 plus again for another tube of mascara.  Seriously girls.....you have to try it.  It isn&#x27;t waterproof but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I wear it all day and it is great.  My lashes are blonde and are not long.  This stuff makes them full, thick and curvy long!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The best I have bought I a long while.  The brush is perfect, not awkward to use.  It goes on think without clumping. Makes my lashes look thick and long.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, but I wished it came in waterproof.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, i have but one complaint. If you have a bit shorter bottom lashes, the mascara hooks at the end, which would be cool if youre staring in the Broadway revival of peter pan but not cool in everyday life.</li>
    <li> I like how easily this mascara applies and love the way it makes my lashes look.  I prefer to wear this mascara alone without any eyeliner, as it gives my lashes a much more dramatic effect.  It does not clump or flake. It does burn a bit if it gets on the rim of my eyelid which is something that I have never experience with other mascaras, and is something I find odd. It also like how easily it washes off with my facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Just regular mascara, There is nothing special or volumizing about this mascara.</li>
    <li> For reference, my lashes are rather short and sparse. The price is right and it does add volume and length to the lashes. This mascara definitely adds drama but not as much as you might hope for. I don&#x27;t think it deserves the name &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34;. It is very nice over every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried and adds extra oomph as a sort of &#x27;top coat&#x27; so that is my preferred way to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that it dries to a sort of crisp and is very crunchy to the touch and will flake like a MOFO if you touch it. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it flaking or transferring any color if I keep my fingers away from my lashes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent drugstore mascara and I highly recommend using it as a second mascara over another one for extra drama.</li>
    <li> Must I say that this mascara is awesome! I read many great reviews on this mascara and have seen many youtube videos on girls saying how marvelous this mascara was. I love mascara so since my old ones were drying out I decided to purchase a new one and this was it. I brought it at Walgreens today for $3.19 and wow! These really lengthen your lashes and give that &amp;#34;false lash&amp;#34; effect. You never have to go out and buy false lashes with this baby around!</li>
    <li> I just like the way my Maybelline mascara wears better.</li>
    <li> Heard raves from youtube about his mascara.  It&#x27;s a good price and does a nice job of coating and grabbing my thin lashes.  Wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10 but it&#x27;s definitely a quality product for drugstore mascara; better than most out there</li>
    <li> This mascara would work wonderfully on some people that already have nice eyelashes, but mine are short and thick and stubby. I find that this mascara does lengthen and volumize my lashes but it clumps very easily if you put too much on. I also find that it doesn&#x27;t keep my eyelashes curled, so it doesn&#x27;t really look like I&#x27;m wearing mascara when I have it on. But overall I like the brush and I think the product is worth its money. This mascara doesn&#x27;t really work for me, but if you do have naturally curly eyelashes then this would look amazing on you.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!  The price is absolutely fantastic and it was shipped to me in a very timely manner.  I am very picky about my mascara, but I have to say without a doubt, this is one of the best products I have used.  It has a nice, thick consistancy that coats really well and makes my lashes look thick, long, and healthy.  It wears beautifully throughout the day and is easily removed before bed.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve used. Even better than the more expensive brands. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Definitely some of the longest lashes I have ever had with any mascara, however it smudged a bit more than I would like!</li>
    <li> First of all for the price, wow, this mascara is sensational.  It works amazingly well, no clumps, just smooth black liquid slides over your lashes.  I&#x27;m surprised for such an inexpensive cost this beats all the high end mascaras on the market hands down!</li>
    <li> I saw a tutorial where a makeup artists was using this mascara and her lashes looked fantastic. I searched for them on Amazon, checked price and it was davilous for just trying. I put it on and voila! My few lashes looked very long! This is a great product to have and at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I use it all the time and it is my favorite mascara. I have recommended this product to friends and they love it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras from drugstore to high end, searching for the perfect one, and I never thought I&#x27;d find my holy grail product for under $3! This mascara gives the effect of putting on 5 coats of any other mascara, with just one swipe! It thickens, flares, and lengthens my lashes perfectly. If not applied properly (left to right motions) it can clump, but that is easily avoided if you wipe some off on a tissue before applying. I recommend this to all my friends, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was just as described.</li>
    <li> Best drugstore mascar ever!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my eyelashes Super long I will be repurchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara on the market. I&#x27;ve used a lot high quality and expensive ones, but this one is totally underestimated. It makes your lashes long from the first coat. Will buy again !!))</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not sure whats the fuzz about this mascara. It is okay but the only bad thing is that it makes the ends of my lashes curl all weird. This is the only mascara that has done than to me. I really wanted to like it. Maybe I will use it as a top coat.</li>
    <li> This mascara is okay. It&#x27;s more of a wet formula. I wouldn&#x27;t recommended wearing on a hot day, it did smudge a bit under my eyes. It separates my lashes well but doesn&#x27;t hold my straight lashes for long</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking that it would extended my lashes but it just coats them making them appear thinker but not longer. works great for bottom lashes though. If length is what you&#x27;re looking for, skip this brand. If you want more volume, purchase away.</li>
    <li> Hated this mascara. It was very wet and heavy and weighed my lashes down. My lashes just kinda got stuck together. However, I gave it to my mom and she loved it, so to each their own.</li>
    <li> I had been using this for 4 weeks now on and off since I got it and I ended up with the worst dermatits/excema around my eyes the professor said he had seen in years. It started as a small rash under my left eye, that then spread too my eye lid and then over to my right eye. It was so swollen and sore, I am on heavy medications now to try and bring my immune system back under control. So I now have swollen red and itchy eye sockets, not a nice experience at all. The product itself is wonderful, I enjoyed it, but it caused the worst reaction for me Ive ever had. Please do a patch test before using, the pain torture is not worth risking it, wish I&#x27;d never bought it now, Im still 6 weeks off being normal unable to use any make up at all and taking steroids to try to counteract the issues this product caused!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product!</li>
    <li> after seeing all these great reviews, i gave it a try.  The price is great, but it didn&#x27;t work on my short lashes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like black ink, gives no length or volume.</li>
    <li> The reviews here are misleading, this is GOOD mascara as far as what it does to your eyelashes, but it is a little WET and by the end of the day its under my eyes  &amp; its all really a pain to get off ( two important things for mascara for me!)</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used it is the best I would love to buy more of these products so that is awesome does not clump lashes looking for long</li>
    <li> Almost impossible to take off. I had racoon eyes trying to take the mascara off.</li>
    <li> This is a dry mascara, which I tend to like. I didn&#x27;t see any lengthening or thickening, only my same lashes blackened. Not what I was expecting. I&#x27;ll stick to my other brands. Cheap enough price to try so I&#x27;m not terribly upset.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great!  Makes lashes long and thick; doesn&#x27;t clump.  Great value for the money. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this all over YouTube and I finally just got to try it. It is honestly the best I have ever used. Goes on so easily, perfect for the bottom lashes as well. Easy to apply and easy to take off. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This mascara works miracles on my blonde eyelashes - huge volume and definition.  However, it smudges easily, and is really difficult to wipe off without makeup remover.  If there is any chance your face will get wet during the day, skip it for something waterproof.  Once it&#x27;s on, enjoy the look and don&#x27;t touch your eyes!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and the price</li>
    <li> this is sold at walgreens for 3 bucks..</li>
    <li> One of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve tried and believe me I have tried a lot (I am 55 and have been wearing mascara since I was 15, so you can guess how many I&#x27;ve tried) 1 coat is all it takes. Doesn&#x27;t smear either but I don&#x27;t use on bottom lashes.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s better than nothing but it&#x27;s not great.  I tend to use it as a primer now after trying it solo and having poor results.  I have short, sparse lashes that don&#x27;t like to hold a curl and this mascara doesn&#x27;t make any of those conditions any better.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and the price is right but beyond that?  No.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Best mascara on the market. I like the way it makes my lashes&lt;br /&gt;look thicker and longer. Loving this product!</li>
    <li> This mascara is inexpensive and works great on my lashes.  It keeps my lashes curled without a eyelash curler and my lashes are long and thick all day long. One of the best for the price. I have only purchased through Amazon as I have not seen it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased every price range of mascaras (as much as $20) assuming the more expensive, the better.  Oh, I wish I had known about this mascara before I wasted my money  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing; very good coverage, non-clumping, lengthens, lashes are not stiff  AND it&#x27;s INEXPENSIVE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it at Walgreen&#x27;s for a great price.  BTW, this product line has alot of other cosmetics as low as $1.  I would compare it to high end makeup- seriously!  And if the makeup doesn&#x27;t work for you, Walgreen&#x27;s will return your money (with receipt).  I&#x27;m seriously happy with this mascara and product line!</li>
    <li> I am a mascara junkie &amp; had high hopes for this. Used it a little more than a week &amp; threw it out.  A lumpy, clumpy mess that flakes. Back to Covergirl Clumpcrusher &amp;/or Almay One Coat for now.</li>
    <li> Amazing mascara, lengthens like the They&#x27;re real mascara by Benefit. Have a slight problem with the wand as it does not seperate the lashes too well, but this can be easily fixed with a toothpick. Could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day. Also, I&#x27;m a high-functioning cryer. I cry at every little commercial that has any sort of violin involved. This mascara stays.  It is not \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; volumizing but lashes do look nice and it stays put. It&#x27;s a very reasonable price as well.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. The brush is not very appealing at first but it is my FAVORITE mascara, and the price just makes it better. It doesn&#x27;t dry out in the tube quickly and does not smear on my eyelids. It doesn&#x27;t clump or become sticky when you apply more than one coat, which is always important for me. I hate clumping/stickiness. Best you can get for the price.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best extending mascara I have ever purchased.  I have spent over $30 on some of the high end products that do not do nearly as well as this product.  In fact, I am no using this product and saving myself the money as it does well.  Jordana puts out an extending &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; mascara too.  I tried that one too, and was right back to this one.  The extending extreme version worked the first time and made a slight difference; but soon failed to make any difference.  I went back to this version.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I received an old batch, but I&#x27;ve used it twice, and both times small flakes got in my eyes and it was very irritating. I like the way it goes on and how it makes my lashes look. I may purchase again to see if it is the formula that flakes, or possibly I just got an old batch of mascara.</li>
    <li> It smears very easily.  I like that it does not clump, but it takes several coats.</li>
    <li> Great product and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I heard about this mascara from bloggers, and I was skeptical to even buy it because this brand is known for their low quality makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore the mascara and it goes on smoothly, it is the perfect amount of volume. The only reason I have to give it a 3 is because once it dries it turns powdery.</li>
    <li> I read so many good review about this, on another site.  It flakes and smudges.</li>
    <li> BEST. MASCARA. EVER.  Seriously!  I am a huge fan of mascara.  If I don&#x27;t wear anything else, a little mascara makes me feel human.  I&#x27;ve tried the super expensive high end brands, the trendy fiber lash mascara, and everything in between.  This works better than anything.  And it layers evenly so you can wear a little to work or wear a little more for a night out.  For the price, you just can&#x27;t beat this stuff!</li>
    <li> Was OK in how it makes your lashes look, worst of all after washing it off the following day it leaves these little tar balls all over my eyes.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Overrated in my opinion</li>
