<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tend skin is perfect. I highly reccomend it. Works as a divine miracle, for real. Don´t think twice. I suffered from severe folliculitis in my thighs and buttocks and after about 2 months of use of this product the lesions disappeared completely!</li>
    <li> Price a little high but the product work well</li>
    <li> This was a great buy for a low price.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and received as advertised</li>
    <li> great but you must use it everyday</li>
    <li> I use this on the backs of my legs since I am prone to ingrown hairs there.  I think the old formula worked better; I like the sting-yness, but this goes on without any bite.  It still helps prevent the majority of ingrowns, but I wish the old formula was still in use.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!  It is great for preventing rashes from a variety of things, such as waxing, shaving or heat.  I tend to get a heat rash when I work out in the summer and I use this every day after I get out of the shower and no longer have problems like I used to.  I also shave the bikini area and this keeps it really nice, no ugly bumps.  I used to wax regularly, and this also helped after waxing.  Basically it prevents ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some men who also use this product after they shave to prevent painful ingrown hairs.  It&#x27;s really awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Good product for a very competitive price.</li>
    <li> Tend Skin is perfect for eliminating the CROTCH ITCH associated with a close bikini shave.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does regular use totally eliminate the itch, it TOTALLY ELIMINATES the red bumps and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I would never get a Brazilian wax or shave close again without following up with daily treatments of Tend Skin.</li>
    <li> Great product works well with bumps! The price was great. Other products do not compare with this solution. Get it.</li>
    <li> I used to use this wayyy back in the day, and now saw this great deal and copped it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any bumps since I&#x27;ve been using this Tend Skin...</li>
    <li> Been buying this stuff for years now. Is amazing at reducing razor rash and ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product though it is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend biting the bullet, buying in bulk and transferring to a smaller container.</li>
    <li> This site is so much better than the tend skin site. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best for that chicken skin from the razor, careful it will dry your hands.</li>
    <li> Leaves baby soft skin, love it</li>
    <li> This is the best product in the world.  My husband and I can&#x27;t live without it!  A bit expensive, but we must have it!!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for the last 7-8 years. Resolves ingrown hairs on my neck.  All it takes is to apply after shaving an every morning.</li>
    <li> This is a better value than you can find in a store and the product does wonders for your skin.</li>
    <li> As specified at a great price.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> great product. i use it anywhere that i shave. well, minus my legs.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, used it after my last waxing and had ZERO bumps. Frightfully priced, but I guess it&#x27;s worth a premium because it does work.</li>
    <li> Got these bottles to refill the roll on dispenser I have.  I have been using Tend Skin for 6-8 weeks now and definitely notice less bumps and ingrown hairs on my legs after waxing.  This has been a long term problem for me.  I enjoy showing off my legs more these days.  Will keep buying this product.  The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because while the issue is at about 15% of what it was, it is not completely gone yet.  I am hoping that with continued use, there will be no more issues at all.  This is still way more than I expected, and overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Not recommended for my face don&#x27;t know about yours but this stuff will dry up any ingrown hair very fast. Like the next day. It&#x27;s a little pricey but so worth it! I took advice from a review on here to put the liquid in a spray bottle and mist the spray on yourself.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!!!!  Every man who experience razor or shaving related issues should use this product after shaving. My face is loving this product very much. No more ingrown hairs or razor bumps. Well worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Virtually eliminates or vastly reduces the number of ingrown hairs after shaving or laser hair removal treatments. Have tried other &amp;#34;remedies&amp;#34;, but this stuff is the real deal. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! This is a great deal because you get two big bottles at a fairly good price. This is the best product I have ever used! Arrived in great packaging and their was no damage to any of the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is invaluable. The value size it the way to go for economy sake, and you can always transfer for travel to another container.</li>
