      <li>The smell and texture are perfect.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>Works GREAT!!</li>
      <li>Very pleased!</li>
      <li>Great water-based lubricant.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>My partner and I love it!</li>
      <li>If you want to use biodegradable and safe products this is a good alternative to chemical products.</li>
      <li>But it smells so much better, and dries without leaving you feeling too sticky.</li>
      <li>It is, quite simply, the best lube.</li>
      <li>For long-lasting lube, I have yet to find anything better than silicone based.</li>
      <li>Love the feel of this product</li>
      <li>My second order because this is the best.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many types of lube</li>
      <li>Comfortable, enhancing, would recommend and buy it again.</li>
      <li>but overall its great.</li>
      <li>Far superior than KY Jelly.</li>
      <li>Really good for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Having tried many kinds of sexual lube with many partners to mixed results, I&#x27;ve settled on this.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and works GREAT!!</li>
      <li>Long-lasting and well worth the money.</li>
      <li>For those of you who have sensitive skin or sensitive to all kind of things, you should test it on your skin first, so you know if you are allergic to it or not.</li>
      <li>Not sticky, and not uncomfortable if you wear it all night or all day.</li>
      <li>and I have found that this does not leave a sticky residue, is tasteless, works wonderfully with condoms and keeps things lubricated for an hour before needing reapplication</li>
      <li>I did a comparison test between Slippery Stuff Gel and my current lube favorite Wet Original.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed it, but, it says its long lasting, if you keep using more and more of it  , it is long lasting, but had to keep applying more of it to last long.</li>
      <li>either (slick AND easy to clean up).  </li>
      <li>Pretty much like every other water based lubricant I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate, feels natural.</li>
      <li>I give it my absolute regard and cannot praise it highly enough.</li>
      <li>No mess.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s quite thick, but that actually works out well because it stays where it&#x27;s supposed to and doesn&#x27;t run all over the place like a more liquidy lube like Astroglide.</li>
      <li>The Wet Original stayed wet and slippery for nearly twice as long as the Slippery Stuff.</li>
      <li>This product is not long lasting....</li>

<li> The Wet lube comes in a factory sealed container.</li>
<li> after a little over 5 minutes have to stop and reapply....</li>
<li> but as you pour it out of the bottle it left a weird string when you are done pouring it.</li>
<li> From the lube, at least.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried it for everything (and I mean EVERYTHING), and it holds up to a serious battery of tests.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s a bad product, but it&#x27;s not a miracle</li>

    <li> This is the best lubricant I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s the only one I have not had an allergic reaction to.</li>
    <li> Great water-based lubricant. Long-lasting and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I did a comparison test between Slippery Stuff Gel and my current lube favorite Wet Original. I applied an equal amount of each lube between my thumb and index finger and then rubbed them together. The Wet Original stayed wet and slippery for nearly twice as long as the Slippery Stuff. The Wet lube comes in a factory sealed container. The Slippery Stuff comes in an unsealed container. I threw away the Slippery Stuff.</li>
    <li> My second order because this is the best.  actually bought the 3 pack this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many types of lube and I have found that this does not leave a sticky residue, is tasteless, works wonderfully with condoms and keeps things lubricated for an hour before needing reapplication</li>
    <li> If you want to use biodegradable and safe products this is a good alternative to chemical products.</li>
    <li> Pretty much like every other water based lubricant I&#x27;ve ever used.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s a bad product, but it&#x27;s not a miracle either (slick AND easy to clean up).  For long-lasting lube, I have yet to find anything better than silicone based.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and works GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Will never change brands. Doesn&#x27;t irritate, feels natural.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s quite thick, but that actually works out well because it stays where it&#x27;s supposed to and doesn&#x27;t run all over the place like a more liquidy lube like Astroglide. It lasted for a session without reapplication needed. Odorless, worked well with condom.</li>
    <li> it is slippery stuff.  Works GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased! Comfortable, enhancing, would recommend and buy it again.</li>
    <li> Slip n slide, let that rocket glide!!!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed it, but, it says its long lasting, if you keep using more and more of it  , it is long lasting, but had to keep applying more of it to last long. but overall its great.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. It is a gel so I thought it would last awhile but as you pour it out of the bottle it left a weird string when you are done pouring it. It also wasn&#x27;t a lasting lubricant.</li>
    <li> Works great. I had this recommended to me by my OB-GYN. Far superior than KY Jelly.</li>
    <li> It works well. It is almost like water. No mess. No stain. It was recommended by my physical therapist, and I have been using it for 6 weeks. Not sticky, and not uncomfortable if you wear it all night or all day. For those of you who have sensitive skin or sensitive to all kind of things, you should test it on your skin first, so you know if you are allergic to it or not.</li>
    <li> Oh my god. Having tried many kinds of sexual lube with many partners to mixed results, I&#x27;ve settled on this. It is, quite simply, the best lube. I&#x27;ve tried it for everything (and I mean EVERYTHING), and it holds up to a serious battery of tests. Does it last as long as AstroGlide? Hell no! But it smells so much better, and dries without leaving you feeling too sticky. From the lube, at least. Buy it. Buy it now, and buy lots. I give it my absolute regard and cannot praise it highly enough. The bottle size is perfect. The smell and texture are perfect. Holy s***. I lack the words necessary to praise this lube. All praise be to this lube.</li>
    <li> BEST stuff on the planet!</li>
    <li> Great product and service.... thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this product</li>
    <li> This product is not long lasting....after a little over 5 minutes have to stop and reapply....I will look for something different....I will not buy this product again</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Really good for my sensitive skin. My partner and I love it! This is our second order and we decided to get the 3 pack</li>
