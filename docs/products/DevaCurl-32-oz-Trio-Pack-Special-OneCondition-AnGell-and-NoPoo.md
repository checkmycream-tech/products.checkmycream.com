<li> but this was such a disappointment.</li>
<li> That gel was useless, making my hair so stiff.</li>
<li> These products saved me from cutting my hair to a pixie cut again.</li>

    <li> Awesome product for maintaining frizz free naturally curly hair.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Very good and soft for curls and it smells fantastic. A must have for every curly girl! I will pay again</li>
    <li> I have loved these products since I began using them a little while ago.  I am happy that I can find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and the Deva products are great!  Much cheaper than salon prices. If you have curly fizzy hair, this product works great!</li>
    <li> The 3 DevaCurl products work great for curly hair! My hair feels so much healthier since I started using them. I will never again use regular shampoo on my hair, and I have basically stopped using a comb.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I will use on my hair. I love being able to buy all three of these in bulk and at a discount. It&#x27;s saving me tons of money.</li>
    <li> I have used the OneCondition and NoPoo before.  I think it is the best shampoo and conditioner!  I have not tried the AnGell.  I would recommend these products to anyone with curly hair. There are no dislikes.</li>
    <li> Deva curl products are a lifesaver for my curly, dry hair. It&#x27;s great to be able to get them in a bigger size since I use so much.</li>
    <li> Just a little expensive but other that it was great</li>
    <li> It just spoilt my curls more and made my hair itchy. That gel was useless, making my hair so stiff. It&#x27;s my fault for buying 32 oz to start with, I just stare at these every morning.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited after reading the curly girl book and trying this out but this was such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have blond curly hair. I originally tried this product after seeing it win an award for use by people with black curly hair. I love it! I have been using the shamp/conditioner/gel combo for 2 years now. The microfiber towel you can buy to dry before gelling also makes a difference. This product leaves soft curls...no crunchiness.  I&#x27;ve used tons of other products (cheap and expensive alike) and prefer this hands-down to all others.</li>

    <li> These products saved me from cutting my hair to a pixie cut again. What a deal compared to purchasing these at Ulta. I will definately buy again, and again, and again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting with my curly hair my whole life and using the DevaCurl Trio actually made my hair soft, shiny, and frizz-free. It&#x27;s awesome. I wish I found out about this stuff sooner!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly. I recently moved from the humid south to the dry west and my curls turned to flat waves. I had pretty much given up on seeing them revive when I found DevaCurl. It brought them back completely! I use the No-poo, the One-Condition and the Angell and my hair is healthy and very curly! I highly recommend this product to anyone with curly hair!</li>
    <li> I love these products-- my hair dresser used them at the salon and I had to get them. They&#x27;re a little pricey but getting them all together here is a great deal. I highly recommend these for anyone with curly hair!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this for her very curly hair.  She has gone through hundreds of products over the years, and this is by far the best.  We live in a very dry climate, high altitude desert, and her hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, curls defined and well conditioned. Really a great product that now my mom and sister also curly heads are now into.</li>
    <li> full price, would be nice to get them a little cheaper, but that&#x27;s ok.  At least they are bigger size bottles.</li>
