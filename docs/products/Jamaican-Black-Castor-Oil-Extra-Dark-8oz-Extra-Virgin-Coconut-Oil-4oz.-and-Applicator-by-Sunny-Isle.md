<li> Oil to scalp with black castrol and cocunut oil via plastic bottle with tip(my hair was soft and managebale with wide tooth comb- which never happened before) and plat hair in 6 sections.  </li>
<li> It helps with hair growth and dry hair.</li>
<li> I love this thick concoction because I can nourish my edges and use it to slick down my edges instead of using drying, harsh gels.</li>
<li> In addition a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> i will continue use to see if i get the desired results as described in the other feedback.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Sunny Isle in the past but my brother recommended the extra dark and I can see why😀.</li>
<li> I do like how it came packaged and that it helped grow my hair, but the smell is not worth it.</li>
<li> After using the black castrol oil and coconut oil for three weeks now....</li>
<li> Jamaican Black Castor oil has lived up to all of the reviews I came across.</li>
<li> The package was a little rib</li>
<li> It is also really heavy on my hair.</li>
<li> Now it is thick &amp; has a slight oder</li>
<li> No more blow outs for me!</li>
<li> i have been using it but find it very thick for hair use unless you are not going anywhere.  </li>
<li> this oil is very thick</li>
<li> My husband thought it was me that was smelling bad.</li>
<li> I did notice growth with using it, but the smell is absolutely disgusting.</li>
<li> I would use it on my scalp and my ends and my hair would feel disgusting after cowashing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I Love this product,  but it didn&#x27;t come with the bottle in the picture and that&#x27;s what I needed! I&#x27;m no fool! FOOL!</li>
    <li> not greasy at all, great for your scalp</li>
    <li> I really like the way these products made my hair feel. The coconut oil acts as a good sealant and it really helped to moisturizer my scalp as well. As for the JBCO, this really helped to make my hair softer and helped to drastically reduce the amount of breakage and split ends on my hair. Overall, I would definitely give these two products a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no quite sure how I like this product. I did notice growth with using it, but the smell is absolutely disgusting. My husband thought it was me that was smelling bad. I just can&#x27;t. I do like how it came packaged and that it helped grow my hair, but the smell is not worth it. It is also really heavy on my hair. I would use it on my scalp and my ends and my hair would feel disgusting after cowashing. If you can stand the smell then purchase this product, but if you can&#x27;t then try something else like me.</li>
    <li> great service. Arrived on time, no delays.  saw it the next week in a local store, but price was a little higher. will start using product next week.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great buy, would buy again. Shipping was decent. Wrapped very well! Wish there was two bottles but still happy with purchase. 4 stars bc I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really see how effective it is to my hair. When I do use it I shed more so Idk if it&#x27;s normal. Definitely will be checking with my beautician.</li>
    <li> My hair stays soft and hydrated with a rich thickness. This brand of castor oil really saturates the hair shaft and follicle. I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying essential oils to my hair daily. In addition a little goes a long way. Then cocktail mix with the coconut oil adds a natural shine to the hair. If your on the fence, try this product especially for all the 4 Curly girls.</li>
    <li> Love it! makes my hair feel like i pay attention to it. Feels well nourished after usage. The applicator also allows me to mix otheir oils with it as well. It came on time and was packaged very well.</li>

    <li> Castor oil really works. My hairline started to grow after one week. The squirt bottle broke after 3days. 👎👎</li>
    <li> I have had Sisterlocs for over 4+ yrs. now &amp; was told about this product earlier this year. I was also informed to order it from Amazon. I first ordered this product in July and hve been using ir every since. I just purchased my 2nd bottle as I am please w/ the results. My hair is growing &amp; getting thicker. My edges that were almost non-existent hve truly grown in &amp; hopefully by next year I will hve new locs around my hairline. I would recommend this product in a heartbeat &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your hair..Now it is thick &amp; has a slight oder but..I&#x27;m looking forward to the end result.. so who cares..definitely not me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sunny Isle in the past but my brother recommended the extra dark and I can see why😀. An amazing product, I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement in my hair and my husband&#x27;s locs</li>
    <li> Only 4 reviews because I only have used it for three weeks.  After using the black castrol oil and coconut oil for three weeks now.... I am impressed.  I have very, very coarse african american hair which has been natural for the last three years.  I have finally found a product that manages my hair with success. How I Use Them: Saturate hair with cocunut oil, apply plastic cap and sit 15mins under the dryer.  Added black castrol oil  to my chemical free shampoo and wash x 2-3xs; conditioned with my favorite conditioner and towel dried. Oil to scalp with black castrol and cocunut oil via plastic bottle with tip(my hair was soft and managebale with wide tooth comb- which never happened before) and plat hair in 6 sections.  Later that day, I used a hot straightening comb with ease.  Oil my scalp 3-4 times per week because my hair drinks these oils.  No more blow outs for me! I can now manage my own natural hair; with only going to the salon to cut hair into a styles. Yea natural women!</li>
    <li> this oil is very thick but i purchased it based on others feedback.  i have been using it but find it very thick for hair use unless you are not going anywhere.  i will continue use to see if i get the desired results as described in the other feedback.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this oil as I&#x27;m Still waiting on the hair growth 4 months later... Mythical oil, Did not promote hair growth at all.</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time yesterday (Sept 4th).  My hair is curly with frizz.  The frizz is gone and the curl remained.  AWESOME!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to experience the rest of the benefits (longer, stronger hair).  Will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product works!!  You can see results in two weeks!!  I will never be without this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for one month now and my hair is thickening and growing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t arrive like they stated it would. The package was a little rib but that was okay. Glad it did not break because both files or glassThe applicator that came with the two items were so small they could have kept it but you. Will do it update later to let you know how it works for my hair😄</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really helps grow and moisturizer your hair. I use it on my edges two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> I love it will order it again soon, it has a great smell and works great . It helps with hair growth and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Hair growing already! Ready to order more, more than pleased. Recommended for those trying to thicken or grow their hair.</li>
