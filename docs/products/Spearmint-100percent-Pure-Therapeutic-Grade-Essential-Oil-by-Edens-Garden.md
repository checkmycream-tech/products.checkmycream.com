      <li>I really love all your oils..</li>

      <li>but I will be ordering more of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.</li>
      <li>Love this .</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Spearmint is one of my favorite EO&#x27;s and this is spot on.</li>
      <li>compared to Eucalyptus, wintergreen and mint, spearmint is the one I like the most.</li>

      <li>The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price.</li>
      <li>Happy with purchase, Fast Shipping, another great essential oil to add to my collection</li>
      <li>All was packed very well and arrived in good condition.</li>
      <li>The scents are strong.  </li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>This is a very useful product that I use in bath salts and headache mixes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love the smell of spearmint and thats exactly what it smells like.</li>
      <li>Good quality I just started using essential oils</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>The smell is my favorite so far!</li>
      <li>I diffuse it in my home for a fresh and uplifting aroma.</li>
      <li>It makes the house smell minty fresh.</li>
      <li>i use it for fresh breathe</li>
      <li>exactly why.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite fragrance of the essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The scent of this essential oil is rich and minty!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>I enjoy all different spearmint oils</li>
      <li>It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way.</li>
      <li>; I&#x27;m going to use it create my own lotions and foot massage stuff with things I buy from the Dollar store, just a few drops of the oil adds moisture to just about anything without making it greasy.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great and a little goes &amp;#34;A LONG WAY !</li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>This is my second time ordering from Eden&#x27;s Garden, and I will definitely order again. :)</li>
      <li>I like to use a few drops on the vacuum filter to make the whole house smell nice</li>
      <li>The smell was great in the beginning, but became a little off after a little while.</li>
      <li>But I also found that it covers up the smell of new puppies accidents in the house.</li>
      <li>It has a very soft aroma</li>
      <li>I bought this along with 5 other essential oils as part of a Christmas present for my son who is into making his own shampoos.</li>
      <li>I really like the idea that it is oil and not mixed with added substances like perfume.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I had some spearmint lotion that didn&#x27;t really have a scent to it, so I added a few drops of this oil and it created a whole new scent out of the lotion.</li>
      <li>you would normally use essential oils for.</li>
      <li>Both oils are chemically composed of the same elements, arranged in the same configuration but in reverse, as in right and left versions of one another.</li>
      <li>In fact, the strength of this spearmint essential oil really surprised me.</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like Spearmint and not sweet.</li>
      <li>The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing.</li>

<li> A few drops in bath oil creates a fragrant soothing bath as well, it&#x27;s an aromatherapy plus</li>
<li> Have ordered a lot from them in the past.</li>
<li> Also, a few drops in a humidifier/vaporizer in their bedrooms helps with common colds.</li>
<li> Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones.</li>

    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!  Smells amazing. I like to use a few drops on the vacuum filter to make the whole house smell nice (spearmint and grapefruit are a nice combo). Also, I add a few drops to a hot bath tub and sit in the bathroom with my children when someone is a little sniffly or stuffy. Also, a few drops in a humidifier/vaporizer in their bedrooms helps with common colds. This is my second time ordering from Eden&#x27;s Garden, and I will definitely order again. :)</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price.  This is a very useful product that I use in bath salts and headache mixes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful starter eo.</li>
    <li> I really love all your oils..They all meet what I exspect from the oils.Spearmint smells so good.I make a lot of my cleaners,and use the oils for diffusing and for salves and aches and pains.</li>
    <li> This company is awesome to work with. The info sent with their product thorough. The product it&#x27;s self affordable and of good quality.</li>
    <li> The smell of the Spearmint Eden&#x27;s Garden oil is heavenly! One of my favorite scents!</li>
    <li> This smells just like a mint, and I like to combine it with Wintergreen. c:</li>
    <li> Smooth easy transaction! Superb oil!  Repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> I just ordered the 30ml, I was so happy with my bottle in this size. Great, sweet and crisp smell that lingers nicely. I Would suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the quality of both the Spearmint and Caraway oils we purchased. We used them to demonstrate the qualities of smell and differentiation. Both oils are chemically composed of the same elements, arranged in the same configuration but in reverse, as in right and left versions of one another. The sense of smell can register the difference between them even though they are the \\&quot;same\\&quot; chemical. These oils were of sufficient quality and potency to be of good use.</li>
    <li> The smell was great in the beginning, but became a little off after a little while. I am not&lt;br /&gt;sure exactly why. But I use it in my bath and diffuser.</li>
    <li> compared to Eucalyptus, wintergreen and mint, spearmint is the one I like the most. The scemt is sweeter and not as pungent as the other. Pleasing, and it smells great, clean, fresh. Excellent to use in the tub or as an expectorant.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with 5 other essential oils as part of a Christmas present for my son who is into making his own shampoos. He loved all the scents. Edens Garden oils are great. The scents are strong.  This is my second purchase through them.  Service and delivery was prompt.  All was packed very well and arrived in good condition. I will be purchasing additional merchandise through them since my son loves the oils.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality at a great price. It makes the house smell minty fresh.</li>
    <li> Timely deliver, great product, the price is right, and one happy customer that will always buy all my oils from y&#x27;all</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, good quality. I use all around the house.</li>
    <li> i use it for fresh breathe</li>
    <li> The smell is my favorite so far! Smells like spearmint gum! I diffuse it in my home for a fresh and uplifting aroma.</li>
    <li> definitely helps my headaches if I massage into skin &amp; then breathe in!</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase, Fast Shipping, another great essential oil to add to my collection</li>
    <li> Spearmint is one of my favorite EO&#x27;s and this is spot on. It smells exactly like Spearmint and not sweet. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is good peppermint oil. Eden&#x27;s Garden is a good company and their prices are much better than the MLM prices. Have ordered a lot from them in the past.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had some spearmint lotion that didn&#x27;t really have a scent to it, so I added a few drops of this oil and it created a whole new scent out of the lotion. Then I added a few drops to some baby oil and use it to massage my feet daily. This stuff is great and a little goes &amp;#34;A LONG WAY !&amp;#34; I&#x27;m going to use it create my own lotions and foot massage stuff with things I buy from the Dollar store, just a few drops of the oil adds moisture to just about anything without making it greasy. A few drops in bath oil creates a fragrant soothing bath as well, it&#x27;s an aromatherapy plus gem !&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this stuff as part of my health/beauty regime for life.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from Eden&#x27;s Garden three times, and all three times they have messed up my order. The oils are good, maybe not quite as good as the really high cost stuff, but good enough for the price. Unfortunately whomever fulfills the orders does an absolutely terrible job... each time we&#x27;ve ordered quite a few, and every time we&#x27;ve received the wrong ones. The first two times they ended up shipping us the ones that we were missing. Well, the last time I ordered, I filed the same missing product report, and nothing ever received. Even if a replacement was received the last time around, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to fulfill an order properly, the first time around. It really bothers me when a customer is treated this way. Word of warning to those looking to purchase from this seller!</li>
    <li> Very good product, true scent.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love.  The aroma lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> Great product, great company!</li>
    <li> It is what it says. Great for aroma therapy and mixes...great for all things you would normally use essential oils for. Like the brand, myself, and the literature sent helps me figure out future buys (I&#x27;m new to the whole essintial oils game)</li>
    <li> Great! As described and even included literature.</li>
    <li> It is good quality oil</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s great for making homemade toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! Good quality I just started using essential oils but I will be ordering more of Eden&#x27;s Garden oils. The price was not prohibitive as some others.</li>
    <li> It has a very soft aroma</li>
    <li> Bought this because it&#x27;s suppose to keep insects out of the house, if you mix it with water and spray around windows and door frames.  But I also found that it covers up the smell of new puppies accidents in the house.</li>
    <li> ALL OF EDEN GARDEN OIL SMELL WONDERFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of oils at work and this is by far the best deal. All their products are just as good and I continue to order them time after time. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a minty chique ... I enjoy all different spearmint oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my room is minty I am always happy</li>
    <li> Great smell to wake up to. I really like the idea that it is oil and not mixed with added substances like perfume. I use it as perfume or mix it with my lip-gloss to add a little bit of flavor.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrance of the essential oils.  I use it in my diffuser, the aroma is so relaxing.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of spearmint and thats exactly what it smells like. I got this to add to a lotion i was going to make for my sister. She wants to smell like a stick of delicious gum lol.</li>
    <li> Put on abdomen for cramps.</li>
    <li> I use as a cleansing ingredient when washing doors gives a great smell that lasts quite a while. love it</li>
    <li> Product is what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this . Product on time definatly purchase again</li>
    <li> The scent of this essential oil is rich and minty! In fact, the strength of this spearmint essential oil really surprised me. I used 3 drops in diffuser and had to move the diffuser back! Yes indeed it was quite spearminty and I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
