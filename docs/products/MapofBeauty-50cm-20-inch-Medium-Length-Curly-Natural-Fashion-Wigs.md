      <li>One of my favorite wigs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this...</li>
      <li>I liked that it did have free shipping, though.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and great wigs, I am totally satisfied with every one!</li>
      <li>Very easy to put on, and you can adjust to fit your head.  </li>
      <li>The hair fibers themselves seem to be good quality--and are surprisingly realistic--but the craftsmanship of the wig itself is only okay.</li>
      <li>hair on top is very sparse, it came in tangled and it took me a good 20 minutes and lots of detangler to get it</li>
      <li>Fits good even on my kinda large head.</li>
      <li>Got it for Halloween, it&#x27;s cheap and looks pretty good.</li>
      <li>Easy to maintain</li>
      <li>I have dark hair, which shows through the wig unless it is perfectly arranged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Looks and feels great, a little warm though&lt;</li>
      <li>Lotsa fun 2 wear, we are so glad I ordered it, boyfriend loves tp take pictures of me.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a fantastic value for the money.</li>
      <li>I was worried that it would be all tangled and that the hairs would look like those cheap frizzy wigs - I worried for nothing.  </li>
      <li>lol Overall,it turned out to be a very pretty blonde wig!</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, very nice long hair.</li>
      <li>Ordered this to use for the various plays I put on and besides a great price they feel and look totally real!  </li>
      <li>but I definitely would not wear this to a con, good for just Halloween.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good enough for costumes and cosplays.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price, but...beware if your hair is darker than the color of the wig.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The wig itself is a bit more yellow than it is in the picture but its a decently believable color.</li>
      <li>and I honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for more for this price...better than I expected</li>
      <li>Cute and arrived super early!</li>
      <li>, it was my first wig!</li>
      <li>I only use this item on my live size silicon doll and it looks great on her</li>
      <li>And, it really made it look much more realistic!</li>
      <li>Hey I don&#x27;t expect much with these wigs as they are cheap...</li>
      <li>I bought it for fun, but I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments.</li>
      <li>SOOOO WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
      <li>Wig seems pretty true to color as pictured; I had to trim the bangs but can be styled with bangs to the side.</li>
      <li>So,I took my dark brown sharpie ,and put in on the roots,to try to make it look more believable.</li>
      <li>this was a little lighter than i thought it was going to be, but i really liked it!  </li>
      <li>Pretty and complimentary.</li>
      <li>Also, the color is more of a platinum blonde than strawberry blonde, which worked out great for me, but just be aware of that if you&#x27;re looking for a more natural blonde.</li>
      <li>; it&#x27;s good enough quality for a costume, but not everyday wear.</li>
      <li>Came in earlier than estimated, long, curly, beautiful color.</li>
      <li>Overall I love it</li>
      <li>I love blonde color.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be ordering more shades from this company.</li>
      <li>The bangs were exactly the length i was hoping they&#x27;d be.</li>
      <li>I got this to wear for a Honey Lemon cosplay (Big Hero 6) and if I had no head band to wear on top</li>
      <li>Well,first of all,it came pretty quickly,(about 2 weeks)..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hey I don&#x27;t expect much with these wigs as they are cheap...I cut the bang shorter and the length...I&#x27;m really pleased with this...I took pictures and I honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for more for this price...better than I expected, it was my first wig! It is shiny and I&#x27;ll powder it down a bit and it&#x27;ll be perfect... man I&#x27;m nearly 50 and this made my day!</li>
    <li> SOOOO WORTH THE MONEY. You won&#x27;t regret it. Came in earlier than estimated, long, curly, beautiful color. Nothing wrong! Bangs are meant to be parted to the side if you think it&#x27;s too long. I&#x27;m definitely buying from this seller again!</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful wig. It came a little over my time limit, but I suppose that was because it was coming from Hong Kong and I did not choose 2-day shipping. I liked that it did have free shipping, though. It is a very good price for such an amazing wig! The volume is incredible, and it stays curly! The color is exactly as it stated in the product picture. The bangs were a little longer than it said it would be, but I&#x27;m fine with that. The wig arrived in a small package, and when opened, in a net bag. Once I took it out, the curls bounced with incredible volume, and it looks and feels like real hair! It does not have the shiny plastic coating like most wigs do. It goes down to about my waist, and the wig even came with a wig cap. It frizzes out at the least bit, but that can be easily brushed out with a wig brush. It doesn&#x27;t lose any strands of hair at all. My only concern is that I have just one of them! I would definitely buy from this product seller again.</li>
    <li> very soft and bouncy curls. does tangle a bit. its a bit lighter than the photo but its still a very beautiful wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright for a bargain wig</li>
    <li> The wig arrived a lot earlier than expected.. well sorta.. it came here when I wasn&#x27;t home so they didn&#x27;t deliver.. apparently I had to sign for it which is odd to me.. but after I got the mail straightened out it still came sooner than I expected. The wig itself is a bit more yellow than it is in the picture but its a decently believable color. Although the bangs are super long so those have to be trimmed. Ive got them in a side swoop but without my glasses it just falls in my face. Its also a bit small.. it may be because I have a lot of hair but still its a lot smaller than I expected, just barely fits my head. Its decent quality, bought a wig from walmart for like a dollar or two less and this wig is 100000000 times better! it tangles a little but its not like complete snarls so you can easily brush it out. There is a bit of a shine to it but with a good washing or two it starts to tone down. would I buy it again? probably.</li>
    <li> It looks real pretty and natural, but I&#x27;m going to trim it even with my hair length. Can&#x27;t beat price. Took awhile to come in.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, but...beware if your hair is darker than the color of the wig. The hair fibers themselves seem to be good quality--and are surprisingly realistic--but the craftsmanship of the wig itself is only okay. I have dark hair, which shows through the wig unless it is perfectly arranged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All points considered, you get what you pay for; it&#x27;s good enough quality for a costume, but not everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Plenty of hair and a nice color, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Not shiny at all (mainly what I was looking for). Looks like a natural blond color. There is a spot where the cap shows (bangs) but I&#x27;m sure it is fixable.</li>
    <li> I got this to wear for a Honey Lemon cosplay (Big Hero 6) and if I had no head band to wear on top I wouldn&#x27;t bother and get a nicer wig. hair on top is very sparse, it came in tangled and it took me a good 20 minutes and lots of detangler to get it acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it isn&#x27;t bad but I definitely would not wear this to a con, good for just Halloween.</li>
    <li> I like it. No problems</li>
    <li> Awesome wig! Very cute! Love how it looks on! I could wear this every day not just for halloween! I would recommend this wig for anyone who is looking for a cute and sassy look!</li>
    <li> Yeow wee, transform into a sexy nymph. Lotsa fun 2 wear, we are so glad I ordered it, boyfriend loves tp take pictures of me. Will definitely be ordering more shades from this company. ThankU&#x27;ll</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and falls off your head</li>
    <li> I only use this item on my live size silicon doll and it looks great on her</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, very nice long hair. Bieng used for Cosplay. I am very happy with this product. Easy to maintain</li>
    <li> It is a pretty blonde shade. But the weave and bangs make it look fake though i think with a hat or something it would look real. I already have long hair so when i put my hair up it is hard to make it not look like there is a bulge coming out of it. I have to play with it. It arrived quickly. I also order the red wine wig from them. I think i like that one better.</li>
    <li> Got it for Halloween, it&#x27;s cheap and looks pretty good. People thought this was real hair? Maybe they were really drunk.&lt;br /&gt;If you can pull off a hat with your costume it&#x27;s better since the mesh shows through somewhat.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels great, a little warm though&lt;br /&gt;looks like the picture</li>
    <li> its ok for halloween, etc.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a very nice wig. It feels very soft and not plasticy at all. So far as I have worked with it, it has not tangled. I would say its not really strawberry blonde however, its more of a very light blonde. The waves are very nice. it feels nice too. If you have dark hair however, it will show through the crown, it is not the thickest. You can resolve this with a tan wig cap however. Good buy!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> For the price it is nice.  Just don&#x27;t expect a ton of hair...</li>
    <li> This wig came earlier than expected and looks amazing, the only problems I had were that you could see a little of my hair under it and that it was a bit big, and I came with knots in it. But besides that it feels amazing and came with a wig cap which was great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little on the small side, in terms of the cap inside, its rather snug to be more specific, but it&#x27;s incredibly pretty, it came out of the bag curled and very gorgeous. All in all, it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Much more natural than I had expected. It was somewhat long for me, but I had not trouble trimming. Pretty and complimentary.</li>
    <li> I have a big head, so I&#x27;m not surprised! Still very fun, I&#x27;m afraid to brush out the tangles it&#x27;s accumulated over time though, too much fallout.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome wig for the price. Gets tangled a little more easily than I like, but put a hat on with it, and it looks natural. I bought it for fun, but I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little small for my head. I&#x27;ve been looking at tutorials online to see if there&#x27;s a way to help stretch it out or something.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy this wig, or not, bc, I saw another wig JUST like it,sold on another site, that got terrible reviews.Well,first of all,it came pretty quickly,(about 2 weeks)..So I was pleasantly surprised ,about that, coming all the way from China! When it came,it was kinda stuffed into a small gray shipping bag,and,the wig was in a zip lock bag, with a free wig net cap. I pulled it out, and it was covered by a thin black net.So,I took that off. And,it was SO long and very fluffy. Actually,it was just a bit TOO fluffy ,and SO light blonde! So,I took my dark brown sharpie ,and put in on the roots,to try to make it look more believable.I took some photos and uploaded one. It looked ok,I guess,but,still pretty fake looking.So,later,I took some of my Aussie Spray leave-in conditioner, and sprayed it all through the wig.I let it dry, overnight. And, it really made it look much more realistic! Almost like the photos on here! I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s what they did! lol Overall,it turned out to be a very pretty blonde wig! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like its design but I guess it&#x27;s just a bad color for me. It seemed darker then the picture when it arrived. Wasn&#x27;t all that bad though.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig for the price. I wore it with a hood so it didn&#x27;t matter that it was a little thin on top. If you stare really hard at the top of your head you may see the cap but not really. I&#x27;ll try attach  some photos....</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig. Good quality. Excellent price. I really enjoyed wearing this!</li>
    <li> I like it, but the color is not for me...a bit too flyaway!</li>
    <li> It is not strawberry blonde. It is just regular blonde.  It is a good quality though.  One of my favorite wigs.</li>
    <li> I do like the wig, and it comes with a hair cap and net, however it is more of a bright bleach blonde rather than strawberry blonde.  Not the color I was expecting.  Oh well. I think I will keep it and use it for an Elsa (from Frozen) costume.</li>
    <li> Great wig for cosplay.. It is a great wig but you do indeed get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Wig seems pretty true to color as pictured; I had to trim the bangs but can be styled with bangs to the side. Need wig hairspray so the lace doesn&#x27;t show in front.  Perfect for halloween where it may not be noticeable or perhaps dinner and a movie.</li>
    <li> Cute and arrived super early!</li>
    <li> it was a nice color, not too shiny but it was a little on thin side. You should probably wear a hat with it.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Looks just like the photo, came in good time.</li>
    <li> i bought this wig because i always wanted blonde hair and for some reason... my actual hair will NOT dye blonde or too any light color what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;so i bought this wig with reviews all saying that it looked real and everyone thought it was real. it sounded like a good buy. i was so excited when i finally got this in the mail after a 3 week wait. i put it on and it was terrible. the color is MUCH MUCH lighter. almost a platinum blonde. this looks like something i might get from a childrens Halloween costume. save your money. spend it on a higher quality wig. this will never be worn. it is just now a decoration in my beauty room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THE WIG</li>
    <li> i LOVE LOVE LOVE MY WIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT CAME JUST IN TIME FOR MY HALLOWEEN PARTY</li>
    <li> I bought this wig because I&#x27;m a kids&#x27; party entertainer with auburn hair who ends up playing characters of every hair color, and I needed a wig to use for Elsa. When I first got it and put it on, my first impression was that it&#x27;s WAY too small. I have a pretty small head, and it still doesn&#x27;t fit correctly. However, after a little more experimenting (Since this was my first wig since I was little and used to get Disney Store wigs), I found that the main problem was that my hair wasn&#x27;t flat enough in the wig cap (Side note: They provide a wig cap, but it&#x27;s black, so I&#x27;d recommend getting a skin tone cap), so now I French braid my hair all around my head. Now it works for characters like Elsa, Alice, Aurora, and even Rapunzel. It looks unnatural pulled straight back, so don&#x27;t expect it to slick back easily. Also, the color is more of a platinum blonde than strawberry blonde, which worked out great for me, but just be aware of that if you&#x27;re looking for a more natural blonde. Probably not one you&#x27;d want to wear on a daily basis, but it&#x27;s good enough for costumes and cosplays.</li>
    <li> The color is not the same as pictured</li>
    <li> Good for costumes and worth it for the price. Fits as expected, it&#x27;s a little more ashy in color than in the photo.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Not totally natural looking, but still very pretty.</li>
    <li> This wig is so pretty the blonde looks so natural its not a bleach blonde color its a very pretty blonde color!!! It looks great!!!</li>
    <li> this was a little lighter than i thought it was going to be, but i really liked it!  everyone thought it looked realistic and i have really dark brown hair!</li>
    <li> I love blonde color. I love curl and shiny wig.</li>
    <li> I should have bought 2! This wig came in great condition, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since it was cheap and coming from China. However, it&#x27;s beautiful. Color is a bit lighter that I thought but is still very natural and pretty. It&#x27;s quite long and soft, quite curly. Sheds, tangles, and frizzes a bit, but brushes out well with a wig brush. Mine came with a very thick bang, but with some tucking and adjusting it&#x27;s easily manages (See my customer photos for more detail). Overall I love it, it&#x27;s a fantastic value for the money. Took roughly about as long as they estimated to arrive, and came in a bag with a very nice wig cap.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to use for the various plays I put on and besides a great price they feel and look totally real!  I bought a bunch of other ones in different colors and styles from this seller.  Super fast shipping and great wigs, I am totally satisfied with every one!</li>
    <li> For 10 dollars this wig exceeded my expectations.  I bought it for my cosplay costume and its perfect. The bangs were exactly the length i was hoping they&#x27;d be. The only thing I didnt like was that I cant really part it the way I want. But its a wig and it was 10 bucks how can you beat that? So i can deal with it. besides that its perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this wig but I can&#x27;t do the clips in the back because even the loosest fit is too tight &amp; gives me a major headache. I have to tuck them in on the sides. Still love this wig &amp; wear it all the time. A lot of people have mistaken it for being my real hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the bangs, but overall I&#x27;m impressed with how this looks</li>
    <li> Fits good even on my kinda large head. I never had A wig before. First one. Glad I bought tho. I thought my BF was gonna rape me when I surprised him with this and tiny mini dress Lol!</li>
    <li> I wore this for a Halloween party, and I had 20+ people ask me where I got this wig.  It looks uh-mazing.  Very high quality.  I was worried that it would be all tangled and that the hairs would look like those cheap frizzy wigs - I worried for nothing.  Very easy to put on, and you can adjust to fit your head.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
