<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i absolutely love this perfume! and i was excited that I found it at such a great price on amazon! to top it off it came very fast!</li>
    <li> Great perfume, great brand. Everybody likes this one. I recommend not only this one but the entire collection. Great acquisition.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Burberry. My girlfriend always loved my tie and noticed the pattern on this perfume and instantly said \\&quot;That matches your tie!\\&quot;. I played it off like I had no idea what she was talking about, sampled it at a department store, and liked it. Purchased it here online and saved a lot of money! She absolutely loves it! Fresh and clean smelling (and NOT soapy or floral!). Classic Burberry brilliance!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend as a gift for my girl. she wears it all the time now, and i just cant get enough of that classy smell.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe what a bargain I got. This smells GREAT. Lots of compliments and it stays with you.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume.  I like it very much as well.  I was glad to find it at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Burberry London is one of my favorite fragrances and is a good choice to wear at work - it&#x27;s a light, but lovely and feminine fragrance.  The price was much lower than Ulta, Macy&#x27;s or any direct retailer&#x27;s pricing.  Thank you for the great pricing and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> This product was purchased as a birthday gift for my sister. In the early 1990s I loved Burberry London, Eau De Parfum. The 2010 version of Burberry London is not what it use to be.  I actually liked the old version FAR better than the new. I gave it to my sister anyway and she claims to love it. I called local dept store to inquire about the parfum before giving to my sister.  I was going to compare what I rec&#x27;d with that at dept store but the sales rep informed me that it is different recipe than in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I wear this everyday and always get compliments on it. On the train, at work, out on the weekends. Sometimes it gets a little creepy how many times a day I get told I smell nice. I guess that&#x27;s a lot better than being told you smell bad!</li>
    <li> Not all fragrances work on all people, but if this works on you... well let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;ve had more than a few people (men and women) want to get a 2nd sniff. I feel sexy when I wear it. The only downside to Burberry is the little coats the bottles wear. I have to get creative to see how much is left.</li>
    <li> for this price it&#x27;s an excellent grab the smell is very fine &amp;  strong enough that my husband should love it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girl friend. It is a pretty mature smell. I would recommend it for older women (30-40 years old). I would definitely buy it again. Best price on Amazon. Good packaging and a cool bottle.</li>
    <li> I tried this in Sephora and loved its smell very much, but I thinks it&#x27;s a little expensive. Then I found this one on amazon. It&#x27;s really a good price but the moment I received it I knew it&#x27;s a fake one. It smelled totally different from the really one. I&#x27;m so disappointed with amazon, and what&#x27;s disappointed me more is it&#x27;s from amazon prime. I won&#x27;t buy anything from this website again.</li>
    <li> Great product. The scent it carries is really wonderful. This perfume pleased my girlfriend very much and I will buy her another bottle once her current one runs out.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is sexy and classy. It&#x27;s lovely scent is good enough for people to take notice, and compliment you too. Trust me, I have received numerous compliments based on this fragrance. Fast Shipping by Amazon as well always makes it a plus!!! Excellent Product!!</li>
    <li> I got a smaller bottle of this for Christmas 2009.  She liked it so much she asked for it again.  I hadn&#x27;t seen the price for this anywhere near what I got it from here for.  She still likes it and I think it smells good on her.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I think it lasts all day and more, I got mine at a dept store so I know its the real deal, I sprayed some on this morning and when i took my clothes off my skin smelled like it tonite, so it lasts for me. My husband loves it, its light enough to be worn at night and sexy enough for everyday.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly! Giving as a gift so timeliness was important! Would definitely order from again!</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas last year and I love it! I put just a spary on each wrist and it lasts all day...I get compliments on it all the time. It&#x27;s a great classic perfume you can wear every day. It&#x27;s very elegant and not too flowery/fruity/musky as alot of perfumes are.</li>
    <li> I absolutley love this perfume! It has a beutiful scent that is strong enough to stay with you for a while but not overwhelming. I have people walk past me and say \\&quot;excuse me what kind of perfume are you wearing?\\&quot; I just love that! It has been my husbands fave so far too! The price between $39-$45 is a great deal!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy that I got this for a great price ($42), especially with all the hype the departmental stores created about this being the best Burberry for women. As early as the second day, I felt nauseous and the scent still gives me a feel of wearing a very strong smelling hair oil!!!! The same day, I decided to pass it on to my family and friends if by any chance they like it (:~()     To me, the regular Burberry Brit and even Burberry Weekend are way better choices than this one! You get almost the same deal on those easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it!  It was nicely packaged and was delivered really quickly.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> According to the packaging and the bottom, it looks like a fake.   The smell is just fine.  It is not what I expected for.</li>
    <li> Burberry London By Burberry For Women is as the title states!  Very pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday, and she really liked it. Although it&#x27;s not one of the newest in the market, it still is one of the good ones out there.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume. I receive many compliments when I wear it. Has a lasting smell, flowery smell. Great for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Burberry, especially London.  Great price, and excellent, fast shipping. It only took one day for me to receive the item! I ordered it in the afternoon and had it at my door the next morning. Would definitely buy from them (Fragrance Net) again.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift to my daughter in law and she loves it. Exactly what the pic said it was and smells so good!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like strong perfumes this is a good choice. It&#x27;s subtle and tasteful. I chose the free shipping from Amazon and it arrive surprisingly fast.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing!! My friends and my boyfriend love it too! And this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.</li>
    <li> What???  Found my signature fragrance at half the price!  How sweet is that!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the large bottle....Exactly as pictured.  Extremely pleased with the product&lt;br /&gt;and the service.</li>
    <li> This is a product I can&#x27;t live without.  This was the absolute best deal I could find, and the product arrived in only a few days.</li>
    <li> this was recommended to me by a friend as a gift for my girl. she wears it all the time now, and i just cant get enough of that classy smell</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this, she had this to say:    The covering of the Burberry is really nice. The scent is a classic and Burberry is a must! Any woman would appreciate it as a gift &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume cause its the only one my wife wears, When I received it the spray valve did not work, I had to rig it in order for her to use it then to our surprise it smelled of alcohol with a hint of the original scent. This Perfume must be extremely old and dated.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling perfume.  I&#x27;m not usually one for flowery scents, but something about this one just appealed to me.  Unfortunately, like some other reviewers have commented, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I spray it on in the morning before walking out the door and by the time I get to work, I swear the scent has disappeared.  Granted, my commute to work is about 2 hours but, come on, that&#x27;s not long enough for perfume (it&#x27;s too long for a commute though!).  Is asking for at least 10-12 hours asking too much?  So, only 3 stars from me.</li>
    <li> The perfume came really fast smells BEAutiful the only thing i think its a little old. But overall I do recommend this seller :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance! It&#x27;s light but leaves a lasting impression. Nice especially for more formal settings, but also for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This perfume is nice and sticks with me all day.  Get many compliments every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really good but as many others reviewers said, it does not last longer than 1H.   I hate the fact that i paid $35 for one perfume that is just a Counterfeit!!!!!   Don&#x27;t waste your money on this One.    Anyway, the perfume smells great, I will probably go to some store that sells the original Burberry London and buy one that lasts on me.   I hope it helped!!! :)</li>
    <li> Took forever to ship, but was great when it finally arrived.  No tracking info and shipped priorty mail.  Got nervous since it was for Christmas, but when it came it was in perfect condition (amazing since there was no packing in the box, just a small box in a bigger box).  I love this perfume and now so does my daughter.  Great product at a unheard of price!  Would order from them again.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it and i love it on her. this is her second bottle i think she would drink it if she could</li>
    <li> My Favorite perfume so far, my husband thinks i smell yummy!! a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> i dont go to the mall so ordering online is perfect. this is a great scent. LOVE it. Burberry scents are great</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted to Burberry fragrances!  I got a sample sprayer of this with an order from a beauty supplier, and not having worn perfume for over 10 years, I was like a kid at the candy counter with this.  I ordered this for myself for my birthday, and could hardly contain myself from opening it early.  It&#x27;s soft enough to wear on the job, and sexy enough to wear to bed.  I got a mini set of 5 Burberry fragrances, and frankly, I&#x27;m on a quest to obtain all of the full sizes!  Great price here and free shipping is always a bonus!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d. the item quickly. Scent is wonderful. Size is large, and was the same price I would have paid for the 1/7 fl. oz. size in my local up-scale dept. store. Very satisfied. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. It is easy to wear and not as heavy as the other Burberry scents. It seems lighter and younger.</li>
    <li> We ordered this product as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter.  It arrived on time and as advertised.  My Granddaughter was delighted with her gift</li>
    <li> I recieved my product very quickly. No complaints about the service at all. The fragrance is wonderful. However, it&#x27;s not long lasting at all. I spray it where I can check out the sent later and there is nothing there. If I had to pay cash I&#x27;d rather go to the mall and purchase (I&#x27;ve made perfume purchase before on this site with another vender and my complaint is the same,,,,fragrance don&#x27;t last). Would I still purchase? As long as I recieve gift certificates I will because I love designer fragrances and would use them for purchases. I give the 3 star because the fragrance simply don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> THIS DOESN&#x27;T SMELL NEARLY AS NICE AS THE LAST BOTTLE I BOUGHT.  HAS THE QUALITY CHANGED?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEOPLE CAN&#x27;T EVEN SMELL IT ON ME, I USE TO GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Burberry London for years from Amazon and I love it. So does everyone else. I get compliments every time I wear it, which is all the time. The perfume is beautiful, sexy, and sophisticated - not overpowering. It&#x27;s also not spicy, sweet or citrusy. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> The scent is fresh, delicious easily my favorite on her. Not teeny cooper sweet nor old like Channel #5. This is a nice fragrance</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. It&#x27;s one of those fragrances that makes people ask you about it. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on it. I will continue to where it all year.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Not overwhelming or cheap smelling and the price is excellent. My all time favorite perfume for any occassion.</li>
    <li> I was well pleased with this product.  I especially was impressed with the fragrance and the cost of the product.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to use any other perfumes since discovering this amazing scent. This scent lasts for days in my hair even though I wash my hair daily or every other day. Not a strong smell, and not much is needed. I did, however notice that the price jumped just several days after I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> The absolute best and long lasting. I am asked quite often &amp;#34;what do you have on&amp;#34; I have passed the website to my friend</li>
    <li> It feels a little silly to review a perfume, as scent is such a completely subjective thing. Not only that, but no perfume will smell the same on everyone. However, this is my personal favorite perfume, and really the only one I wear. I am not much into perfumes and heavily scented lotions to begin with, and one of my biggest pet peeves in the workplace are people who slather themselves with too much fragrance. I also don&#x27;t care for overly feminine scents. On both counts, Burberry London delivers for me: it is very light and if it does have floral notes like so many say, I definitely would not describe it as flowery. As a matter of fact, if a man were to wear it, I would find it very sexy. I guess that&#x27;s why I like it--I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a woman all day, because I don&#x27;t like the over-flowery, fruity fragrances chosen by so many women, but I definitely like how men smell! This perfume makes me feel like I&#x27;m smelling a pleasant but not overly masculine cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that when I apply it in the morning, it goes on very light and people at work rarely even notice that I&#x27;m wearing anything--once in a great while, someone will compliment me on it, while someone else will then remark that they didn&#x27;t even know I wore perfume. Again, this is what I&#x27;m after with perfume in the workplace. However, if I apply it in the afternoon/evening, it becomes much more potent, so much so that I have to wash a bit of it off to dilute it.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite Burberry scent, actually it&#x27;s my favorite perfume there is. It&#x27;s too bad the big box stores stopped carrying it....but sure glad I could find it online! LOVE!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite scent! It lasts nicely all day without being over-powering. The shipping was incredibly fast and the product is perfect..no complaints...I love it!!</li>
    <li> Very classy scent. Very strong. Spray sparingly, a little goes a long way. Lasts all day. Will receive many compliments.</li>
    <li> The shiping was fast, nothing to complain about the servis, just it wasn&#x27;t, as good as I expect, the fragance is to sweett when you try it on, I start getting headeches, even if I use very little, to strong.</li>
    <li> I was amazed and thrilled when I found my fave parfum on amazon for half the price. Hooray! Was worth the wait instead of instantly buying in the store. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It came really fast and smells great. I bought 2 because this is my faborite fragrance. I&#x27;ve received many compliments and a few of my girlfriends have also started wearing it.</li>
    <li> I smelt this perfume and what i got smelt totally different.  i did not like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer dissappointed</li>
    <li> It was the product that I ordererd, however, it was the \\&quot;Tester\\&quot; bottle.  The \\&quot;Tester\\&quot; bottle, really???&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a new bottle of perfume. No where in the description from the seller did it say that I would be recieving the \\&quot;tester\\&quot; bottle. The word \\&quot;tester\\&quot; was written on both bottle and the box. And, there was no cap on the valve, either. To make matters worse, I purchased this for a gift. I never did give it to the recipient.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine doing so.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> Came in quicker than excpected. And the bottle is huge! Much larger than my other perfume bottles. Burberry London is my favorite scent, and my boyfriend&#x27;s too</li>
    <li> Really, really like this perfume!  It stays on all day and has a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering!!  So glad I decided to give it a try!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know the smell even. But my wife likes it. Still unpacked. I will be happy if my wife is happy. (:</li>
    <li> I love how it smell, this is my second one. And the good thing is it good for Women AND MEN. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this parfum for a few years now and it&#x27;s my favorite by far!!  Nice light scent is just perfect for me</li>
    <li> A lady at my church wears Brit, which smells good on her, but I REALLY LOVE Burberry London.  It has a great smell!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I had ordered and at a great price. Same quality of parfum from a big retailer.</li>
    <li> Perfum arrived quickly and exactly as described; It was an excellent price, and my wife loves it as usual too.</li>
    <li> I bought this parfume at burberry and it smells different than this one.&lt;br /&gt;This is totally fake because it does not stay long. after one hour, it is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I did not open and use it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas but found out she still had a half bottle so now I use it.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine, except custom fee&#x27;s in my country. I pay 30 $ custom fee&#x27;s for this item.................shame.I still can&#x27;t believe ..........</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Very florally and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;However, do NOT order it here. The product that I got was very watered down. The smell of the perfume is faintly present, but it fades within minutes of putting it on. Also, to add insult to injury, the nozzle broke, so I can&#x27;t even use the perfume as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the real Burberry London and I would suggest that to anyone, but do not order it from here. I&#x27;m very disappointed in Amazon. This might be one of those times where it&#x27;s worth it to go to the store and buy it.</li>
