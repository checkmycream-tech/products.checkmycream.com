<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps nails from flying everywhere. Good construction and solid feel. I use it on kids too. You will probably need to use another clipper for &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; clipping areas up tight against the skin at times as you won&#x27;t be able to see with these clippers at times. Very nice, neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> Should have puchased this a long time ago</li>
    <li> This clipper is excellent. It however works a bit too well so make sure you are careful when clipping: you may clip too much or cut into flesh.</li>
    <li> Excellent sharpness and short travel path of the blades make it easy to use. However, you probably will still need something else for your feet (these are made specifically for hands)</li>
    <li> I just cut my nails, forgot my nail file, but the file at the bottom of the case actually worked pretty well. I say this cause the Seki Edge Nail Clipper will cut your nails easily, but leaves it quite sharp or rough. Basically they need to be filed. I see no problem with this, but in case you need to cut, but don&#x27;t have a nail file with you the one on the bottom of the holder will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, about the clipper itself, its a good size, and is easy to use. It will cut a huge thick toe nail with ease and I like the thumb indent on the tip of the lever, makes it more ergonomic and easy to squeeze. Sometimes I feel like its a bit flimsy where the top lever is attached, but I think its because I don&#x27;t feel any tension or tightness when I fold it into clipping mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, easy to use and will cut a thick nail quick...no need to clip twice to cut through that huge toe nail.</li>
    <li> One of the best nailclippers I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;ve been through alot.  Stays sharp and the white plastic holder holds your nails so you can throw it afterwards.  The only issue is that if your cutting toe nails, you can take off the white plastic so you can have more space.  Mine says made in Japan and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Best nail clipper, by far, that I have ever used.  Just bought a second one ... my wife needed one after seeing mine.</li>
    <li> Worked like advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. Very sharp and does a nice job. The plastic catching case is kind of a joke. I just take the clippers out and use them.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are super sharp, which obviously you want in nail clippers, but I find them to be crazy slippery. I don&#x27;t have arthritis or anything, but I have a hard time gripping these and have nicked myself, and my son with these. I sound like a total klutz, but the Tweezerman ones I had before and lost just worked better for me.</li>
    <li> Very bulky and difficult to use.  It doesn&#x27;t have the small file used the clean under nails either.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> these are realy easy to squeeze to clip your nails. good leverage. very sharp. the file is very sharp also.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; pair of clippers instead of the cheap ones I usually get.  She won&#x27;t use these either.  I find the plastic (probably added for old or arthritic hands) to be cumbersome and get in the way.  I take them out of the plastic to use them.  Unfortunately, the file is in the plastic which makes it almost unusable for me.</li>
    <li> Works better than normal/cheap drug store bought clippers.  Should last many years.  But not the super duper item that some reviews project.  Plastic housing has built in nail file on bottom.  Doesn&#x27;t have a cuticle &#x27;digger&#x27; (for lack of knowing what to call the little tool that helps to dig around the cuticle and nail bed).</li>
    <li> Quality blade and cuts wells, but it is a pygmy size clipper, especially in the hands of a man.  It is so small for my &#x27;average male&#x27; hand that it is downright uncomfortable and it fall out of my hand at least twice with each clipping. For a small hand this clipper would work fine but ADVOID if you have large hands.</li>
    <li> Really Sharp. Collects well. easy to empty. Better than the other one i have</li>
    <li> This is a good quality clipper. It&#x27;s nice and sharp and doesn&#x27;t send clippings all over the room. It is also sturdy and I expect it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> These are the most amazing fingernail clippers ever. I was a little hesitant to spend the extra money on these versus the usual cheap nail clippers I get at Wal-mart but after reading other reviews I decided to go for it and I&#x27;m glad I did. The problem I always had with the cheap nail clippers is that one side of the clippers or the other was always dull and wouldn&#x27;t clip the nails well. I was always trying to maneuver them into different positions to get a clean cut. Also, my nails were always a bit rough for the first 12-24 hrs after cutting my nails. Not with the Seki clippers. The Seki clippers are very sharp, clip the nails effortlessly and leave them smooth. These may cost more than the standard nail clipper but they&#x27;re worth every penny! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the clipping catcher device, but I don&#x27;t like those on any clippers. Not a big deal, I just pulled it off and through it away. The fingernail file is part of the clipping catcher though so be aware of that if that&#x27;s important to you. Like I said though, they leave my nails very smooth anyway so the file is unnecessary anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m writing a review for nail clippers, but these are amazing. I picked them up because I was tired of the pharmacy clippers that often seem blunt or defective causing them to cut unevenly (or at all). These are very very sharp, the blades are lined up perfectly, and the fingernail catcher is a nice bonus that actually works! As an aside, I accidentally put them in a bag with some glasses. In the process of luggage getting tossed around they put a couple of deep grooves into one of the lenses. Be careful &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Very finely made for a simple tool that is most often made poorly. A pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to overanalyze something that just clips nails.  But what this thing does, it does well.  It&#x27;s built strongly, its easy to hold, it makes precise and accurate cuts, and it catches clippings without flinging them all ofer the floor of the room you&#x27;re in.  It feels like a completely different instrument than the disposable drugstore models I&#x27;ve been using for decades.  Of course this is expensive for what it does, but in the big picture I think this is a fairly small splurge that you won&#x27;t regret making.</li>
    <li> Match my expectations. Efficient, with a cutted mail case &amp; not to big.&lt;br /&gt;As the picture shows it is not really beautiful either but I do not care.</li>
    <li> I realize we&#x27;re only talking nail clippers here but once you use these bad boys you&#x27;ll never go back to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; clippers again.  Not only are they sharp and easy to use but I simply love the nail clippings catcher.  Also, I&#x27;ve never understood why they bother adding files to metal clippers....I&#x27;ve never liked steel files; they just don&#x27;t work.  I usually need to dig up a wooden file if any shaping or smoothing is needed.  The file on this clipper is different.  I tried it out and found it to function well ( at least for my minimal needs ) so I didn&#x27;t have to hunt one up.  When I&#x27;m done, I leave this pretty thing out on display in my bath...it looks that nice.  I highly recommend this brand and style of nail clipper.  They&#x27;re expensive, true enough, but they&#x27;re also likely to be the last pair you&#x27;ll have to buy (unless folks start stealing them from the bathroom).</li>
    <li> It was better then expected.</li>
    <li> Just joining all the positive reviews to say that this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. :)</li>
    <li> I had been buying those $2-3 nail clippers that just dont \\&quot;cut it\\&quot;. This one does exactly what is says it does. Cant ask for more. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love them!  So sharp, best clippers ever!  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are pretty decent. They are sharp so your nails won&#x27;t crack. However, the trapper doesn&#x27;t work well. The nail falls out easily. Do not buy this product for the trapper.</li>
    <li> Superb quality. Way too small for me. I&#x27;m a guy but my hands are small. This particular clipper barely fit for my pinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a perfectly made clippers.</li>
    <li> Good product. Ear pick and then this nail cutter.. good expericence with Seki. Thank you.;</li>
    <li> My first use of the clippers showed me that I should have bought these years ago! The cut is smooth and not ragged as are the typical clippers that are readily available. A little light filing to touch up the slightly rough edges that are inevitable due to misalignment while cutting maybe needed. They are sharp, so be sure of your positioning before cutting! I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product, I was looking forward to trying it.  I have to say I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  It works ok, but the dimension of the cutter opening is not very big.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and easy to use. I loaned mine to a relative during a Christmas visit and they had to get one of their own.</li>
    <li> i like this clipper very much and have it attached to my keychain but i&#x27;ve lost 2 pairs already (while running). if you don&#x27;t have ot clicked back in and all the way down, it could come loose when running. i just tried using a ladies small hair tie to try and keep it in place, so i don&#x27;t lose any more. at $10 a pop, it&#x27;s getting expensive. recommended!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Arrived as promised and it great shape.  I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to be made of good quality materials. However, the white plastic covers too much of the nail clipper itself and you can&#x27;t see well enough how much of your nail you may be cutting. You might not even see that you&#x27;ve got some of your finger skin in there. Poor plastic placement...</li>
    <li> Just what it says it is. The very best- neat beautifully edges. Takes a bit to receive (from Japan) but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Good nail clipper.  I bought this and the Klipit Nail Clipper set and I prefer this one.  Better feel and smoother cut.</li>
    <li> Sturdy clipping lever, sharp cutting edges.  There is a fine grit emery board on the back.  Also, the removable nail clipping holder does an excellent job of holding clippings.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I got a defective clipper/catch, but this product is terrible. The clippers work fine, when separated from the catch. But when attached, it is very difficult to get your nail where it needs to be to get clipped. Also, NO nails were trapped in the catch, which was disappointing because the catch was the entire reason I bought this product (trying to hold a toddler still to cut her nails and worry about the nail clippings is nearly impossible). I kept trying it, thinking that I must&#x27;ve been missing something, but it still didn&#x27;t catch any nail clippings.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very sharp, easy cutting, and doesn&#x27;t spray clippings everywhere.</li>
    <li> i grudgingly have to agree that it works fine but if you have thick  fingers it maybe  wise to get something with bigger size.. this clipper is too narrow and small for my fingers but it cuts very well and has a good nail file</li>
    <li> Junk, not suited to any adult male. Will not fit my toe nails whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Go somewhere else for this requirement</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of different brands of clippers to replace the drugstore variety that we had in our drawer.  This works very well.</li>
    <li> It is a good nail clipper, but doesn&#x27;t really hold the clippings as advertised.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what a good clipper was until I tried this. You can feel the durability of the clipper when you first touch it. You notice the superior design when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lever that activates when you pull the clipper down is very well angled. This allows even the thickest toe or finger nails to be cut with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth $8 for something you will probably use for the rest of your life.</li>
    <li> I think they are good enough - certainly big enough that I won&#x27;t lose them in my purse.</li>
    <li> Awhile back, I whined on a social media site about my nails snagging on stuff after I clipped them.  A friend suggested that I try the Seki Edge Deluxe Fingernail Clipper.  I have to admit that I usually buy inexpensive clippers, as I have a tendency to lose them.  However, I am very glad that I spent a little more for these superior clippers.  First, the blade is quite sharp, so you needn&#x27;t apply much pressure when clipping your nails.  Second, there is a small well in them that collects the clippings.  The well isn&#x27;t that large, so you need to empty it every few snips.  However, even if the well is full, the clipping simply falls out rather than being launched into the air, as happens to me when I use cheap clippers.  Third, a metal emery board is a built into the bottom of the clippers, which is a convenient feature.  The clippers aren&#x27;t perfect, and I find that I sometimes need to go over them twice to snip off small snags and rough edges, but they are solid and work better than most other clippers, so I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> After buying the Toenail Clipper, I had to get the fingernail one now as well.&lt;br /&gt;And it worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Same thing with the case though - I liked it better without it. I just cut my nails on top of a hand towel and it catches all of it.</li>
    <li> These things are so sharp and cut super clean. It took me awhile to get used to them at first because I would cut too much!! Highly recommend any of their clippers.</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased another Mehaz 660 Model: 9MC0660, I did not like this one as well as the Mehaz.</li>
    <li> Really great clippers. The nail clipper catcher slips off which makes the clippers much more compact. I also own the Seki stainless steel version. I found both equally sharp. The stainless steel version are bigger so if you want a more compact version, get these.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re tired of replacing the cheap drugstore choices, these nail clippers really are better quality. They&#x27;re made better, work better and it&#x27;s not subtle.</li>
    <li> This clipper is super sharp and does a great job on my nails. Like the clippings catcher and the built-in nail file that does a great job of finishing the nails smoothly.</li>
    <li> I chose to rate this product a five because it is made from the same material as the ancient Japanese Samurai swords and it is an excellent product. My future purchase of nail clipper or toe nail clippers will be a Seki Edge product. Highly recommend item.</li>
    <li> Love this - my favourite nail clippers from Henckels broke and I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a replacement, only to be disappointed.  This came close, and seem to be well-built.  I can see this lasting me a while before I have to search for my next perfect nail clippers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I didn&#x27;t look at the measurements but I thought the clippers would be a little bigger. Other than this, they work well and they&#x27;re holding in there. The plastic nail &amp;#34;catcher&amp;#34; on the sides works for me, so that&#x27;s a plus. I typically clip my nails outside so any rogue flying pieces don&#x27;t get all over the house.</li>
    <li> It clips your nails without getting all over the place. It&#x27;s small and easy to use. It may save your marriage. It may ruin it. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about a nail clipper.</li>
    <li> The best thing I like about this clipper is that it cuts finger nails easily with just one stroke.  It must be that the cutting blades (top and bottom) are extremely sharp, hard, and close precisely upon each other.  The white plastic housing is comfortable to hold and the cutting action is smooth and feels effortless.  There is also a nail file on the bottom of the plastic housing.  Should I be in the market for nail clippers, Seki Edge would be my first choice.</li>
    <li> great edge, cut my nails nice.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great.  Very sharp and accurate and very well built.  I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone.  Get the nail clippers and the toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> This one is the best! You don&#x27;t have to worry about going too short or any pain from doing that. The design makes it the easiest experience possible. I&#x27;ll never buy a cheap one again!</li>
    <li> This product is great for the price. I keep it in my pocket and it&#x27;s the perfect size. The nail catcher works well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love the trimmings catcher and these trimmers are very sharp they were well worth the money glad I found them</li>
    <li> i thought it contained 1 large and 1 small nail clipper.  misleading photo!  I know the fine print says one but I don&#x27;t appreciate misleading advertising at all.</li>
    <li> I was so sick of crummy nail clippers that only worked a couple of times. This nail clipper is so nice and sharp and I love how it catches the trimmings.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail clipper!  Smooth clipping and it does not crack my nails  or leave rough edges as I use them.  It catches all the clipped nail pieces, too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give this clipper a three because it looks to be well made and it IS sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the design is poor in my opinion.  The file is built into the bottom of the plastic housing in such a way that its largely unuseable unless you have fingernails longer than a typical man.  And the plastic housing is just in the way.  From the positive reviews, i expected much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep looking.  This was a waste of money</li>
    <li> Had never tried any clippers other than those at local drug stores and discount stores. These seem like a quality pair and are definitely sharp with solid construction. Also the nail catcher is extremely useful. Worth every dime.</li>
    <li> Good clipper. Works great. A little overpriced.</li>
    <li> It can cut very well. It is good for me but a little bit small for big people to handle it, though.</li>
    <li> All animals groom.  Cats and dogs use their tongues.  Chimpanzees pick bugs out of each other&#x27;s coats with their fingers.  Humans use nail clippers, hair driers, towels, toilet paper, modern plumbing, and combs.    The broader question we should be asking is why nails continue to grow.  Endlessly.  Even after death.  They serve a function, to a point.  Specifically, nails are good for scratching.  They are also effective at gripping into something soft and fleshy.  But, if left to grow ungroomed, each of these tasks becomes more difficult.  Consequently, trimming nails becomes something more than grooming - it becomes preparing one&#x27;s self to accomplish.    Some people use their teeth.  My dentist recommended against it.  As such, I ordered this sexy beast.  It has done everything I&#x27;ve asked of it and more.  Well, not necessarily more.  It&#x27;s at least done what I&#x27;ve asked of it, and for nail clippers (to me), that&#x27;s enough.  The manufacturer of this product should be proud.</li>
    <li> Very sharp cutting surfaces. Allows for extremely accurate cuts. Clipped nail catcher is ingenious. Would highly recommend this excellent product.</li>
    <li> its ok but not what i expected for the price, not a smooth cut, brakes nail</li>
    <li> Just a joke. No better than a $1.98 pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> this device is too small for me to use..it would be nice if that were disclosed better to avoid disappointment..</li>
    <li> When I first used these clippers and they cut through nails with no hesitation and using almost no pressure I was shocked.  I have always purchased what I thought to be &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; clippers like Revlon, etc which all required a lot of pressure to get them to cut and even then it usually wasn&#x27;t very clean so I just thought that all clippers basically sucked.  The Seki brand clippers are amazing and have held their sharp edges over several months of using them.  I&#x27;m sure they will eventually dull and wear out but I&#x27;ll only ever purchase more Seki clippers to replace them.  Try them and see the difference!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t flex like cheap clippers, also they&#x27;re very sharp and make a nice clean cut on your nail. Made in Japan. I don&#x27;t much care (hence still giving it five stars), but I find the nail clipping catcher attached to the clippers is basically useless. I usually cut my nails so they come off in one nail, and that means it&#x27;s too large to fit into the catcher. If you &amp;#34;nibble&amp;#34; your nail away with many clips then the pieces will go in the catch.</li>
    <li> Best clipper I ever used. The reviews in amazon are really helpful, especially when there are a lot of them for one product</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use these clippers.  Fantastic, excellent job and no stress, strain of slipping and spinning out of your fingers if you have thicker hard to cut nails.  I highly recommend these clipeprs</li>
    <li> But the clipper is to small to work with easily. Does the job but I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have owned nail clippers for a long time. This one with the added clpper holder is an excellent addtion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sick of those 99 cent cutters, I went on Amazon to find something better.  I was assuming I&#x27;d find something better for like three dollars, but couldn&#x27;t turn this down due to the good reviews.  After using this, I&#x27;m absolutely sure this is worth eight times more than the cheap ones.  It cuts easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a rough edge, and doesn&#x27;t fling the nail across the room (that&#x27;s so gross).  The nail file does work really nice, it&#x27;s much better than the ones on cheap ones.  I don&#x27;t really use it much, just to take a corner off occasionally.  So yeah, go ahead and buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> they are sharp and have a good connection at the swivel head, didnt find any loosness there so they will probably last a good long time. i would probably get rid of the toenail catch though, probably just save you time not useing the toenail catch</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at paying a premium for nail clippers.  I mean what could they possible do that normal clippers cannot?  Well it turns out these guys are a ton nicer then your average drug store ones.  They clip down very smoothly, you don&#x27;t have that sort of big snap, the blades actually cut through the nail smoothly.</li>
    <li> These clippers would be good even if they didn&#x27;t have the plastic surround. The steel is tough and the edge is durable. But the surround elevates it to new heights--gone are the days of complaining girlfriends stepping on the shards of my nails deep in the carpet! The gentle rustle of my clippings as they tip into the trash is the sound of a 21st century nail clipper. Just stop, throw away your rusty Revlon from CVS, and buy these clippers. They have improved the quality of my life by improving a tremendously mundane and annoying task. One of the few tools I have bought as gifts for friends (they think I&#x27;m joking). Reviewers complaining about the surround not working--uh, if you tip it up while you clip your nails the gravity will pull them out, but just, you know, hold it level and it works great.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. This is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Overall they are decent but the container does not hold its contents very well. It also feels a bit flimsy, feels like it could break any day now although I have now had it for about 7 months.</li>
    <li> It is sharp enough. But quite pricey. The collecting jack makes it feel real bulky and hard to use.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail clipper I have ever owned--a high-quality Japanese-made product.  I love the clippings-catcher feature, and the fine file on the bottom is very gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> This is a precision instrument, the best nail clipper I ever had. I also have the bigger one for the toe nails, and I love both.</li>
    <li> Will be a pair that lasts forever and cuts incredibly easily.  Worth the extra couple dollars from the cheap brands.  You will never replace!</li>
    <li> These are GREAT! I never thought about actually buying a good nail clipper, usually just go to the nearest pharmacy to buy something, never thought about finding a good one.  However, I now have found the best nail clipper ever.  This thing is sharp, it cuts, and it catches your nails.  I use in my office at work, doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.  The build quality is excellent and doesn&#x27;t look like it just came off the production lot in china.  The nail catchment is alright, it does its job.  People have complained about the rasp that is on the plastic nail catchment and that its fairly useless, I&#x27;m a guy, and I use it only sometimes.  I guess if you file your nails often, get one of those dedicated files.  The nail catchment is removable if it interferes with your nail cutting.  I think there would be a chance that for some it would interfere and needs to be removed, but this one is cheaper than the seki fingernail clipper without the catchment.  The nail clipper looks a bit different, but I would think they cut just the same.  Bottom line, I will not be buying those nail clippers from drug stores any longer, Seki Edge for life!</li>
    <li> Catches the fingernail clippings &amp;#62; 90% of the time, as long as I keep the clippers tilted. Sometimes the opening on the mouth of the clipper is too narrow, and I have difficulty getting one of my nails into the mouth. However, usually I can overcome this by changing the angle of approach.</li>
    <li> The clippers work fine, but for the price I expected a significant upgrade over the trim brand I normally buy. The catcher and file are nice but otherwise I don&#x27;t prefer them over the trim and won&#x27;t replace them when they get lost.</li>
    <li> Love the nail catcher and this is a very sturdy clipper which has remained sharp for over a year now. It is strong enough for thick toenails and has always made clean cuts this far, and it is a quality feeling device. It is has a nice little file underneath also.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was sick of searching for a nailclipper around the house but then figured I&#x27;d look for the best out there and Seki came up again and again. I only purchased this model (with the fingernail trapper) because it was cheaper than the basic model and could disassemble into that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely cuts cleaner than my old clippers and leaves clean edges without the need for filing. The trapper doesn&#x27;t do anything so I just took it off like the other reviewers. Might be worth the money if it lasts longer than other brands, but I suspect the edge will eventually dull.</li>
    <li> Some cheaper clipper tear through the nail leaving a rough edge that needs to be filed smooth. These clip smoothly and leave a clean edge.</li>
    <li> My main reason for purchasing this item was the catcher compartment feature, which is supposed to contain the numerous nail clippings. However, this is only the case if you are holding the clipper at an angle that pulls the clippings downward into the compartment. If the nail clipper is tilted upward, which actually feels more natural, the nail clippings fall out, which totally defeats the purpose of having the compartment feature.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best clippers I&#x27;ve used. I knew from the sound of the first clip, that these were premium. Another plus, nails are not rough or jagged after cutting, feels like they were filed as well. The nail catch is great as well, it is solid and secure, catches clippings well. Ive yet to be as impressed with a pair of clippers. Stop buying cheap pairs. Worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I usually try to make the small, everyday things in life as enjoyable and efficient as possible.  I&#x27;ve neglected a better nail care solution for years, never really paying attention to it.  I have nail clippers - from CVS or something - they work fine.  Why try to fix it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents had been sharing a pair of nail clippers for years.  So for Christmas this year, I purchased these for my father.  He loved them.  So I tried them out, and wow, these are amazing. They make the process that much better - easier to handle clippers, cleaner cuts, and a nifty little cover that captures all your clippings.  Seeing as I clip my nails every 7-10 days or so, how could I not buy these for myself?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these fingernail clippers, and the matching toenail clippers.  They are very reasonably priced and I am very happy with them.  Order yourself a pair, and unless you are some kind of crazy nail clipper collector, I promise you&#x27;ll be more than pleased.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best nail clipper. We threw away all the cheap ones and bought a few of these. Also bought other things made by Seki Edge.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product.  I might take the angle down a bit with sand paper since it seems a bit high for precision handling.  It&#x27;s about 40 degrees open and 25 degrees fully depressed, more difficult to handle than my primary clippers.  This may mean nothing to most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is adequate, though when you press it down in the closed position it gets stuck between the plastic, which seems like a design oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually most impressed by the file.  It is comprised of a geometric raised dot pattern that&#x27;s not as susceptible to clogging.</li>
    <li> Heads up....these are what I would consider a small fingernail clipper....only about 2 inches long.  That being said, they&#x27;re good quality and do the job.  They&#x27;re just not as big as I thought they were going to be but, that was my mistake.</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper and made in USA.  Bought from spasourceonline.  Fast shipping.  One thing though... The clipper may be a bit too sharp.  When I tried to clip fast, the nail need to be filed coz nail a bit rough after especially the top part of the nail.</li>
    <li> Amazing, will never go back to cheap clippers.  the nail catcher is flawless, and the file is GREAT.  Seriously, if you use regular nail clippers ever, order this and throw them away.</li>
    <li> This clipper is so well engineered it felt like my past &amp;#34;nail cutting experiences&amp;#34; were THIRD WORLD.&lt;br /&gt;The Seki Edge Deluxe is &amp;#34;surgically sharp&amp;#34; .. making filing off the ruff edges after cutting almost unnecessary. I&#x27;d say you could almost throw your nail file away.. Two thumbs up.. and FIVE STARS..!</li>
    <li> Clipper actually cuts the nail the first clip and there&#x27;s a statisfing &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; sound, which I haven&#x27;t had with other nail clippers.</li>
    <li> This Finger Nail Clipper has been in a big help when I am in my office and at home.  Good product to have in your desk drawer</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Best nail clippers we&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> If you never had a nail clipper with a trap for your clippings, you are missing out. It&#x27;s such a logical invention that I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not standard. Get this clipper. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product. Feels like it has much more power vs other clippers I&#x27;ve used. I didn&#x27;t realize it had a little clipping catcher built in which is an added plus.</li>
    <li> Replaced a very cheap style like these that I lost and these clippers work much better.  Very sharp and catch pretty much everything.  Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> This clipper is very well made and easy to use. Love the fact it collects the clippings. My only criticism is that it is on the small side. Would prefer a wider cutting edge.</li>
    <li> The only con is that the emery board is located on the detachable plastic part.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, since I rarely use it.  However, it is a very good quality emery board.</li>
    <li> This is the first pair of fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve owned that actually does its job.  For the last 20 years I&#x27;ve been using a small scissors to trim because every clipper I&#x27;d used was junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic body catches about half the nails, but the ones it doesn&#x27;t catch don&#x27;t really go flying like with cheap clippers, so you can just trim over a trash can.</li>
    <li> The leverage provided by the lever is very good, and the clippings catcher appears to work just fine. The loop on the end of the plastic catcher isn&#x27;t suitable for putting on your keychain, however. Removing the clipper from its shroud is easy, and the body of the clipper does have a hole suitable for keychain attachment, but the lever covers the hole, preventing keychain usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a clipper, it&#x27;s awesome. A keychain accessory, it is not.</li>
    <li> The blade is extremely sharp but I find it sometimes still leaves a rough edge but I&#x27;m not sure why since it cuts so easily.  Also I have trouble cutting the entire nail off, it often leaves it dangling at the end but this is probably due to my technique.</li>
    <li> My grandmother gave me one when I was a kid. I lost it. I now have a new one. same great quality, if you are not in the habit of losing clippers, get this one for your home. sharp steel. will not rust.</li>
    <li> it stays sharp it cuts every time! I really have to recommend that people buy it! :) don&#x27;t be afraid!</li>
    <li> they work great. they are nice and small and cut nicely. they also are nicely rounded so they shape your nail nice.</li>
    <li> overbuilt  encased design ; excessive hand moves to set up; good quality steel,plastic, hinges, but very hard to use accurately</li>
    <li> I ordered this &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; item in the hopes that i would not misplace it if i spent more on a nice nail clipper. Unfortunately I lost it somewhere in the couch or something after 1 day. LOL I did cut my finger nails once and it was nice.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the nail collector part but the collector is very very small and it didn&#x27;t serve its purpose..</li>
    <li> Very sharp, cuts cleanly and quickly and fits the hand well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have never felt more like a ninja than when cutting my fingernails with these new clippers.&lt;br /&gt;I have particularly thick nails, and junky clippers are definitely one of my pet peeves. They don&#x27;t work for me! But these ones are definitely not wimpy!&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the file is on the back of the plastic fingernail-catcher-case and not on the metal clippers themselves. I don&#x27;t really like using the little fingernail catcher, but then I have to go grab it to file my nails (because these clippers do leave them a little sharp).&lt;br /&gt;But they are awesome! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the very best clippers. They cut perfect. The catch tray keeps the cut parts are stored and don&#x27;t get all over the place. Saves time, excellent.</li>
    <li> We keep buying Seki nail clippers because they work so well and we get used to the quality. I had to buy yet another one when one went missing. It went missing so I had to run to the nearest big box store and buy a different brand, which really disappointed. I immediately went onto Amazon and bought yet another Seki. once you use them you can no longer go back to any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stay sharp, they clip through the nail smoothly-- sometimes too smoothly so you need to be careful that you are about to cut what you intend to. I have never had to sharpen the others yet, and they remain quite sharp after over a year. The case is handy for clippings but I prefer to remove it. I also like that there is a file built in to the bottom. Very handy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled...this may not be the clipper you think it is. I thought I was purchasing the Seki stainless steel model AT A GREAT PRICE.  WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. This is a Seki clipper but is inferior in every way. Instead of a &#x27;bargain&#x27; I got a nail clipper that I could have purchased at Walmart for $1.50. The stainless Seki is a very fine tool; I purchased one several years ago and thought I&#x27;d p urchase another pair for the car.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and strong. It works great and is the best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> Usual high quality and smooth operation.  Bought a set for every member of my family.</li>
    <li> GREAT fingernail clipper.</li>
    <li> Cut my nails very cleanly. Enough said. Priced about right for quality cut.. CASE allows putting in pocket without snagging.</li>
    <li> The fingernail catcher is rather ineffective, but otherwise these are great.</li>
    <li> Smoooth ----- goodbye forever to Revlon instruments. Sharp and cut like butter. I&#x27;m a new fan!</li>
    <li> Hey, it&#x27;s not quite like buying a new Ferrari sports car, but for a nail clipper, it&#x27;s just what I needed and it&#x27;s darn good.</li>
    <li> Use minimal pressure to prolong the life of the cutting edge.</li>
    <li> Best cutting edge I&#x27;ve ever used. Precise and accurate. Worth every penny. Tossed my cheap drugstore brand and won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I have used by far.  Cuts easily and evenly</li>
    <li> These clips nails like champs! I highly recommend these clippers. The little nail file on the plastic catch is also really effective. I would totally buy these again.</li>
    <li> Finally found clippers that don&#x27;t bend and rip your fingernail. Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> Very durable construction. The plastic case and nail collector that the clipper fits into isn&#x27;t very useful in my opinion. It makes the clipper less maneuverable around your finger nails. And it doesn&#x27;t necessarily collect the clippings very well. But the nail file on the bottom is useful if you don&#x27;t already have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the clipper is quite broad, which makes it difficult to get precision trimming. I wish it was a bit more curved, so you could use the corners more effectively. Upside of this clipper is that it is very sharp, and cuts easily, including toenails.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They are absolutely the nicest and best working I have ever had. They are nice and sharp and they&#x27;re easy to handle. I especially like the feature where the nail clippings drop into the space below and then will be dumped out after you&#x27;re finished. The little nail file on the side is just great.</li>
    <li> Now that I have the clippers, I wonder why I had to suffer all those years with a dull set of clippers and nails pieces strewn all about the bathroom floor. Worth the money because with the quality of these I have a feeling that they are going to last me years.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know there could be such a difference between nail clippers, but wow! These blow everything else out of the water. Easy cutting and cleanup, compact and high quality.</li>
    <li> So that&#x27;s what clippers do</li>
    <li> sharp ! i was looking for a nail clipper like this for years</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp and hold the nail clipping which is a bonus - I would order again</li>
    <li> clippings fall right out which is embarrassing at the gym.</li>
    <li> These are my go-to clippers. They stay sharp.</li>
    <li> The worst part about cutting your nails is the logistics of it. Why is such a seemingly monotonous task so arduous? I have to find somewhere to cut my nails that stands as the least likely place to deposit a nail on the floor which then goes into my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this wonderful invention. Cuts are sharp, easy, and the catcher is probably the greatest innovation of the last hundred years. Just shake the clipper out over the trash bin and you&#x27;re done. Genius, Jerry! Genius.</li>
    <li> These are the best.  If you have hard fingernails (and I also bought the toenail clipper--same 5 stars), these go through them like a hot knife through butter.  The Japanese understand better than anyone cutting technologies. Once you try this, you&#x27;ll round up all those cheap worthless Chinese made ones and toss them.</li>
    <li> Read about these in a magazine where they had a great review.  Probably the only clippers I will ever need to buy.  Bought a pair for another family member too.</li>
    <li> Best that I&#x27;ve ever had the privilege to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean sharp cuts, great file, handy clipping catcher that&#x27;s easy to empty.</li>
    <li> good,really sharp : )  good job</li>
    <li> They work great - great edge - clean cut. No more nails flying all over the room. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> sharp nail clipper &#x3D; great.  The nail catcher is effective.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever had.  Well worth the price to have a nice pair.  Now I just have to keep the kids away from them so they do not become lost!</li>
    <li> Awesome, So sharp!  Best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  Only complaint is they are a little bit clumsy to handle.</li>
    <li> cut finger nails smoothly and nails won&#x27;t be all over the floor. i had clipper without the thing which can hold nails. i hate that</li>
    <li> Item was received as advertised in good condition. It is being used daily in its intended use and has performed adequately.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut the nail cleanly. Like so many other customers, I prefer to use the clippers without the plastic nail catcher. Using the clippers in this manner makes the edge of the blades easier to see. The file is a little different to others I have used but once you get the hang of it it works quite well.</li>
    <li> My husband bought a pair of these while in Japan. He has loved them for years, so we got a second pair. I know it is silly to love nail clippers, but these really are great.</li>
    <li> My finger nail clippers usually come from the store as the $0.99 special or are lifted from a family member / room mate. To say the least I&#x27;ve never been &amp;#34;wow&#x27;d&amp;#34; by a finger nail clipper. They all seem to dull too quickly and end up ripping instead of cutting the nail. Another thing I noticed when using the cheaper nail clippers is that the resulting cut is much rougher. Usually I would wash my hands and not notice it but with these cutters the cut was clean and smooth. Fresh out of the packagethe Seki Edge Delux Fingernail clipper with nail catcher is great. for 8 bucks, i&#x27;m expecting 8 years out of this bad boy/girl. w/e.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> After breaking 2 sets of cheap nail clippers I decided to do some research and buy a nice set.  These nail clippers are well worth the price.  It cuts through my nails easily and leaves a nice clean cut.  I am thoroughly impressed with the nail file on the bottom.  The build quality is noticeably better than standard clippers.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about paying so much for a nail clipper, but it is extremely sharp and cuts through with a short, smooth motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the attached plastic housing is kind of bulky and annoying to use. I&#x27;ve removed the nail clipping device from this plastic assembly, and it&#x27;s much more ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus of this product is that there is an extremely high quality metal file attached to the bottom of the white plastic housing.</li>
    <li> These have the name but not the quality. I was expecting the quality as the rest of my seki clippers but there were not even close. Do yourself a favor and make sure you are buying stainless seki clippers. These are not much better than dollar store clippers for 10x the price.</li>
    <li> This is great item. I loved it. Its sharp, its handy what else! Just expected little more catch of the cut nails. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good. so the nails won&#x27;t fly and it&#x27;s won&#x27;t mess up your room.&lt;br /&gt;very good quality. i believe i can use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I thought buying a clipper this expensive would be great.  Not!  There is no prong to clean dirt from under your nails.  It doesn&#x27;t really catch the trimmed part of your nail.  And the file on the back of the unit is too small.  Other than that, it was great.  Not!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a nail biter or should say I was a nail biter, but now I enjoy using these&lt;br /&gt;nail clippers to get the job done instead.  They are amazing and the nail catcher is&lt;br /&gt;single handedly the best more ingenious invention ever!&lt;br /&gt;No more nails flying all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edge is sharp and bites through my nails with ease, but than again I don&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;crazy thick nails...just normal ones...so if you too are normal like me and sick of flying&lt;br /&gt;nails get things and be merry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for both my hands and toes w/o any issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing the cheap local store clippers for years - never again.  Worth every penny.  Solid and easily clipped my very heavy thumbnails.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used the3 different models of Seki nail clipperssold right here on Amazon after reading through a number of reviews for both the Seki and Clyppi. In fact, I was a bit torn between choosing between the two. Having used both of these now, I could provide a short comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clipping&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Both are really good clippers and clip nails cleanly and crisply. Clyppi&#x27;s large sized clipper is a bit stronger than Seki.&lt;br /&gt;Seki - 4.5/5&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constuction&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Both are very well constructed, but Clyppi is somewhat barebones - more about it later.&lt;br /&gt;Seki - 5/5 -&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Seki does indeed feel deluxe with a plastic cover / nail catcher, whereas Clyppi felt a bit weird with sharp lines.&lt;br /&gt;Seki - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Clyppi - 4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend either of the two - go with the best deal available.</li>
    <li> The cutting edges are very sharp so it really cutting the nails, not crushing it. Easy to hold, easy to use. The nail clippings catcher is great, but also making it harder to use it on the toe nail.</li>
    <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
    <li> I like these Seki brand nail clippers.  The ones i bought are the standard slightly curved to cut your nails with a round cut and have the white plastic around it to catch any nails that fall back into it.  Overall, the white case doesn&#x27;t bother me, i can still cut my nails pretty much the same with it on, but you can take off the white case as well.  The reason i put 5 stars, is it&#x27;s heavy duty, the metal is like 2 times thicker then most of those cheap clippers you buy at CVS or something, so it feels very sturdy.  The edge must be pretty sharp as it&#x27;s no effort to cut my nails at all.  I have the slightly larger ones for toe nails and they both work great.  It&#x27;s worth the slightly extra money.  They do have small file on the bottom, and it works ok as well.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to get snippets of loose skin or to get at corners of nails.  the safety overhang makes the cutting edge difficult to use and it&#x27;s really tough to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> For the price greatly disappointed, returned due to the design being mostly plastic.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Seki clippers. This purchase was for my wife and she is thrilled. I had earlier purchased Seki nail clippers and toe nail clippers for myself. They are very sharp and of extremely high quality.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and will last a long long time. Shipped quickly. No more throwing clippers away after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I keep my nails short and neat. Unfortunately, clipping them is near torture because they are wide, somewhat flat and naturally strong, making it hard to get a clean cut. Although this clipper still isn&#x27;t wide enough to clip my nails with one cut (which probably isn&#x27;t a good idea anyway since my nail beds are also short), I can easily and quickly make two to three cuts from corner to corner on each nail without worrying about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper clippers are very hit and miss in terms of sharpness and usually have a sweet spot that clips just fine while the rest of the blade ends up bending, tearing or partially piercing the nail. (Eek!) When I use these Seki clippers, I never feel like they are bending the nail before cutting through. I never have to re-clip a section of nail, and the clipped nails edges are never ragged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the file--the only thing worse than clipping my nails would be the sensation and sound of filing them--so I can&#x27;t comment on that. The clipping catcher isn&#x27;t particularly useful unless you&#x27;re clipping at the right angle so everything falls inside, and I actually find that it compresses the clipper a bit to the point that the lever jiggles and feels loose when you flip it around for use. This does not affect the performance of the clipper however. (Sliding the clipping catcher off does take care of the jiggly lever though.) The lever is still easy to press, has the right amount of resistance and makes a satisfying click when clipping the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I splurged a bit and opted for these over another pair of $3 drugstore clippers.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time now for nails and mostly hangnails.  The sharpness of the cut is great.  Even the little filer works great!  Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for about a month now and I am so pleased with them.  I have never owned nice clippers, I have always purchased the cheapies at the gas station or local drug store.  I decided to spend a little extra to get some that will maybe last forever.  They are quality made and so SHARP!  Watch out!  My only complaint would be that they should come with a carrying case, a little pouch or something because if you just throw them in your drawer or makeup bag the next time you go digging for them you may cut yourself on those sharp blades.  I ended up finding a small little padded coin type purse to keep mine in, to protect them and me!</li>
    <li> These babies really cut cleanly. Very solid feel to them. I have both nail and toenail sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file seems odd. It is imbedded on the back of the clippers and seems less than accessible because it does not go to the edge. I admit that maybe I do not understand how to use a nail file when you can not get the edge on your nail. I&#x27;m a guy with thick but short finger and toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the file is less than perfect, the clippers are awesome.</li>
    <li> If i don&#x27;t keep a set of clippers around i&#x27;ll chew on my nails (awful habit...i know). These are quality. The snip with precision, are super sharp and have a heft to them that screams quality. The nail file on the plastic case was nice...but i ditched it pretty quickly as a dedicated file is better.</li>
    <li> Cuts my nails very efficiently, many of my other clippers leave rougher edges on my finger nails</li>
    <li> Clipping part is very good. Built-in file is awkward to use and shouldn&#x27;t be considered when buying. In my opinion</li>
    <li> I have only used this clipper one time, but I liked it. I was mostly surprised at how sharp it is. Hope it remains sharp for a long time. I didn&#x27;t find the nail catcher very useful. I would prefer the thumb handle to be a bit larger to prevent slippage when using. It was a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> The handle seems to be somewhat on the loose side and the catcher misses an occasional clipping. I had greater expectations.</li>
    <li> I had dozens of nail clippers that don&#x27;t work well - don&#x27;t cut clean and break the nail, distort when you squeeze the handle and rust.  These work great.  Nice and sharp, just the right curvature, and no rust so far.  The white plastic attachment the captures the cut nail is a nice feature but it can be removed if you don&#x27;t care about that or want a smaller travel clipper</li>
    <li> I had tried three different clippers to replace my 15 year old, worn out Revlon clippers. All of them, including the new Revlons, were junk. So I took a chance on these. They are well made - the cutting edge is very sharp and fits together perfectly. The handle is cast or forged, not stamped, and they feel very solid. The plastic clippings box comes off. The box seems like a good idea, but I find that it gets in the way so I leave it off. But the box has a nice nail file on the bottom. I would prefer the nail file had been on the clippers. These cut perfectly, and I expect they will last a *long* time.</li>
    <li> The ease with which it fits my hands and it leaves a nice clean cut.  Far better than what I have been using all these years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these clippers for a year now. I still think that, overall, it is the best pair I&#x27;ve ever owned. Still as sharp as when I first bought them. Easy for kids to use. My sister has arthritis in her hands. She borrowed my clippers while we were on vacation and she loved &#x27;em. Her hands usually hurt after she trims her nails, but the combo of the great cutting action and the wide nail catcher making it easier to hold, she had no pain.&lt;br /&gt;My only 2 (small) issues are-&lt;br /&gt;*The price. This is a lot to pay for nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;* I do agree with the other reviews that think the cutting blade is a little small.</li>
    <li> These things are sharp and beefy.  You really get power behind a light touch when you must cut tough (old person) finger and toe nails.  Sorry but it&#x27;s a reality...they get thicker and pretty cranky to trim.  Get these.  They&#x27;re just the ticket.</li>
    <li> No comparison to the cheaper clippers. These are very sharp. We removed the plastic clippings catcher, though. The catcher makes it hard to see exactly where you&#x27;re cutting.</li>
    <li> These things work great I wanted some clippers that caught the fingernails because I hate it when i see a fingernail just laying some where. These catch them really well and they wont break your bank.</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Package states made in Japan but item is not stamped with that info. A little bulky for small hands.</li>
    <li> These allow me to precisely clip my nails, and they catch all of the clippings. I&#x27;m 100% happy with them.</li>
    <li> The Seki Edge Deluxe Fingernail Clipper is overrated. I have had several of these now. They are not consistent. It is very simple, they either cut or they don&#x27;t cut. Hold the fingernail clipper up to the light, slowly close the lever and look to see if the jaws close together evenly. Do the jaws meet evenly and are the top and bottom jaws parallel? If not, you are only going to get a partial cut. If they are parallel and sharp you will get a good cut. The more they are out of parallel, the more they will not give you a good cut. On almost all of the these, the cutting edges of the jaws are not parallel to each other.</li>
    <li> Well, mostly they don&#x27;t. This is a good, sharp little clipper, that keeps most of that stuff contained.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality steel. It does not wobble or bend the fingernail during trimming.</li>
    <li> It catches all my clippings! Love it! The blades are also super sharp which I love. Will not go dull for awhile!</li>
    <li> Excellent products made with best workmanship.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously sharp nail clippers.  Best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Ergonomically speaking, it&#x27;s very strange.  The handles are too short to get a comfortable grip - other it slips, or I have to hold it so that the handle is digging into the crook of my hand.  The spring is too strong, it&#x27;s not easy to hold and clip. Lastly, there&#x27;s a dull area in there that doesn&#x27;t cleanly cut the nail - just a dot, but annoying.  You know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because I didn&#x27;t throw it away and if it&#x27;s the first clippers I find when I need one, I will use it because I&#x27;m too lazy to look for another pair.</li>
    <li> Efficient and effective.</li>
    <li> My husband really wanted one of these, so I bought it.  I never use it, but he likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve always needed something on my clippers to prevent the nails from flying everywhere.  I never actually thought to check if they had nail clippers with something built into them to catch the nails.  I used to get some index cards and tape to make something similar to this catcher.  Never worked quite as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this when I thought I lost the clippers I&#x27;ve been using the last 10 years. Thankfully I found the old one in a drawer (a $5 one from a local drug store) after I ordered this since I like that one better. Here are my thoughts on the Seki:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Clips crisply&lt;br /&gt;- Thought small, is easy to grip&lt;br /&gt;- Feels durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- The nail clippings catcher is too close to the front that it limits edge maneuverability (this is a big problem especially if I&#x27;m using this on my kids)&lt;br /&gt;- Nail file is terrible&lt;br /&gt;- Very expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good enough to keep as a backup, mostly because I&#x27;m too lazy to return this. No way I would have bought this if I had a chance to try this first. It&#x27;s OK but definitely not a good value.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavier than I thought but very sturdy feel. My husband likes it, it&#x27;s now used to handle his toughest toe nails :)</li>
    <li> Clips crisply, has a nail file which some of the more expensive ones don&#x27;t and does catch the nails when clipping.</li>
    <li> The file rubs against my finger when using the clipper.  For me that is like fingernails on a blackboard (does anyone under 20 know what a blackboard is?)</li>
    <li> These are sharp. Really sharp, and they cut well. However, the top is so thick that it&#x27;s difficult to control, especially for trimming children&#x27;s fingernails. I want to love these, but if there are two pairs of clippers in the drawer, I reach for the other ones.</li>
    <li> quality made and sharper than the cheap clippers, however i don&#x27;t like the plastic nail catcher, wish it was removable. it catches the nails just fine but doesn&#x27;t exactly trap them, the clippings kept spilling as i went along. the plastic also makes it hard to clip a hangnail because it&#x27;s a bit bulky and obscures a view of the blades. good thing about it is it makes the handle more comfortable to use. these haven&#x27;t replaced my cheap clippers though.</li>
    <li> I definitely had my reservations about spending so much on a NAIL CLIPPER, but now I understand what all the hype is about. This nail clipper rocks. I bought it primarily to use on my kids&#x27; nails, and it works perfectly for that. I have been through a variety of \\&quot;baby\\&quot; and \\&quot;safety\\&quot; nail clippers that just did NOT work (cheaply made, misaligned, dull). THESE clippers are clearly well-made. They are as sharp as they need to be, precise, and clean-cutting! Now I actually look forward to trimming my kids&#x27; nails. ;)</li>
    <li> I never thought I would be saying this about a pair of nail clippers, but I had a huge smile on my face the entire time I was using these. They are extremely sharp, cut effortlessly, and the separate file on the bottom of the clipping catcher is actually useful (unlike every other pair of nail clippers I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the $8 and change.</li>
    <li> There is a small issue I have with them; when you tip them upside down to use them all of your old clippings fall out of the top! It can get kind of annoying after a while. Other than that they seem to work as you would expect.</li>
    <li> I am a fanatic when it comes to keeping my nails cut short. Until I discovered these clippers I always used Revlon clippers and wasn&#x27;t entirely disappointed. However since I started using these Seki clippers I have noticed that my nails no longer have a sharp edge to them after being cut. The design of the handle is also much more comfortable than other clippers I have used over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this fSeki ingernail clipper and also bought a Seki Toenail Clipper. They are unusually sharp tools compared to what I have always used and are priced very competitively. As usual the products got to me quickly which is why 90% of my online purchases are thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is more expensive than the made-in-China drugstore variety, but it works much better. Cheaper clippers leave my nails a little raggedy, but these cut very cleanly. They are very sharp--I can even cut the tiniest piece of nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic guard does a good job at keeping clipping from flying all over the place. On the bottom of the guard is a nail file. It looks like sticker made of metal that is inset into the plastic. It is not just a &amp;#34;sticker,&amp;#34; the file works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of hyper-quality products, and this is definitely one of them.  I wish I had purchased this a long time ago.  No mess.  Easy cuts.  Is actually strangely satisfying to use.  Highly recommend the seki Deluxe Fingernail Clipper - you&#x27;ll never go back to your cheapo, nail-tearing 99 cent clippers again!</li>
    <li> When the most recent pair of nail clippers my husband had broke (the main hinge literally broke in half), I decided to order these based on all the positive reviews.  He wanted another cheap pair and was a bit horrified at how much these were, but once they arrived and he used them for the first time, he said that they really are worth the extra expense.  They clip neatly and leave a smooth edge on the nails, and the trapper area is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a nice splurge, and I could see them being a great gift if you put them in a little bag with some other nail accessories.</li>
    <li> The clipper works very well to cut the nail, and I find I don&#x27;t have to file afterward which is nice.  I actually took the white \\&quot;holder\\&quot; off and feel this makes it easier to use.  It does not work well to clip cuticles, as the blade is not long enough.</li>
    <li> This clipper does exactly what I bought it to do.  It clips nails and catches it in the little, white, plastic section.  I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal, but after going through so many different, cheaper nail clippers because of various issues, I spent my money on a quality product instead.  I should have just done this in the beginning - it would&#x27;ve saved time and money.</li>
    <li> I have used the cheap fingernail clippers that you can purchase at drugstores for $2 to $3 for most of my life.  The cheap clippers always seemed to become dull after a period of time.  Decided to look on Amazon for clippers that would keep their sharpness.  So far this pair has remained sharp and cuts through finger and toe nails quickly and cleanly (4 months of use).  These clippers also come with a &amp;#34;Clipping Catcher&amp;#34; that catches nail fragments as they are clipped and is easily emptied by pointing the tip of the clippers down and gently shaking.  The &amp;#34;Clipping Catcher&amp;#34; is easily removed if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that these do not work as well when trying to cut cuticles (this is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars).  The outsides of the cutting edges are not as precise when trying to cut cuticles.</li>
    <li> Nice overall look/quality.  Upscale touch over the all metal type. As infrequently as we buy this, worth the extra price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re sharp and effective, but most importantly I can tell they&#x27;re going to last by the way they were constructed.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several cheap clippers from Walmart and CVS, but I finally spent $2 more and got a GREAT set of clippers. Buy these and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> My son never likes getting his nails trimmed because the cheap nail trimmer I usually buy from the pharmacy used to snap his nails and send a painful reverberation to his fingertips. Today, he didn&#x27;t flinch, and best of all, didn&#x27;t resist getting his nails trimmed. Very smooth action and didn&#x27;t have trouble with the nail catcher getting in the way.  No more nail-boomerang! Also got my shipment in less than 5 days and it came all the way from Japan!</li>
    <li> Great nail clipper.  Claps clean and neat and the built in file tidies up.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have ever used! I have been a tweezerman buyer up to this point and now have converted to Seki!!</li>
    <li> They are very user-friendly and very economically priced. I bought the toenail cutters also and are a very good brand.</li>
    <li> One the best nail clippers I have used. I hated the ones I used to buy in departmental stores. But surprisingly, when I went overseas, even the cheap ones available there were pretty good. But in the US, Seki is the best one so far.</li>
    <li> Sharp and well-made. Leaves a smooth clean cut, not the jagged mess from the  $.99 gas station or drug store version. Also has that nice plastic piece to capture the cuttings so they don&#x27;t fly all over te place.</li>
    <li> They seem sturdy, but the nail catcher really just gets in the way of clipping your nails. I don&#x27;t think these are as special as I was expecting when I read other reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice and so far I am appreciating the ease of cutting my nails.  It&#x27;s a sturdy, sharp tool.  The catcher works.  I also appreciate how this arrived promptly from Japan.</li>
    <li> Makes clipping my finger nails easy without the clippings flying all over. It&#x27;s a bit small and I wish I would have bought the larger toe nail clippers.</li>
    <li> I know what you are thinking...$10+ for a fingernail clipper?  Well...let me tell you.  Soooo worth it!  All the cheap clippers do is maul my nails and make me have to file them after I cut them.  This set cuts them just right with no after maintenance.  Great set of clippers!</li>
    <li> The reason we go this one is because it catches the nails once it is sheared off. Works excellently and wish we got this one rather than the one without the catcher. We now have two of these clippers which will be useful in case one is misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Seki clippers are excellent.</li>
    <li> Horribly ineffective. The edges were so dull they didn&#x27;t even cut through paper. I even tried it on my 1 year old and it did not cut her nails- it just grabs on but doesn&#x27;t cut through the nail. Given so many other positive reviews I hope this one was defective. I would not waste my money on Seki based on this item.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  The clippers tear your nails, cutting unevenly and leaving burrs with every cut.  These are the worst cutting nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Even the pair from the dollar store cuts better than these do.</li>
    <li> In a long running and seemingly endless search for a decent pair of nail clippers, I bought these for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Finally he is pleased. They still don&#x27;t lock in place while open to clipping mode (clippers used to do that) but with the case they&lt;br /&gt;have enough bulk to them that you can get a good grip on them and the top lever doesn&#x27;t slip to the side. The casing does not really catch the nail clippings but nevertheless is a helpful feature. Good and sharp too. Give a nice crisp cut to the nail.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  Revlon is better and cheaper.</li>
    <li> These Japanese nail clippers are the best i have ever used they are so sharp you don&#x27;t even feel it cut through your nail,I call them Samurai nail clippers.</li>
    <li> This clipper would be perfect if the plastic guard was removable.&lt;br /&gt;Then it would be more maneuverable and easier to use in corners and on long nails.&lt;br /&gt;As of now, I have to clip long nails twice to get them as short as I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the construction of the clipper itself is so solid that it&#x27;s worth a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be burning through this like you would with cheap $1 drugstore clippers.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s so sharp, it cuts through nails like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a sharp, durable clipper and are willing to forgive the plastic guard issues, this is the clipper for you.</li>
    <li> I really like it because it catches the nails and I don&#x27;t have clean up afterwards. It is quite sharp too so you don&#x27;t even have to cut your nails right after you shower but the problem with that is the cuts won&#x27;t be smooth. Maybe my nails are a bit tougher than others. Overall, it is a decent nail clipper. I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Ninjas don&#x27;t even mess with my pretty hands because they know I cut my nails with clippers handcrafted by the decedents of Samurai from Seki, Japan. And that makes me intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I haven&#x27;t seen a single ninja since I bought these. Coincidence? I don&#x27;t believe in coincidences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, no one has ever seen a ninja because if you saw a ninja (not that you would -- they&#x27;re too stealthy), it would be the last thing you saw. Ninjas a totally cool and flip out all the time and are basically invincible. But if you own these clippers, only then will you have REAL ultimate power.</li>
    <li> Seldom in life is the best of class completely affordable. Just buy these and congratulate yourself for years on your purchase of a superior product. Would that all life&#x27;s simple tools be so effective as Seki&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Best fingernail clipper I have purchased, worth the price</li>
    <li> Fabulous nail clipper. But housing is so bulky, when cutting your toenails you lose sight of your nail as the clipper settles onto your nail. Clip of faith!</li>
    <li> Finally, sharp, smooth cutting for rock hard nails. Had to order two pair because first one was confiscated by my teenage daughter who inherited my rock hard nails. Cuts so clean that little or no filing is needed any more. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I would say that the blade clips nails a lot more effectively.  The picture is misleading. You only get one clipper not two! It is a notch up from the nail clippers you get at the pharmacy but really not that spectacular.</li>
    <li> The nail clippers are very well made and perform the job expected. Delivery was prompt. The best feature is the nail capture enclosures. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this clipper and also the toesnail clipper. These are very sharp and very easy to manipulate even with decreased strength and agility. The nail clipping catcher seems to work just fine but since I never had such a benefit before, it is icing on the cake. It works well without shredding the nail. a quick swipe with an emery bioard should be used afterwards to reduce sharp nail edges.</li>
    <li> Best ones I have found.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having to borrow mom or sister&#x27;s nail cutter so I decided to buy this form reading the great reviews. Really like it except that I like taking off the white casing to get a more comfortable hold when clipping nails. Very sharp and ergonomically correct.</li>
    <li> Clean cutting and with much less effort than other clippers i&#x27;ve used.  Expensive, but worth the money.  I separate these from other clippers in my house so they don&#x27;t get lost.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the price, but I bought it anyway, so I can&#x27;t complain.  This is a pretty nice nail cutting tool.  I especially like the nail catcher.  I didn&#x27;t think that would work, but I was wrong.  It works great.  I keep this on my keychain, and have used it several times.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> The clippers work great as far as they do the job of cutting but they give you a harsh edge, it&#x27;s hard to shape your nails just using the clippers...you have to make lots of little cuts and then maybe a file.  It does do a pretty good job of catching your clippings though.  That&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> I like the way they if in my hand and how easy they work If anyone is looking for a nail clipper buy this</li>
    <li> This clipper is sharp, accurate and has a very useful file built in. It is exactly what a clipper should be in every way.</li>
    <li> This product literally fell apart on 3rd use. Despite my high hopes, this was a waste of money; I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Cuts through nails easily and smoothly. Nicely designed and lightweight. It&#x27;s a very good quality product and worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job trimming nails. The blades are sharp. The nail catcher is marginal and you have to dump it routinely but that&#x27;s no big deal. Construction appears to be rugged.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers. Very sharp</li>
    <li> A product not easy to find at the retail level and a little pricey --  but a well made product that does the job</li>
    <li> Benefits of these nail clippers include:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Cut fingernails don&#x27;t go flying everywhere&lt;br /&gt;2.  Sharp enough that fingernails don&#x27;t break/chip mid-cut&lt;br /&gt;3.  Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this really made the fingernail cutting experience much more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and seemingly precisely engineered and crafted clipper.  The only bit of inadequacy compared to the best I have owned is that the cut is not the smoothest.  A little bit of filing after cutting may be required.  The very few best clippers when sharp can produce cuts that do not required much filing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the clippings catcher, it blocks your view.  When you take it off it is much better - But - it is so well finished, and shiny that it is to slippery to hold.</li>
    <li> If the phrase &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; ever applies to a product, it&#x27;s fingernail clippers. I bought three sets of these Seki Edge clippers last year, one for me, and one each for my folks, and we&#x27;re all completely satisfied with them. Never again will I scrimp on clippers with those drugstore cheapies. It&#x27;s worth every nickel of the extra buck to splurge for the high-quality steel, sharpness, and craftsmanship that comes with this brand. No more clippings flinging across the room. No clicking sounds from dull blades. Just nice, clean cuts. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, but leaves rough edges on nails which makes it harder to file your nails, unless you file it down shorter or else it will leave your nails to split. I&#x27;ve never had issues in the past with any other nail clippers. No splitting whatsoever, this did. So, unto the old and hopefully find another with a nail catcher.</li>
    <li> very nice quality nail clippers. works very well. worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very sharp.  The 4 star rating is because it is very difficult to see what/where you are cutting the nail.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. Perfect cuts every time. Empty the plastic nail catcher every time or you will get a frustrating surprise when they dump out the next time you pick them up. Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned...by a HUGE margin. Nothing I&#x27;ve ever owned has even come close over 30+ years. Will purchase more.</li>
    <li> While this is a pretty good nail clipper, it&#x27;s no better than a much less expensive Revlon.  Revlons tend to vary in qualiy;  at least one I bought recently was incorrectly ground and did not cut well.  Frustrated, I expected more from the Seki Edge.  While it cuts very well, the attached plastic clippings receptacle doesn&#x27;t do a particularly good job.  Worse, it obscures the user&#x27;s view of the clipper&#x27;s blades when trying to position the tool on your nail.  I removed the receptacle -- it just pulls off -- and that problem disappeared.  The nail file attached to the receptace is quite good, much better than the Revlon file.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:  get the Revlon for less than half this price of the Seki.  If it isn&#x27;t made right, return it or recycle it and try another.  Most work just fine.  Skip the off-brands as they are difinitely inferior to the Revlon or the Seki.</li>
    <li> I like the first one so much, I bought a second one...  Great product.</li>
    <li> Seki makes quality products. This is no exception. I like the feel of the clippers in my hand and the sharpness of the blades. Paying a little more for quality never hurts.</li>
    <li> Has everything you need in a nail clipper</li>
    <li> I thought these would be full size clippers... but they&#x27;re more like a mid-size pair. They are sharp and cut clean for sure! I&#x27;m very happy with these things!</li>
