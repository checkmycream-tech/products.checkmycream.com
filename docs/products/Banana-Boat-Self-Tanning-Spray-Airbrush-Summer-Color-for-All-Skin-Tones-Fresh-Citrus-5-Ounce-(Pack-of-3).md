      <li>but once you get the hang of it you will love the results!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>A Nice Bronze Tan And</li>
      <li>It has areas a nice citrus smell, and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but most of all it does not streak.</li>
      <li>gives me a nice glow.</li>

      <li>It has a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>It does spray on nicely, and goes on with a citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to the kind that you go to a tanning salon they spray on you using the walk into machines.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to see it on line.</li>
      <li>one application of this gives me a nice tan without any orange tones.</li>
      <li>kind of a &amp;#34;no-brainer&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>sprays on nicely</li>
      <li>At this price, you can&#x27;t beat it to keep a nice tan without the sun.</li>
      <li>but honestly I&#x27;d rather have it that way.</li>
      <li>still kind of meh.</li>
      <li>This Banana Boat spray mist goes on easily, has a pleasant smell, and gives a really nice color.</li>
      <li>But once you figure out that perfect rhythm of application you can get a fairly passable deep tan.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re comfortable asking a friend for help, that&#x27;s always a good option.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>Best part is it leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
      <li>I have light colored skin and did good for giving me a tanned look but as it wore off, it gave my skin a yellowish orange appearance.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best self-tanner out there.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend you add it to yours!</li>
      <li>I am very fair and do not tan naturally.</li>
      <li>More like choking on chemicals scent.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>so I always rub over applied areas with my hand to make sure its even coverage.</li>
      <li>Ordered this 3 pack from Amazon because I really like the product and the price was great for a 3 pack.  </li>
      <li>Also, like with any self tan product make sure you exfoliate before using.</li>
      <li>I can get way more with the lotion.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>be ordering more of this.&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve tried many products.  </li>
      <li>It is much better now.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll know that it will be a bit more of a process to apply it.</li>
      <li>I have an indoor job that requires most of my hours at a computer</li>
      <li>and this is not even in my top 10.</li>
      <li>My wife and I both use this and love it.</li>
      <li>I also love the price.  </li>
      <li>I Love It...</li>
      <li>I love banana boat, I trust their products to perform as described and this one is no exception.</li>

      <li>Go for it but leave some for me : )</li>
      <li>Overall, for the price it&#x27;s probably one of the best tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>many of the reviews reported.</li>
      <li>Will update if it works better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I used it years ago my husband asked me why I smelled so good</li>
      <li>This one has even coverage, even pretty good on hands and feet.</li>
      <li>I have pretty fair skin since I started wearing spf and quit indoor tanning altogether</li>
      <li>It dries fast and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I think the best thing is that it wears off much like a real tan.....not all splotchy.</li>
      <li>and if you apply it in light even coats it&#x27;ll look much better on your skin</li>
      <li>Best $6.50 I&#x27;ve spent in a while!  </li>
      <li>The other brand has a perfect sprayer that truly comes out like an airbrush.</li>
      <li>product is easy to use and when used as directed does not give you the orange glow of the majority of products out there.  </li>
      <li>Very quick drying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have pretty fair skin since I started wearing spf and quit indoor tanning altogether so I was&lt;br /&gt;looking for an at home spray tan that looked real and didn&#x27;t stink too much in the process.&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill! I found it years ago in Walmart and then couldn&#x27;t find it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;until I found it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it years ago my husband asked me why I smelled so good and if I were using&lt;br /&gt;a different laundry detergent for my clothes than his! It took me a while to figure out what he&lt;br /&gt;was talking about and then realized it was my self tanner lime smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of lime but for some reason they really knew what they were&lt;br /&gt;doing incorporating it into this tanner! It compensates for the smell the skin has when it is&lt;br /&gt;tanning the skin. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I am so pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve used many types of spray on self tanning products, including high end ones like Fake Bake and Modelco. This Banana Boat spray mist goes on easily, has a pleasant smell, and gives a really nice color. At this price, you can&#x27;t beat it to keep a nice tan without the sun. I am not fair skinned, so I wouldn&#x27;t comment on how this would work for a very light skinned person. I have moderate skin and used this in the middle of winter with no tan and it looked very nice on. Comparable to Modelco, Fake Bake, and the Mystic booth spray tan.</li>
    <li> This spray tan is the best I have used outside of a salon. It is easy to apply but difficult to tell where you have already applied it as it sprays on clear. None of the other reviews mentions a very important factor...this tan does not rub off on your clothes so you may wear white without any worry! Also, I didn&#x27;t experience the long try time many of the reviews reported. Also, like with any self tan product make sure you exfoliate before using. I read that many users put lotion on their knees, elbows, and feet to prevent those areas from getting too dark but after exfoliating well this won&#x27;t be an issue. I do wish thei product was a little darker so I didn&#x27;t have to apply layers of this spray but I assume that is how Banana Boat sells this for &amp;#34;all skin types.&amp;#34; Also, when it comes to colored hands and feet, first, don&#x27;t spray them and second, use baby wipes as you can control what you wipe off much better than just washing your hands and feet after applying.</li>
    <li> I picked up a bottle of this over the weekend so that my legs will match the color of my arms and I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the results.  The color is really natural looking and if you apply it in light even coats it&#x27;ll look much better on your skin, just remember to go light around your ankles and knees.  The scent is much better than the usual self tanner but I have to say that for me this stuff takes twice as long to dry as usual, I&#x27;ve been sitting in front of a fan for about thirty minutes right now and my legs are still a little sticky.</li>
    <li> Use the lotion lightly for your base then use the spray daily to maintain you skin cancer free tan! I use it every summer instead of stockings and all winter in Palm springs. I pay a price if I sit in the sun and tanning beds did me in...this is safe and the perfect shade of tan. The spray is even and the color is totally believable and the price makes it economical..compared to spray tan salons and fancy drug store self tanners! Go for it but leave some for me : )</li>
    <li> Overall pretty dissapointed with this product . the &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; smell is awful and so strong that it gave me a headache. You can&#x27;t use it at any angle like it says. I was left feeling very greasy and not much darker at all. Might be better for someone that is pale... I have a light tan already so I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve tried almost every self tanner and this is not even in my top 10.</li>
    <li> I used the banana boat lotion the last two summers, but when I look for it now, it is always sold out in stores. The lotion worked great so I thought I&#x27;d try this. I am a very fair skinned, natural redhead like blind you with my legs white. I sometimes have the problem of self tanning products showing little or no color on me. This does work, but I still prefer the color of the lotion formula and one application of the spray doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot. It adds a little color, but two applications is better for me. I can get about 4 or 5 applications out of this spraying my whole body. I can get way more with the lotion. This is still inexpensive, especially compared to a spray tan, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, but it comes out clear so you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s going. This is the first spray out of a can that I&#x27;ve used (I tried fake bake flawless, which comes in a spray bottle) so I did have some uneven areas, but I got it evened out on my second try. It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t come out dark, because it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing or surfaces in your bathroom. Rubbing this in with a self tanning mitt worked the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have that self tanner smell, which is great, but I do suggest opening a window when using this because it smells terrible while spraying. I&#x27;m not sure where they got the idea that it has a fresh, citrus scent. More like choking on chemicals scent. My fiance had to cover his face to spray my back so heads up there. This seems to take a long time to dry. You feel sticky like after a spray tan for a long time so give yourself plenty of time for that. I&#x27;d say at least 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad, but not the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have a natural yellow hue, which means self tanner tends to make me orange, no matter the brand. But this one does a perfect job of just staying at a brownish tan, not orangey. It&#x27;s the only self tanner I swear by!</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Mist allows me to have a natural tan when Spring rolls around and I want to wear shorts. I have an indoor job that requires most of my hours at a computer so I don&#x27;t get much sun. My wife and I both use this and love it.</li>
    <li> Actually I have been using this product for at least a few years. It sprays on relatively easy and leaves very little splotchiness. like the other lotions, and crams  that are available. I am allergic to the kind that you go to a tanning salon they spray on you using the walk into machines. I will continue to use this product now and into the future.</li>
    <li> upon reading these reviews i went and purchased 3 of these from walmart...ive already showered and dryed and the product seems to go on well..time will tell what it looks like as i already have a tan...as there is no sun to speak of {chem-trails} im hoping this will be a good alternative...I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER TO FIND 3 BOTTLES advertised FOR $20...I JUST PAID UNDER $6.00 BOTTLE AT WALMART..to my calculation thats far under $20..kind of a &amp;#34;no-brainer&amp;#34;...If it looks good/smells pleasant I will review 5 stars without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Im not a huge fan of this product. I DOES darken you but also gets on your clothes and wears off easily.</li>
    <li> This spray tan stays on the longest and looks like a real tan, not orange at all. I do think they have upgraded their product since 2010/2011 It is much better now. Smells wonderful and no streaks or blothes. I stock up on this stuff, I love the lotion also! If you want a natuaral looking tan with a nice glow, get this stuff! Remember to exfoliate your skin before you put self tanners on, your tan will last a week+</li>
    <li> Use occasionaly for a fake tan. I like the coverage and the odor of this tanning mist much better than the other products available. You have to be very careful when spraying because the coverage can get blotchy with all of the self tanning sprays. Hold at least 6-8 inches away and move the can up and down while applying the spray, the more movement the less blotchy tan. 2 to 3 applications per week gives you a nice tone.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product because it sprays out in such a nice fine mist and does not smell when spraying, AND the color develops into a natural looking tan on my pasty skin. I love the Banana Boat lotion tanner, but it is difficult to apply as evenly as spray. The fake tan smell of the spray does develop a little while the color develops, but it is not nearly as overwhelming as other spray tanners I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, each application (two coats as recommended by directions on the bottle) takes up half a can of spray, and I only do my legs! It also sprays out such a volume that it gets everywhere within a large radius of where you spray (which is nice for a more even application, but messy for clean up). The spray takes longer to dry than other options, leaving me feeling sticky and standing in front of a fan for longer after application compared to other brands. Also, it sprays clear, so you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve sprayed visually until it develops (or where you need to clean in the location you sprayed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deal breaker for me is the mist bubbling up during spray and dripping large foamy deposits onto my legs while I spray. These then develop into darker blotches. I have tried only spraying with the can upright (which is REALLY difficult to do on oneself, so I had a friend who is an airbrush technician do it for me) and it still bubbles up, and the pressure of the mist then blows the bubbled formula onto the skin (even spraying 10 inches away from skin).  I did purchase a pack of 3, so I will try another can and see if perhaps the one I used first was a dud. Will update if it works better. Until then, I&#x27;d recommend using Neutrogena Micromist tanner instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if they could fix the bubbling problem, this would be a great spray tan at home option. Adding in a color so you can see how thick you have already sprayed (and have an instant airbrush until the color develops) would also be a huge improvement on this product.this product.</li>
    <li> Who is this quote from? Every southern woman ever, that&#x27;s who! I love banana boat, I trust their products to perform as described and this one is no exception. Beautiful tan color that builds with use.</li>
    <li> I  read all of the reviews which made me try the product, during the winter months I get white, almost glowing, and the product gave me  a nice color, you must exfoliate and be careful not to overspray your feet.</li>
    <li> I tried this self-tanner on a recommendation from a friend.  It cost $6.50/bottle at my local Target.  Best $6.50 I&#x27;ve spent in a while!  I was noticeably tanner after just one use, and the tan is not at all splotchy or orange.  I was asked the next day at work if I had been laying out by the pool all weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few tips that can&#x27;t be said enough:&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure your skin is clean and exfoliated prior to application.  I usually wash my body with a sugar scrub, dry off with a towel, and apply the product immediately afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;2) Hold the nozzle firmly, with even pressure, and always keep it about 1 ft from your skin.  This may be tricky for your back or other hard-to-reach spaces.  If you&#x27;re comfortable asking a friend for help, that&#x27;s always a good option.&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply in a well-ventilated room!  I apply in my bathroom with the window and door opened.&lt;br /&gt;4) Watch out for those trouble spots: ankles, feet, hands, wrists, and elbows.  These are the areas that will typically discolor and are a telltale sign of a spray tan. I rub lotion on my feet and ankles prior to application, and scrub my hands to the wrist vigorously after.&lt;br /&gt;5)  Do not use this several days in a row, as you will turn orange.  I apply ~3 times/week.  If I want extra color for an event, I use it two days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;6)  Do not shower soon after using this - I usually wait until the next morning to shower it off so the bronzer can really set.&lt;br /&gt;7) The mist itself contains bronzer and can discolor white tile a white tub - be careful!  I have a white tub, but I just rinse the tub out immediately after I use it, and it&#x27;s been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be keeping this in my beauty arsenal for years to come.  I strongly recommend you add it to yours!</li>
    <li> Great tanning product and I have product allergies with no affects!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a nice natural color that lasts days. The only problems is that the third time I used this product I broke out in a fine, bright red, itchy rash that lasted a week. Maybe good for some people just not me.</li>
    <li> I have light colored skin and did good for giving me a tanned look but as it wore off, it gave my skin a yellowish orange appearance.  I&#x27;ve used this product in the past for several years and this is a common thing that had happened.  I usually scrub off as much as I can and reapply when this starts to happen.</li>
    <li> Everything was great as stated</li>
    <li> Great product.  When applied correctly, gives a beautiful tan year round.  People think I&#x27;ve spent hours in the sun.  However, all I&#x27;ve done is used Banana Boat spray.</li>
    <li> As a skin cancer survivor, I limit my sun exposure even with sunscreen. This tanning spray smells great and goes on well and doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily feeling. So I can look like I have gotten sun and not a pasty white even in Winter.</li>
    <li> I am pale and don&#x27;t use tanning beds, so I have tried a number of fake tanners. Most of the lotions were affordable but not very effective, and smelled awful. The Spray kind was more impressive, but still kind of meh. THis stuff works! I take a shower, exfoliate, put lotion on my ankles, wrists, elbows, armpits and knees, and they starting with my legs, working my way up, spray it in largely up and down, kind of looping motions. The only problem I have had is that when I use a lot it takes like 15 minutes to dry. And if you don&#x27;t let it dry all the way you can get paler patches from the chemicals rubbing off on your clothes. (Doesn&#x27;t strain them though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you don&#x27;t apply it excessively, if you just dance around naked in a well ventilated area (ie bathroom with the fan on) it should soak in nicely, within five-ish minutes. I put it on at night, let it soak in and shower the next morning. It should be noted that while this smells way better than most self tanners during application, the next morning it smells pretty self-tannery. But a quick shower, and that&#x27;s gone, and this color really is lovely. Such a healthy, natural looking glow, especially after a few uses! I am pale and didn&#x27;t get at all orangey. So 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This summer I was in the market for a new tanner. I am very fair and do not tan naturally. I have feed several lotions, wipes and now 2 sprays. This one has even coverage, even pretty good on hands and feet. I use a moisturizer base on hands and feet to keep from getting too dark. I feel like the color is good. I spray in my tub w a towel down and no transfer so far. I sprayed initially 2 days straight and second day 2 coats. I got 4 full sprays out of my first bottle. I do rub it in after spraying bc it doesn&#x27;t seem like maybe it&#x27;s even but maybe it is? I feel it lasted about 4 days with a decent color. I do think the pool faded it some. I do think the smell is nasty. I have used others and done mystic and this stinks way more and leaves a terrible taste in my mouth even with good ventilation. Luckily, the next day the smell showers off easy. It is also way stickier than anything else I&#x27;ve used and seems to take a long time to dry. Overall, for the price it&#x27;s probably one of the best tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Orange is the new tan.</li>
    <li> If I hadn&#x27;t tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Airbrush tan first I would probably be giving this one more stars. The sprayer on this can is awful. It doesn&#x27;t come out in a light, continuous spray....well, it does, but it spits which messes up your flow and causes the tanner to run which means you&#x27;ll have to rub it in to avoid streaks. The other brand has a perfect sprayer that truly comes out like an airbrush. I felt like the Banana Boat had a better color and was definitely darker than the other brand which is a huge plus. And the Banana Boat is a lot cheaper than the other brand. I got a sticky sensation for a few hours after putting the Banana Boat on that I didn&#x27;t get with the other brand too. So, in the end, I&#x27;d probably buy this again because you do get darker and it lasts longer, especially if you re-apply a couple of days later. I just won&#x27;t expect the ease and convenience of the other brand and I&#x27;ll know that it will be a bit more of a process to apply it.</li>
    <li> I finally found a tanning spray that makes me look normal.Pleasant smell while applying and I don&#x27;t \\&quot;stink\\&quot; much after it starts to work into my skin like most other fake tanning products. Have had no streaking or weird orange coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still careful to exfoliate certain dry areas and and watch how I apply it around my ankles. I will never buy another brand of spray tan. Thanks Banana Boat!</li>
    <li> I have been using this spray for a few years. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive ones but they don&#x27;t compare. I have fair skin and one application gives me a nice glow. It does not look orange or streaky at all. I get compliments all the time when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;For me it works best to spray and then still rub it in. That seems to avoid any streaks. It dries fast and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve picked up this bottle a few times when i needed the extra color at a cheap drugstore and i never found it to work as well as i hope. when i spray my face i need to use at least 3 coats for any improvement the next day, and im scared to do more than one coat on my body because those are bad streaks i cant cover up. i would say increase your budget a little and get something better.</li>
    <li> The spray dispenser did not work properly so application was very difficult and impossible to distribute evenly. Spray impossible to keep just to desired body area. Color had orange tinge and wore off in unsightly patches.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it said it was a spray on tanner, which I liked, and because it said it had a &amp;#34;fresh citrus&amp;#34; scent, which I loved as I hate the smell of self tanners.  It does spray on nicely, and goes on with a citrus scent.  However, after it dries, it smells EXACTLY like all the other self tanners out there.  Ick.  And it left my legs streaky and orange.  I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon won&#x27;t allow me to return it.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but most of all it does not streak. Looks like you just came in from St. John all day..&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;COVER your toenails before to spray&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This sometimes is hard to find locally so I was thrilled to see it on line. :) Great product. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best spray self tanner I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried tons of them!  I live in the Pacific Northwest which means self tanner is needed 9 months out of the year.  I&#x27;ve tanned and used self tanners for about 15 years so I&#x27;ve tried many products.  This is my favorite self tanner because it provides even color, has a constant stream at any direction, and is by far the best smelling self tanner (my fiance doesn&#x27;t even notice)!  I also love the price.  I use this product a few times each week and am set up for monthly delivery, which works out perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest smelling self-tanners I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;It sprays on nicely and I haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking.&lt;br /&gt;This gives a nice healthly glow to it, but if you are looking to get a deep dark tan I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this self-tanner. If you are looking to not look as pale this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> First off, I realized after 3 different brands that I&#x27;m allergic to DHA which is the tanning ingredient in self tanners. I get a horrible, itchy rash all over lower legs that last about 2 weeks with one application of self tanner. I did try this one before I realized this. Although it sprayed well and evenly, it still had the gross tanning spray smell after a couple hours. I also thought this color was a bit orange to my liking. I got this at a great deal so I&#x27;m not sending it back I&#x27;ll just give it to a friend that wants it.</li>
    <li> Being born and raised in Southern Callifornia tanning is inevitable.  I tanned in a salon ever other day while I was there.  Now that I have moved to the south. the tanning beds here seem circa 1970 so tanning in a salon is not an option.  I needed a product that would give me the look of a tanning salon without the risk.&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use and when used as directed does not give you the orange glow of the majority of products out there.  It sprays on smooth and evenly and does not streak.  Best part is it leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
    <li> This Is The Second Summer I Have Used This.. I Love It... Looks Like I Tanned In A Tanning Booth.. But NOT... Just From The Can.. A Nice Bronze Tan And Complimented On... I Would Reccomend It..</li>
    <li> Smells really good and I don&#x27;t notice it wearing off bad or even notice any type of typical wear off.  It does seem like I need to spray a lot to show something but honestly I&#x27;d rather have it that way.</li>
    <li> I use this product about once a week on my legs to looking pasty white when going bare legged in the summer.  It works.  The 3 pack I ordered should last me all summer.</li>
    <li> I like it. It has areas a nice citrus smell, and is not greasy. Nice natural color.</li>
    <li> I seriously don&#x27;t understand how so many people said this worked. I haven&#x27;t noticed the slightest difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I love it.  By no means will you get a tropical tan, but that&#x27;s why I like it.  It gives you the perfect glow without looking fake.  I have never noticed any bad smell.  It smells fruity and pleasant.  My routine is to shower/scrub/shave, dry thoroughly, apply moisturizer to my face, spray the product all over my body, spray the product into my hands and rub on my face, rub the product in on my body (I didn&#x27;t used to do this, but I&#x27;ve found that I get more even color if I do), wash my hands, and let myself dry for 15 minutes before getting dressed.  There were even times that I&#x27;ve spray-tanned in the morning and gone about my day.  Although, if you do not allow adequate time to really absorb and dry the product, it may wash off if you come in contact with water. (I did the dishes and had white forearms at one point.) I also have very sensitive skin, but never had a reaction to this product or had any problems with my face breaking out. My only qualm is that the most recent cans I received were faulty and would only spray if turned upside-down.  I was able to use them by spraying the product in patches and rubbing it over the whole area, but it was very inconvenient and awkward.</li>
    <li> Tans good. I have trouble spraying a even spray so I always rub over applied areas with my hand to make sure its even coverage.</li>
    <li> You get some decent color, but it fades fairly quickly. Three days after I applied, I looked like I had contracted vitiligo, forcing me to furiously scrub my body down with a loofa to avoid the stares I would no doubt get. If it would at least last a week, I&#x27;d be happy to use this as part of a weekly regimen, but having to apply 2-3 times a week is a no-go and you might as well hit up a local tanning salon.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have used. No streaks and looks natural. I use with a tanning mitt so my hands do not get stained.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best self-tanner out there. I have spent a lot of money trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t smell bad and is easy to use.  This is it!  The mist is super fine and makes the product very easy to apply evenly (just rub a tiny bit of body lotion into the backs of your ankles when you are all done).  It&#x27;s actually hard to make mistakes.  It has a nice scent.  I Ike the natural color, and if it isnt dark enough, I just apply another coat the next day.  I think the best thing is that it wears off much like a real tan.....not all splotchy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this 3 pack from Amazon because I really like the product and the price was great for a 3 pack.  It took a little while for it to become available, but it was shipped immediately after that.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on flawlessly, non greasy.  I spray on legs after showering and drying.  Then rub it in.  Great color and I am fair colored.</li>
    <li> Great color! Buildable, brownish not orange. I apply a little every day. Very quick drying. Only downside: you have to use in a well ventilated area. I turn on my fan and open a window.</li>
    <li> You have to be very careful and the first time you use it you will make mistakes but once you get the hang of it you will love the results!</li>
    <li> This product works great in the pool It doesnt leave any uneven colors, it leaves your skin nice &amp; soft....</li>
    <li> If they ever discontinue this product I will CRY. Okay, that&#x27;s a little melodramatic. I will tear up a little, though :) But seriously - this product is *amazing*!!  I discovered it a year or two ago and even did the subscribe and save (until I realized I was having it shipped more frequently than I was actually using it. Now I have a mini-stockpile so I&#x27;m set if it&#x27;s ever discontinued. If you like being orange this is not the product for you. This product goes on easily and looks FANTASTIC. Totally natural. Just don&#x27;t go spraying it on every day (as I did once for 4 or 5 days in a row) - b/c then you will look orange. Stick to every other day or every few days and you&#x27;ll look like you live in CA year-round.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! But u can definitely buy this cheaper per bottle elsewhere... I&#x27;ve seen it for as low as 6.50 a can</li>
    <li> This is my favorite budget spray tan! I am very fair but one application of this gives me a nice tan without any orange tones. I personally don&#x27;t use it as a spray because I&#x27;m just not coordinated enough to make that work without missing spots; what I do is spray a bunch of the liquid onto my tanning mitt and then buff it into my skin in a circular motion. Around my knees, elbows, ankles, and on my face I put some moisturizer in the palm of my hand and spray a bit of tanner into it, then mix them together before applying. This makes the color less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to use a good moisturizer at least twice a day with this product because I find that it does tend to get patchy as it fades and dry skin makes that worse. Exfoliate beforehand! You will experience the iconic self-tanner smell once this dries down but I really enjoy the citrus-lime scent it has when you first use it and think it blends well with tanner smell.</li>
    <li> I bought these to hold me over through winter. A few times I got im very splotchy in the usual areas, hands, feet, elbows etc. But once you figure out that perfect rhythm of application you can get a fairly passable deep tan. Basically give it a try, you have everything else right? Be warned that you can&#x27;t return this product because it is an aerosol liquid.  Bottom line, if you happen to be one of the people that can exfoliate, apply and maintain correctly. this is a useful product for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both this and the Deep Dark Tan Summer Color cream on my very light skin.  This takes more applications to develop into a tan but the color is brown, with essentially no hint of orangeyness.  The Deep Dark Color version develops very quickly but gives me an orange look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros to this:&lt;br /&gt;-Great natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Takes 2-3 applications before much color appears&lt;br /&gt;-5 oz can doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, you can&#x27;t really just spray this on and leave it.  The nozzle blasts spray in too small a spot.  I have to spray myself and then rub it around, like with a cream.</li>
    <li> the color is perfect&lt;br /&gt;no streaks&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering more of this.&lt;br /&gt;one can usually covers whole body.&lt;br /&gt;smell isnt too bad.</li>
    <li> Being fair skinned, I have used sunless tanner forever.  I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind under $20, and this is by far my favorite.  I like it because it gives a very natural looking tan that lasts.  The fine mist is much easier to rub in and avoid streaks than a lotion or foam.  For under $7 a bottle, you cannot go wrong with this product!</li>
