      <li>Nice!</li>

      <li>so I need a really good sun protection product.  </li>
      <li>This is the best sunscreen around and worth the money.</li>
      <li>Dermatologists love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more!</li>

      <li>It goes on wonderfully and washes off very well.  </li>
      <li>It comes off very easily under water or perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By far LaRoche Posay Anthelios XL 50 is the best.</li>
      <li>however, good skin cancer prevention is worth it!</li>
      <li>I have used many of the Anthelios sunscreens, but this one smells like a combination of motor oil and gasoline.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen is simply the best.  </li>
      <li>sunscreen feels stickier than most.</li>
      <li>I love this tinted cream.</li>
      <li>It is the supreme sun protectant because it covers the broadest spectrum of UVA, which causes the most of the sunburns.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if I love it</li>
      <li>I have a combination skin and most sunscreens that I tried caused breakouts and blemishes.</li>
      <li>For some reason it holds better and blends well with a concealer and powder thereafter.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t get any better than this.  </li>
      <li>I did some research on the best possible sunscreen</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen</li>
      <li>PHARMAMUNDI is a reputable seller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better products before, I think.</li>
      <li>but i prefer the cream much better.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m back here to buy more!!!</li>
      <li>The product is pretty good, except a bit greasy for oily skinned people like myself.</li>
      <li>I would say this iteration is best for skin on the dry side</li>
      <li>This sunscreen not only offers the best facial protection that I have found, but its composition as a moisturizer is superb</li>
      <li>It is is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It applies smoothly and I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I have used it for 2 years now; buying it on trips to Europe until it was available here.</li>
      <li>and it goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is absolutely fabulous.  </li>
      <li>This is a first product that didn&#x27;t - it is very light weight and you can&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect this product to keep your skin from getting significantly darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I expect the US market will have many more sunscreens with Mexoryl in the near future at more competitive prices.at more competitive prices.</li>
      <li>You can check the LaRoche Posay website for full details, ingredient list, etc.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good sunscreen but only marginally better than its much cheaper competitors.</li>
      <li>It was fine, but there is not a directions in English, so I am happy because I knew this product for long time before, otherwise, I would not be sure how to use it.</li>
      <li>It does a super job even after being out on the water all day.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried so many many different sunblock products over the years..  </li>
      <li>I recomend this product .Protects against sun like no other i have used, Some of them irritatemy my skin and cause me some kind of allergies..</li>
      <li>This cream works nicely for my fair skin, as long as you get 50+ and you apply it thoroughly and not in patches on your back or front.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this product, the only thing that really keeps my skin protected, and I like how lightweight and easy to apply it is.   </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes products arrive with an expiration date that is coming up soon, but this arrived with an expiration date that is over two years out, so it&#x27;s a fresh</li>
      <li>This is wonderful; not greasy or irritating.  </li>
      <li>The product I ordered came quickly and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that easily gets hives or rashes, and this has caused no problems at all.</li>
      <li>The dealer was great; delivery was far sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>Have tried many different sunscreens.</li>
      <li>Make sure you put it on 30 min before your first foray into the sun and then occasionally reapply if you continue to stay in the sun.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent sunscreen tho somewhat expensive.  </li>
      <li>I am an avid golfer in California.</li>
      <li>It has all the ingredients that shield the skin from the aging UVA rays (the underlying reason for sunblock in the first place), with all the benefits of a truly wearable product.  </li>
      <li>it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, my skin is 61yrs old and has had much too much sun in my youth, but this has at least stopped it in it&#x27;s tracks.</li>
      <li>The product it is ok, but take long time to arrived.</li>
      <li>sunscreen is very easy on the eyes and doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other sunscreens.</li>
      <li>Everyone who golfs regularly knows a strong sunscreen is a must if you want to protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Be smart by from the companies in Canada.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it even though I&#x27;m olive-skinned, as I&#x27;m on medication which has made me very susceptible to sunburn-</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>and this product really helps.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Daily use of sunscreen is so important, even if the sun isn&#x27;t actually out.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been available in Europe for a while, but the UVA blocker (Mexoryl)has recently been approved by the FDA.</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing else works like it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a really nice product that I will definitely be re-purchasing.will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be looking around more for other options.</li>
      <li>If you choose an Anthelios sunscreen that contains SX or their newer Cell-Ox Shield, you&#x27;re not getting the full coverage that this particular product provides (or so several dermatologists have explained).  </li>
      <li>This particular formulation goes on as a liquid-</li>
      <li>After spending some time researching the issue, I learned that this particular brand of Anthelios contains the two forms of Meroyxl -- SX and XL -- that are needed to block UVA and UVB lights.  </li>
      <li>Although this is designed for normal to dry skin, it works fine on my oily/combination skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a daily sunscreen user for most of my adult life, and I credit that to my skin looking much younger than it really is.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this sunscreen and seller.</li>
      <li>High protection</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s made for people like me who normally break out when using sunscreen.</li>
      <li>sunscreen protects you reasonably well, better than any other sunscreen I have tried, but only marginally.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert</li>
      <li>Additionally, Mexoryl&#x27;s chemical properties are very resilient to the intense radiation of the sun, providing lasting</li>
      <li>Good price, was what I expected, and it showed up in just a few days.  </li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin and have no problems, even around my eyes</li>
      <li>, some didn&#x27;t have lasting coverage, &amp; quiet frankly, most didn&#x27;t deliver on their essential purpose:</li>
      <li>and, so far, no burn yet, despite being outside watching my daughter play softball in the intense, summer Texas sun.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen that REALLY works for me.</li>
      <li>- my skin has felt amazingly soft ever since I have started using it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who is concerned about sun protection, especially those who are pale like me and who need a sunscreen that is strong but not overpowering on the face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is designed for the face, so it&#x27;s a small tube, but the product really does sink or melt right in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for LaRoche Posay&#x27;s sunsreens high &amp; low, and could only find a moisturizer with SPF 15.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was recommended by our dermotologist when my 10 year old son was diagnosed with lupus last year.  Absolutely nothing else works like it.  We tried something else to save money and now he&#x27;s burnt so I&#x27;m back here to buy more!!!</li>
    <li> This product does not let any rays in...It is is fabulous.  It applies smoothly and I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have always been a faithful sunblock user, winter thru summer, but my skin still looks a bit aged with sun damage..  Why is this?? and I have tried so many many different sunblock products over the years..  Some were too oily, some were really heavy &amp; thick, some stung the eyes, some didn&#x27;t mix well w/my daily foundations &amp; makeup, some didn&#x27;t have lasting coverage, &amp; quiet frankly, most didn&#x27;t deliver on their essential purpose: to protect our skin from burns AND AGING!  The Anthelios however is proving to be very different.  It has all the ingredients that shield the skin from the aging UVA rays (the underlying reason for sunblock in the first place), with all the benefits of a truly wearable product.  It goes on wonderfully and washes off very well.  I only wish I had started using it 10 years ago.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> In my quest to find an everyday sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t feel greasy and that has broad-spectrum coverage, I discovered this Anthelios brand. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreens with Helioplex in them the last few years, but I recently read how something about how Helioplex isn&#x27;t as stable as dermatologists once thought it was.  After spending some time researching the issue, I learned that this particular brand of Anthelios contains the two forms of Meroyxl -- SX and XL -- that are needed to block UVA and UVB lights.  If you choose an Anthelios sunscreen that contains SX or their newer Cell-Ox Shield, you&#x27;re not getting the full coverage that this particular product provides (or so several dermatologists have explained).  Although this is pricier than some other Anthelios products, I decided to get this for my face so I&#x27;m not taking any chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is designed for the face, so it&#x27;s a small tube, but the product really does sink or melt right in.  You only need a small amount to cover thoroughly your face, neck, and chest, and so it should last a long time.  I&#x27;ve also had no problems applying my foundation/makeup over it, as long as I let it sink in for a few minutes before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also paraben-free, non-comedogenic (so it won&#x27;t clog pores), water-resistant, and non-perfumed. I have sensitive skin that easily gets hives or rashes, and this has caused no problems at all. Although this is designed for normal to dry skin, it works fine on my oily/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes products arrive with an expiration date that is coming up soon, but this arrived with an expiration date that is over two years out, so it&#x27;s a fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily use of sunscreen is so important, even if the sun isn&#x27;t actually out.  I&#x27;ve been a daily sunscreen user for most of my adult life, and I credit that to my skin looking much younger than it really is. (People keep thinking I&#x27;m 30, even though I&#x27;m about to turn 40.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice product that I will definitely be re-purchasing.will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> This cream did not soak in. It made my face pale white. It also burned when I put it on. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product may be an excellent sunscreen-- however, I found this product so sticky, I don&#x27;t even want to use it.  I would not buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for LaRoche Posay&#x27;s sunsreens high &amp; low, and could only find a moisturizer with SPF 15. This is not a new product- it&#x27;s been available in Europe for a while, but the UVA blocker (Mexoryl)has recently been approved by the FDA. Dermatologists love this stuff! They use it themselves &amp; recommend it to patients.It blocks shorter &amp; longer UVA wavelenghths AND has UVB blocking of SPF 60. This particular formulation goes on as a liquid- no greasy feel &amp; no white face... it&#x27;s made for people like me who normally break out when using sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been using it even though I&#x27;m olive-skinned, as I&#x27;m on medication which has made me very susceptible to sunburn- and, so far, no burn yet, despite being outside watching my daughter play softball in the intense, summer Texas sun. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anything else again. You can check the LaRoche Posay website for full details, ingredient list, etc. I purchased the double pack from an Amazon marketplace vendor for the price of one bottle from the website, so shop around-- you definitely pay for what you get with this product-- however, good skin cancer prevention is worth it!</li>
    <li> The product is pretty good, except a bit greasy for oily skinned people like myself.</li>
    <li> I am extremely fair skinned and at 21 have already had sun damage. This sunscreen not only offers the best facial protection that I have found, but its composition as a moisturizer is superb - my skin has felt amazingly soft ever since I have started using it. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is concerned about sun protection, especially those who are pale like me and who need a sunscreen that is strong but not overpowering on the face. This is the best sunscreen around and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I recomend this product .Protects against sun like no other i have used, Some of them irritatemy my skin and cause me some kind of allergies.. I have a very sensitive skin and have no problems, even around my eyes</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that REALLY works for me. I have sun sensitivity, I am prone to get brown spots and discoloration from even a few minutes in the sun with 30+ sunscreen on!  My dermatologist began treating my brown spots and gave me this sunscreen to use to keep them from coming back. It WORKS!  I am thrilled with this product, the only thing that really keeps my skin protected, and I like how lightweight and easy to apply it is.   The container is small but it lasts a long time, you only need  a little at a time.   This 2 pack is a great value, I paid $43.00 for just one bottle!</li>
    <li> I am very careful with my skin. Have tried many different sunscreens. By far LaRoche Posay Anthelios XL 50 is the best. High protection and it goes on smoothly and my face is not shiny at all. I was very happy purchasing from Pharmamundi. Highly recommend this sunscreen and seller.</li>
    <li> This cream works nicely for my fair skin, as long as you get 50+ and you apply it thoroughly and not in patches on your back or front. Make sure you put it on 30 min before your first foray into the sun and then occasionally reapply if you continue to stay in the sun. I have to stay under the umbrella if I am out all day and this product really helps.</li>
    <li> Good price, was what I expected, and it showed up in just a few days.  Nice!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I have sensitive skin and this is great sunscreen!  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunscreen tho somewhat expensive.  I limit it to my face and neck.  It does a super job even after being out on the water all day.  I have used it for 2 years now; buying it on trips to Europe until it was available here.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and can attest to it&#x27;s excellent sun protection qualities. PHARMAMUNDI is a reputable seller. The product I ordered came quickly and was exactly as advertised.  In the past I ordered from Canada and it was considerably more expensive. This sunscreen is simply the best.  [[ASIN:B000XMIHGO LA ROCHE POSAY ANTHELIOS XL 50+ SPF60 FLUIDE EXTREME (PACK OF TWO)]]</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, my skin is 61yrs old and has had much too much sun in my youth, but this has at least stopped it in it&#x27;s tracks. I would say this iteration is best for skin on the dry side and I can wear makeup over it without the beading up of the sunscreen. This is the only product that I can wear everyday with no irritation that completely protects my skin.  I use retin a and any sun causes a severe reaction, now I can venture outside with a hat and have no problem.</li>
    <li> So i have tried several tinted moisturizer with spf 50+. I actually have this brand in fluid but i prefer the cream much better. For some reason it holds better and blends well with a concealer and powder thereafter.  I use a foundation brush to spread it everywhere. It sets nicely. Because I have melasma and still working on getting rid of it. Slowly. I still need a concealer. I love this tinted cream.</li>
    <li> Why is this 1/2 off? I like a sale but??  I always paid $50-60 for it.  I heard it was just pulled off shelf from FDA?  Why? Any side effects?  I have been using for years. I like it and it seems to work. Just worried it may be bad?</li>
    <li> I have used many of the Anthelios sunscreens, but this one smells like a combination of motor oil and gasoline.  Not sure what&#x27;s in it that smells that bad, because two of the others I&#x27;ve tried in this line didn&#x27;t smell like that.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert so I need a really good sun protection product.  This is wonderful; not greasy or irritating.  Couldn&#x27;t get any better than this.  The dealer was great; delivery was far sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> This is great news that Amazon is caring this product.  I have always had to purchase it overseas because it was not available in the United States.  I would bring home sunscreen for my children, grandchildren, friends, and myself.  This is the very best of the best in sunblock products.  Thank you stocking it.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin and most sunscreens that I tried caused breakouts and blemishes. This is a first product that didn&#x27;t - it is very light weight and you can&#x27;t even feel it. I spend a lot of time on a sailboat and this sunscreen does an EXCELLENT job of protecting my face. I wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I love it but I don&#x27;t hate it either. I&#x27;ve used better products before, I think. Doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes. That&#x27;s a big plus. I&#x27;ll be looking around more for other options.</li>
    <li> The product it is ok, but take long time to arrived. It was fine, but there is not a directions in English, so I am happy because I knew this product for long time before, otherwise, I would not be sure how to use it.</li>
    <li> The application is awful. It feels thick and sticky and leaves a white film on top of my skin that can&#x27;t be removed without rubbing it in for minutes, which then turns my skin red, so I prefer not doing that either. That alone has made me reluctant to use it ever again. Definitely does not \\&quot;Melt-In\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This was not the same product as the anthelios I purchased from Europe or Canada. Be smart by from the companies in Canada.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is absolutely fabulous.  It is also a great moisturizer.  Whenever I wear it (every day) I get compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I am an avid golfer in California. Everyone who golfs regularly knows a strong sunscreen is a must if you want to protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used various sunscreens of SPF 30-55. They are from Neutrogena and Coppertone. Although both gave me some sun protection, I felt neither gave me satisfactory results as my skin always became noticeably darker even when I wore ample amounts of SPF 55+ non-Mexoryl Sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I did some research on the best possible sunscreen and I found it was Mexoryl. It is the supreme sun protectant because it covers the broadest spectrum of UVA, which causes the most of the sunburns. Additionally, Mexoryl&#x27;s chemical properties are very resilient to the intense radiation of the sun, providing lasting protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as FDA approved Mexoryl three years ago ago, I bought Anthelios, which is SPF 60. I have used Anthelios practically everyday, including weekends, in the last 5 weeks. Here is what I have found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)The sunscreen is very easy on the eyes and doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other sunscreens. You can safely apply them around your face without the fear of the painful and dreaded sunscreen eye sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)The sunscreen protects you reasonably well, better than any other sunscreen I have tried, but only marginally. This is not a perfect sun protection. Rather, it is just better than its mediocre competitors. Don&#x27;t expect this product to keep your skin from getting significantly darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)This is the most expensive sunscreen I know.&lt;br /&gt;2)The sunscreen feels stickier than most. It leaves somewhat of a greasy feel on your face, but it isn&#x27;t too bad. It is definitely wearable for daytime activities such as work.&lt;br /&gt;3)This sunscreen is not water or sweat resistent. It comes off very easily under water or perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good sunscreen but only marginally better than its much cheaper competitors. I expect the US market will have many more sunscreens with Mexoryl in the near future at more competitive prices.at more competitive prices.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like some of the other sunblocks I used in the past. I wear this under my foundation and seems to work well and doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy.</li>
