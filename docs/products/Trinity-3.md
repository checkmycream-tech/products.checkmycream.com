      <li>well worth it !!!!</li>
      <li>I loved the tingle aspect of this.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m normally fair complected.</li>
      <li>And best of all my skin felt smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smelling good but doesn&#x27;t smell too good afterwards</li>
      <li>Not a lotion to start with if you have fair skin.</li>
      <li>Smells good.  </li>

      <li>You have to be able to handle the tingle, but it give great color.</li>

      <li>I love this lotion!</li>
      <li>I love the tingle feeling as well!</li>
      <li>It works wonders &#x3D;)!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This is THE ABSOLUTE best product I have used in years!  </li>
      <li>I have continued to use it and love, love, loveee the results of my tan with this lotion!</li>
      <li>Trinity 3 has by far been the best tingle lotion I have ever used!!!!</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth (good texture, keeps my skin from drying out when using it).</li>
      <li>The tingle was good, but didn&#x27;t really enjoy the color it gave me.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s tried even more lotions than me and agrees this has been by far our best find.</li>
      <li>But creates a beautiful tan fast.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is very light and not offensive at all.  </li>
      <li>i used back in 2007 and loved the results and haven&#x27;t seen it since !!</li>
      <li>This lotion also made me extremely light headed to the point I almost passed out!</li>
      <li>It instantly gives you color and smells great!!  </li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but its ok for the price.</li>
      <li>I am a lotion junkie :) and this lotion has given results that can&#x27;t even compare to others.</li>
      <li>so make sure you wipe the inbetween your fingers and wash your hands after you go in the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very perfume-y and can be overbearing, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it because of the impressive end result.</li>
      <li>I like lotions with a lot of tingle and if they have bronzers as well, that&#x27;s even better.</li>
      <li>If you like tingle tanning lotions, you&#x27;ll love Trinity.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much and smells great too.</li>
      <li>However for the price, there are some better tingle lotions out there. :)</li>
      <li>This lotion was ok.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more and will be looking to you all to get it from.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite lotions.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I go to, and I fell in LOVE with it...</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of lotions and this is truly my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I also love the tan it leaves after the redness disappears.</li>
      <li>Even better than the Hollywood Tans tingle lotions.</li>
      <li>it also makes your skin feel silky and smooth!</li>
      <li>love the way it feels</li>
      <li>I love tingle and use it because it helps my psoriasis.</li>
      <li>and I could tell it was a tingle right away (which is a GOOD thing)</li>
      <li>i did experience the high tingle power, but after a week or two of using it i don&#x27;t even feel the tingle, but still get great results.  </li>
      <li>stuff has a good kick of heat the first couple of times you use it</li>
      <li>Totally worth it, color results are fabulous!!</li>
      <li>so make sure you shower the next day and also wash your hands really good!  </li>
      <li>If you think it&#x27;s too much at first, I would suggest trying it a couple more times because you&#x27;ll probably get used to it and end up loving it.</li>
      <li>I often get asked where I went on vacation because my tan looks so great and natural.</li>
      <li>This lotion has both an intense tingle and triple bronzers and have given me an awesome tan and very silky smooth skin.</li>
      <li>NICE FRESH SCENT.</li>
      <li>The downfall is it will leave the coloring between fingers but other than that its awesome.</li>
      <li>Overall, I was happy with my purchase and was glad that I gave this one a shot.</li>
      <li>and wow... this is amazing!  </li>
      <li>But I searched for the best of tingle lotions and this one was considerable high on the list.</li>
      <li>Perfect for getting those legs tanned, which is pretty much only where I apply this stuff.</li>
      <li>The color pay off was super!</li>
      <li>OMG so glad i found this lotion online super cheap ..</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the tingle lotions.</li>
      <li>Trinity 3 gives me great overall color.</li>
      <li>The price was great as well, they were selling a similar product at the tanning bed for over $60</li>
      <li>I purchased this product after hearing rumors that it was one of the hottest tingles available.</li>
      <li>Then later on, they become a beautiful golden tan color.</li>
      <li>im super excited too receive</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>NOT A BAD ATO EIGHTHER.</li>
      <li>From the first time I used this lotion i fell in love and had to buy a bottle right away in the salon.</li>
      <li>The after tan smell was pretty strong.  </li>
      <li>This product delivered tremendous results after just one use.  </li>
      <li>I love lotions with high tingle factor and heat..</li>
      <li>This was a different from product Was very pleased with how it worked.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have bought this from a tanning salon and it was awesome after three tanning sessions I was pretty dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However for some reason when I bought it off here it welped up my skin and made my skin have way too much of a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;. My skin would feel like it was burning hours afterwards from this and didn&#x27;t leave much of a tan. Will not buy this again from amazon. It almost like its not the same than from the salons.</li>
    <li> I went on a limb with this lotion purchase. And believe me I am a tanning fanatic. I&#x27;ve never really been too fond of devoted creations. But I searched for the best of tingle lotions and this one was considerable high on the list. So I had to give it a try. I loved the tingle aspect of this. It is def. one of the hottest lotions ive used. However, the color of the lotion is just too dark - DO NOT use this unless you have a DARK tan or it will look a bit orange. If not applied evenly it will streak and stain your clothes. I cut it with a white lotion (goddess by designer skin - another intense tingle) so that the lotion color wasn&#x27;t so ridiculously brown. Overall, I was happy with my purchase and was glad that I gave this one a shot. However for the price, there are some better tingle lotions out there. :)</li>
    <li> really good nice tingle when u get out about ten mins gets u real dark wash your hands good after use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a few months now and wow... this is amazing!  It does get hot especially the first few times you use it. But creates a beautiful tan fast.  I have tried a lot of lotions and this is truly my favorite.  Doesn&#x27;t take much and smells great too.</li>
    <li> Good color(not too bronzy). Intense sizzle (if you&#x27;re not used to sizzle I wouldn&#x27;t start with this one. Goes on smooth (good texture, keeps my skin from drying out when using it). Overall good product. Just not the hugest fan of the smell. It&#x27;s not gross but not yummy either.</li>
    <li> i bought this not to long ago. the day i first used it, it left the orange all between my fingers so make sure you wipe the inbetween your fingers and wash your hands after you go in the tanning bed. other than that i liked the product left me with a nice bronzed look and the tingle factor i think is just right.</li>
    <li> This lotion was ok. The tingle was good, but didn&#x27;t really enjoy the color it gave me. It was more of a tingle then deep bronzer. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but its ok for the price.</li>
    <li> This is without question the finest \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; lotion I&#x27;ve used. As a naturally fair-skinned tanner, it takes a great lotion to give me really dark results. I&#x27;ve used a wide range of products (especially from the Devoted Creations line) and this is the all around best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used.     A word of caution-- test this product on a small part of your skin before you apply it all over. I&#x27;ve known several people who are allergic to Trinity. If you have sensitive skin, you may have an adverse reaction to \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; lotions.     If you like tingle tanning lotions, you&#x27;ll love Trinity.</li>
    <li> This is THE ABSOLUTE best product I have used in years!  I tanned the same evening as I received it and did not have a terrible \\&quot;sensation\\&quot; while tanning.  HOWEVER, after I tanned I went on a 3 mile run and WOW!  By the time i finished up I was developing and I can say it was awesome!  I had reached a plateau and have tanned for several years.  This product delivered tremendous results after just one use.  I am darker this morning.  And best of all my skin felt smooth and silky.  There is NO smell after you tan!  The fragrance is very light and not offensive at all.  Don&#x27;t even think about it - order this!  You will be happy you did!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have never used a DC lotion before, but had read some decent reviews. I noticed a difference after the first use. I have tried SB Stunning, Paint it Black, Designer Skin products, but this one tops them all. Plus it smelled great too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing rumors that it was one of the hottest tingles available. WOW! I only use it on my legs and boy is it BLAZING hot! The color pay off was super! It does contain a large about of bronzers , so you must apply evenly and wash your hands well after, even so it stays on your skin. I use gloves, because, I don&#x27;t want it transferring to other places I may touch like my face or anyone else. If you are new to tingles then do not buy this product. If you are a tingle junkie, then Trinity 3 will satisfy!</li>
    <li> I just do not obtain a tan without using a great lotion...or going to the carribean for a couple of weeks. This lotion has both an intense tingle and triple bronzers and have given me an awesome tan and very silky smooth skin.I often get asked where I went on vacation because my tan looks so great and natural. I tried many lotions and have been disappointed over and over, but I have found the results I have been looking for with this product. I&#x27;m normally fair complected. I have also noticed that I tend to hold my color longer with this product. My salon does not carry this product but they have been happy to order it for me...at their higher prices of course.So I am happy to see that I can buy it much cheaper online. I&#x27;m a 40 year old mom(30 at heart) and my 20 year old daughter loves this product as well. She&#x27;s known to all by her year round tan. She&#x27;s tried even more lotions than me and agrees this has been by far our best find. My husband has even began to tan and he&#x27;s had great results with this product as well. Love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tanned for years and have just recently started using tingle lotions. I&#x27;m waiting on a shipment of another lotion I ordered so I got packets of this at my salon the last two times I tanned. The first time I used it, I felt the tingle and it got a little hot, but was not a bad feeling. It lasted maybe 20-30 minutes after tanning and then it felt like a mild sunburn until the next day. Nothing major. The second time I used it, I barely felt any sort of tingle and barely even turned pink like I did the first time. So far none of them have really had much of an effect on me- so maybe it&#x27;s just me personally that tingles wear off quickly? As for color payoff, I&#x27;m not sure it made much of a difference besides the first visit. I think maybe I got a shade darker, but not much difference.  The bronzers don&#x27;t seem too heavy in this lotion. The scent is okay- a little perfumey for my taste, but not bad. ATO isn&#x27;t too bad.  But overall this lotion is just okay for me. Nothing I would repurchase. Going to try some others.</li>
    <li> this product has to be one of the best tingle and bronzer lotions for 2011.  Use caution when you are using it for the first time though.  If you are sensitive to a tingle lotion this may not be for you  However, if you like the tingle and bronzer combo than this is the lotion for you!</li>
    <li> I like to get really dark without tanning very often, and this product makes that possible! This has to be the best tanning lotion out there, it is truely my favorite!</li>
    <li> I bought a packet of this lotion at the tanning salon I go to, and I fell in LOVE with it...I came home and ordered a bottle..If you want to get dark results, and like HOT, TRY IT. Just make sure to shower before touching other people.</li>
    <li> I am getting ready to buy my third bottle of this...LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! I love the tingle feeling as well! Works great, no streak and smells great!</li>
    <li> I am an experienced tanner, I&#x27;ve been tanning for almost 10 years and have been using lotion with tingle for the majority of that time. I like lotions with a lot of tingle and if they have bronzers as well, that&#x27;s even better. The tingle is the most intense the first time you use this lotion. After that, you can still feel it and it still gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not as intense. If you think it&#x27;s too much at first, I would suggest trying it a couple more times because you&#x27;ll probably get used to it and end up loving it. I&#x27;ve read in a couple reviews that people said you need to be careful because it makes you orange in between your fingers, but I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over a week now and it hasn&#x27;t happened to me. Trinity 3 gives me great overall color. I was kind of at a tanning plateau before using this lotion, and after using this a few times I&#x27;m already a couple shades darker. The one thing I can live without would be the scent. It&#x27;s very perfume-y and can be overbearing, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it because of the impressive end result. Overall I really like this product and am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> From the first time I used this lotion i fell in love and had to buy a bottle right away in the salon. Paying $70 dollars is so worth it but getting my second bottle on amazon was cheaper and I can get 3 bottles for the price of one.  It is a hot lotion so you will get really hot and red if u have not used tingles before. This lotion gets me a few shades darker in one visit! Mix this with another lotion that has a bronzer and never use a tingle lotion on your face!</li>
    <li> OMG so glad i found this lotion online super cheap .. i used back in 2007 and loved the results and haven&#x27;t seen it since !! fast results tingle not so bad itchy but well worth it !!!! im super excited too receive so i can throw away all the other pricey lotions i bought that suck! YAY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion. Not for the faint of heart lol, it is an extreme tingle!! Totally worth it, color results are fabulous!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. The first time I used it, I tried it on my legs which don&#x27;t tan very easily and after that one use, I definitely noticed a color improvement that I hadn&#x27;t been getting even after tanning for almost a month. The tingle wasn&#x27;t too bad at all, just itchy. The second time I used this I tried it on my arms which also were not keeping up with the color of the rest of my body. Wow, in just one use my arms totally caught up with the rest of my body, I was so happy. The tingle effect for me personally was not that intense so if you&#x27;re worried about that, you might not have to be but the effects are still great. Can&#x27;t wait to use it more!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, it is a hot tingle for sure, but the smell is nothing to brag about, decent lotion and the bronzer is decent too, nothing real special.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is terrible. I doesn&#x27;t seem to help the tanning process. It is very hot (tingles) and I&#x27;ve used old Swedish Beauty high tingle factors. It stinks and the bronzes in it is apparently not good with oriental skin. It turned me orange. Also, use gloves when applying because it will get stuck in between your fingers and make your hands look like you&#x27;ve been playing in red clay mud and forgot to wash them. It stinks too. This lotion also made me extremely light headed to the point I almost passed out! A tanning salon clerk told me it was because for a high concentration of Niacin in it, but idk. I threw the bottle away. I&#x27;m a Swedish Beauty girl and always will be. Forget the lower quality products like these and go with something that is time tested and proven to work.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! You have to be able to handle the tingle, but it give great color. Not a lotion to start with if you have fair skin.</li>
    <li> [ AT FIRST TRY IT WAS REALLY HOT AND I FELT THE TINGLING,BUT AFTER FIRST TRY I DIDNT FEEL ANYTHING UNLESS I PUT IT ON MY FACE AND THATS A NO-NO]</li>
    <li> Best tan ever it&#x27;s tingle you will burn if you use it in the sun!!! I think it&#x27;s great if you need a tan it  truly works the tan!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Friday and it arrived at my house on the following Monday! It says this is a level 3 tingle and I don&#x27;t know about the different levels but I didn&#x27;t think that it tingled any more than any other tingle lotion I have used in the past.  I don&#x27;t usually notice anything until an hour after tanning.  The tingle effect lasted several hours for me.  The after tan smell was pretty strong.  It goes on smelling good but doesn&#x27;t smell too good afterwards so make sure you shower the next day and also wash your hands really good!  All in all I would say this lotion is probably pretty average.</li>
    <li> Myt girlfriend tried this tanning lotion and she shortly thereafter got rashes and blotches across her body.  We don&#x27;t know if this is just her being sensitive to the lotion, or the lotion itself, but it something to keep in mind.  If you are think you may be sensitive these types of lotions, I&#x27;d suggest applying it to only a small portion of your body, like your forearm, before rubbing it all over your body.  The other reviews are good, so it may just be my girlfriend&#x27;s skin didn&#x27;t agree with the lotion, but we would definitely suggest testing it on a small portion first, lest your whole body gets itchy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Trinity 3 now about 4 times a week for the past two months. This is THE BEST lotion i have ever used. I have been an avid tanner for 9 years and have tried over 50 lotions. I am a lotion junkie :) and this lotion has given results that can&#x27;t even compare to others. The combination of the bronzer and the tingle give a gorgeous dark color after very few uses. The first few times using Trinity 3 i did experience the high tingle power, but after a week or two of using it i don&#x27;t even feel the tingle, but still get great results.  I recommend not showering for 4 hours at least after using this lotion to let the bronzer soak in. That really makes a difference. :) I would HIGHLY recommend this lotion to anyone wanting a serious tan!! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried several different tanning lotions and this one is by far my favorite.  I love lotions with high tingle factor and heat..this one has topped them all for me.  I also love the tan it leaves after the redness disappears.</li>
    <li> I am skeptical when buying anything off Amazon, especially anything like cosmetics or lotions because they have a tendency to be fake if you&#x27;re not careful. I was pleasantly surprised with this. I used it and I could tell it was a tingle right away (which is a GOOD thing) and I got very dark after just one use! I have continued to use it and love, love, loveee the results of my tan with this lotion! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> WOW!! All I have to say is that I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and this lotion REALLY WORKS!! I not only get the tingle, but it bronzes my legs upon the first tanning session. Granted I wouldn&#x27;t use it until I have a slight base tan. The tingle was more intense the first time I tried it, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. Now I barely notice it anymore, but I can tell it&#x27;s working because my legs are red after I get out of the booth. Then later on, they become a beautiful golden tan color. This works on the first session, and only intensifies with multiple sessions in a row. Perfect for getting those legs tanned, which is pretty much only where I apply this stuff. It could work for arms too, but they get tan enough without tingle. I have tried many tingle lotions, and this one is the best one yet. Even better than the Hollywood Tans tingle lotions. Give it a try, and if anything, test it on a small area of skin before you go full out. It works wonders &#x3D;)!</li>
    <li> The first time i used this, i put it on my face. BIG MISTAKE. It ruined my face! My skin tone is terribly uneven. I have lines on my face to this day. I thought that tanning more often would fix it, but i was wrong. I used it again but this time only on my arms and legs. Somehow, my face started burning again. Why is this lotion doing this to my face? Now it&#x27;s even worse. I just had to call out of work. Ughhh.</li>
    <li> This lotion gets me very dark after I tan. But I don&#x27;t think it is worth it, because the lotion makes me very itchy. It also makes my skin get red and blotchy. It is so intense, that sometimes when I use it I feel like I am going to pass out. If it doesn&#x27;t make me feel sick, I still feel extremely itchy and I cannot stand it. I have to take a shower right away after using it, and it still takes about an hour even after a shower for the itchiness to go away.</li>
    <li> love the way it feels after i tan and it smells great!! it also makes your skin feel silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS LOTION ON AMAZON BECAUSE ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS. WELL I FINALLY GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT TODAY AND LET ME TELL U THIS STUFF IS HOT! I USED IT ON MY FACE EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I SHOULDNT AND WOW I WONT DO THAT AGAIN LOL. I ALWAYS DO BUT THIS IS TO HOT FOR THE FACE. I WAS A LITTLE RED FOR A WHILE AFTER BUT NOTHING SERIOUS AND THE COLOR TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULL. IM ATLEAST THREE SHADES DARKER THEN I WAS BEFORE I GOT INTO THE BED TODAY. MY SKIN FEELS LIKE SILK TOO. I LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS LOTION ALOT. NICE FRESH SCENT. NOT A BAD ATO EIGHTHER. I WILL DEFENITLY BE USING THIS LOTION ON A REGULAR BASIS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  THIS LOTION TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A DEEP BROWN TAN. 5 STARS ON THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful! I felt horrible after using it. And broke out in hives. I have used other tingle lotions, and have never had this type of reaction to them.</li>
    <li> This was a different from product Was very pleased with how it worked. Will be ordering more and will be looking to you all to get it from.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the tingle lotions. Trinity 3 has by far been the best tingle lotion I have ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very hot.  Smells good.  Not sure if it is as good as Insanely Black, which I use all the time.  I love tingle and use it because it helps my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is by far the hottest I have ever used. Do not put it near your face. The downfall is it will leave the coloring between fingers but other than that its awesome.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lotions.  It instantly gives you color and smells great!!  The price was great as well, they were selling a similar product at the tanning bed for over $60</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion! not a strong tingle; I have used it for over a year and my friends use it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Tans you dark but not for the average/novice tanner. It is hot!</li>
    <li> Trinity 3 is really a decent lotion, but we don&#x27;t want just decent lotions.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a good kick of heat the first couple of times you use it but after then, the sizzling effect dies out and all you have left is a lotion that smells \\&quot;ok\\&quot; with a ton of bronzer.  I bought a Designer Skin tingle lotion recently, and hopefully it will work much better.</li>
