      <li>This wig is great for the price!</li>
      <li>Awesome awesome wig!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a wonderful wig for a great price!</li>
      <li>Great color and thickness, one of the best wigs I have ever used.</li>
      <li>brought considering a scarlet witch cosplay, but could use any given day is beautiful</li>
      <li>problem I had was parting it and making it look it good from the top.&lt;br</li>
      <li>X&amp;Y angels sends amazing products for the cost definitely love this wig sooo chic!!</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased that it arrived a week before the earliest estimate....</li>
      <li>The color is great and the hair is soft and does not tangle I love it!!!</li>
      <li>It is actually a really nice color</li>
      <li>The curls fall down beautifully and fits wonderfully on my head.</li>
      <li>It also does not come with a wig cap but that&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>Good product worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>Looks really cute with a hat or beanie.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tad bit shiny, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I really love this wig</li>
      <li>beautiful, hair looks natural</li>
      <li>The clips to secure the wig onto your head would have worked fine, had one of the clips not separated from its elastic strap the moment after I clipped them together for the very first time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased by the outcome and will gladly buy more X&amp;Y wigs in the future</li>
      <li>Very fun and sexy, but also very realistic</li>
      <li>It is actually full and silky, the color is more golden blonde than light brown.</li>
      <li>It was soft and comfortable!</li>
      <li>The curls are really nice and keep their shape when brushed.</li>
      <li>Huge section on the back with no hair at all, which was too easily exposed.</li>
      <li>I love this wig is very soft, has natural appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a full head of curls, that&#x27;s not usually how wigs work.</li>
      <li>Honestly I never really expected anything with this cheap wig.</li>
      <li>Its super soft and not too shiny.</li>
      <li>Mine was much much darker than pictured.</li>
      <li>I wanted this mainly for cosplay.</li>
      <li>I managed to get a real X&amp;Y Angel through Amazon, once, but this one was definitely not the real thing.</li>
      <li>Some people even believed that this was my actual hair at a first glance.</li>
      <li>The hair color is just slightly lighter than what&#x27;s shown in the picture, but that&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
      <li>It is a decent wig, though, and I&#x27;ll be using it because it isn&#x27;t worth the trouble to send it back.</li>
      <li>Not as thick and full as the picture shows.</li>

<li> Shorter than expected, dry, frizzy, and prone to tangles.</li>
<li> The cap is a little different but does not effect the style or look of the hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
<li> The one I got was almost the same color, but it was much shorter than the pictures showed, and was also very thin and started tangling as soon as I put it on.</li>
<li> The cap itself was entirely too small to even cover my head.</li>
<li> The wig I received came just before its shipping date but was not exactly the wig I ordered.</li>
<li> Anyways, too much trouble to send it back all the way to China... got lazy</li>
<li> Almost black</li>
<li> (I have a small head.)</li>
<li> It is too small for the head, and it made my head look abnormally disfigured.  </li>
<li> Definitely was a fake.</li>
<li> I bought this for cosplay but only received a wrong wig.</li>
<li> This should work for I needed, but I wish it was as thick as I was expecting.</li>
<li> Lots of broken hairs.</li>
<li> Incredibly thin.</li>
<li> Horrible.  </li>

    <li> X&amp;Y angels sends amazing products for the cost definitely love this wig sooo chic!!</li>
    <li> Definitely was a fake. Shorter than expected, dry, frizzy, and prone to tangles. Lots of broken hairs. Huge section on the back with no hair at all, which was too easily exposed. I managed to get a real X&amp;Y Angel through Amazon, once, but this one was definitely not the real thing.</li>
    <li> The wig I received came just before its shipping date but was not exactly the wig I ordered.

The clips to secure the wig onto your head would have worked fine, had one of the clips not separated from its elastic strap the moment after I clipped them together for the very first time.

    <li> it&#x27;s shorter than the picture.</li>
    <li> Honestly I never really expected anything with this cheap wig. I bought this for cosplay but only received a wrong wig. The style I received was a shoulder length curly blonde wig with bangs. Anyways, too much trouble to send it back all the way to China... got lazy and I just figured I could use that wig for another cosplay... Probably will never order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the quality of this $9 wig. It was soft and comfortable! It&#x27;s a tad bit shiny, but that&#x27;s okay. There are plenty of tips and tricks to reduce that shine! The curls fall down beautifully and fits wonderfully on my head. The hair color is just slightly lighter than what&#x27;s shown in the picture, but that&#x27;s totally fine. It&#x27;s still a wonderful wig for a great price! Some people even believed that this was my actual hair at a first glance. I&#x27;m pleased by the outcome and will gladly buy more X&amp;Y wigs in the future</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome wig! Great color and thickness, one of the best wigs I have ever used. Very fun and sexy, but also very realistic</li>
    <li> I love this wig is very soft, has natural appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I brought considering a scarlet witch cosplay, but could use any given day is beautiful</li>
    <li> Looks really cute with a hat or beanie.&lt;br /&gt;A bit shiny but nothing dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was faster than expected.Good product worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I had was parting it and making it look it good from the top.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said wear with a hat or beanie.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Incredibly thin. The wig cap was literally showing through the hair. The cap itself was entirely too small to even cover my head. (I have a small head.) It was like wearing a yarmulke with a ponytail attached.</li>
    <li> This wig is great for the price! The cap is a little different but does not effect the style or look of the hair. It is actually full and silky, the color is more golden blonde than light brown. It is actually a really nice color and I am very pleased that it arrived a week before the earliest estimate....</li>
    <li> It is too small for the head, and it made my head look abnormally disfigured.  Not officially from X&amp;Y ANGEL!!!</li>
    <li> Mine was much much darker than pictured. Almost black</li>
    <li> Not as thick and full as the picture shows. I wanted this mainly for cosplay. This should work for I needed, but I wish it was as thick as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I really love this wig and I get a lot of compliments wearing this wig as well. The color is great and the hair is soft and does not tangle I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Very great wig! Its super soft and not too shiny. The brown is a bit darker than it looked in the picture but I prefer that. Don&#x27;t expect a full head of curls, that&#x27;s not usually how wigs work. The curls are really nice and keep their shape when brushed. It also does not come with a wig cap but that&#x27;s OK</li>
    <li> beautiful, hair looks natural</li>
    <li> a very beautiful and nicely made wig!!!</li>
