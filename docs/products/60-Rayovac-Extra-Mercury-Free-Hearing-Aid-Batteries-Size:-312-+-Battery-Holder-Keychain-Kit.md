<li> The last package of 60 batteries I ordered had 3 dead batteries so far</li>
<li> They last about a week the same as any other brand.</li>
<li> These batteries seem to work for the same period of time as other brands that I purchased.</li>
<li> I think Rayovac lasts longer than other brands, however, I dislike the packaging.  </li>
<li> Worked as they should, but possibly not better than other brands, however will probably order again.  </li>
