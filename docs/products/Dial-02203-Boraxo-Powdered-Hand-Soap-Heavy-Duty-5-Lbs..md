      <li>The best hand cleaner!</li>
      <li>This soap is very good for getting oil and grease removed from your hands.  </li>

      <li>Great stuff, have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>Smells good, works great, affordable, lasts a looong time.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes, there&#x27;s just no way to improve a product, and Boraxo hand cleaner is a good example.</li>
      <li>Using it when I go to Teds Montana Grill Restaurants reminded me of the product and how good it is.</li>
      <li>Boraxo hand soap has always been a good product.</li>
      <li>I work on my cars fairly often  </li>
      <li>I find it amazing how many great products have been ruined in this fashion.      </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>we use this at the refinery to clean hands in bathroom thats how I ran across it, works great.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best hand cleaner around.</li>
      <li>I wish the grain was finer but as a product it is still the most effective hand washing product I have for getting grease off.</li>
      <li>Whatever made the original so good ( and I still have some )  </li>
      <li>The original Boraxo hand soap was finely ground almost like sugar and had a great smell.</li>
      <li>GREAT for exfoliation yet very gentle.</li>
      <li>But gets the dirt and grease off easily and effectively</li>
      <li>I used this in elemantary school,it is abrasive so its better with dispenser, messier environments, not home use.</li>
      <li>Much better than anything with &amp;#34;micro-beads&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t kill wildlife...</li>
      <li>I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INCLINED TO GIVE MORE STARS.</li>
      <li>service was fast, soap is great.</li>
      <li>A product that has been around for 120 years and still better than any soap hand cleaner made today.</li>
      <li>and i must say no soap I&#x27;ve ever tried works better than this at getting it off.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>Glad i found this here and decide to try it again.  </li>
      <li>I will purchase more</li>
      <li>Used the canned Boraxo for many years.  </li>
      <li>WORKS BETTER THAN MOST HAND CLEANERS I HAVE USED.</li>
      <li>One more piece of advice - purchase a parmesan cheese sprinkler with this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the best hand soap for getting soiled/greasy hands clean quickly.  </li>
      <li>Some worked pretty good</li>
      <li>So glad it&#x27;s available through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I fill an empty plastic creamer bottle and it works great!</li>
      <li>Great old and tried Product---Still inexpensive</li>
      <li>Good and gentle hand cleaning product, &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; created by mother earth , not oil based,or solvent based just washes of with the dirt.</li>
      <li>About the best hand cleaner around - takes off stuff that other hand cleaners don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I use it in my garage and it takes the grease off easily.</li>
      <li>It rinses off easily leaving no slippery residue and almost no scent.  </li>
      <li>I had to mix it with a fine grain BORAXO salvage soap which I had.</li>
      <li>This is the genuine article, powdered Boraxo handsoap.</li>
      <li>Every day, 5-100 times a day, I get a free hand massage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years and like a lot of the good old standbys, I think it is still one of the best, general purpose deep hand cleaners.</li>
      <li>My hands come out looking and feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works ok  but is much coarser and doesn&#x27;t have that clean smell.      </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that an empty plastic shaker herb bottle full beside the sink is attractive and works well.</li>
      <li>And it leaves your hands kind of soft.</li>
      <li>I was surprised  they still  made it and decided to try it again after seeing all the good reviews and for old times sake.  </li>
      <li>Now keeping it in a very large &amp;#34;spice jar&amp;#34; in the shower (the kind with holes as big as those made by a paper punch, so they won&#x27;t clog).</li>
      <li>However if you are a wuss this product may not be a good fit for you as it is gritty and rough.</li>
      <li>Works for every need grease, grime, smells on your hands from cooking and leaves your hands feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I tried many different kinds of hand cleaners.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, it works better than regular soap.</li>
      <li>Prompt service and product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>My skin was SO soft and smooth, afterward.</li>
      <li>like so many things that actually worked.    </li>
      <li>Being interested in the environment, I use this in my laundry recipe.</li>
      <li>I first found this soap at a metal foundry where I work security.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t possibly give this a higher review or more stars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found too that it doesn&#x27;t dry one&#x27;s skin as badly as many of the solvent based cleaners.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something similar to the discontinued Anco powdered hand soap, and this fit the bill exactly.</li>
      <li>It is very economical to use, especially if you buy this large size.</li>
      <li>Works really well to get grease and grime off but the grain is a bit course.</li>
      <li>The soap is very sand like and scratches my hands as I wash with this soap.</li>
      <li>Its a gentle exfoliator and doesn&#x27;t have salicylic acid or anything else in it</li>
      <li>I would highly Recommend this product to anyone!</li>
      <li>I tried to get the soap I could only find 35 to 50 pounds available.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery from vendor.</li>
      <li>Shipping was lightning fast however.</li>
      <li>When hands are dirty, this is the best you will ever find for cleaning hands and leaving them feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Luckily The Sheraton had instructions posted next to the soap.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have used this stuff since wood shop in junior high 1961.  </li>
      <li>Bar soap gets you fake clean borax gets you real clean.</li>
      <li>Either that or Boraxo saves .000001 cents per unit with the new formula.        </li>
      <li>Simply the best for dirty greasy hands.  </li>
      <li>to Amazon for providing a marketplace for small family vendors to provide products in a huge market.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
      <li>This will clean all the oily dirt away on your hands as well as all the other grimmy stuff from working in aerospace, cars, or the yard.</li>
      <li>I remember when i was a little kid they used to have this soap in most of the public restrooms</li>
      <li>Thanks for providing a product that used to be universally available, but now is hard to find at retail</li>
      <li>I purchased &amp;#34;New Commercial Stainless Steel Versatile Dredge Shaker,</li>
      <li>This really scrubs your hands, it doesn&#x27;t only sanitize.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a gentle soap but definitely does the job.  </li>
      <li>Old School.  </li>
      <li>but I gotta say that out of all of them Boraxo, by far, got my hands the cleanest.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>I call it man soap, my 6 year old son calls it pokey soap.  </li>
      <li>I have an old soap dispenser and ran out of soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the genuine article, powdered Boraxo handsoap. Great stuff, have been using it for years. No sissy perfume odor or greasy hand cleaner. Fast delivery from vendor. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> we use this at the refinery to clean hands in bathroom thats how I ran across it, works great.  I will purchase more</li>
    <li> Boraxo powdered hand soap met all of my expectations for grease removal. It removes the toughest of stains and leaves your hands feeling clean, without being harsh on skin. I was looking for something similar to the discontinued Anco powdered hand soap, and this fit the bill exactly.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF!    Old School.  So hard to find on a retailers shelf in a small   town like Chicago....yet, this product takes off all of   the grease, grime, and \\&quot;schmootz\\&quot; (a Technical term),  from a MetalWorkers very dirty hands-  and leaves then tender (well- sorta) as can be!    The \\&quot;Blue Bix\\&quot; is a finer texture than the Red Box-   so it&#x27;s my   personal Preference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years and like a lot of the good old standbys, I think it is still one of the best, general purpose deep hand cleaners. It keeps for years without going oily rancid like some other cleaners. It cleans deep into those tough skin crevices. I&#x27;ve found too that it doesn&#x27;t dry one&#x27;s skin as badly as many of the solvent based cleaners. It cleans the surface without leaching out the deeper skin oils, at least not quite so badly. It is very economical to use, especially if you buy this large size. I don&#x27;t use it rapidly enough to warrant a commercial dispenser. I&#x27;ve found that an empty plastic shaker herb bottle full beside the sink is attractive and works well. Keep the remainder socked away somewhere out of the way.</li>
    <li> About the best hand cleaner around - takes off stuff that other hand cleaners don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> service was fast, soap is great. Pleasure doing business with Amazon. com. When making a purchse I try to get it through Amazon</li>
    <li> Thanks for providing a product that used to be universally available, but now is hard to find at retail outlets.&lt;br /&gt;Thank to Amazon for providing a marketplace for small family vendors to provide products in a huge market.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> Great old and tried Product---Still inexpensive and it still cleans as it always did</li>
    <li> removes grease and grime with ease. It is the same soap I used years ago. I&#x27;ll buy it here again.</li>
    <li> Scrubs the tough stuff off you hands.  I call it man soap, my 6 year old son calls it pokey soap.  Man hands get a different kind of dirty and this stuff takes care of it quick.</li>
    <li> The best hand cleaner!</li>
    <li> Being interested in the environment, I use this in my laundry recipe.</li>
    <li> While I know this is supposed to be for cleaning hands, I use it on my face. My boyfriend suggested I use it to treat my breakouts and it works great! Its a gentle exfoliator and doesn&#x27;t have salicylic acid or anything else in it like acne products do, so it actually works. Love it!</li>
    <li> I remember from my childhood!! My dad wouldn&#x27;t be caught without his tin of Boraxo! This is by far the best hand cleaner around.</li>
    <li> Great service! Prompt service and product exactly as described. My husband and I remember this product from when we were growing up and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed at all.</li>
    <li> Makes cleaning hands simple and leaves them soft!  Mechanic&#x27;s dream.  Boraxo is the only cleaner we have found that is very tough on grease and dirt and leaves hands feeling moisturized when done.</li>
    <li> The powered hand soap arrived on time and well packaged. The soap is very sand like and scratches my hands as I wash with this soap. I had to mix it with a fine grain BORAXO salvage soap which I had. Now it cleans the grease and dirt from my hands without the scratching from the boxed product, Suggest buying the regular grade of BORAXO instead of the Professional soap.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works great, affordable, lasts a looong time.  What else do you need?</li>
    <li> The original Boraxo hand soap was finely ground almost like sugar and had a great smell. This stuff works ok  but is much coarser and doesn&#x27;t have that clean smell.      Whatever made the original so good ( and I still have some )  is probably banned by the Feds.   like so many things that actually worked.    Either that or Boraxo saves .000001 cents per unit with the new formula.        I find it amazing how many great products have been ruined in this fashion.      Shipping was lightning fast however.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR. DOES NOT MAKE SUDS, BUT ADDING A SMALL AMOUT (ONE DROP) OF LIQUID SOAP WORKS QUITE WELL. REMOVES GREASE AND TREE SAP QUITE WELL. WORKS BETTER THAN MOST HAND CLEANERS I HAVE USED. DOES NOT LEAVE THAT GREASY FEELING AFTER RINSING. IF IT HAD MADE A LATHER I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INCLINED TO GIVE MORE STARS. HOPE THIS IS ENOUGHT WORDS.IT DID COME ON TIME AS ALL THE STUFF I ORDERD FROM THE ZON.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it locally...this was the perfect solution...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It&#x27;s absolutely the best hand soap for getting soiled/greasy hands clean quickly.  But it, you&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
    <li> I have an old soap dispenser and ran out of soap. I tried to get the soap I could only find 35 to 50 pounds available. I was so disappointed then I found this in 5lb box and it came within a couple of days. I like this soap because it cleans well doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands and it leaves skin feeling soft and silky afterwards. I use it in my garage and it takes the grease off easily.</li>
    <li> I remember when i was a little kid they used to have this soap in most of the public restrooms and i hated it because it felt like rubbing sand.  I was surprised  they still  made it and decided to try it again after seeing all the good reviews and for old times sake.  I work on my cars fairly often  and my hands get pretty dirty with that thick caked on grease and i must say no soap I&#x27;ve ever tried works better than this at getting it off.  I  like that sand feeling now .  My hands come out looking and feeling clean.  Glad i found this here and decide to try it again.  Hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> well packaged - just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Boraxo hand soap has always been a good product.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love...with a soap? Odd, I know. But I can&#x27;t tell you how passionate I am about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this soap I was at a Sheraton Hotel approximately 3 years ago. I was a little confused regarding how to get started. Luckily The Sheraton had instructions posted next to the soap. So I followed the instructions, and got the best hand massage of my life. Now I wash my hands solely with this in my home. Every day, 5-100 times a day, I get a free hand massage. Furthermore, it works better than regular soap. This really scrubs your hands, it doesn&#x27;t only sanitize. My hands are softer and feel different after using this for the past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t possibly give this a higher review or more stars. This is a 100/100 product. One more piece of advice - purchase a parmesan cheese sprinkler with this. The box is large and heavy. You need something to sprinkle the soap onto your hand with. I purchased &amp;#34;New Commercial Stainless Steel Versatile Dredge Shaker, Set of 2&amp;#34; from Update International here on Amazon. These are perfect for this soap!</li>
    <li> Works really well to get grease and grime off but the grain is a bit course. I wish the grain was finer but as a product it is still the most effective hand washing product I have for getting grease off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mechanic and this is the Best stuff in the world for washing hands.</li>
    <li> I have used BORAXO since I was a kid. This will clean all the oily dirt away on your hands as well as all the other grimmy stuff from working in aerospace, cars, or the yard. I mix it with my fancy smelling liquid soap and it makes a perfect combination of clean!!! I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Use it daily will not be without it.</li>
    <li> I have worked with my hands all my life as a machine operator, plumber, pipe fitter, and welder. Needless to say my hands would not only get dirty but a ground in, I&#x27;m not coming out, kind of dirty. I tried many different kinds of hand cleaners. Some worked pretty good but I gotta say that out of all of them Boraxo, by far, got my hands the cleanest. Boraxo removed not some, not most, but all the grime and corruption from my hands and arms. I will continue to use this product as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I first found this soap at a metal foundry where I work security. This stuff works great. However if you are a wuss this product may not be a good fit for you as it is gritty and rough. But gets the dirt and grease off easily and effectively</li>
    <li> I used this in elemantary school,it is abrasive so its better with dispenser, messier environments, not home use.</li>
    <li> Good and gentle hand cleaning product, &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; created by mother earth , not oil based,or solvent based just washes of with the dirt.</li>
    <li> This soap is very good for getting oil and grease removed from your hands.  So glad it&#x27;s available through Amazon.  Nothing compares in the local markets.  This isn&#x27;t a gentle soap but definitely does the job.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended using this as a soap for face and body. One shower and I&#x27;m hooked. GREAT for exfoliation yet very gentle. My skin was SO soft and smooth, afterward. Combine this with dry body brushing and wow. Now keeping it in a very large &amp;#34;spice jar&amp;#34; in the shower (the kind with holes as big as those made by a paper punch, so they won&#x27;t clog). Highly recommended. Much better than anything with &amp;#34;micro-beads&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t kill wildlife...</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff since wood shop in junior high 1961.  It is gritty soap that cleans really dirty greasy hands and not so dirty hands as well.  It rinses off easily leaving no slippery residue and almost no scent.  You need to get a dispenser with this product to work well.  My dispenser is mounted over my mop sink in the garage.</li>
    <li> I was looking everywhere locally and couldn&#x27;t find it. Using it when I go to Teds Montana Grill Restaurants reminded me of the product and how good it is. This is the greatest hand soap ever! Works for every need grease, grime, smells on your hands from cooking and leaves your hands feeling soft and smooth. A product that has been around for 120 years and still better than any soap hand cleaner made today.</li>
    <li> My shop is equipped with the vintage type Boraxo dispensers.  Sometimes, there&#x27;s just no way to improve a product, and Boraxo hand cleaner is a good example.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I go fishing a lot &amp; I use this product to wash my hands &amp; it takes away the odor on my hands! I also use it to wash my hands everyday!  I would highly Recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> When hands are dirty, this is the best you will ever find for cleaning hands and leaving them feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Used the canned Boraxo for many years.  Was disappointed when I could no longer find it in stores.  It is now difficult to find online.  Took a chance and bought this instead.  It seems to be the same product.  I fill an empty plastic creamer bottle and it works great!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It contains the hard granules that provide some abrasive action. And it leaves your hands kind of soft. This is the one soap that will cut through grease and other hard to remove soils on your hands. It is the same soap that comes in the much more expensive (per unit) canisters.I swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> I would do a commercial for this soap. Bar soap gets you fake clean borax gets you real clean. Buy it now!</li>
    <li> Best hand soap ever.  Buy a parmesan cheese shaker to put this stuff in and use by your sink!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband who needed something to get tough grime, grass stains, etc. off his hands (and sometimes his feet).  He loves it, no more scrubbing just wash with this stuff.  Since it is a powder it seems to make a mess-or maybe that is the husband?</li>
    <li> Simply the best for dirty greasy hands.  It does not dry out skin like the liquid and gel hand cleaners.  Get a dispenser so you just have to put a hand under it and tap.</li>
