      <li>Works just as good as the name brand stuff, though I wish it were made in the USA, like Rogaine.</li>
      <li>This was a good value considering the price for Rogaine in stores.</li>
      <li>like a good value</li>
      <li>I ditched the liquid formula &amp; switched over to foam for good.</li>
      <li>Olive oil + sugar facials are good for exfoliation.  </li>

      <li>Good Product  </li>
      <li>This is as good as Rogaine.</li>
      <li>But this Kirkland works just as good</li>
      <li>it feels better on my scalp the price is great 2</li>
      <li>My husband had used it for years and is very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The more you know!</li>
      <li>Use this with Lipogaine Shampoo and the results are spectacular.</li>
      <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>So the liquid version seems to do more damage than good..  </li>
      <li>These are a nice affordable alternative to Rogaine brand.  </li>
      <li>Foam version acts as a nice moose to style your hair as well</li>
      <li>Applying it is very easy, and you can&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s even there when it dries.  </li>
      <li>helpful hints to make this product more effective...</li>
      <li>By far the best value for this type of product - haven&#x27;t noticed any difference from brand name product.</li>
      <li>I,ve used it with great success ,my wife says I have more hair where she grabs it</li>
      <li>At this point, knowing the time required post-Minox in order to stabilize, and the time required for Propecia to show results, I am expecting improvement in 4-6 months, but not before I lose a lot more hair from post-Minox shedding.  </li>
      <li>I think it uses more alcohol or something</li>
      <li>nothing more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the liquid.</li>
      <li>and I use more than the recommended dose.</li>
      <li>Also, a six- month supply is more convenient.</li>
      <li>They have been using it for more than 2 years and they plan to continue with it.</li>
      <li>most people do not know about Mino</li>
      <li>The price is more affordable as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Except for the brief alcohol smell when applied, this product is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Its okay.</li>
      <li>I now have more hair.</li>
      <li>Well, I can say it works because, while I am still have thinning hair, I have WAY more hair than my father did at this age.</li>
      <li>I wish I researched the product more</li>
      <li>At this point, knowing the time required post-Minox in order to stabilize, and the time required for Propecia to show results, I am expecting improvement in 4-6 months, but not before I lose a lot more hair from post-Minox shedding.  </li>
      <li>I use it twice a day as recommended, but all over the top of my head.  </li>
      <li>But if the testimonials are to be believed, your hair will eventually stabilize again in 6-12 months when the growth and resting phrases become more staggered and balanced</li>
      <li>By using this product, It has prevented me from loseing more hair.  </li>
      <li>I was able to cure that side effect by taking [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Also one more thing, I bought this at costco for 49.99 (6 month supply), but if you dont have a membership there, then this is your next best buy. :)</li>
      <li>The hair I have on top is healthier but not fuller.  </li>
      <li>But if the testimonials are to be believed, your hair will eventually stabilize again in 6-12 months when the growth and resting phrases become more staggered and balanced</li>
      <li>Like many guys who stop</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t be sure I&#x27;m noticing any regrowth results.  </li>
      <li>more below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
      <li>This foam is a million times better.  </li>
      <li>and i get another 90 days supply for about 5 dollars more than i pay at the store.</li>
      <li>I had more hair and it was thicker and fuller.  </li>
      <li>great seller, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Within 2 months I saw more hairs growing in on my temples and a thickening of hairs all over.  </li>
      <li>Item was as seller mentioned purchase price and shipping speed was satisfactory 100% Satisfied</li>
      <li>updated: March 2015, I have since been able to reintroduce this brand without a rash.  </li>
      <li>WAAAAYYYY better than the liquid.</li>
      <li>I love the foam.</li>
      <li>You get a lot more for the lower price.</li>
      <li>Okay, This stuff does work..  </li>
      <li>The solution is more liquid than foam.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s better than being bald.</li>
      <li>I started dropping a lot more hair</li>
      <li>I purchased a 6 month supply, and most often use it once a day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product was as advertised. Timely arrival.</li>
    <li> I started using it make ticker my beards. I hope it will work&lt;br /&gt;October 25th 2014 I start using it</li>
    <li> Much better than liquid. Easy coverage and no build up. Dries nicely, price is right compared to retail.&lt;br /&gt;Not looking for growth, just trying to keep what I have.</li>
    <li> not the same as rogaine, causes painful bumps on my head, no reflection on seller, but product is different from rogaine, may not affect you the way it affects me.we are all different.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, but everyone will probably have different results. Interesting fact, the active ingredient was initially developed as a vasodilator/antihypertensive. The more you know!</li>
    <li> I now have more hair.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any growth after 2 years of use....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if minoxidil works well for me but that&#x27;s a whole other topic.  These are a nice affordable alternative to Rogaine brand.  The best part about the foam for me is it doesn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol (like in minoxidil liquid forms)...which causes my head to turn in to a rash after a week or two of use.</li>
    <li> perfect.  Thanks for quick shipping</li>
    <li> I looked around and found this to be the best value. Easy to apply and odor free. If it works, great. If not, I&#x27;m not going to feel remorse about the money spent.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work. You can tell just from the fact that I no longer have to regularly clean the hair our of my shower drain. My hair got fuller and thicker during the first several months, after that it levels off. After a year I started using it just once a day and I have been maintaining pretty well.</li>
    <li> Shows good results in 4 months. I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Impressive results as compared to all the time consuming treatments that produced limited results and cost over 10 thousands dollars in 4 months.</li>
    <li> Losing your hair, but don&#x27;t want to lose a lot of cash? This product has you covered. I&#x27;ve been delaying the effects of male-pattern baldness for years, one jumbo 6-month supply at a time. You can&#x27;t beat the price, or the value of holding onto your youthful looks for a little longer.</li>
    <li> great seller, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s only been a month and haven&#x27;t notice any change yet</li>
    <li> I was using the same product (Minoxidil) but the one sold by CVS Pharmacy. This time I decided to change and bought this one from Kirland. I have to tell you that it works as promised and its cheaper than the other ones (Rogaine for example). Just for the record you will have to keep using it to get results because if you stop your hair will start falling again. GOOD LUCK!!!</li>
    <li> along w/proscar 1 mg daily and 2 applications daily of this item - hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in 20 years...satisfied and will continue using...also very easy to use, unlike the stupid dropper that made my scalp extremely itchy and inflamed.</li>
    <li> Fast prompt delivery, and it&#x27;s the same as Rogaine for a much better price. This is the only way I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I,ve used it with great success ,my wife says I have more hair where she grabs it and I,ve noticed a furry taste also!</li>
    <li> I wish I researched the product more but I&#x27;ve been on it for just a close to two months and I have seen my face starting to suffer. I&#x27;ve noticed an increase of wrinkles on my forehead and dark circle underneath my eyes. I did not change my diet or do anything different in the last two months so this has to be the culprit. This product may or may not work but I&#x27;m going to have stop immediately to prevent further damage. Not all people have the same side effects but it is a actual fact that Minoxidil inhibits collagen synthesis which effects skin elasticity.</li>
    <li> Works Great. Much cheaper than Rogaine or Walmart&#x27;s brand. Finishing my second container and the hair growth has thickened on my crown area. At this price, its worth buying to keep my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and a very good alternative to Rogaine. You get a lot more for the lower price. I like the foam because it drys up quickly and I am able to use it more often then the actual liquid because the liquid dropper kind takes much longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Rogaine for couple of years when a friend told me about this alternative. It seems that this product is either the same in quality or a little better because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Monixidil Kirkland brand for one year and it has either stopped by hair loss or has help grow back some hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> My grandsons have premature hair loss. It works fantastically for them!  They have been using it for more than 2 years and they plan to continue with it.</li>
    <li> I tried it for a while but the alcohol in it gave a burning feeling / headache and I didn&#x27;t like the dryness of my hair after it dried.&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought what is the point of committing to it for life in the hope of gaining a little extra hair.&lt;br /&gt;If I really decide to improve my hair I will just do a one time hair implantation. It is a lot less headache.</li>
    <li> Great product you don&#x27;t have to buy the brand name in this product and I would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 4 weeks but I have noticed my hair is falling out. I read a couple blogs online regarding hair loss and some say my hair will come back and some say it won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m going to continue using this in hopes it&#x27;s just one of those &#x27;gets worse before it gets better&#x27; situations. This was a good value considering the price for Rogaine in stores.</li>
    <li> I had only used this product for one week when I developed a rather severe rash on my ears. There was no rash or flakiness on my scalp, however, but both ears became red and swollen, and covered with tiny little bumps. The bumps feel like little blisters, but I am trying not to break any open, so am not sure if they are filled with liquid. I generally do not have sensitive skin, so this reaction was surprising. I won&#x27;t be using it any more… wasted money.</li>
    <li> It does not work and other users had warned me. My bad, I should have listen to others. Always buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Item was as seller mentioned purchase price and shipping speed was satisfactory 100% Satisfied and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i have less hair falling and scalp looks less great product would recommend! I simply follow steps twice a day, in the morning, leave on for 15 min to 30 min then apply gel and at night after shower leave on.</li>
    <li> I think I will need at least a month to give a factual review. So far I think it is working.</li>
    <li> This was purchased because of thinning hair for a family member.  It is the best price for this that I&#x27;ve found.  It seems to be doing the job as well.  I have ordered the 6 month supply several times.</li>
    <li> The product seems to me indistinguishable from the brand name, but a lot cheaper. The only problem is the dispenser; on 2 occasions the plastic broke when I removed the cap. I could still use it, but with slight difficulty.</li>
    <li> nothing more need b said. been using it for a month so far. try it!!  try it, try it, try it</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and had decent results, but after a while it was kind of difficult to obtain it because I&#x27;m out of the country, so I switched to Hervamatin, which I could get locally until I read about it on Amazon. This was shipped very fast by Monster Deals, and like the foam feature however, the cap which it&#x27;s use to measure the dose should have a mark on it to verify the right amount to be applied because it appears that the container  won&#x27;t last the full month as indicated.</li>
    <li> cheaper rogaine...i am all for that.  It is hard to find cheaper rogaine so when you do, you gotta act</li>
    <li> i have used it for about 2 weeks as instructed and i can see new hair growth already.  i highly recommend to people that try this first before you think about other procedures including NeoGraft.  i thought it was only for male pattern boldness but that is not the case at all.</li>
    <li> Once this product arrived and the box clearly said (what can&#x27;t be read in the ad/photos) that this is only for the top back of the head baldness.  My hairline is receding so I was hoping to address that.  Fine usually, I&#x27;d return it, but no this product is apparently a hazard to return, but not ship out?  That&#x27;s uncool.</li>
    <li> Started using Rogaine and switched to this brand after a couple of months.  This product seems to work the same as Rogaine and is much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Its cheap but it is not exactly a foam</li>
    <li> Wonderful! By-by Rogaine. Works just as well and as easily as Rogaine (exact same ingredient) at a much lower cost.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. Just like the more expensive formulations without the added cost for a brand name.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t worked. Tried it for a year, no results at all and when my package came, it was expiring in 2 months and I ordered a 6 month supply.</li>
    <li> This stuff works as well as Rogaine Foam at half the price. Use this with Lipogaine Shampoo and the results are spectacular. Stopped Propecia one year ago due to side effects. Started the minoxidil and ketoconazole treatment immediately and my hair is virtually unchanged. I&#x27;d recommend this stuff to anyone. If you are as afraid of hair loss as I was, remember if these treatments don&#x27;t work for you, look into getting a hair piece. They have come a long way and look as natural as anyone else&#x27;s hair. But, if you currently have hair and want to keep it as long as possible use this and the shampoo i mentioned. It works. I can&#x27;t say for sure how well it will work if you have little to no hair but for me it has. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Very good for growth hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four months now.  My wife tells me there&#x27;s more hair on the back of my head (I can&#x27;t really comment on that, obviously), and I&#x27;ve noticed that my receding hairline looks thicker.  I&#x27;ve decided to give this product a full year, then judge for myself at that time whether the gain is worth the cost as well as the ritualistic routine required to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s because of the routine that I don&#x27;t feel I can give it five stars--but I understand the need for the schedule:  It&#x27;s no different than any other medication in regard to dose/response.  Minoxidil is the active ingredient of this foam, and just like the active ingredients of, say, thyroid pills, needs to be taken in regular intervals at a regular dosage in order to work.  It needs to be applied to a clean, dry scalp twice a day.  Every day.  So if you&#x27;re the type who does not take daily showers, forget it.  In my case, I needed to move my bathing schedule up a notch to twice a day; a full-bore shower in the morning, and a light washoff with hair washing in the evening.  Every day.  This is not a product that works if you apply it once... go on a three-day camping trip... and apply it when you come back.  You&#x27;re committed to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that once the new hair is established, missing a dose or two won&#x27;t hurt.  Since I&#x27;m not there yet, I have to reserve any comment in that regard.  A four-day Yellowstone vacation is likely out of the question unless we stay in one of the lodges until that point.  I also understand that all regained hair is lost again if the product is stopped (the new hair supposedly falls out within a few months), so it looks like I&#x27;m a two-shower-a-day type of guy for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I do feel it works.  And why not, since it&#x27;s established medical science that this medication causes hair growth (it&#x27;s actually a side effect; Google &amp;#34;Minoxidil&amp;#34; and read about its original intended usage) in certain groups of people.  But it involves commitment, and you&#x27;ll likely find yourself restructuring parts of your life to continue using it.  If your hair loss only kinda-sorta bothers you, perhaps you won&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s worth it.  In such a case, there is a prescription medication you can talk to your doctor about which may work better for you--and who knows?  Your insurance might cover it.  For me, it&#x27;s the foam.  Twice a day.  For life.le.  But it involves commitment, and you&#x27;ll likely find yourself restructuring parts of your life to continue using it.

    <li> It is really too soon to tell how this compares to Rogaine. I will say that based on my early usage, I find that it is not as thick as&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine foam and has a bit of a chemical odor.  However, if it works as well as Rogaine and if it&#x27;s not irritating, I&#x27;ll consider it to be a good product.  The price is great.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I am so sad, because i would love to keep my hair, but nothing helps.</li>
    <li> Over the last 5 or so years, I have lost a substantial amount of hair. I tried womens rogaine and equate alternative and another brand that was taken off the market but didnt see much for results. At best I stopped losing hair, but the bald spots were still embarrassing. I always noticed people glancing at the top of my head. beh. My dermatologist couldnt find an issue and it got to the point where she implied I would just have to deal. She recommended I try men&#x27;s variety, which I had, but I had seen some females note the extra strength worked. I purchased a 6 month supply, and most often use it once a day. I started dropping a lot more hair and I was so nervous. I read this could happen and DONT STOP. I kept with it and then I noticed my scalp starting to itch a little and had some pimple like bumps on my scalp. I read that could be new hair growth. I started taking this about 6 months ago and about 50% of my bald spots are filled in with hair. I have taken pictures as I have went along so I could monitor growth and it is substantial. I like the foam because it doesnt run down my scalp like the drops do. Having longer hair, it is easier for me to get a consistent application and it doesnt irritate my scalp like some of the others I have tried. 5% has not been tested on women from what I understand, but mine was bad enough that I was willing to take the risk and it has definitely shown results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it seems to work like as good as they say.  What I have been told is that for women it will not grow hair back but it will stop it from falling out any longer but the down side is that once you stop using it your hair will start to fall out.  I have found since I&#x27;ve used it my hair seems to be thicker and does not fall out anymore other than what occurs normally.</li>
    <li> This stuff works if used regularly! I do get a bit of irritation, but it&#x27;s a small trade-off to not have a bald spot.</li>
    <li> love this stuff and recommend it all the time… nice to have a supply on hand because it doesn&#x27;t last me 6 months… maybe 4… still very worth it cuz it has helped the temple area of my hair noticeably… when i stopped using it i notice that my temples thinned out again… but started it again and within a few weeks the hair was back.. yay!!  I prefer the foam over the dropper as the foam is like a mousse product and actually gives my hair body whereas the liquid didn&#x27;t…</li>
    <li> Second order I guess it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> It leaves a very heavy residue on hair.  It says to use on only  but there is no way to avoid getting on the hair. I tried to return it after one use and was advised that it is hazardous waste and can not be returned. They should state that on the description before someone throws $60 down the drain.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than rogaine. Works like Rogaine. Could be cheaper than what&#x27;s listed. Hair growth is present, but the new hair is fine and almost &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; like. I guess it&#x27;s better than being bald.</li>
    <li> This is effective and cheap but it burns like a motha and smells strongly of alcohol. I get such bad flakiness, unlike the real rogaine I used originally, that I am not going to be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> got described in advertising</li>
    <li> I really like the unscented alcohol based, as it does not leave much residue in my hair other than the Minoxidil itself. I have been using it for six months and it appears to be working. I was not expecting a dramatic change in hair growth, and I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the foam is unlike that of Rogaine foam. The solution is more liquid than foam. Also, you have to press hard on the applicator to release the solution. Can&#x27;t say whether this product works as well as Rogaine, as I have switched back to the Rogaine Foam. I rather stick with what I know.</li>
    <li> I started growing hair in little as three months. The product does make your hair kinda sticky but after it dries it&#x27;s not a problem. Just wait a minute and dry with a hair dryer. The only minor issue I had with the product is that when you first use it, it&#x27;s more foam than the liquid that the foam turns into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t complain, I grew a lot of hair in as little as three months and I can thank Kirkland Minoxidil for the results.</li>
    <li> Okay, This stuff does work..  Im giving it 4 stars because anything that requires daily use sucks, but, you gotta do what you gotta do...I prefer this minoxidil over the liquid brand because it does not contain propylene glycol...  Propylene Glycol makes my scalp itch, alot..  So the liquid version seems to do more damage than good..  Some people complain about the foams inability to make contact with the scalp, I have a little trick for you guys..  Fill up a cup of hot water, fill the minoxidil cap halfway with the foam, submerse the cap in the water, not to the point where water fills the cap..  After about 20 seconds the foam will liquify, then use a medicine dropper to apply the minoxidil directly to the scalp...  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the reason why this product does not work for some people..  Minoxidil is not a hair loss product, it is a hair growth product! It&#x27;s actual mechanism of action is to &amp;#34;open channels&amp;#34; in the scalp allowing more blood and oxygen to the follicle...  Thats all it does..  If you have a terrible diet and live a terrible life, this product will send &amp;#34;terrible&amp;#34; blood to your scalp.. Making your hairloss worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, before you decide to use any type of minoxidil you should take a good hard look at you diet and lifestyle..  Excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, fast food and a sedentary lifestyle will typically make this product ineffective..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some helpful hints to make this product more effective...&lt;br /&gt;limit alcohol consumption to once a week..&lt;br /&gt;smoke cigarettes only when you drink..&lt;br /&gt;adopt a paleo diet..&lt;br /&gt;take a zinc supplement, 50 mg a day works for me..&lt;br /&gt;use a ketoconazole shampoo a few times a week..&lt;br /&gt;a multivitamin will help, just don&#x27;t overdo it..  Less is more when it comes to multivitamins..&lt;br /&gt;get some exercise, it will help cleanse your body of all the crap..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you fix the &amp;#34;inside&amp;#34; you can fix the &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34;..  Hope this info helps.. Good luck!lps.. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Could not get this childproof cap off 4 out of 6 of the containers and need to use the cap to measure the foam.  Complained to the seller and have never gotten any reply. He should have offered to replace the four with product thaty had caps that come off. Had to use a hammer which wreaked the tops.</li>
    <li> Same as Rogain, but you get it for less!</li>
    <li> good value, I believe it works just as well as the more expensive name brand</li>
    <li> Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;This product is very effective at regrowing hair.  Give it 2 months for some results.  The results will continue to come in the longer you use it.  Beware skin side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first usage:&lt;br /&gt;Twice a day for 6 months.  I applied it to the entire top of my head (I am thinning on the entire top).  Within 2 months I saw more hairs growing in on my temples and a thickening of hairs all over.  After 6 months I had great results.  I had more hair and it was thicker and fuller.  But the skin on my face was getting dry with fine lines so I stopped.  I lost my gains within 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second usage:&lt;br /&gt;The gains were so impressive the first time that I decided to give it another try, but this time only using one application per day to try to offset the facial skin side effects.  My personal experience is that one application per day is equally as effective as two.  I am 4 months in and I am seeing the same gains I did during my first usage after 4 months.  The facial skin dryness and fine lines are still a problem but I am managing it (more below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin problems:&lt;br /&gt;I personally have observed fine lines, skin thinning, and dryness on my face from using this product.  If you search Google you will find other reports like this with Rogaine and Minoxidil (same as Rogaine).  Basically it ages your face.  This is a side effect to seriously consider.  More hair will make you look younger, but at the same time it ages your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been managing the skin problems by decreasing my dose to one application a day, and doing things to encourage exfoliation and skin healing.  Olive oil + sugar facials are good for exfoliation.  Don&#x27;t over-moisturize or the skin will never heal.  I suggest washing your face at night and not applying any moisturizer until the morning.  Let it be tight and dry.  It will cause healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less is more:&lt;br /&gt;For me I get the same results with one application a day versus two applications a day.  Given the side effects, the saying definitely applies... less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use latex gloves:&lt;br /&gt;I use gloves when applying minoxidil to my scalp.  Otherwise the minoxidil dries out my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use hair color:&lt;br /&gt;Minoxidil will cause lots of baby hairs to grow in.  Call it peach fuzz.  It will eventually get thicker and longer.  But while you are waiting you can apply hair coloring to get the visual benefit of new hair before it fully matures.  I use &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; hair color kits from Walgreens.  It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update regarding my second usage:&lt;br /&gt;Per my above review, I had started using Minox a second time but only once per day instead of twice.  I am updating this review to report that I have stopped again.  I was able to maintain my Minox usage for about 10 months this time but the side effects were still there and eventually got bad enough to where I had to stop, just like the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final verdict on Minox:&lt;br /&gt;As some one who has tried it twice, my conclusion is that it&#x27;s not worth it.  It definitely regrows hair but the side effects are really bad.  Granted, some guys can use this stuff for years and have no problems.  Your results may vary, but for me and lots of other guys who have problems with the side effects I would advise against it.  Basically, what&#x27;s the point if you can&#x27;t keep using it long term and all of your gains are lost when you stop?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side effects are kind of weird to describe.  Basically it messes up my body fluid balance.  My ankles are constantly swollen and my skin gets dry and thin.  My face gets gaunt, dark circles under eyes, and periodic pain in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about getting off of Minox:&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time getting off of Minox.  Both times I experienced bad shedding 1-2 months after stopping.  You can search around and find lots of people who talk about this post-Minox shedding.  Like many guys who stop, my experience was that my hair was much worse after stopping than it was before I started.  You will find lots of theories and explanations as to why this is.  My own theory based on reading is that because Minox stimulates your hair into the growth phase (anagen), it means that when you get off it suddenly all of those hairs go into the resting phrase (telogen) at the same time.  So the result is that your hair looks much worse because all of the follicles are resting at the same time after stopping Minox.  But if the testimonials are to be believed, your hair will eventually stabilize again in 6-12 months when the growth and resting phrases become more staggered and balanced again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using Minox again.  Twice was enough to convince me that the side effects aren&#x27;t worth it.  It has been 1 month since I stopped Minox for a second time.  I am starting to see shedding again and I fully expect it to get progressively worse in the next 1-2 months.  However, in anticipation of stopping Minox, I started taking Propecia 4 months ago.  I gradually transitioned between the two, but nothing can stop the post-Minox shed.  But I have read several testimonials from people in my position who claim that when the shed is over and things stabilize again the hair will grow back much better because I have been taking Propecia.  At this point, knowing the time required post-Minox in order to stabilize, and the time required for Propecia to show results, I am expecting improvement in 4-6 months, but not before I lose a lot more hair from post-Minox shedding.  I will update this review in 6 months to let you know how my transition is going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and note that I am taking 0.25mg of Propecia on M-W-F only.  You can go online and read a lot about alternative dosing for Propecia.  My dosing decision was based in part on testimonials which confirm that low dosing works for many guys, and also as an attempt avoid possible side effects of Propecia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propecia update (after 2.5 years on propecia, and off minox for 2 years):&lt;br /&gt;I have stayed with my 0.25mg of Propecia on a M-W-F schedule since getting off of minoxidil.  My hair is stabilized but is overall thinner than before minoxidil.  The hair I have on top is healthier but not fuller.  No more clumpy follicles causing itching and coming out at the root.  I still shed a bit in the shower but it&#x27;s all shaft, no follicle (ie normal shedding which grows back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience tender and puffy nipples for a short time which is a known side effect of Propecia.  I was able to cure that side effect by taking [[ASIN:B00014IGXS Nature&#x27;s Way DIM-plus - Estrogen Metabolism Formula -- 120 Capsules]] (8 per day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect I will stay on Propecia for the rest of my life in order to maintain what I have.  I might consider a hair transplant eventually to make my hair fuller.  Ideally you want to be on Propecia before getting a transplant, otherwise DHT can attack the transplanted hair just like your regular hair.  If I ever decide to stop Propecia then I will be sure to very slowly taper off to try to avoid the hormonal crash that some men experience when quitting the drug.ce was that my hair was much worse after stopping than it was before I started.

    <li> Same as Rogaine for a fraction of the cost. Thanks Kirkland!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. As effective as the more expensive Rogaine. Absorbs in quick especially after a shower when my hair is wet. I wear my hair a bit longer so next order I may try the old school liquid with pipet to get it to my scalp better and less on my hair. For the price, and the same active ingredient, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would waste money on the brand name Rogaine.</li>
    <li> Definitely helping maintain volume. Foam version acts as a nice moose to style your hair as well</li>
    <li> So far I am very satisfied with at least the process of using foam twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this one month (have had some light shedding) but the product itself as a styling product I guess I would say, is quite a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin (fine) hair and this adds a light hold that is all but undetectable to the feel of my hair. This is actually better as a light hold on my hair than products I have purchased for that purpose. For ease of use, this is already a win. I avoided it in the past  because I honestly though it would be a pain to deal with. It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hair re-growth that will remain to be seen with one odd exception...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 15-18 or so years ago my eyebrows of all things became thin to non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case I have also applied this in the same frequency as it suggests for hair loss to my eyebrows (not the suggested use) and one month or not, they are definitely growing. Starting at the center as the most impact and working their way out, I have definite hair replacement going on. Not sure how far it will go, but I am getting  hair all along the brow, just the most at the center.</li>
    <li> Fair price, 6 month supply. I&#x27;m good to go. First time i&#x27;ve noticed it working... (Using with other products)</li>
    <li> This version of Rogaine is virtually identical to the name brand except for the carrier used.  You will notice no difference in performance.  The price is more affordable as well.</li>
    <li> I had a side effect of experiencing heart palpetations upon the first use of this product. Stopped use and washed head 9mmediatelyu. Side effect continued for six hours. Tried to return product and I was told the product is considered &#x27;HAZERDAS MATERIAL&amp;#34; and Amazon/supplier would not accept a return.</li>
    <li> Unclear how this product worked and non refundable.</li>
    <li> Overwhelming horrible chemical smell.  I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazon offered the best price for the product.  My husband had used it for years and is very pleased with the results. Also, a six- month supply is more convenient. Usually it&#x27;s only available in 1, 2 or 3 month packs.</li>
    <li> I ditched the liquid formula &amp; switched over to foam for good. It&#x27;s so much better than the liquid. The foam does NOT leave a sticky residue on my hair like the liquid does, and it dries much quicker too.  However, there&#x27;s a tendency to over-dispense the product, since there&#x27;s no exact measurement like the liquid dripper.</li>
    <li> Great product and works just like rogaine. The price seems high comparitvely to the liquid solution, but its much easier tto manage and apply, which is why i keep purchasing the foam.</li>
    <li> I am a woman but use the 5% because it is far more effective.  Love the foam - t/he liquid made my hair very greasy.  This wonderful and it works.</li>
    <li> I love the foam. WAAAAYYYY better than the liquid. My hair really has thickend, no joke. It&#x27;s great stuff, I do know where you can buy it cheaper though, but I&#x27;m not going to say on Amazon (if you think about it you can figure it out). You have thin hair, buy this, use 6 months to a year, you will notice the difference - I did, so Im going to continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogain for several years and then they made the foam, I love the foam product buy man is so expensive for a 90 day supply at the store. But this Kirkland works just as good and i get another 90 days supply for about 5 dollars more than i pay at the store. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of foam for about a month, may be less.  My application waivered a bit after week 2 because I was temporarily displaced by Hurricane Sandy, but have resumed normally with it again.  I stopped using regular 5% minoxidil topical solution about 6 years ago or so; it left my hair feeling greasy and really irritated my scalp, so I was using it only 1x a day anyway.  This foam is a million times better.  Applying it is very easy, and you can&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s even there when it dries.  Also, it does not irritate my scalp in the least.  However, given that I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve seen any noticeable results.  I&#x27;m 44; my hairline is receded at the temples and thin on the crown, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m past the point of no return or not.  I&#x27;ve been using this along with Nizoral 2%; I&#x27;m hoping to see something more noticeable in the next month or two.</li>
    <li> I need is the liquid version for a couple of years. This one is much easier to apply and see to have a much better coverage as well. In addition, the liquid version has an alcohol burn to it and leaves a greasy feeling to my hair. My wife says she can tell when I stop using it for a period of time,so I guess that means it works!</li>
    <li> Good Product  I would recommend this product to men that are losing hair.  By using this product, It has prevented me from loseing more hair.  I don think that any new hair is growing but is is certainly keeping me from going bald in which I am happy about.</li>
    <li> Minoxidil is absolutely not worth the false hope and torture. Once you realize what a nightmare it is to put it on even nightly, let alone apply it twice daily as recommended (and wear it out in public with a greasy looking patch on your scalp), you&#x27;ll then learn that stopping application will cause you to lose even more ground than when you began (there is a serious &amp;#34;initial shed&amp;#34; when you start use). Please google &amp;#34;stopping minoxidil&amp;#34; before considering using a minoxidil product. I experienced absolutely no gain (noticeably lost ground) from over 6 months of use and threw the rest of this garbage in the trash and just buzzed my hair short.</li>
    <li> it feels better on my scalp the price is great 2 glad there finally making a generic  buy this it works</li>
    <li> Well, I can say it works because, while I am still have thinning hair, I have WAY more hair than my father did at this age. No Caeser look for me!</li>
    <li> Seems to work better for keeping the hair I have rather growing new hair.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this works...</li>
    <li> Its okay. Nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> About twice as expensive as the generic liquid minoxidil, however it appears to be easier on my scalp. Though I was going to have to start using nizoral shampoo for a while.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the name brand stuff, though I wish it were made in the USA, like Rogaine. This is made in Israel.</li>
    <li> The Best thing. My hair was falling out rapidly due to my discontinuing my generic finisteride . And then I was reading about hair loss, came across this generic minoxidil on Amazon. Bought this on 11/23/2013 (last year)  It was amazing, my hair started getting thicker, and yes the receding front hairline was getting less noticeable, growing back.  Today my hair looks like it did when I was 40 yrs old, much thicker, definitely a miracle in progress. (In LESS than 3 months time!!!)&lt;br /&gt; It is like a hair mousse (the minoxidil foam)  You shake the can, spray in to fill in plastic cover 1/2 full of foam, then run it through your hair in thinning areas, but I used it all over scalp, then only use a small soft comb to comb it all back then side to side, then back to front, finally styling hair as I like it.  I would be happy to post a pic but then you would know who I am (just kidding)&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this item is the Best Thing I have Ordered from Amazon in over a yr and a half.  I really think you should try it if you are starting to go bald.&lt;br /&gt;One impt. note: I did seem to notice the bags/dark circles under my eyes but then I am in my early sixties so a full head of hair is a blessing to me. I am not sure if the dark circles were there before, my pharmacist said he has never heard of this side effect but who knows. Give it a shot!!!!&lt;br /&gt;By the way this is sold in super Walmart stores (a different generic brand, but considerably less expensive,) I have not tried Walmart&#x27;s equivalent of this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m waiting for results</li>
    <li> Evidently I am not one of the &amp;#34;80%&amp;#34; that has decent results.</li>
    <li> Best Price I have seen!!</li>
    <li> easier to administer that a liquid formulation&lt;br /&gt;not sure of results yet, too early to tell, just started using it&lt;br /&gt;seems like a good value</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I can&#x27;t be sure I&#x27;m noticing any regrowth results.  I&#x27;m using this in hopes to revive my front of my head and hair line that has receded and thinned a good amount in the last 5 or so years.  I *think* the thinned area looks thicker now but it may just be placebo, no one else has mentioned noticing any difference.  Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using twice a day as specified on the can and it is really easy to apply especially with my hair being short.  I place the nozzle directly to my scalp in the spots I wish to apply and squeeze out about a nickle sized amount in the areas.  I ordered a 6 month supply and I will continue to use it for at least the 6 months (it was relatively cheap, ~$50, well worth the try).  It seems to have no negative effects and takes less than a minute to apply.  If it works for anyone, which it appears to have based on what I&#x27;ve read, it is a good product.  Even if it does not work for me I will not degrade my 4 star rating unless something bad comes of it, which I am doubtful.  I am still hopeful of seeing positive results in the future, in which case the 4 star will become 5.  I will update this review later as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/22/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware... After 5 months of foam use with no clear results I decided to switch to liquid minoxidil which I believe may have been working better because I actually noticed some side effects and shedding which I read was to be expected when the formula was working. I never experienced any good or bad effects in my 5 month use of the foam.  Anyhow, I&#x27;m not exactly sure when I first noticed but I have been having large dark circles around my eyes for awhile now and I&#x27;ve had people comment about them saying I looked very tired.  At first I thought perhaps it was just due to lack of sleep and never thought it could have been brought on by minoxidil but after some time I realized the circles were very persistent (every time I looked in the mirror)...Then I came across A LOT of people complaining about the same issue and now I am certain the bags are caused by minoxidil.  I&#x27;ve discontinued my use for the about a month and a half now and the dark circles still persist and I&#x27;m not even sure if they have faded at all.  In my opinion I would much rather have thin hair or even be totally bald for that matter than have these zombie like circles under my eyes and I am praying they go away sooner than later.  I will never try it again and based on my experience I would not suggest any minoxidil products to anyone.hen I came across A LOT of people complaining about the same issue and now I am certain the bags are caused by minoxidil.

    <li> I love the fact that with this product, the \\&quot; sticky effect\\&quot; of regular minoxydil is a thing of the past. It&#x27;s easy to style your hair with it when it&#x27;s been massaged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for the brief alcohol smell when applied, this product is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Item is as described - Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> I used it as directed.  by the third day I became very dizzy and sick.  I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> If you are reading this - you are probably losing hair - may not be a lot, but a little and you want to get it back - even if it is a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for over 2 years now and I can vouch for the fact that it really works - on both skull cap (rear) as well on the front (forehead line)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes Kirkland MInoxidil unique ?&lt;br /&gt;  (1) Foam is so much easier to apply, spread - unlike a liquid or a spray, you can control where you want it and how you want to spread it&lt;br /&gt;  (2) 2 years of expiration - it is a 6 months supply, but I use it for more than an year since I use it on alternate days&lt;br /&gt;  (3) IT WORKS - You will start noticing a difference within 1 month of applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What most people do not know about Mino is that it works on your front hair line as well as your rear skull cap.</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Product really works if you use it before you become bald.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousin.  He needs this.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have tried the solution as well but i found that to be too greasy. The foam is a lot less greasy and easier to apply for sure. It also dries a lot quicker. Just after a few weeks I have noticed an improvement in the thickness of hair.</li>
    <li> Been 2 months and no results yet.</li>
    <li> updated: March 2015, I have since been able to reintroduce this brand without a rash.  The quality of the product released from the bottle is not the same as the brand name, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Kirkland version to save money over brand name Rogaine.  I have tried both the foam and liquid generic versions.  Compared with the brand name Rogaine, both of these generic preparation caused a rash and crusting that I did not experience with the brand name Rogaine.  The rash went away with discontinuation of the medication, restarted with re-challenge of the medication, and has not returned since stopping the medication completely and resuming brand name Rogaine.  I have mild to moderately sensitive skin so it is possible that this rash would not necessarily be experienced by those with &amp;#34;thicker skin&amp;#34;!  As always, Amazon was very excellent about refunding the costs of these non-returnable  but non-usable item.  I have used the return funds to resume the more expensive brand name Rogaine.  It was a nice attempt to save money but didn&#x27;t work out dermatologically for me, your own individual experience may vary.</li>
    <li> I placed the order and they ended up sending me, facila cleansing product. I brought this to their attention, it was replaced, but I received my correct product 30 days after the initial order. I got an apology, but nothing else.</li>
    <li> I started using minoxidil foam for the first time in late August.  Two months later, the regrowth is clearly visible.  I use it twice a day as recommended, but all over the top of my head.  So I end up using double the recommended amount.  I apply it when my hair is damp and massage it in for a few minutes until the foam has fully liquefied.  At this point, I start a 25 minute timer.  I then carefully comb my hair without letting the comb touch my scalp.  Doing this prevents my hair from sticking up later.  When the 25 minutes is up, my hair is starting to set and I then comb it fully.  It looks very natural and full.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years hair growth starts as light fuzz but eventually comes in heavier. So I guess the answer is yes works great for me. I&#x27;m 67 and have a full head of hair that I didn&#x27;t have at 57.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and the Kirkland brand really aggravates it - the romaine brand does not. I think it uses more alcohol or something but it&#x27;s like night and day compared to how my skin reacts.</li>
    <li> GDMF! This stuff makes my scalp burn, i have all this scalp acne now, my forehead looks like the back of a Nestle Crunch bar. If I could return this stuff I would, but Amazon won&#x27;t let me ship it because its an aerosol can, but how did they ship it to me in the first place? I really want my money back, more importantly I want to be able to sleep without scratching my scalp and seeing pieces of skin fall off. Stay away from this stuff.</li>
    <li> Well the main problem was that I experienced non stop dread shed for the entire cycle (3+ months) most positive reviews I read stated that the shed lasted for a few weeks while old weak hairs fell out, this was further confirmed by some quick research. I discontinued the use because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any slowing of the shed and no new growth or thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore the product left a horribly thick residue in my hair that resembled the old hair gel everyone used in the 90s.</li>
    <li> awesome product and seller</li>
    <li> This is working great after 4 months, I didn&#x27;t take before and after photos but I could clearly see the difference after just 3 months of use. Will be re-purchasing soon, as this is a life-long treatment. If you stop using it, it stops working.</li>
    <li> Was kinda greasy. I recommend either taking the pill form to battle hair loss, or just embrace it like I did. Now I keep my head shaved. I think it looks decent.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually use this.  After I realized you have to continue to use the product forever; I decided to just stay bald.</li>
    <li> Hair today gone tomorrow</li>
    <li> I\\&quot;ve been using this product for about 5 months now, (on my last bottle) and I have seen hair to sprout on the front of my head and in the temple region, (where I\\&quot;ve been noticing thinning the most). I\\&quot;m 24 years old, so if you still have a little hair in that region, it will most likely grow back! My hair is noticeably thicker! Be patient, and keep the 2 a day routine, you&#x27;ll thank yourself! (morning and night) I apply this product when my hair is damp; I feel as if it spreads easier that way and I use more than the recommended dose. (The recommended dose isn&#x27;t enough especially if your hair is long on top. I\\&quot;m not to fond of the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; either, yes its supposedly odorless, however it still has a slight aerosol smell, but it goes away when it dries up (no biggy). Also one more thing, I bought this at costco for 49.99 (6 month supply), but if you dont have a membership there, then this is your next best buy. :)</li>
    <li> This is as good as Rogaine. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25, and for a couple of years, have been experiencing hair loss in my hairline. After a while of being mad and sad about it, I figured screw it and accepted it. While I&#x27;m still accepting of the hair loss, I&#x27;ve regained a little bit of hope. On a whim, my mom got me this stuff about last November and I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. I apply it every morning and at night when I go to bed. I can say I&#x27;m definitely seeing some hair growing back in my hair line. The instructions say it takes about four months so see results and it&#x27;s true, if you stick with it. I only use enough to cover the areas that are balding so the bottles last me a little longer. Anymore than that seems to leave a lot of residue on the hair. The ONLY side effect (and it may not even be a side effect of the product but I thought it was ironic that someone else mentioned a similar thing that happened to them) is that for some reason, my ears got extremely hot, itchy, and dry for a couple of days. And I tried EVERYTHING to make it stop. The only thing that kind of helped was a hand cream for extremely dry hands I found at Home Depot. I&#x27;m not sure if it was because of the foam, but even if it was, to me, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for regaining some hair and confidence.</li>
    <li> By far the best value for this type of product - haven&#x27;t noticed any difference from brand name product.</li>
    <li> my son loves this product!</li>
    <li> might not be the product&#x27;s fault, but I am still going bald just as quickly, don&#x27;t expect miracles if your genes are like mine</li>
    <li> Way cheaper the Rogaine. If you are still buying Rogaine then you are wasting your money. This stuff is the same stuff just 3 times cheaper.</li>
    <li> Minoxidil does add a new hair growth to the crown of my head.  It takes between three and four months to see the first new hair.  I have used it for about four years.</li>
    <li> I had a hair transplant at the front of my scalp having lost it through male pattern baldness. I had a transplant of 2239 grafts. After three months there was no sign of hair regrowth. Then, I started using the foam Minoxidil and in two weeks I saw new hair growth where all the transplants were grafted. I probably would have seen hair regrowth, but it appears using this medication accelerated the process.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat it for the price. Much cheaper than rogain and works just as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for an excellent price. It&#x27;s about time they made a non greasy minoxidil in an easy to apply foam.</li>
