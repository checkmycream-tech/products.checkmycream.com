      <li>However those are the only good things I have found.</li>
      <li>This straightener is good for layered or short hair.  </li>
      <li>Good flat iron</li>
      <li>I will say that I love the iron plates in that they stay smooth and don&#x27;t chip, but the plates don&#x27;t meet completely, which impedes the straightening process.</li>
      <li>Take this for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>

      <li>It gets super hot and straightens even at the roots.</li>
      <li>The teeth really help make getting your hair straight easy.</li>

      <li>The words printed on the side came off the first day.</li>
      <li>and then I have to take several passes with the iron before I achieve satisfying results.</li>

      <li>My friend has thick, curly, frizzy hair and it works amazing for her!</li>
      <li>but didnt really work for my hair.</li>

      <li>and I need the high heat .</li>
      <li>but this is not a salon worthy flat iron.</li>
      <li>It gets hot enough and does the job</li>
      <li>Have looked for this type of iron for several years (as my former favorite was a Futura Flat Iron that is no longer in production.)</li>
      <li>This iron makes gives you an extremely professional finishing result.</li>
      <li>I have used the Babyliss Titanium Pro previously, and I like the other straightener better.  </li>
      <li>Anyway so I bought this because my hair was super short and my other straightener was to broad to get the job done.</li>
      <li>As a Stylist, I need a flat iron that I can depend on, that will do its job.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly</li>

      <li>I was skeptical that anything could straighten her hair - the Babyliss did and it looks amazing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this product for about a month. I tried to give it some time to rule out user error. I&#x27;m a half-full person but I have to share my experience. I thought I was getting a good value based on the reviews and the before and after price. I have thick, coarse Polynesian hair. I consider myself to be an expert (not professional) flat iron user--have used it for years and have gone thru several irons. I&#x27;ve had to work extremely hard with this iron. I have to blow dry my hair first to calm the waves and then I have to take several passes with the iron before I achieve satisfying results. I&#x27;ve never had to do that with any other iron. I also can only iron out small patches at a time. I will say that I love the iron plates in that they stay smooth and don&#x27;t chip, but the plates don&#x27;t meet completely, which impedes the straightening process. I&#x27;m going to begrudgingly make the best of this because I can&#x27;t afford the waste. Take this for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I bought the half inch recently and thought maybe it was me. All of the first reviewers comments were true for me as well. You don&#x27;t buy a half inch flat iron for my thick long hair but beyond that the plates don&#x27;t clamp properly on the hair. The iron didn&#x27;t seem to be heating up well either. I tried to press the plates together no luck. I have tried so many flat irons and this was easily the worst. I bought mine at Marshalls so I wonder if maybe it was defective or just a really poor product.</li>
    <li> One of my friends let me use this straightener and I fell in love with it! I have long, thick hair and it straigtened it after two times of going over that section of hair. My friend has thick, curly, frizzy hair and it works amazing for her! Its the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m deffinitly going to get one of my own! :)</li>
    <li> I was wrong.  It didn&#x27;t worth that great, in fact I went back to my old flatiron without the comb.  I really should have&lt;br /&gt;sent it back but I forgot about it.</li>
    <li> This is the second straightening iron I have got from Babyliss . I love both , I ordered this one because of the comb . My hair is wavy ,short , course &amp; thick and I need the high heat . I love love love it .</li>
    <li> This iron has a dial temperature control, which I like. it also has a good temperature range. However those are the only good things I have found. the plates are too slippery and the iron has no grip on hair. This makes it particularly difficult with my thick, coarse, curly hair. I have a recently acquired 1\\&quot; long burn on my forehead from this iron and the difficulty controlling it in the hair. this degree of burn is definitely a first for me with irons.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick, corse and curly hair.  I was skeptical that anything could straighten her hair - the Babyliss did and it looks amazing. I believe the teeth are key since we have tried various flat irons and none worked.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this flat iron on my hair.  It came out so nice that I decided to buy one for myself.  It makes your hair shine, which is an added bonus.  It is not real large so it is easy to pack for travel.  A great product.</li>
    <li> The comb is the secret to this iron&#x27;s success.  Love it!  Have looked for this type of iron for several years (as my former favorite was a Futura Flat Iron that is no longer in production.)</li>
    <li> heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t fry hair.  Glides smoothly over hair, even with the comb.  You can adjust the heat settings too.  I absolutely love this</li>
    <li> Flat iron is somewhat cheaply made. The words printed on the side came off the first day. It gets hot enough and does the job but this is not a salon worthy flat iron.</li>
    <li> I got this hair straightener because like always Hairdressers do a little number on your hair because they don&#x27;t listen to what you actually want done. Anyway so I bought this because my hair was super short and my other straightener was to broad to get the job done. This straightener is really awesome. I can recommend it for short and long hair. It gets super hot and straightens even at the roots. love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have long thick hair and this iron straightens out our hair like nothing I have ever seen. It is light weight, get hot really fast and does the best job on our hair I have ever seen. I have spend hundreds of dollars on flat irons that claim they work excellent but this item is the real deal.  I recommended this iron to all my friends and family members because we all have long hair and we like to do our own hair.  This iron makes gives you an extremely professional finishing result.</li>
    <li> It is cheap made with the teeth on it which pulls your hair...I expected mor out of this Pro product....</li>
    <li> I love this because it has teeth on one side. It made my curly hair poker straight. The teeth really help make getting your hair straight easy.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron but didnt really work for my hair. I have thick really curly hair and this iron really didnt live up to its hype. The plates are very slippery so it doesn&#x27;t grip your hair the way it should, also the comb attachment is almost impossible to get on.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after my chi started to go out on me. I had my chi for about 5 years &amp; absolutaely loved it. I&#x27;ve had this one for about a month now &amp; love it! It heats up quick, leaves my hair soft, silky &amp; shiny! I have med-thick hair &amp; it does the job. I&#x27;ve curled my hair a few times with this &amp; the curls come out so much better than a curling iron. Its lightweight &amp; I love the carrying case. The only drawback is the words started coming off from the lock/unlock button. I don&#x27;t use that feature anyway but still a drawback. I didn&#x27;t care for the comb feature either. It left my hair frizzy. Good thing it was removeable! I&#x27;d definately recommend this for anyone looking for a new hair straightener!</li>
    <li> I am a professioal,this was a better price than I can get, it works great at keeping the fly away hair under control</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron if you can use one.  I could not get the hang of it.  This one even has teeth to help control the hair.  My beautition used this one and his quit working and he could hardly function without it.  I gifted my to him and my hair is beautiful every time he uses it on me.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> As a Stylist, I need a flat iron that I can depend on, that will do its job.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly</li>
    <li> This straightener is good for layered or short hair.  I have an angled bob hair cut that is short and layered in the back.  This straightener doesn&#x27;t work very well for long or thick hair.  I have to use another one for the longer sections of my hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this straightener based on the reviews by others.  I have used the Babyliss Titanium Pro previously, and I like the other straightener better.  This is a good straightener for the price, but I should have spent the extra $25 to get the Titanium pro again.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this item.  Was used for a very short period of time and it just stopped working!  No damage or reason.  It just worked one morning and then didn&#x27;t work the next morning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the performance of this ironning for hair can I return it I would like to get one without the comb include instead ! No matter if I have to pay difference thanks</li>
