      <li>Smell is ok.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am still glad that I purchased it from Amazon, as&lt;br</li>
      <li>of the reasons why it is my favorite is because it is moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I am very happy that I could find here after my local drug store stopped carrying it.</li>

      <li>but I mix it with some scented lotion and its fine</li>
      <li>~ I mix 8 1/2  and 9 1/2 for a fabulous color.</li>
      <li>Great with my L&#x27;Oreal Excellence blonde hair</li>
      <li>I find all self tanners for the most part have that distinct smell</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure if you used this every day, you would get a very nice dark tan.</li>
      <li>This product goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for putting them in packs for better pricing.</li>
      <li>It does keep my skin nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>Definitely my new go to. :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;more moist and smooth, but it also gives me a gentle tan glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everyone asks me what I use because it is such a nice tan color.</li>
      <li>I think this will be a good one for me during the winter , but not dark enough for me in the summer.  </li>
      <li>just began working a night shift in an area which isn&#x27;t famously sunny in the first place and did not want to turn ghostly white, so I decided to try this product out.</li>
      <li>Wife loves it and it does exactly what it says it does</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
      <li>I use this every day for the first week then every three or four days.&lt;br /&gt;Hey</li>
      <li>Not really dark but adds a light but noticeable tan.  </li>
      <li>I just purchased more and plan to use it all Winter long.</li>
      <li>This really works and does not have an odd odor like so many self tanners do.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
      <li>color is very realistic and I have not had any problems with streaks or lines.</li>
      <li>Because the color change is so gradual, it is easy to control and won&#x27;t be noticed suddenly by friends and coworkers.</li>
      <li>This product is difficult to find here in Nebraska but Amazon makes it nice and easy!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Really like the smoothness of this lotion.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to look like I have too much color,</li>
      <li>i really didn&#x27;t notice a tanning effect</li>
      <li>Of course use it generously &amp; masage in very well.</li>
      <li>It really does work!&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this is only available online...</li>
      <li>other reason I really like it is that the scent actually smells good.</li>
      <li>and I always make sure I have washed my hands thoroughly after applying (just like any other brand).</li>
      <li>I have been putting this mainly on my legs.</li>
      <li>it is by far better than any other I have tried.</li>
      <li>The smell is not like other tanners, and not too strong.</li>
      <li>Although I can&#x27;t find it in stores near me, it is reasonable here on amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I started out using the light version, but decided to use the dark version one time.</li>
      <li>I have very fair/light skin and red hair.</li>
      <li>, it also leaves you skin soft &amp; silky feeling</li>
      <li>It works well and looks natural.</li>
      <li>I only burn in the sun and have tried many different products to give me a little color for summer.</li>
      <li>It does not have a bad chemical smell like many others, I would describe it as a light floral scent.</li>
      <li>No real mess or fuss.</li>
      <li>It not only gives you a natural looking tan</li>
      <li>This does give me a little color but not as much as I would like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the lotion! It not only gives you a natural looking tan, it also leaves you skin soft &amp; silky feeling</li>
    <li> Best self tanning product I have ever used. Hard to find in stores so I order online.</li>
    <li> I stopped being able to find this product in stores a few years ago and was very disappointed until I found it here.  Great product and great seller!  I have psoriasis and this of all lotions there are out there is the best for it.</li>
    <li> I love this gradual tan lotion, and I feel like I have tried them all! Although I can&#x27;t find it in stores near me, it is reasonable here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is very realistic and I have not had any problems with streaks or lines. I do rinse my hands after, but it hasn&#x27;t ever dyed my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons why it is my favorite is because it is moisturizing. Some tanning lotions leave my skin dryer than when I put it on, but not this one. No need to apply other moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason I really like it is that the scent actually smells good. It does not have a bad chemical smell like many others, I would describe it as a light floral scent.</li>
    <li> The perfect tanner, imo.  This product doesn&#x27;t agitate my skin and it goes on very smoothly.  Olay hit the mark on this product.</li>
    <li> Really like the smoothness of this lotion. Smell is ok. I apply this lotion after the shower and since  it is a self tanner I do not notice a smell as the day goes on . There is a very little tint to this . I have been putting this mainly on my legs. This does give me a little color but not as much as I would like. Make sure you wash your hands..... It will stain your hands. I think this will be a good one for me during the winter , but not dark enough for me in the summer.  This came in a 3 pack at a good price. Would I buy again.??? Yes... It does keep my skin nice and soft.  This product also wears of nicely and does not get blotchy and I&#x27;m faired skin with freckles. I have used this all over my body. I use other products like fake n bake to get a darker color on my arms and face.</li>
    <li> Good job. It is what I wanted.Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is difficult to find here in Nebraska but Amazon makes it nice and easy! It is a wonderful self tanner which leaves your skin in great shape and a beautiful long lasting color. Initally it takes time to build it up and then I just use it once a week or so. I just purchased more and plan to use it all Winter long. Everyone asks me what I use because it is such a nice tan color. My grown children asked Mom where did you go that you got a tan???  Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
    <li> I am a man, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to say about lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just began working a night shift in an area which isn&#x27;t famously sunny in the first place and did not want to turn ghostly white, so I decided to try this product out. I&#x27;m not concerned enough about my skin tone to invest in the higher end products of this type; this product seemed moderate enough that I couldn&#x27;t go terribly wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does as advertised and gradually brings color to your skin. Because the color change is so gradual, it is easy to control and won&#x27;t be noticed suddenly by friends and coworkers. In addition, it smells quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Gradual skin tone color change; easily to control level of darkening&lt;br /&gt;- Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not for everyone</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and suntan lotion combined. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is not like other tanners, and not too strong. It works well and looks natural. Very happy! Definitely my new go to. :)</li>
    <li> IT WAS TERRIFIC JUST WHAT I WANTED AND GOT HERE AT GREAT TIMING,PLAN ON ORDERING SOME MORE FOR ME AND MY MOTHER.</li>
    <li> I use for face make up&lt;br /&gt;, works great.</li>
    <li> it left dark  places on my skin , it looked  fake&lt;br /&gt;with a orange tint . not easy to rub on.</li>
    <li> I liked that I could buy more and save more money. It was just what I needed. Thanks for putting them in packs for better pricing.</li>
    <li> This product does not leave a yellow color like the others I have used. Of course use it generously &amp; masage in very well. I will definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> This product works great with my skin. I am very happy that I could find here after my local drug store stopped carrying it. It leaves my skin silky and streak free!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and it does exactly what it says it does</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  Nice color -- not orange-y like some self-tanners.  Nice light smell, also.</li>
    <li> I use this about 3X/week to maintain a nice golden skin color.  It moisturizes my skin well and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  It absorbs into your skin.  I don&#x27;t want to look like I have too much color, but I&#x27;m sure if you used this every day, you would get a very nice dark tan.</li>
    <li> The Olay Body Quench Plus Touch of Sun, is an excellent&lt;br /&gt;product.  Not only does it help to make my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;more moist and smooth, but it also gives me a gentle tan glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helped to have 3 tubes of it, in one package.&lt;br /&gt;With the cost of the shipping, however, it would probably be best if I could locate this product in a&lt;br /&gt;local store so that it wouldn&#x27;t have to  be shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still glad that I purchased it from Amazon, as&lt;br /&gt;they had it for the least amount of money that I could&lt;br /&gt;find.</li>
    <li> this product smells great and feels wonderful. i really didn&#x27;t notice a tanning effect but i&#x27;m a lotion lady and i will continue to use it</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion/moisture ever!  Does not leave you smelling like a coconut!</li>
    <li> I would rate this product 0 stars if I could. It smells so horrible. I could not get past the smell, it almost made me puke. I would describe it as rotten cream with butter and fake caramel smell mixed in. I left it on to see if the smell would go away once it dried but it didn&#x27;t. I had to keep drinking water because I felt like every time I breathed the product in, it made me gag.&lt;br /&gt;If Olay could fix this disgusting smell, I may be able to rate the other factors like the lotion quality or the way it tans you. Unfortunately, it was too gross to (smell) past.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and all of a sudden could not find it in&lt;br /&gt;places where I usually bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I looked on this site. This really works and does not have an odd odor like so many self tanners do.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Liked this product.It gave me just a touch of color and added moisture to my skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purches.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the stores anymore but works great. I tan but this is perfect for in between tanning.</li>
    <li> This is the only self-tanner I use...it is by far better than any other I have tried. The secret is to apply this lotion, allow to dry, and then apply your normal daily moisturizing lotion over the self-tanner (I use the regular Olay Quench Lotion as well). It really does work!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this is only available online...I can no longer find it in any stores :(</li>
    <li> I have very fair/light skin and red hair. I only burn in the sun and have tried many different products to give me a little color for summer. I like to wear shorts and skirts, but am too embarrassed because of my &#x27;white&#x27; skin. I found this a couple years ago and it was easy to find in the the various stores, but now it is virtually impossible to find anywhere, except on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if Olay has stopped making it or if there is another reason. I even went to Olay.com and cannot find it. I have tried other brands (Jergens, Avon, etc) and nothing compares to the results I get with Olay. It gives me just the amt of color I want after 2-3 applications and I always make sure I have washed my hands thoroughly after applying (just like any other brand). I started out using the light version, but decided to use the dark version one time. I stuck with the dark after that because it gave me faster results. I also learned that either of them go on smoother if I have applied a regular skin lotion before applying the Olay Touch of Sun. To sum it up: it is a great product and I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday for an even glow. I find all self tanners for the most part have that distinct smell but I mix it with some scented lotion and its fine</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I had been looking for. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  No real mess or fuss.Very lightly scented  Have used this product for years without any problems.  Gradual, real-looking color.  Not really dark but adds a light but noticeable tan.  Skin feels and looks good.</li>
    <li> Subtle, natural tan without the burn and skin cancer risk.  I use this every day for the first week then every three or four days.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, I look good and I am in my seventies!  Great with my L&#x27;Oreal Excellence blonde hair ~ I mix 8 1/2  and 9 1/2 for a fabulous color.</li>
