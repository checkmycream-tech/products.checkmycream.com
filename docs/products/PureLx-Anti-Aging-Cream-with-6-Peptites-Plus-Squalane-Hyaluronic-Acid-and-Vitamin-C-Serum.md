      <li>It has a light lavender smell.  </li>

      <li>So, so far, so good.</li>
      <li>So far, I am very pleased and I am excited to see the results with continued use of this</li>
      <li>First off, I love the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Alright, I was excited to try this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken special interest in this item which means I&#x27;ve added it to my &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>i am looking forward to seeing the full results after using this for a while.</li>
      <li>The cream arrived on time and I loved the packaging especially the pump feature.</li>
      <li>the cream is rich but still easy to apply to the whole face.</li>
      <li>and i liked it enough to order the full size version.</li>
      <li>Either way it was worth the discounted price I received in exchange for my opinion.  </li>
      <li>It quickly absorbed in to the skin</li>
      <li>and I love how creamy and soft it is.</li>
      <li>I feel like I look more awake, and likely, with continued use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with PureLx Vitamin C cream and my skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It has made my skin feel smooth and so soft.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin really soft and smooth</li>
      <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
      <li>Maybe this product is best suited for oily skin types though those with wrinkles usually have dry skin!</li>
      <li>I used it faithfully for two weeks and my skin became more dry each day.</li>
      <li>Not only do I see the difference in the fine lines around my eyes</li>
      <li>While creams like this aren&#x27;t supposed to give immediate results I know that when I&#x27;ve rubbed the cream in the fine lines around my eyes look smaller...</li>
      <li>I like that it comes in a pump bottle, so you can control how much you get out, and it doesn&#x27;t get contaminated by any bacteria or anything on your hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m spending time to be ready routine.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much they have faded, but I do know that my face feels healthier and</li>
      <li>Not only is it smooth as silk but it has no oily residue.</li>
      <li>Squalane is a fatty compound that is not only produced in our own bodies but is found in many vegetables and most commonly is extracted from the liver of a shark.  </li>
      <li>It is not oily and my face still feels clean and fresh after applying and there is a slight scent, but I don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if it lives up the anti-aging claims it makes, as my sample size is not enough of the product to produce those results, but going by the ingredient list and the high quality of the cream i would think with regular long term use you would see good results.</li>
      <li>I was concerned because it has a light lavender scent, and lavender is a scent that often bothers my allergies, but it&#x27;s so light and subtle</li>
      <li>So the first plus, no odor, second it does not irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>I ordered other brand through Amazon, and Body Merry works so far very fast!</li>
      <li>PureLx offers.  </li>
      <li>This size has lasted me so far about 10 days.  </li>
      <li>Too early to tell but so far been using it for 2 weeks and no issues.</li>
      <li>I have used it for about a week, and my face is retaining more moisture and has been less greasy and dry.  </li>
      <li>The cream spreads smoothly, and it only takes a small amount when applying.</li>
      <li>No reason to keep it a secret :)  </li>
      <li>Really seeing a difference in the firmness of my skin, also less wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a all in one anti-aging cream.  It has Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid.  I was given a sample size complimentary to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  This cream is all I need for my face, and neck.  I have been using it in the morning and at night.  It has a light lavender smell.  This cream is not greasy.  It has made my skin feel smooth and so soft.  It helps to plump up my skin so I have fewer wrinkles too.  This size has lasted me so far about 10 days.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This is a great anti aging cream. It is a nice sized bottle so I can easily take it on the go with me or keep it in my purse. It makes my skin really soft and smooth and I love how creamy and soft it is. It absorbs nicely into my skin and leaves it feeling silky not oily or greasy. A little bit goes a long way so this will last me awhile. My face looks brighter and more youthful as well. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> I hate long facial regimens that involve a multitude of products and steps; this anti-aging cream has what I look for most all wrapped in to one - 6 peptides, vitamin c serum, and hyaluronic acid.  It is formulated for both daytime and nighttime use, so it can be your morning moisturizer as well as you night cream.  The bottle may seem small, but a little definitely goes a long way - using it once a day I estimate it will last 3-4 months at least.  It is not oily and my face still feels clean and fresh after applying and there is a slight scent, but I don&#x27;t even notice it.  I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles or fine lines right now, so I don&#x27;t know how much they have faded, but I do know that my face feels healthier and this cream with hopefully fend off future lines and wrinkles.  It&#x27;s also organic and not tested on animals!  I received this cream in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have only used this cream for a couple of days but I am starting to notice the difference already.  Not only do I see the difference in the fine lines around my eyes I can feel the difference.  My face is feeling tighter and looking brighter every day I am using the cream.  My mom was asking me what did I do to my eyes because the dark circles and puffiness was less than the day before.  I had to tell her about this cream from PureLx Skin Care.  No reason to keep it a secret :)  Everyone should get this chance to turn things around and prevent a little aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review.

    <li> very nice product! love the size too.</li>
    <li> I found this anti-aging cream to be non-greasy and easy to apply.  I have used it for about a week, and my face is retaining more moisture and has been less greasy and dry.  I feel like I look more awake, and likely, with continued use, I believe it could assist with fighting off the wrinkles I don’t quite have yet.  This is a great product, and pairs well with the microdermabrasion scrub PureLx offers.  I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
    <li> It was difficult to dispense.</li>
    <li> Really seeing a difference in the firmness of my skin, also less wrinkles.  I will definitely be re-ordering this product.</li>
    <li> the cream is rich but still easy to apply to the whole face.</li>
    <li> Alright, I was excited to try this product. I did receive this in order to test the product. I have given it 4 stars at the moment, just because i have only been using this for 3 days. So the first plus, no odor, second it does not irritate my skin.  (i have sensitive skin and have used other products that I either break out, or they cause my skin to have burning sensation. ) The cream spreads smoothly, and it only takes a small amount when applying. So, so far, so good. i am looking forward to seeing the full results after using this for a while. thank you.</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not only is it smooth as silk but it has no oily residue. I&#x27;ve taken special interest in this item which means I&#x27;ve added it to my &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s in my makeup bag so that it&#x27;s part of my every morning routine not just the I&#x27;m spending time to be ready routine.  While creams like this aren&#x27;t supposed to give immediate results I know that when I&#x27;ve rubbed the cream in the fine lines around my eyes look smaller...Call it wishful thinking or call it a cream that you need to have in your routine. Either way it was worth the discounted price I received in exchange for my opinion.  I will continue to look into this product line for other must have solutions!</li>
    <li> Not working. I am still testing for 2 months now. I ordered other brand through Amazon, and Body Merry works so far very fast!</li>
    <li> First off, I love the bottle.  It is elegant and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product can be used both day or night.  It soaks in easily and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  I like that I can apply makeup after this product without having to wait a long time for the product to be absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are great and include jojoba seed oil, apricot kernel oil, 6 multi peptides, hyaluronic acid and squalane.  I had not heard of squalane before so I looked it up.  Squalane is a fatty compound that is not only produced in our own bodies but is found in many vegetables and most commonly is extracted from the liver of a shark.  It has many benefits including moisturization, anti-aging benefits, and is a powerful antioxidant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product daily for about 2 weeks and I already can feel a difference in the way my skin feels.  During the winter, my skin especially on my nose and chin tend to be very dry.  Since using this product, those areas are not as dry and cracked.  The recommendation is to use this product for at least 30 days for optimal results.  So far, I am very pleased and I am excited to see the results with continued use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review</li>
    <li> The cream arrived on time and I loved the packaging especially the pump feature. It quickly absorbed in to the skin and I can feel the cream working instantly.  Feels light and none greasy,  Great moisterizer and wrinkle reducer. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 and have dry skin. The product did not deliver enough moisture. I used it faithfully for two weeks and my skin became more dry each day. Maybe this product is best suited for oily skin types though those with wrinkles usually have dry skin!</li>
    <li> Too early to tell but so far been using it for 2 weeks and no issues.</li>
