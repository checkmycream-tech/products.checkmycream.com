<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived before over a week before the expected delivery, everything is as pictured and perfect.  I have really long &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; hair, keeping clips intact is difficult yet these cheap cat ears stay in place in both my hair and a synthetic wig!  Do order if you are on the fence!</li>
    <li> The product came in right on time before halloween and it is very cute, durable and affordable buy it now you wont regret it</li>
    <li> Both ears are either only two right ears or two left ears facing one direction. Quality is good for the ears and bow, but it is hard to wear without it looking funny.</li>
    <li> We also brought a set of the Necomimi ears that while larger and somewhat better formed do require an expensive headset to use.  These just fasten on with simple hair clips and while they were the cheapest they are the ones my daughter likes to wear the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bow was a throw away for her but the rest has gotten plenty of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did take several weeks to arrive from overseas.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved this so much and wears it daily</li>
    <li> Cute and cheap little set.</li>
    <li> The only thing that bugged me was that the ears were noticeably different sizes.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s loves it! thank you!</li>
    <li> They were kind of flimsy</li>
    <li> The bells ring nicely but the clips atent the best and don&#x27;t stay in well in my hair.</li>
    <li> I just got mine today ^w^ I was super surprised since they weren&#x27;t supposed to come in till next month, yay! I tried them on and immediately noticed that one looked pointier. I didn&#x27;t really care since I could just push it down, but when I looked at them together, one had more cloth and was hot pink, the other had less cloth and was baby pink!! They also didn&#x27;t come with ribbons and bells on the ears like in the picture &gt;.&lt; Not to mention they were different sizes &gt;.&lt; I&#x27;m okay with it except the size... Otherwise, they are the cutest thing ever!! I&#x27;m not exceptional, but i&#x27;m glad to finally have necomimi</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend to wear to a rave so we could get in for a lower price. If we had actually made it there it would have been completely worth it. It&#x27;s what it looks like.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved the way the ears looked and felt. As adorable as this product is, we had a few problems with it...I will list the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The ears and bow are very soft and plush&lt;br /&gt;+ Comfortable fit for both&lt;br /&gt;+ Visually appealing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Despite the ears fitting comfortably on the head, upon closer inspection, it seems as though the item has placement flaws.&lt;br /&gt;  Apparently, or at least in my case, the clip placements were faulty; they were on the same side of both ears, making it appear as  if one had two right ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ear tips are &amp;#34;rounder&amp;#34; than expected for a set of cat ears, as opposed to being pointy, but that can easily be altered or fixed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the Costume cat ears and bow a 3 out of 5 stars. It&#x27;s soft, durable, and visually appealing despite the fact that it looks like one may have two right ears.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> My ears and bow paired with my cosplay outfit was awesome. I like that it had bells in it.....this added to the adorable i was going for with my cosplay outfit.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my cat ears!  They are super cute and really soft! I like it when I walk the bells jingle (: very happy</li>
    <li> These ears were perfect for my cosplay costume and I love the fact you dont have a bulky hair band to get in the way. Great quality and for the price its worth it. I only wish it included a tail as well I love the material its so soft.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Looks exactly like in the picture and it came in good conditions</li>
    <li> Way better than those cat headbands!! This is probably one of the best parts of your costume should you choose to dress like a cat/animal. The clips ensure your \\&quot;ears\\&quot; stay on. The bells and bow are adorable! I might add those they they require a little shaping to look more pointy, but that&#x27;s just my preference. Otherwise I highly recommend this to anyone in place of a headband.</li>
    <li> the bells are sort of low quality but overall i love the product. theyre adorable and exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> I wear these all the time, and they fit perfectly on my wig. I pulled the bells off (my cosplay didn&#x27;t require bells on the ears) but then the ears started to rip a bit. But, it was probably because the bells were stitched. But overall an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Perfect and sturdy! They have a good shape that doesn&#x27;t require any alterations. You can just clip in and go!</li>
    <li> So today I just got these shipped in to me~ And I love everything about it~!!And also the fact that I got this a couple of weeks earlier is great~! The ears are super-duper cute,and I love how they have attached hair clips at the bottom so it&#x27;s easier to put on ^~^ The bow was really adorable aswell~ And the bells on the whole set just made it look....KAWAII~! I would definitively recommend this to anyone!These are some of the best cosplay ears I&#x27;ve used~</li>
    <li> For $2 these are a steal. I bought them for fun, and have worn them to festivals and clubs. They shipped in about a week. I prefer clip in ears to a headband because you can position them yourself vs. being fixed on a band. I would have rated 5 stars but the clips started coming off the ear so I had to glue gun it on but these are only $2. Worst case scenario buy a new pair...</li>
    <li> It was very difficult to get these clipped to the hair and symmetrically placed.  Might be better with a connecting headband for even placement.</li>
    <li> These ears are just what I wanted! Despite when I thought they would be coming, they came at least a good week and a half to two weeks later! They aren&#x27;t much, fuzzy all around and pink on the inside. They sit pointed and the little bells in the ears jingle when you shake your head. The neck tie jingles as well!  All-in-all, I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Chrislyn</li>
    <li> I think they&#x27;re perfect. It is exactly like the picture and the hair clips seem pretty firm too. Id def recommend this item to my friends</li>
    <li> It shipped real fast, did not take long to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fur and nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It fits just right.&lt;br /&gt;The bells sound nice and look well placed.</li>
    <li> I love this product. They were super cute and had no problems with them.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to get them but I got these just in time to wear to work for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Adorable. Loved the bow that came with it.</li>
    <li> I just received my kitty ears and they are exactly as pictured. They came quickly and are super cute! Thank you!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute and make sense for the price. Note, though, that these tend to slip easily so if you&#x27;re going to do any active sports and expect them to stay on, you might have to rethink your costume.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.  Order this before and ordered it again.  It is as they say it is and comes very fast</li>
    <li> I got these as a part of the costume for an upcoming Halloween party. They are really cute with the bells and ribbons. For some reason the bells on the ears and collar don&#x27;t match but I wasn&#x27;t planning on using the collar anyway. The hairclip part where the ears attach to the clip look sort of cheap but they seem to be sturdy enough.</li>
    <li> The ears are so very confortable to wear, the material is very soft. I&#x27;d recomend them to anyone who plans on cosplaying a cat because the price of extremely affordable and the product quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> I like this. The cat ears are hard to get to stay in your hair if you&#x27;re running around though.</li>
    <li> This was purchased to complete an outfit for a costume 5k run here in Arizona. It arrived on time and was in great condition. The ears clipped in easy and did not budge an inch. Amazing and fun!</li>
    <li> It came weeks before estimated and it&#x27;s just so perfect! The ears are adorable. The clips work fine. The bow makes the whole thing :3 Honestly it&#x27;s in way better condition and way more durable than I expected. If you&#x27;re feeling iffy about this, give it a shot anyway &amp;#60;3 Worth it.</li>
    <li> Not picky but it&#x27;s awkwardly shaped ears and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  In fact it broke.  I love the bell.  Btw they make a lot of noise when u barely move</li>
    <li> Very cute! But she&#x27;d.... I use them and they do work and are very comfy, though I wish the shedding would stop</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these didn&#x27;t come in time for what I needed them for.  But I will save them for a whatever occasion comes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a really nice quality. Soft faux fur and cute ribbons and tiny bells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth your buck if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap set of cat ears and bow tie.</li>
    <li> Because they&#x27;re very soft and my girlfriend loves them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a cute and fun buy, the bells are also a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving them, I HAD to put them on. The style itself is absolutely adorable, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Only thing that is wrong with it is that the pink cloth isn&#x27;t thick enough, so you can kinda see through it. I love how the ears attach via metal clips, it makes the attachment more reliable. I was planning on only using them on Halloween, but with how good it looks I must wear it more than just once a year!</li>
    <li> Warning: You&#x27;ll probably get a few odd looks if you walk around outside with these.  Not that it matters, though - the ears are absolutely adorable.  The clips seem durable enough, and the bells are just too cute.</li>
    <li> I ordered these in both black and white, and I am very satisfied with both pairs! Interestingly, depending on the color that you order, you get a different clip for your hair. The black ones had a traditional snap clip, while the white ones had a large bobby pin. I am fairly sure it varies depending on the color, but it could also be that each set of ears is handmade and so the clip varies each time. In any case, I gave the black ones to my boyfriend and kept the white ones for myself, and I haven&#x27;t built up the courage to wear them in public (yet!) but rest assured the day will come. :D</li>
    <li> It took a long time to get here, but it came in between the expected dates. They were in great condition, none of the pieces were missing or fell off and the clips stay in place and feel secured. They are also very cute and comfortable to wear. Im satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These will last me a while and the ear clip-ins are sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;The little bell on the bow was my favorite really cute:D&lt;br /&gt;no dislikes</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but I got a headband not a clip as advertised. Recommend you look else where because I only purchased this for clip on. Be careful.</li>
    <li> Super cute, I just got them!! Took 9 days to get to me.. Worth the buy, make me feel like a super cute and sexy kitty ;3 and my boyfriend also enjoys them ~</li>
    <li> these cat ears were definitely not what i was expecting. I thought they would have the triangular clips but they just had long bobby pins :/ they&#x27;re kind of hard to put in like this and aren&#x27;t very stable. The bows don&#x27;t look like what they are in the picture either. They are ok though, i like that they&#x27;re soft and the bow is really cute to wrap around your neck ^-^</li>
    <li> The ribbons on the ears are not as long as expected. And the &#x27;fur&#x27; at the end of the ear is coming off when I fist open the bag. I had to use glue to glue it together! Overall is was okay.</li>
    <li> Wore these as I dressed as a cat for Halloween.  WOW!!!!  I cannot believe how great these are!  Super cute with the little bells just like a little kitty...LOL!!!  I was a little scared of the &amp;#34;clip barrettes&amp;#34; instead of a headband, but these are amazing!!!!  They stay in place REALLY well and I didn&#x27;t have to keep up with a headband all night.  Super awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> If your looking for mouse ears these would be ok, but I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended buying something else for my cat costume.</li>
    <li> These ears are SO cute. I love the little bells on them and the soft black fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I can barely do anything without having the ears slide off my head. If you want them to be more secure, try tying your hair into pigtails and clip the ears near the hair elastic. I had a bell fall off one ear but my friend luckily had a safety pin on hand. The bells are just hot glued on, so they&#x27;re not very secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality could be better, but I had lots of fun being a cat girl. Perfectly fine for a casual Halloween or cosplay event.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I never enjoyed wearing headbands. They would always squeeze my head after a while and make it hurt. Here&#x27;s a simple solution if you have the same problem as I do! These cat ears are attached to snap-on hair clips and easily go on your hair. The fabric is very soft and the bells make a really cute jingle! The choker simply ties around your neck and is adorable. I use these for cosplay and they work wonderfully. I would easily recommend this to anybody, especially for cosplayers. Headbands are more annoying on wigs but clips are easier and less hassle.</li>
    <li> They are really cute and soft. The bells got annoying. But my bow didn&#x27;t come, only the ears. And I was disappointed. Other than that, they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
    <li> This were shipped and received very quickly. I wore them quite a bit, but I was putting them on one day and suddenly the bow and bell came off of one of the ears. I just replaced it with another pair and a set that has a headband piece instead, it&#x27;s much more comfortable. The collar bow&amp;bell is suuuuuper cute too.</li>
    <li> they came in right on time and I would have to say:they are great.&lt;br /&gt;the quality was amazing,the bells are really cute.&lt;br /&gt;but the reason I give it only 4 stars is that they could not correctly clip in right.&lt;br /&gt;but other then that they are really great for cosplay!</li>
    <li> The ones I received are very cute nothing  was wrong with them only thing is I was completely shocked at how small they were I kinda was hoping for them to be a little bigger . Otherwise I love them to death they are truly exactly what I wanted no headband n they are very easy to put on</li>
    <li> What are you waiting for? No need to wait and think, get it now you fool! Now! Stop reading this.</li>
    <li> bought for a friend, she looks damn good in it</li>
    <li> just what the picture shows. the ears can be adjusted to a better shape if they don&#x27;t sit right at first. very easy to put on and love the little bells. authentic</li>
    <li> I took off one star because I&#x27;m not that big of a fan of the hair clips. I wish they were more like &amp;#34;snap-on&amp;#34; clips rather than &amp;#34;slip-on&amp;#34;. Other than that, I really do like them. They&#x27;re so cute! I&#x27;d rather wear these than the hairband kitty ears. Much more comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> First, the ears don&#x27;t have bells or the ribbon in them. The ears are tied onto a cheap barrette by a string, which also holds the ears into their shape. The bow doesn&#x27;t look like a bow, it looks as it is: two ears stuck together. Lastly, THE EARS WERE UNEVEN! They are two different sizes! Keep looking if you&#x27;re considering these ears, they are a waste and do not even properly offer what they depict.</li>
    <li> I got these actually awhile back, but forgot to do a reveiw over them. Anyway, the pros about the product is it comes with a collar, and the shipping is decent. Cons, they look more like mouse or bat ears, they aren&#x27;t pointy enough, and the bells were really loose when I got them. I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for mouse or bat ears. :)</li>
    <li> Cute if you&#x27;re a middle school weeaboo, but these are exactly what you pay for. They&#x27;re a cheap costume toy. They look tacky, and I&#x27;d feel bad if anyone used these for a cosplay. You&#x27;re better off making your own.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets of these ears and they are sewn and crafted perfectly. There is some sort of glue put on the end of the ribbons to act as a reinforcement so the ribbons don&#x27;t fray, which is wonderful. The ears clip into your hair with barrettes and the boy ties around your neck with a ribbon. These are very cute and soft- makes you look like an actual hybrid!</li>
    <li> These are very cute and fit my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> These came faster than expected.  They are super cute, although they do shed and it&#x27;s hard to get the clips open to put in my hair because it&#x27;s cheaply made but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I would recommend for costume use.</li>
    <li> I was expecting snap clips but it was just bobby pins, the item itself is well made but the way you attach it is not.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing cat ears since i was a freshman in highschool. im extremly pleased with these ears and the clips that they come with are very sturdy clips now cheap at all. im happy to be a kitty again and now be afraid of my ears falling off with a headband.</li>
    <li> These ears are cute, they stay in my hair well, but the shape is more like panda or mouse ears. The bow is pretty cute and I like all the bells. I think I will try to iron them to fix the shape though. I see if I can update it if it works.</li>
    <li> The bow is crooked! Pretty useless to have that BUT, the ears are really cute! I had a hard time keeping them on but there is a way!</li>
    <li> OMG so adorable&amp;#60;3 don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it :)</li>
    <li> Too cute! I love these cat ears and collar. The cat ears don&#x27;t slip off. I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about thoes pesky headbands. They go great with my cat cosplay costume.</li>
    <li> Came in great condition, only problem was that one of the bells have a very dull jingle sound like it&#x27;s broken, other than that everything was fantastic!</li>
    <li> Ugh, I wanted to love these.&lt;br /&gt;They are TINY, cheaply made, and just not worth the money. The bell bow collar that came with the ears looks ridiculous and is just as cheap looking.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute product with easy to clip on ears and adorable easy to tie bow. I used it for a Halloween costume and everybody loved it!</li>
    <li> So adorable and the bell tone of the ears is very pleasant. I love to wear the ears around my house just being a kitty :)</li>
    <li> I ordered these on a whim because I&#x27;ve wanted a pair for a while now.  I found these and though it was a great price.  They shipped ultra fast and I love them. I can&#x27;t wait to use them at the Ren Faire.</li>
    <li> Really cute. Doesn&#x27;t have the issues that a hair band does.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that bothers me is that the bells are pretty loud. I had hoped they would be more subtle or maybe ring with more of a jostle. And with all three, it&#x27;s pretty distracting. Still, this is a wonderful set and a little modifying can take care of that noise if it bothers you too. And considering the great price, you&#x27;re not losing out at all.</li>
    <li> looked like how it was supposed to . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> This product is just adorablee! I feel sooo cute like a kitty when I wear it. &amp;lt;3 I&#x27;m most likely gonna cosplay as a neko maid now for comic con. &amp;lt;3 THANK YOU WHOEVER MADE THIS PRODUCT ;D</li>
    <li> Hello, I recently received this off of my wishlist. I love to use it for my sexy kitty cosplay sessions. Lots of compliments so far. It&#x27;s cute and well made.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so big that it&#x27;ll look like bat ears. I have a big head but these still looked HUGE on me. Then while I was taking it off, the clip part snagged on my hair and ripped two or three strands :/</li>
    <li> BUY IT! you will not regret it, it is exactly like the picture, not to small, not to big, perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special for cosplay or a cat costume!</li>
    <li> What can I say? They bring out my inner cat. I needed something to go with my skin-tight, vinyl cat suit when the wife and I are feeling kittenish, and these fit the bill perfectly. Now, when she purrs \\&quot;Ohhhhhhh, baaaaaaad kitty!\\&quot; My little ears perk right up.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the bow tie as much. It was crooked. The sewing was not straight on the bow. The ears were fine after taking them out of the packaging. :D</li>
    <li> These ears where adorable,the clips where really sturdy, and the fur was soft and cuddly! I thought the bells would be annoying after a while but they have a soft jingle to them that is pleasant. The bow is cut and soft as well and I will be so buying some more for my friends who like being cats...I wish they would make them in two tones though.</li>
    <li> the ears are just hair clips that comes off. the collar isn&#x27;t anything special... and the bells are annoying ( which is on every piece of the costume)</li>
    <li> i love the ears and everybody loved them when i wore them&lt;br /&gt;the bells were adorable and i loved the bow tie too&lt;br /&gt;my only problem is the bow&#x27;s ribbon was ripped when it arrived so i had to do a make do fix that has actually worked&lt;br /&gt;(another problem I have is getting them in but my friend also has trouble with that too XD)</li>
    <li> These kitty ears are absolutely adorable, when I opened the packaging for the first time I was excited to see that they appeared just as they did in the picture- and when I put them on I couldn&#x27;t help but feel adorable myself. - The hair clip idea vs. band is an excellent way of attaching these- they appear seamless on the head and the bow is absolutely fantastic. The bells jingling around when I shake my head makes me feel really happy- and they go well with my gloves I just purchased. - They are soft as well- the only thing I will note - is the bow can me hard to untie sometimes if you tie it wrong to yourself. - Would recommend to anyone looking for cute kitty ears to cosplay- or just for fun.</li>
    <li> There super soft and comfortable to wear! I adore them and you should get them!</li>
    <li> I bought these accessories to add a little Anime feeling to my dress in a convention where I sold some Anime thingies. The product is exactly as depicted, and the good thing about the ears is that you can clip them wherever you want in your head, unlike some headbands that pressure your head triggering headaches. They also look more realistic that most of the Cat ears that you can see in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute and has a good quality. I recommend this to anyone who wants to disguise as a Cat or a Nekomimi character ;3</li>
    <li> These are exactly as i expected them to be ^^ There exactly as the picture. Love them :D They arrived really fast and its just so cute to have those bells on the ears!</li>
    <li> Ears clip in easily, though one of the bells needs to be slightly sewn on again (half of the stitching came off). Look nice, and now these ears are all over my school. :3 I love them and wear them all the time. So, nice quality and nice look/feel. However, a bit of a pain to center on my head, and look a little rounder, but you can angle them and point them. All in all, BUY IT! :D</li>
    <li> Too cute and looks really cute on!</li>
    <li> its super cute and the friend i gave them to fell inlove with them. thanks for sharing these cute things with the world</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this! It is well-made and looks like it does in the picture. She will be using it for Cosplay. Would order more from this co.</li>
    <li> I love these cat ears and there super cute! The only problem is they where much larger then I thought and that I couldn&#x27;t make the ears match each other which really annoying, other then that I loved them!</li>
    <li> Upon getting these i was very excited as soon as i went to put them on FOR THE FIRST TIME the bells fell off of them! I didn&#x27;t even get to wear them and they already broke.Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teenage daughter for a superhero mystery game night where she was supposed to play Puss in Boots. She looked adorable in this set! All it took were black clothes, black boots, and a little makeup to complete the ensemble (although she did add a cape, which was her idea). Considering the price, these are very well constructed, and I expect she&#x27;ll get plenty of use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, she didn&#x27;t want to wear the collar as a collar, so I suggested she wear it as a belt. The ribbons are long enough to do that with a girl with a tiny waist. She ended up wearing it as a bracelet, and it worked well that way too.</li>
    <li> Super cute! They are clipped on, I love being able to place them exactly where I want them.&lt;br /&gt;I never really use the bow, it feels like a little too much.</li>
    <li> THEY&#x27;RE SOOO CUTE! I cannot get enough of them, though the ears need to be &amp;#34;molded&amp;#34; into the cat ear shape or else they look like mouse ears as there is no wire or anything inside to keep them up. Still, so cure!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely kawaii and perfect! They look exactly as pictured. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone looking for great cat ears.</li>
    <li> The bells that were suppose to come with the ears didn&#x27;t come.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely ADORABLE. I love these ears. They arrived much earlier than expected so i was so happy when i received them! Also my boyfriend thinks they are cute too.</li>
    <li> Cute and decently made. Only problem was the clips which weren&#x27;t very secure, but it was an easy fix with superglue.</li>
    <li> Soft, cute, look great on my girlfriend. add a bit of kinkyness to our love life. I love cat girls muahahaa</li>
    <li> These are my favorite cat ears. Ditched the bow, but the ears are the perfect head to ear size ratio.</li>
    <li> Super cute, super easy to put in my hair and they stay in place. I love them!!! Can&#x27;t wait for Halloween!</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture, except for the bow. There isn&#x27;t a ribbon in the center, just the ribbon to tie around your neck.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the quality is pretty good and the hair clips are very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Fuzzy and cute, easy to clip into hair, its perfect! The bells add an extra adorable touch!</li>
    <li> These ears are awesome! Personally, these, being a clip-on style, doesn&#x27;t work too well for me as they always get pushed out of position or even fall out all together. Still, they are exactly as described in the listing and the bells are super cute and jingly!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a present, it arrived in perfect conditions, overall it looks great and the materials look resistant enough</li>
    <li> Great Cosplay Accesories for people how love manga and costumes. It was a gift for my wife and she love it.</li>
    <li> really nicely made, make you instantly look like an anime character and for some reason they make your sexy level go like 10 points higher!!! i wish that they had them in more colors like brown though if they did i would totally swoop them up!</li>
    <li> Straight out of the package, the ears were a little too round, almost mouse-like. So I took some old earrings and pierced them, forcing them to become more pointy. After that they were perfect! I love these things, they are so soft and a good size for a catgirl.</li>
    <li> soft as hell! they attach with clips! i loved this so cute!</li>
    <li> I did use the collar and the bell on it was a really cute accent. The ears didn&#x27;t work for me however. I was afraid the clips wouldn&#x27;t stay on during a whole night of dancing and I couldn&#x27;t get these to look quite right or evenly balanced on my head. So, I ended up getting another set of cat ears that were attached to a headband, and that worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> Very cute!  Not really sure what else to say other than that haha. The bow is very cute. Only thing, it gets a little noisy with all those bells, but I don&#x27;t mind. c:</li>
    <li> the clips detach after a while but its a super easy fix. so many compliments, so many smiles, love wearing them anywhere :)</li>
    <li> I always wanted neko ears (cats ears) for a long time then I found these! they are so kawaii (cute) I like how I look in them I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> So cute!! It took me a little while to get the ears secured properly, but they are adorable, and the bow is a good size too :)</li>
    <li> Love this! Would totally order again. Looks like the picture! All I need now is a tail. Doesn&#x27;t smell weird and shipped within a reasonable time frame for free shipping.</li>
    <li> They were as good as the white pair I bought, but the bow is a little tacky. looks like the cheap material from a santa suit just black. They came from china so they took like a month, my friend wasn&#x27;t able to wear them for Naka-kon, BUT she wears them any way</li>
    <li> Super awesome for cosplays or just running around. Absolutely no issues, but the quality is as expected with cosplay stuff. Absolutely no issues though!</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE these soo much! They are sooo cute and a lot better than stupid headbands. They look exactly like the picture and are great for the price. I wear them around the house, at any appropriate occasion, and for my boyfriend because he thinks it&#x27;s so cute when I wear them and mew at him. He loves them as well. (: Mew~&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> i was really excited to get these in the mail. Their really cute and look great on me, i love how they clip onto my pretty thin hair and dont slide off. They also make a really light bell noise when i move around.</li>
    <li> pretty ears to wear&lt;br /&gt;they are nicely done and are easy to attach anywhere you like&lt;br /&gt;love the sound of bells while moving its very cute&lt;br /&gt;the bow piece is lovely too</li>
    <li> Cute little bell kitty ears! Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I bought these just for fun and they&#x27;ve lasted me longer than I thought easy to put on even on wigs I love them</li>
    <li> Worth noting that the clips are put onto the ears so that you would put them into your hair upwards, rather than across your hair. Makes it kinda hard to secure them. But they can be easily resewn/resecured onto the ears in the appropriate crossways fashion. Or just use some hairclips.&lt;br /&gt;The ears themselves are very cute. My girlfriend really loves them. The bells are less distracting than one would think.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the included bow is very cute, although she probably won&#x27;t use it. But for the price of the ears, and the quality, I consider the bow to be a freebie bonus.</li>
    <li> These are the cutest kitty ears I have found. The price is great and the barettes are the best way to wear ears. The bow is cute too I guess but the ears alone are well worth the purchase price of the set.</li>
    <li> These are adorable! They have clips inside the ears so they stay securely in your hair and are easy to put in. The picture holds true to the product - fuzzy ears and bow tie. The bells are super cute too.</li>
    <li> Does not look like cat ears at all.  Looks like rejected Mickey Mouse ears.</li>
    <li> Super cute but people said it looks more like bear ears instead of cat ears.</li>
    <li> These are my lazy &amp;#34;need a costume/not really&amp;#34; go to ears for when I am at conventions or want to look cute. They suit my needs, and are not annoying or heavy. The clips hold them in my hair really well, even dancing all night at a club. I have that evil type of hair that can&#x27;t hold pins and clips too. Cute lil cheap add on to outfits. I have had these several years now. Bells still attached and all.</li>
    <li> Very cute, soft, durable plush material. The clips are just like regular hair clips, so they&#x27;ll actually stay in place. Superior to the crappy headbands. I&#x27;m actually using the bowtie it comes with to tie around my hips (bow in back), and looping a plush cat tail I ordered, through it. I expect these pieces will last a long time. Worth every penny. Arrived fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the people who complained about the ears looking too much like mouse ears received theirs in a different condition, like crushed oddly in the mail or something. Mine have a decent point to them. Face the pink parts slightly outward to each side, they definitely look like cat ears.</li>
    <li> The shipping on these was really fast.  They are nicely made for what they are and the ears are really soft and easy to put on and wear.  I purchased these for a cute Risuka cosplay and they&#x27;re perfect for the price.</li>
