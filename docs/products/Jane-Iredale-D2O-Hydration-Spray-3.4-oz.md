      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the Jane Iredale liquid mineral foundation, but I&#x27;m sure the D2O spray would only enhance that as well.  </li>
      <li>finishing touch to the whole process.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical as to whether I needed this spray, but it does an awesome job of setting your foundation and powder as your last step.</li>

<li> I eventually broke down and bought her some as well!</li>
<li> It dries in a few seconds</li>
<li> This winter was a tough one, and I had a dickens of a time with dry skin.  </li>
<li> I use it whenever my skin starts to look dull...</li>
<li> Jane Iredale products have, at least, minimized the problems I have with the skin on my face.  </li>
<li> The fragrance is very subtle for those like myself who can&#x27;t use heavy scented products.  </li>
<li> The odor is very faint and doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.</li>
<li> Smells really bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product because of it&#x27;s wonderful scent but it feels a bit sticky on my skin during the warmer months. I may use it more in the winter when I need more hydration.</li>
    <li> I love the D20 hydration spray. I spray my face after I apply my make up; it leaves a beautiful dewy finish on my skin.  I use it whenever my skin starts to look dull...it wakes my skin up.  I love this product..it is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This D2O facial spray is dynamite.  It dries in a few seconds so you can apply it frequently if you want.  It sets the minerals on your face whether they are in the loose or pressed powder form.  I&#x27;ve never tried the Jane Iredale liquid mineral foundation, but I&#x27;m sure the D2O spray would only enhance that as well.  The D2O never bothers my itch-prone skin - only soothes it.  The odor is very faint and doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest. So if you are averse to powdery type foundations because you think they settle in lines and are too matte, you will love this spray.  I use it with the JI pressed and loose bases. D2O really gives a finishing touch to those exceptional foundations.</li>
    <li> I really like this D20 Hydration Spray, it smells beautiful, feels light and refreshing on face. I use it for extra moisture as well as to set mineral makeup. Will re-purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you use mineral makeup! It sets your makeup beautifully plus it smells wonderful. I love all of the jane iredale products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT AND USE IT TO SET THE JI POWDER.  VERY GOOD PRODUCT.  STAYS IN PLACE WELL.  USED FOR A LONG TIME</li>
    <li> Love this with the powder from Jane Iredale.</li>
    <li> I use this before i love how my skin feels good product. Any thing for Jane Iredale is good your skin will feel the different</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  The moisture it provides is outstanding.  I use it to set my foundation and throughout the day as a refresher.  The fragrance is very subtle for those like myself who can&#x27;t use heavy scented products.  I purchased several and plan to always have 3  or 4 on hand.  Fabulous spray.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as to whether I needed this spray, but it does an awesome job of setting your foundation and powder as your last step.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that the spray works but it does. I&#x27;ve been using Jane Iredale on and off for years and after reading reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy it. Sometimes my makeup looked chalky &amp; this has solved it. Even my husband can tell the difference!!! I&#x27;m not that fond of the smell but it goes away quickly. I will never be without a Jane Iredale hydration spray again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I could not tell a difference when used prior to applying the pure pressed based.</li>
    <li> This spray is the perfect finish to putting on your daily makeup. It refreshes and restores your natural glow. I just live it</li>
    <li> I have what I would call the World&#x27;s Most Sensitive Skin.  I have to triple rinse my clothing, to ensure that all the detergent has been removed.  I have to use, as a final rinse, salt in the rinse water of the washer, to truly neutralize the soap in my undies.  As soon as I try a new moisturizer, I can count on a week&#x27;s worth of pimples or, worse, an itchy rash that doesn&#x27;t quit.  Jane Iredale products have, at least, minimized the problems I have with the skin on my face.  This winter was a tough one, and I had a dickens of a time with dry skin.  I knew that I couldn&#x27;t put Aveeno or Clinique or any other brand of moisturizer on my face.  Since I use Iredale&#x27;s Magic Mitt to cleanse my face, and I use her make-up, I thought I&#x27;d try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfection in a spray!  My flaky skin around my nose is gone.  My itchy jawbone is gone!  Yay!  I use it to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my mineral makeup, and I use a generous spray of it before I go to bed.  It has a lovely &amp;#34;lily&amp;#34; fragrance from the natural source, and that makes it particularly nice to use.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I found this spray to be drying and irritated my eyelids. That is where I am sensitive to cosmetics so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. But for something that is suppose to be moisturizing it left my face feeling tight and dry.</li>
    <li> I like the light feeling in this spray.  The first day that I rec&#x27;d it I got a sunburn was amazing on it!</li>
    <li> I can really tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use this to set my make-up! It is extremely refreshing and cooling.</li>
    <li> When using the Hydration Spray in conjunction with the Jane Iredale foundation, blush, shadows, etc., it brings out the wonderful appearance of a perfect complection. Skin just feels and looks healthy, and I&#x27;m a \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot;! An amazing line of products.</li>
    <li> I love ALL the Jane Iredale products. One item that I always want to have on hand is the D2O Hydration Spray, as it is a must for setting the Jane Iredale make up so that it lasts all day, and keeping the skin properly hydrated.  One little can of spray lasts for months ... a great value for its cost.</li>
    <li> Works well but I think it smells of fermenting trash juice in a kitchen garbage can with cigarette butts in it.  The smell goes away when it is dry.  On the fence about liking this overall, because in general I am a fan of Jane Iredale cosmetics &amp; rationally I know it isn&#x27;t anything as icky as it first smells.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling nice and refreshed. Makeup feels fresh and dewy all day. Glad I decided to try it!</li>
    <li> This product is great for setting the mineral powder foundation on your face and it smells great. It has great ingredients and also softens your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I like to apply my Jane Iredale compact powder with a soft brush and then spray lightly with the D20 hydration Spray.  My makeup continues to stay on all day without touchup, and appears smooth without caking. I&#x27;m happy I tried it, and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I use all Jane Iredale face products &amp; this is such a nice way to spritz&lt;br /&gt;a finishing touch to the whole process.  It seems to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the makeup&lt;br /&gt;&amp; give my face a nice fresh feel.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff!  Use it to freshen your makeup in the middle of the day and in the morning!</li>
    <li> This spray is so refreshing and sets my make up perfect. I am a huge fan of Jane Iredale make up. My teenage daughter loves this product as well. I eventually broke down and bought her some as well!</li>
    <li> Great hydration booth anytime!  Sets makeup in the morning.</li>
    <li> Smells really bad. I like Pommist better</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  It&#x27;s cooling and the aroma is wonderful.  It&#x27;s a great way to freshen up and revitalize during the day, and relaxing to use at bed time.</li>
    <li> Really hydrating without being itchy or feeling too wet.  Great to use after at home skin treatments.  Check around your local specialty shops in your area though.  A lot of spas have added Jane Iredale to their product line.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jane Iredale products for over 10 years and will not use any other mineral foundation.  I have tried some of the other popular and less expensive brands and nothing compares to JI.</li>
