<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this was given to someone else to try.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this product free, so that I can try it and write my review after use.  All I have to say is that I love this product.  Firstly, it&#x27;s made with nautral ingredients like Organic Aloe, a Jojoba oil, Grean tea and so on and so forth. I experienced that my face and neck felt smoother after using it for a few days.  The hyaluronic serum quickly absorbs into the skin.  Great product and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve added this to my regimen of facial products and have definitely noticed an improvement. It&#x27;s been about two weeks since I started using this particular product and under my eyes seems to be the most dramatic. They look less puffy and smoother.  My skin feels refreshed and the fine lines are less noticeable, like a mini facelift in a bottle. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure but it&#x27;s definitely alot cheaper than botox. Using this along with my moisturizer leaves my face feeling smooth and light. I have sensitive skin and this serum absorbs well without any irritation. I received this item at a discount to review since I have never tried it before. All opinions stated, whether self-purchased or provided for review, are completely those of my own.</li>
    <li> I am reordering the serum because it has helped moisturize my very dry skin. I was pleasantly surprised. It is gentle and unscented. I am 62 years young.</li>
    <li> My skin already feels smoother and firmer after about a week of use. I&#x27;m young still so I don&#x27;t have aged skin yet. But I still use this to improve my skin and it works for me. I think it&#x27;s great for all ages. You don&#x27;t just have to have aged skin or be older. It&#x27;s a good product (:  ps. I think depending on how much you use the product, you might want to use it before you put on a mosterizer as a precaution that it won&#x27;t dry out your skin. Just as you would with any other product. Best buying everyone!</li>
    <li> Clairgenics Hyaluronic Acid is an excellent product. It has been excellent to use on my skin and as a high end skin care product it really lives up to its name. It tones and firms my skin. I&#x27;m a woman in my mid 40s and as a beauty school student in the master esthetics program, I have learned much about the benefits and role that hyaluronic acid plays.  It not only keeps the skin firm and toned it produces collagen which helps keep it elastic and still youthful.  Our bodies naturally produce collagen and we produce the most in our youth. As we age and become that dreaded &#x27;o&#x27; word..older..we lose gradually the collagen. It begins to break down as we age..another dreaded word..lol..and therefore we get sagging of the skin, fine lines and wrinkles.  Some more dreaded words. Hylouronic acid acts like a mini chemical peel and helps to combat against these occurrences.  Outside expensive surgery and botox and dermafillers...there really is not a magic potion lotion or serum that will ultimately stop the aging process of the skin. It will happen to all of us eventually.  The trick is to use high professional products of high quality and learn how to use preventative steps and measures to make our skin last as long as possible in the healthiest state possible.  Besides staying and keeping hydrated, using dunscreen, stop smoking, keeping skin properly moisturized day and night, implementing a very good home skin care routine with high quality products, a very nutritional diet...all of these factors and there are othets..these are some of the big factors will go very far in helping our skin last as long as possible.  We are born with and only have one skin, adding the use of Clairgenics Hylouronic Acid to our daily skin care is a total must. I have done so..the results are excellent.  The vitamins A E and C are very critical to skin health as well as others. It would take much more posting space to explain why they are. Clairgenics has incorporated these vitamins that are sovital for skin into the Hylouronic Acid product as this company very much understands the health and science of skin. I give this product a complete star 5 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I hate when I repeat things other people say - so unoriginal - but I love this product so much, I am just going to have to do that. This is almost magical. I have a friend who saw me recently and said I looked younger. At 62 this comment is not to be taken lightly. I am not sure how I found out about it - maybe in a magazine promotion but I am glad I did. I probably overuse it a bit because it feels so good after putting it on.  You should put a layer of your favorite moisturizer on top of it. I use Patricia Wexler MD&#x27;s pink stuff on top and my skin is like butter. Seriously.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will definitely be purchasing again in the future</li>
    <li> Awesome. I love this stuff so much that I order a new bottle every time I open my back-up. Has done wonders for reducing my pores, evening my complexion and actually helping with oily skin some.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid is great for keeping your skin plump and moisturized. I recently added Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum to my daily skin care and I love the healthy glow I see after I use this. I like to apply it morning and night. This product is clear, I did notice a slight scent but after it is on my skin I did not notice the scent at all. It also dries pretty quickly so I can apply any other products I may be using. I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good products.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, watch the packaging though - mine came frozen!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this serum on her face in the daytime. She says her skin feels tighter and more elastic again, and I see a difference in her appearance in the past couple of weeks. There is a visible improvement in skin tone, and her skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it used to be.</li>
    <li> Clarigenics has only great products!! This is one of them!</li>
    <li> This product is working fine for me thus far, it&#x27;s only been a week. I like the fact that it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin easily and does not leave an oily effect afterwards. The supplier was also very helpful and shipped the product on time. I will definitely re-order from this supplier this product again.</li>
    <li> Clarigenics recently allowed me to try the company’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum in exchange for an honest review. I love using a good hyaluronic acid and I can honestly say, this is one of the best I’ve tried. Many are thin, with earthy odors (though most odors dissipate quickly).&lt;br /&gt;Clarigenics’ Hyaluronic Acid Serum is nice and thick, providing a very different experience to what I’ve been used to with other acids. It has a nice odor that rapidly evaporates. I had some beautiful photos for you, but Tumblr has changed on me, and now I can’t seem to get my photos to post easily, so until I convince myself it’s time to dump Tumblr and move along to something else, or Tumblr rectifies the issues, I’ll be photoless (or until I can find a solution).&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself absorbs quickly, ensuring that you don’t add additional minutes to your morning and evening skin regimes. Clarigenics is made with quality ingredients and doesn’t irritate even my hyper-sensitive skin. I feel comfortable using it even around my mouth area, where I don’t usually like to use skin products for fear of ugly rashes and/or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum is designed to fight off all those signs of aging. This is an absolutely wonderful product. It’s necessary to follow the serum with a great moisturizer, so be sure to remember to do this, should you try any type of hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;I rate Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum 5 youthful stars.&lt;br /&gt;All in this review are my own. I would never recommend a product that I do not or would not use myself or in my own household.&lt;br /&gt;opinions</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over the weird consustency.  Feels like putting Vaseline on my face.  Very expensive Vaseline.</li>
    <li> Fantastic fast absorbing serum, that delivers great results and moisturized skin all day.</li>
    <li> Made my face sensitive and over dry even using it once a week. I have vey sensitive dry skin so I am very careful.  Most people will probably do ok with this, but I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> 1. What is your main concern why you tried this product?&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin is becoming dry resulting to rough feeling because of the climate and it lacks of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;2. What do you expect to achieve in using the product?&lt;br /&gt;Youthful glow with smooth and moisturized feel.&lt;br /&gt;3. Will you recommend it to other and if so who? (Answer is at the end of the review statement)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I are using the Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 13 days already.  We religiously applying the serum around our eyes, and face down to our neck.  Right now, we can visibly tell the difference it made in our skins mostly on my part. Before I tried this serum, my facial care was Anew Platinum Cream but after few hours of applying it into my face and being exposed to sunlight, my skin were becoming dry again and becoming flakey. With this serum, my skin were transformed from dry and rough to smooth and soft. It is not flawlessly smooth like the face of commercial model but it is totally far from being dry.  The potent, long-lasting moisture treatment effectively works in the kind of facial skin I previously had and transformed it to a moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it YES but as always with careful consideration what kind of skin condition and correction you need to have. If you need an effective natural facial moisturizer, try this serum.  Aside of moisturizing your skin it is also an Anti-Aging Cream with Vitamin C + E.  It&#x27;s free from toxic ingredients (Paraben). For the deep line repair part, I couldn&#x27;t say anything yet (not done using the whole bottle).  Right now I am satisfied with the result.  Follow thoroughly the instructions to works best and the take care your health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather disappointed in this product, I just discovered there is carrageenan in it and that has been something I&#x27;m trying to stay away from due to the controversy regarding possible contributions to breast cancer - no the studies aren&#x27;t absolutely conclusive that carrageenan is the actual cause, however it is a questionable ingredient and one I really try to stay away from. I&#x27;ll probably send it back.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  It&#x27;s more viscous than the other hyaluronic acid serum I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s has a cooling effect on the skin.  I use it under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Looking Younger everyday :) great Product that is giving me visible results! lightweight and non-greasy product offers lots of benefits</li>
    <li> Doing great so far....feels great on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> As expected as described. Great product and fast delivery thanks</li>
    <li> Most folks seem to use this only on their face but I use it on the backs of my hands too and it has really helped give me smoother skin there also. Just be sure to put a moisturizer on afterwards so it can seal it in. I have very light and sensitive skin and I only use products like Clarigenics that are committed to natural skin care. No irritation at all! I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of other anti-aging skin care products and this one just plain works.</li>
    <li> My skin felt smoother right away – a little bit the first day but significantly better around day 3 or 4.  I’m looking forward to how much improvement will take place over time.  The hyaluronic acid serum arrived quickly and has a very smooth and light feel.  It absorbed very quickly. Also I started drinking more water and I recommend that together with the serum if you want to fill in wrinkles.  More water means more moisture and then the Clarigenics serum locks it into your skin.  I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> Works fine I think; I use it occasionally. I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll be long-term.</li>
    <li> This product is no different or better than any other moisturizer I have tried.  I am really not impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I started seeing results in the first few days, particularly under my eyes.  I can feel with my fingertips how much softer my skin is getting, and the wrinkles are fading as the skin around them plumps up.  I’m now starting to use it on my neck and hands too.  Great stuff, will re-order!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks, and my skin looks better already. With my schedule, I can&#x27;t spend a lot of time on complicated steps. I like how this product pulls moisture into my skin. Product arrived on time and customer service has been super.</li>
    <li> I ordered one to begin and I used it faithfully until it ran out.  I know this may sound too fantastic to believe, however, I have noticed a difference.  Particularly, the deep Shar-Pei like lines on my forhead have been noticeably lessened and of course, taking a few years off my appearance.  (We do live in a society that at times, can be a bit shallow. &amp;#60;grinning&amp;#62;)</li>
    <li> Feels great on face. Makes your face soft and smooth. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Feels so good. Smooth and non-greasy. Smells great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Haven&#x27;t used much of it but so far, so good!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice but have not used very long for results but it is very smooth. For a serum this does not feel as greasy as some yet feels very smooth to the touch as stated earlier. Excellent dispenser as well allows for just the right amount on the fingertips</li>
    <li> This serum was definitely worth the purchase.  I love that not only does it feel good when it is applied, but it has a nice smell and leaves no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This has a nice light scent, is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. Since starting to use this product, I have noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my skin. My pores appear smaller as well as those fine lines around my lips and eyes. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants great looking skin as well as those with sensitive skin as it causes no irritation.</li>
    <li> I love amazon coupons and I needed a natural hydration moisturizer for my face. I was recently Dx. with kidney Cancer and one of the side effects from the Nexavar is Very dry it is an acne like dry. THis product was the one of the best I have tried I loved it and it worked on my back and arms it reduced the amount of bumps visable. I would recommend this product if you had side effects from any chemo it is wonderful. Love love love my skin again</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum as while back already and I have to admit, it did wonders to my skin. Within the first two weeks, I could see and feel a noticeable reduction in fine lines and wrinkles that just made my skin feel beautiful again. When applying the serum, it is really easy. It goes on smooth, gets absorbed quite easily and quick and almost instantly lets my skin feels smooth and soft, leaving it with nice glow. The next time I can get my hands on this product again, I will certainly say YES.</li>
    <li> I am still evaluating &amp; using this product everyday &amp; night. I will know more once the whole bottle is finished. Thanks again RLT.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first HA serum so I have nothing to compare it to. I guess it is helping my skin somewhaat. I do have to say that I haveto use my moisturizer afterwards because it soaks right into my skin and leaves it feeling dehydrated if I don&#x27;t. I think my pores are smaller, but that is about it for now.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Tomosom.com in exchange for an honest review. I really enjoyed this product, I used very often so I thought I would like to try it. This serum is reasonably priced ($21.97) and it&#x27;s very simple to use! After using about a few drops every night my skin feels much more hydrated, not oily or sticky. My face is so hydrated and soft I just love it! This is a thick product so a small amount really goes a long way. The liquid inside is a thick clear color. It has a pleasant very nice scent. The  ingredients in this serum are natural vitamins and won&#x27;t harm your skin:  98% NATURAL AND 72% ORGANIC - A hypoallergenic blend of rejuvenating ingredients helps to reduce the look of fine lines and deep wrinkles while infusing the skin with pure Hyaluronic Acid (locks in moisture), Vitamin C (reverses sun damage), Jojoba Oil (anti-bacterial moisturizer), Witch Hazel (blemish fighter), Vitamin E (repairs cellular damage), Green Tea (neutralizes free radicals), and Aloe (heals and soothes stressed skin. Well worth its weight on gold, Awsome product. DISCLOSER: I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Applies nicely and absorbs quick,does a nice quick job on brown spots removal, but have not seen a difference in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> As a 45 year-old non-smoker who does not wear makeup except for special occasions, I expected this &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; product would do what all these rave reviews said it would. Instead, it made my face erupt in zits. Acne zits with redness, chafing, and didn&#x27;t do a thing for the slight (and I DO mean slight, I don&#x27;t go in the sun, I don&#x27;t tan, I&#x27;m IRISH) crow&#x27;s feet (laugh lines, whatever you want to call them), this stuff did NOTHING. SO... acne like a teenager (and I didn&#x27;t have acne as a teenager) at 45, redness, and no tightening or smoothing... AND suddenly I&#x27;m getting calls from the company (WTF?) asking all sorts of personal information (didn&#x27;t know Amazon gave out phone numbers). Personally, I found the fact that I was getting called at home during the dinner hour really the absolute straw. So. There you have it. Stuff is crap, made my not-too-bad skin (wanted to have no lines around my eyes) look like a fifteen-year old who eats nothing but Cheetos and McDonalds. Not exactly the &amp;#34;youthful appearance&amp;#34; I was going for. And Amazon ? This is the first time I&#x27;ve had a company call me after over 20 years of being a member... so you might want to make sure they don&#x27;t do that again. CRAP. AVOID.</li>
    <li> The promotional code they gave me did not work.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!  I have normal to dry skin and it&#x27;s also past the 50 mark as well, so there are a few wrinkles as well.  This serum feels very nice going on and while it doesn&#x27;t feel tight.....it appears it must tighten as I have less wrinkles and my skin looks fresher and younger.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
    <li> Wonderful will purchase more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Serum! I am pretty mad at myself for not having come across this before. If you;re looking to get smoother more refined skin texture, this serum is definitely for you! I woke up with more glowing skin and my acne marks are fading! This serum is quick to deliver amazing results, you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> It worked and I noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick serum. This one tiny bottle contains all these good stuff, such as aloe, Jojoba Oil, Witch Hazel, Green Tea, vitamin C and D! And 365 day guarantee so everyone should try it.</li>
    <li> I love that this serum contains so many wonderful ingredients that are so good for your skin. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and at night before bedtime. It goes on easily and dries pretty quickly. Afterwards, I follow up with a moisturizer. I like how it helps to keep my skin feel smooth and hydrated. An added plus is that Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum is made in the USA and is FDA and GMP certified.&lt;br /&gt;I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> LOVE this facial serum. It is always great care of your skin and prevent wrinkles. I will definitely be using this for many years to come. I love that it is 70% organic and is made in the United States of America. I also love that it has vitamin C and E. I have those stubborn forehead wrinkles that I would try anything to get it to help prevent them from getting worse. I have been using this product for a few weeks and I am very impressed. Can&#x27;t wait to see what results I have after using this product long term.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, does not break me out. I was impressed!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and my &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; acne has cleared up considerably. I am 40 years old and have continual break outs to this day. I will definitely purchase this again. My skin feels tighter and looks brighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first bottle, and my skin looks a lot better already!  I hope that the second bottle will continue the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that putting this onto a damp face makes it work better and faster.  Definitely having some time between application of this and your moisturizer is key, too.  I use it morning and night, without fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My splotchiness has decreased, and my skin seems a little tighter (only I can really tell, but I did get carded twice this past week, so that&#x27;s showing something--I&#x27;m 47!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin has disappeared and new dry patches clear quickly.  (Note that after the first few days, I had dryer skin than normal, but I kept using it and it went away, leaving me with much MUCH better skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red spots are coming up about 10% of what they used to.  They heal much faster, too.  When my skin is dry, I tend to scratch the driest spots, so I am now not having to deal with that damage that I used to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product--and am looking forward to another bottle.  The manufacturer was kind enough to send me a discount code for my second bottle, so that&#x27;s a perk, too!</li>
    <li> One thing I&#x27;ve learned as a long time serum devote is serums are not one in the same as a moisturizer. Most are not the least bit moisturizing which was actually a good thing. At one point in my life my skin was so oily that almost any moisturizer spelled either an oil slick or a major break out. Serums were, and still are, a skin savior. They delivered rejuvenating benefits without the irritation or grease of heavy moisturizers. Then when my skin became more balanced &amp;/or it was drying out thanks to indoor heating, I would always layer a moisturizer over my serums. This Clarigenics Hyaluronic shakes all that up. It&#x27;s actually really superb at moisturizing and can be used alone with wondrous effect. It plumps the skin, stays on all night and leaves your skin so soft and dewy come mourning. It makes for a lovely sleeping mask too if you slather it on thickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my very first Hyaluronic Acid serum and now I&#x27;m hooked and have ordered backups. This one in particular is a favorite thanks to a lack of fragrance or Dimethicone, it&#x27;s nice thick consistency, the fact it&#x27;s clear and the way it feels cooling and non-stingy to the skin. I also love the way I can use this right under my eyes and how it has never caused a bit of milia or pore clogging. It&#x27;s great in conjunction with a Derma Roller too, soothing and helping to take down the resulting redness a bit. It also draws and locks in moisture which is important after micro-needling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might be slathering it on a bit too thick or maybe it&#x27;s evaporating because after only about a month my bottle is already half gone. This along with retinol and Vitamin C serums have made some of the most dramatic improvements to my skin that I&#x27;ve ever seen. All within a month. I can&#x27; wait to see what happens after a year. Clarigenics Natural Skin Care sent a free sample for review.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, Botanic Hyaluronic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, MSM, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, Vitamins C &amp; E, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin. This is contained in a clear glass bottle with eyedropper. It is made in the USA and is 98% Natural and 72% Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: This is a full featured product containing Hyaluronic Acid to moisturize and help the skin retain moisture, Vitamins C to reduce sun damage &amp; E to repair cellular damage, and Antioxidants for healing and soothing. This is a gel-like serum, one squirt from the eyedropper will cover the whole face. It absorbs quickly and completely. It really make my skin feel so hydrated and was cooling on my dry skin. It has a slight floral fragrance which disappears once it is absorbed. I used this under my makeup and it held up perfectly, didn&#x27;t cause my BB cream to get oily or slippery. Even after cleansing my skin felt smooth and restored. This product can be used all over the body, on cracked heels, dry elbows, crepey neck, and dry hands. It immediately starts to work and I found that applying it daily to those areas really improved them, reducing dryness and having almost a plumping action that showed smooth, soft skin. This hydrating plumping does reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. While I realize that everyone might not have the great results that I did, I definitely recommend this product to help your skin feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results from using this producy</li>
    <li> I’ve had decent results in the past with hyaluronic acid serum, but I’m always looking for brands that take natural and organic skin care more seriously. I tried the Clarigenics brand and it was the best face serum I’ve used – smoother and softer on my skin, and no irritation. I like that they don’t use any nasty parabens or other crud like some companies, and that it has a lot of extra botanical softeners and vitamins in it. It absorbed very easily, and has a nice scent. My skin felt softer after the first use. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I’ve been experimenting with different types of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid Serums to try to find out which one I like best. Dr Oz has raved about the anti-aging benefits of of Vitamin C and E on the skin and these Serums have become all the rage. I received a 1oz bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C E &amp; Organic Antioxidants by Clarigenics Complimentary to review. As I have mentioned before while reviewing other anti-aging products, I am not one to jump on the anti-ageing hype but I do want to take care of my skin the best that I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarigenics  lists the serum as being 98% Natural and 72% Organic and as a hypoallergenic blend of rejuvenating ingredients helps to reduce the look of fine lines and deep wrinkles while infusing the skin with pure Hyaluronic Acid (locks in moisture), Vitamin C (reverses sun damage), Jojoba Oil (anti-bacterial moisturizer), Witch Hazel (blemish fighter), Vitamin E (repairs cellular damage), Green Tea (neutralizes free radicals), and Aloe (heals and soothes stressed skin). They are paraben free, and use no dioxanes, phthalates, SLS, alcohol, or other toxic ingredients, and make their products in the USA in a FDA and GMP certified facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serum has a consistency of aloe, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin. To me it smells like Witch Hazel more than anything else (Most Serums I&#x27;ve tried smelled of Jojoba Oil), however it is not overwhelmingly strong.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry sensitive skin. And this product does as it promises. No more dry patches, scaling, or redness. My skin is bit by bit looking better every day. Thank you Clarigenics!</li>
    <li> My wife ,loves this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice a difference at all....</li>
    <li> Does not go on greasy. Leaves skin soft. Having a damp face helps application.</li>
    <li> I have quite sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always careful trying new products. But I wanted something in addition to my regular Creme de la Mer regimen. And this works! The texture is light and the gel is absorbed into the skin quickly. My skin looks more radiant and fine lines and first wrinkles disappeared after the first 2 weeks of use. I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I received this for a review and I loved how the vit c was reversing damage.  Cancer runs high in our family so I liked I had something to counter pollution and exposure.  I used it at night and I did a test on my hands.  There was a difference.  Only issue is you do have to keep using it.  It&#x27;s been a few months now and I can&#x27;t tell a difference any longer on my hands.</li>
    <li> Have seen and tried so many things like this, I did not expect much.  However, I absolutely love it!  It even works great on my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Used in conjunction with my morning and evening moisturizers, I saw a difference in one week. Lines are less visible and skin is smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum works very well to smooth out the little wrinkles that are forming with age. I was quite amazed by this one. It visibly reduced the wrinkles in my forehead, as I tend to raise my eyebrows a lot thusly have some wrinkles forming there.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few hyaluronic acid serums and I do like the Clarigenics formula, but I am not super impressed with it. It states, &amp;#34;Apply Clarigenics Hyaluronic Acid Serum once in the morning and again at night. Clarigenics natural skin care products require only a small amount to be effective. Provides anti-aging and anti-wrinkle benefits for all skin types and conditions, including acne, dry or oily skin, and eczema. Follow with a quality moisturizer. Expect to see more vibrant skin the first day, with even more significant improvement in the first month.&amp;#34; And it does work nicely as a moisturizer and is beneficial to skin.  I can’t really say if it helps with wrinkles because I really don’t have any at 30 years old. I am mostly using this as prevent wrinkles and heal my skin from acne scarring. The thing I am not really enjoying about this product is that it&#x27;s leave my skin kind of sticky. I know they have aloe in it and maybe that&#x27;s why since aloe tends to leave the skin sticky after use. The consistency of the serum is more gel like then other serums I have used. I am guessing once again this is because of the aloe. I have no problem with that and even with the sticky issue I will just use the serum at night before bed. I am sure a lot of people won&#x27;t mind it and since aloe is so great it&#x27;s probably worth a little stickiness. :)</li>
    <li> Love this HAS. Use nightly and would not be without. Told friend, they bought two. It is very easy to use and high quality. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Tried this serum! I am a HUGE fan of these types of products. I don&#x27;t care if you are 18 or 80 everyone needs to be using a vitamin serum. The benefits are amazing!! First of all with this product it seems a little scary at first cause it&#x27;s oily. I have mentioned this before. It&#x27;s a weird feeling to be putting oil on your face when most the time the whole goal in skin care is to remove oil and to prevent it from showing through our makeup. So it is a trip trip putting oil on your face. This is totally different. It&#x27;s the consistency of an oil, but not the feel. It goes on smooth and soft, absorbs into the skin and leaves it just Dewey enough to look healthy and not pubescent. I liked that there is no smell, no dyes, no chemicals, parabans. It&#x27;s all natural ingredients, so really nothing that would irritate the skin, even the most sensitive skin types. I noticed a huge change in my pore size and the over all &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of my skin. If you aren&#x27;t aware of the benefits of hylauranic acid then you need to know! It sounds intimidating and kind of OMGOSH,I&#x27;m not putting acid on my face. But it&#x27;s from a nature, not a man made chemical on a lab somewhere. H.A. Is a moisture binder, it attracts moisture to the skin to plump up and fill in fine lines. I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without some form of H.A. On my face. Its a must! Don&#x27;t be afraid of the name, it&#x27;s really a beautiful thing. Doesn&#x27;t irritate and keeps the skin young and funky fresh! I use it under my moisturizer twice a day after cleansing. And it&#x27;s a must have product. Don&#x27;t but just any serum, make sure it&#x27;s natural and from a reputable company such as this one. You just never know what you are going to get and the quality is really amazing. My skin LOVES this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
