<li> Expensive, but nice on the throat.</li>
<li> Great flavour which lasts a long time, compared to other brands I have tried which seemed tasteless.  </li>
<li> I especially like that the large quantity box, 15 oz, is packaged with a small box to carry in your purse or briefcase</li>
<li> The glycerin ingredient keeps your mouth and throat lubricated naturally, and the sugar-free aspect prevents that &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feeling in the mouth you get with other lozenges.  </li>
<li> It helps with my dry throat before I sing at church.</li>
<li> so I consume an average of one per day, more when I&#x27;m sick or traveling, especially in air-conditioned environments.  </li>
<li> Grether&#x27;s Sugarless Black Currant Pastilles were suggested by my  ENT to help sooth hoarseness.</li>
<li> I swear by these lozenges and share them sparingly because some friends (and little ones) treat them like candy.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not a strong flavor.</li>
<li> I got used to these while living in NYC, but down in Texas, they are hard to find.</li>
<li> Hard to describe what black currant tastes like,</li>
<li> Recommended for any scratchy, tired, dry throat problems you may be experiencing.</li>
<li> They are hard to find.  </li>
<li> but they give me TERRIBLE breath and make me super self-conscious.</li>
<li> Not ideal...</li>
<li> These kept my throat at ease and didn&#x27;t cause weird side effects.</li>
<li> Grether&#x27;s pastilles are ferociously expensive...</li>
<li> you have a boring job and stand around for hours doing nothing, you&#x27;ll need these; however, they&#x27;re addictive and can break your budget.</li>
<li> , they are expensive.  </li>
<li> These were &amp;#34;prescribed&amp;#34; to me by the ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist to the stars on Broadway during the worst sinus-infection I&#x27;d ever suffered.  </li>

    <li> These saved my musical theatre life. Playing a leading lady in a musical can be tricky. These kept my throat at ease and didn&#x27;t cause weird side effects. And they&#x27;re sugar free and still taste good. Recommended for any scratchy, tired, dry throat problems you may be experiencing. They&#x27;re a life saver!</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised.  Fast and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Share one with a friend and they&#x27;ll keep looking back at you to see if you are going to offer another. I got used to these while living in NYC, but down in Texas, they are hard to find. In fact, I never see them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a boring job and stand around for hours doing nothing, you&#x27;ll need these; however, they&#x27;re addictive and can break your budget. Such a nicer look over gum chewing any day.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite lozenges of all time.  They are soothing without burning and calming for all throat conditions: dryness, soreness, tickly coughs, and over-use. I use them are a travel staple. They are hard to find.  My last order from Amazon was at a great price and came directly from Switzerland.</li>

    <li> Been using them for years, and It does what no other drop seems to be able to do, sooth the tickle in my throat. They are yummy!. First time buying the sugar free and I do enjoy them, not as much as the full sugared ones.</li>
    <li> I have bought these English throat soothers for years.  But this is the first time I found blueberry and sugarfree!  What a treat!  And the large tin contains a tiny tin thats perfect for going to plays or the opera and you don&#x27;t want to have something paper wrapped and noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are expensive.  But I have not yet found anything comparable.  A lovely stocking stuffer for my girls, too.</li>
    <li> My fiancé is a singer and recently had throat surgery.  These were highly recommended by his surgeon to soothe his throat before and after a show!  He loves the taste and they def seem to help!</li>
