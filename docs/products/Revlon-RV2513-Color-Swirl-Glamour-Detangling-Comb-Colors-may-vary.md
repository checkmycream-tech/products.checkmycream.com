      <li>I now own two.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  </li>
      <li>Nice and sturdy product.  </li>
      <li>Revlon RV2513 Color Swirl Detangling Comb.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon should revisit this product as it is marginally suitable for hair.  </li>
      <li>it is also very easy to clean and seems impervious to pulling out hair, so it doesn&#x27;t replace a good brush, but helps a lot before brushing</li>
      <li>This one was very smooth.  </li>
      <li>Very cheap plastic and</li>
      <li>This one is nicely rounded and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The box amazon shipped the comb in was huge!  </li>
      <li>I actualy noticed more ripping of my hair with detangeling combs than i have with using a brush.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any give to it at all like most plastic combs.</li>
      <li>Love this comb</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these combs.  </li>
      <li>so it snaps off more easily than others.  </li>
      <li>I switched to this product instead and so far it&#x27;s been great:</li>
      <li>I got it to make the $25 free shipping when I needed to spend just $2 more.</li>
      <li>But for people to like the combs better this is a pretty nice cheap one.</li>
      <li>I bought them for the nice colors, and I definitely got two good ones.  </li>
      <li>It works as expected, good styling, and seems to be fairly durable.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
      <li>I like this great comb,I use gel and it combs my hair back great,and the price can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
      <li>I am glad I got it nice item and not in my local store.</li>
      <li>This is a post to all my cheap friends who are looking for a great gift for me, and other curly girls like me.</li>
      <li>This comb would be better with more teeth and in the same materials and colors as depicted on Amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>I use it to detangle my hair after showering and it gets the job done quickly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>It is brittle, cheap plastic that broke the first time I dropped it.</li>
      <li>For the price it was worth it.</li>
      <li>Bury good for curly hair, doesn&#x27;t break it as other brushes</li>
      <li>My compromise is to use this detangling comb right before a shower, when my hair is at</li>
      <li>very smart purchase&lt;br /&gt;Durable and sturdy</li>
      <li>Pretty painlessly.</li>
      <li>So, unless you only plan on using it once, buy a better comb.</li>
      <li>This time I got a similar one with a handle since this one slipped out of my hands in the shower many times.  </li>
      <li>I love Amazon, and it&#x27;s only a $5 comb, but this is was not acceptable quality control</li>
      <li>it is clear plastic and cool looking.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it really.  </li>
      <li>It works very well for detangling.</li>
      <li>It is much too sharp for the scalp and easily breaks when it is dropped on the bathroom tile.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been told not to brush it after a shower because wet hair is easy to break.</li>
      <li>separates tangles with easy and has a wide separation between tines.</li>
      <li>the two-toned blended colors are more like a gradient shift in colors from opaque black to the translucent color not tortoise shelled like the picture.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>It was exactly the comb I wanted, But, I found it at several stores at a much lower cost after I bought it.</li>
      <li>The price was far too high for the product.</li>
      <li>Disappointing as the teeth are nice and far apart and comb is not made of cheap plastic.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised how painlessly this comb removes tangles.</li>
      <li>but wow what a difference.  </li>
      <li>This comb is sturdy, I have dropped it in the shower several times, while combing conditioner through my hair and the comb has not broken.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t pull and hurt her head like her old one.</li>
      <li>My only concern, long term, is that it appears more brittle than other combs</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to someone needing a basic comb.</li>
      <li>I also love the pink and black coloring of the comb I received.</li>
      <li>Snapped right in half, using it on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>instead of screeching with every trip through her curly fine beadhead, she only has a few ows.  </li>
      <li>the \\&quot;random color\\&quot; I received was purple--my favorite!</li>
      <li>The plastic is somewhat cheap feeling and after a long time of use it did break a little but was still usable.</li>
      <li>I really looked widely for that Revlon unbreakable detangling comb.</li>
      <li>but of course it&#x27;s not wet.</li>
      <li>It is still nice looking though; I got an aqua and a purple one randomly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, but I didn&#x27;t appreciate getting a random color.</li>
      <li>My hair can get tangled easily because it&#x27;s long, but at least a 1/3 of the teeth snapped out before it was even a year old.  </li>
      <li>I have hair that will seriously tangle and snarl on itself because it&#x27;s really fine.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they would ship such a small item in such a huge box.</li>
      <li>My hair is not thin, but not so rough or strong either, and within less than a year, a few of the teeth have fallen off already.</li>
      <li>Liked the looks, but unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t going for looks only when wanting tangle-free hair...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s oiliest, so it&#x27;s not dry</li>
      <li>I have really fine long hair that gets tangeled in the back of my lower neck and with this comb theres no more ripping</li>
      <li>The comb is pretty big in size, its bigger than the average combs.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was surprised how painlessly this comb removes tangles. Both my toddler and I have curly hair and this comb seems to be the answer to our prayers. It&#x27;s just what you need if you have curly hair. I can detangle even without a conditioner- Pretty painlessly.</li>
    <li> Snapped right in half, using it on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. I did put it through it&#x27;s vigors, but still, come on.</li>
    <li> I like this great comb,I use gel and it combs my hair back great,and the price can&#x27;t be beat!!! And It&#x27;s cool looking to boot!!!</li>
    <li> Great comb - the two-toned blended colors are more like a gradient shift in colors from opaque black to the translucent color not tortoise shelled like the picture.  It is still nice looking though; I got an aqua and a purple one randomly.  I bought them for the nice colors, and I definitely got two good ones.  I have hair that will seriously tangle and snarl on itself because it&#x27;s really fine.  This comb goes through wet hair without causing knots or ripping at the strands.  The tines of the comb do not have sharp edges, so it does not scratch the scalp.  I am very pleased with the quality of these combs.</li>
    <li> The comb is pretty big in size, its bigger than the average combs.  A comb is a comb what else can you expect..  Works as advertised.  Great Price.    The box amazon shipped the comb in was huge!  I don&#x27;t understand why they would ship such a small item in such a huge box.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and this comb just glides right through it. I highly recommend this item. I also love the pink and black coloring of the comb I received. This comb is sturdy, I have dropped it in the shower several times, while combing conditioner through my hair and the comb has not broken.</li>
    <li> I use it to detangle my hair after showering and it gets the job done quickly and painlessly.</li>
    <li> Got it for my girlfriend after she broke her last comb.  It works as expected, good styling, and seems to be fairly durable.  Definitely looked different than in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t matter -- function over form!</li>
    <li> Niiice detangler! The combs are wide enough apart not to snag your hair and the plastic is sturddy enough to keep it from breaking. If you don;t already use a detangler for separating your hair in the shower you should look into getting one because it will help you from yanking out a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I really looked widely for that Revlon unbreakable detangling comb. This comb would be better with more teeth and in the same materials and colors as depicted on Amazon&#x27;s website. I received a carmine red and jet black comb instead of green and white.</li>
    <li> I ordered this comb for my 4 year old daughter who has tight unruly curls to the point where her hair is constantly knotty.  Me not having any experience with this type of hair, I was told to buy a wide tooth comb because she was screaming every time I had to brush her hair.  It was a disaster every time, until I got this comb.  We would shampoo then condition in the shower and I would comb her hair out with the conditioner in, rinse and then comb it after she was dry.  What a miracle, still tears involved in the combing sometimes but wow what a difference.  I would have given this comb 5 stars but the other day when I was combing her in the shower it broke in half.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 18 months.  This time I got a similar one with a handle since this one slipped out of my hands in the shower many times.  For the price it was worth it.</li>
    <li> As I have curly hair, I&#x27;ve been advised not to brush it when dry. It seems to loosen the curl and create frizz. I&#x27;ve also been told not to brush it after a shower because wet hair is easy to break. So what do I do? My compromise is to use this detangling comb right before a shower, when my hair is at it&#x27;s oiliest, so it&#x27;s not dry but of course it&#x27;s not wet. This is very easy on my hair, I do not hear horrible little snapping noises when combing at the ends, so I believe it is less damaging. I like it, 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this comb! It is brittle, cheap plastic that broke the first time I dropped it. It also hurts when going through my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb. It works well enough. I use it when my hair is wet. I have fine hair that tangles easily. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m ripping all my hair out when I brush it out with this comb. It is plastic. One tooth busted off when I dropped it on the wood floor. But for the money, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Bury good for curly hair, doesn&#x27;t break it as other brushes</li>
    <li> my granddaughter, tenderest head ever existing, loves this comb.  instead of screeching with every trip through her curly fine beadhead, she only has a few ows.  a vast improvement for all of us.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expected this inexpensive comb to last forever at the price when I added it to my cart to meet my $25 shipping minimum, but when combing my wet curly hair it snapped in half within a week after buying.  Disappointing as the teeth are nice and far apart and comb is not made of cheap plastic.  Liked the looks, but unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t going for looks only when wanting tangle-free hair...</li>
    <li> It was exactly the comb I wanted, But, I found it at several stores at a much lower cost after I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is not a rubber comb. it is clear plastic and cool looking. I like it for wet hair that tends to tangle. Great price. I got it to make the $25 free shipping when I needed to spend just $2 more. I am glad I got it nice item and not in my local store.</li>
    <li> This detangling comb worked great in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She uses it after she washes her hair to comb through it and it doesn&#x27;t pull and hurt her head like her old one.</li>
    <li> I like this comb but I guess I prefer to use one that has a handle on it as handles make it easier to hold.  This comb tends to slip through my fingers when it gets wet.</li>
    <li> I actualy noticed more ripping of my hair with detangeling combs than i have with using a brush. But for people to like the combs better this is a pretty nice cheap one.</li>
    <li> The comb tines are perfect size, works well, inexpensive too. It&#x27;s lightweight but I&#x27;m unsure if the plastic is brittle and prone to breaking?</li>
    <li> Bought this comb as a replacement for a hard plastic detangling comb that I lost.&lt;br /&gt;This comb gets the job done--the teeth flex and bend a little bit, which didn&#x27;t happen on the previous comb I had.&lt;br /&gt;But overall it works on my thick shoulder length hair which is hard to comb when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, the \\&quot;random color\\&quot; I received was purple--my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have really fine long hair that gets tangeled in the back of my lower neck and with this comb theres no more ripping or tearing- I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this comb for my daughter&#x27;s long thick  hair. It works very well for detangling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, but I didn&#x27;t appreciate getting a random color. I paid for a specific color.</li>
    <li> Very cheap plastic and the prongs break off, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The Revlon comb was dirty and scratched. The plastic ring holding the comb to the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging was broken in several pieces, leaving me to believe this was not well cared for in the warehouse.  It is filty and I NEVER would have purchased this product in a store in the way this was presented.  I love Amazon, and it&#x27;s only a $5 comb, but this is was not acceptable quality control and I feel this particular item purchased was a waste of my money!    It is also a brittle plastic, and I would not have purchased if seen in person.</li>
    <li> This comb does work, although it just does a basic job and I don&#x27;t understand the claim that it creates \\&quot;volume\\&quot; in the hair. I see these claims advertised on combs and it seems like a gimmick to me. The plastic is somewhat cheap feeling and after a long time of use it did break a little but was still usable. I ended up losing mine though and bought a different brand. Also the design is not very visually appealing.</li>
    <li> I purchased Revlon Color Swirl Detangling Comb as an add on purchase.  I did it on a whim for a great price.  I thought to myself, \\&quot;What can I lose?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m NOT losing my hair due to breakage.  (HOORAY and Happy Dance.)&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect comb for detangling curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that enough.  THIS IS A PERFECT COMB FOR DETANGLING CURLY HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I misplace this comb I panic.  I refused to go back using wide toothed combs that tear my hair out.  I rather walk around with dirty hair hoping no will notice.  When I find it again our reunion is aweeter than a couple&#x27;s reunion after a spat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have placed Revlon Color Swirl Detangling Comb in my Amazon wish list. This is a post to all my cheap friends who are looking for a great gift for me, and other curly girls like me. BUY THIS COMB!!!</li>
    <li> Revlon RV2513 Color Swirl Detangling Comb.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon should revisit this product as it is marginally suitable for hair.  It is much too sharp for the scalp and easily breaks when it is dropped on the bathroom tile.  I purchased three of these and did not return them since I did not want to waste return postage on fragile, overpriced combs.  Instead, I placed them in the recycling bin.  The price was far too high for the product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  I have medium long thick hair and the comb is pretty much useless when my hair is wet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these combs.  The plastic comb slides through wet hair, making it far easier to deal with post-shower.  I now own two.</li>
    <li> This comb is awesome!! I have very thick long hair, and this helped get rid of the tangles with out breaking my hair. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick curly hair which is a chore to comb through every day.  I use this comb on her now and she likes it - it didn&#x27;t have any weird plastic rough edges that could get caught in her hair as others did.  This one was very smooth.  The color was nie.  My only concern, long term, is that it appears more brittle than other combs and I can foresee a tooth cracking off at some point.  We&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months and this hasn&#x27;t happened.  If it does, I&#x27;ll update the review!  It doesn&#x27;t have any give to it at all like most plastic combs.</li>
    <li> I use this comb in the shower to comb out tangles.  Works great.  Good size and weight to the comb.  It&#x27;s a sturdy comb and I don&#x27;t expect to lose any tines pulling out tough knots.  The tines aren&#x27;t sharp either, I&#x27;ve had some combs that hurt your head because they&#x27;re so sharp.  This one is nicely rounded and easy to use.  Would highly recommend to someone needing a basic comb.</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy product.  I use it every time I wash my hair and comb it out.</li>
    <li> Love this comb i couldn&#x27;t find any like it in the stores. only odd thing is it came a different color than it was pictured i got a baby blue color instead of the greenish color, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me 5 stars all around</li>
    <li> The plastic it is made of is definitely on the brittle side. My hair is not thin, but not so rough or strong either, and within less than a year, a few of the teeth have fallen off already. Because it doesn&#x27;t have a handle, it is more difficult to grab on to it, especially when your hair is still wet after a shower. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair can get tangled easily because it&#x27;s long, but at least a 1/3 of the teeth snapped out before it was even a year old.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it really.  I think the plastic is too hard so it snaps off more easily than others.  I switched to this product instead and so far it&#x27;s been great: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006O0APQO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11</li>
    <li> I Used to detangle wet curly hair&lt;br /&gt;A very smart purchase&lt;br /&gt;Durable and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canf think of anymore to say</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the plastic is so brittle, it&#x27;ll break the first time you drop it. So, unless you only plan on using it once, buy a better comb.</li>
    <li> separates tangles with easy and has a wide separation between tines. it is also very easy to clean and seems impervious to pulling out hair, so it doesn&#x27;t replace a good brush, but helps a lot before brushing</li>
