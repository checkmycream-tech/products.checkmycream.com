      <li>so comfortable, i love it</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like light purple.</li>
      <li>Really cute, a little bit lighter shade of brown than shown in the picture, but still really impressed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as plush as it looks in the picture, but not bad!</li>
      <li>I was worried if it would fit.</li>
      <li>and they fit my style</li>
      <li>Nice, well made, attractive and cozy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of glad it was brown instead of black honestly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very soft, I love this hat!</li>
      <li>Great if you can handle a month long transit time.</li>
      <li>My new hat is so soft and  nice and warm .</li>
      <li>Compared to other beenie hats I own, this one is distinctively better.</li>
      <li>I love this cap and wear it frequently.</li>
      <li>My 7 yr old daughter loves it :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very warm and cozy.</li>
      <li>but when I got it, its actually brown and its not a dark brown as it shows in the picture either its just a regular brown color but its still beautiful!</li>
      <li>The material is soft, and not too light.</li>
      <li>other than that I just love it!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Still pretty tho.  </li>
      <li>I love beanies but as far as what I was expecting it didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectations, although I am still very pleased with my purchase, I just expected more slouch less beret.</li>
      <li>Received hat today, very nice baggy beanie just as described, came way earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a nice dark brown.</li>
      <li>Good quality, thick, and pretty shade of brown.</li>
      <li>But it is nice and slouchy and tight at all.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, and it looks just like the picture.</li>
      <li>Came as expected but does not look cute on me like on the models.</li>
      <li>That part didn&#x27;t bother me as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>It is so warm and cozy.</li>
      <li>I really like my hat , and its the color brown that I wanted to match a winter coat</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
      <li>Bought this in brown, not the color that I was really expecting to look like.</li>
      <li>Its ok for the price.pretty cute not great though</li>
      <li>Oh, there is also no tag anywhere on it, so tthat&#x27;s kind of weird, but still, love wearing it.</li>
      <li>a nice loose fit, a dark brown.</li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Nice and cozy!  </li>
      <li>very soft, but looks nothing like the picture.</li>
      <li>really soft!</li>
      <li>The knit is not as large and the beanie is more of a small,  French beret style,  not at all what I was looking for,  nor what the picture shows.</li>
      <li>I will say that it took nearly a month to arrive, and no tracking at all.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like it.</li>
      <li>Soft, but don&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
      <li>Much smaller - doubt it will hold up to much wear.</li>
      <li>brown not black</li>
      <li>It smelled funny and was a lot thinner than I expected.</li>
      <li>A little skimpy, but worth what I paid for it.</li>
      <li>Shipping was much faster than expected</li>
      <li>Arrived much sooner than expected.  </li>

    <li> Loved it fit perfect just like the picture</li>
    <li> Bought this in brown, not the color that I was really expecting to look like. When you put this on, there&#x27;s a bumpy area that pops up. It&#x27;s unnoticeable though.</li>
    <li> Nice warm hat what is very stylish.  Fits like the picture.</li>
    <li> Arrived much sooner than expected.  A great hat for the price.  Like the reviews said, it is styled in the picture to look baggier than it is.  The color is a brighter brown than shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Came as expected but does not look cute on me like on the models.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and it looks just like the picture. The material is soft, and not too light. And I love the color, it&#x27;s a nice dark brown.</li>
    <li> Hat looks black in pictures but it&#x27;s more like light purple. Not nice! Besides for that, its a nice hat.</li>
    <li> Great material, however, mine came in a brown color and after waiting almost a month to receive it I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> very soft, but looks nothing like the picture. Much smaller - doubt it will hold up to much wear.</li>
    <li> I love beanies but as far as what I was expecting it didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectations, although I am still very pleased with my purchase, I just expected more slouch less beret.</li>
    <li> Regular knit hat, as pictured!</li>
    <li> Not as shown--too small. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I like the color and the style of the hat, my only complaint is that the head hole is made a little on the small side.  This means that anytime I turn my head or tilt my head up, the hat pops off.</li>
    <li> Thank you so  much for the great deal and transaction!</li>
    <li> so comfortable, i love it</li>
    <li> It does not stay on my head without an army of bobbi pins.</li>
    <li> Thinner knit than shown in offerings</li>
    <li> Wrong color but problem was resolved. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Great hat very happy with it fits perfect.</li>
    <li> I wore this hat as shown in the pic for an entire day and it never once slipped or felt like it was going to fall off. I didn&#x27;t have to pin it or anything!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! Fits perfect and I get TONS of compliments every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> This hat looks nothing like the one pictured. It is very thin and it blew off my head the other morning.  People have no integrity</li>
    <li> This was a gift &amp; my daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> fast shipping item perfect</li>
    <li> Warm winter hat for ladies! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Shipping was much faster than expected and I love my hat! It fits as shown and is made of quality material.</li>
    <li> Cutest hat. It&#x27;s not as plush as it looks in the picture, but not bad! It&#x27;s a doer!</li>
    <li> Love these hats, good quality, shipped fast, fits well!</li>
    <li> Nice and cozy!  Love them!</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Bought it for my mom, but I think I&#x27;m keeping it. My 7 yr old daughter loves it :)</li>
    <li> Nice hat, gave it to my niece as a present, she loves it and looks great.</li>
    <li> So disappointed of the color...brown not black</li>
    <li> Really cute, a little bit lighter shade of brown than shown in the picture, but still really impressed. Good quality, thick, and pretty shade of brown.</li>
    <li> This was OK.. A little skimpy, but worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Received hat today, very nice baggy beanie just as described, came way earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> seems rather small compared to picture, and I have a small head.</li>
    <li> I love mine, bought one for someone else.</li>
    <li> I love this hat. It got really cold here and I wore it arround the house. It is so warm and cozy. I love the color.  I was worried if it would fit. I do not think I have a big head. But it is nice and slouchy and tight at all. It does not feel like I am wearing a hat when it is on my head.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected! I get a lot of complements on it! I will say that I thought this hat was black but when I got it, its actually brown and its not a dark brown as it shows in the picture either its just a regular brown color but its still beautiful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very warm and cozy. I enjoy wearing it!</li>
    <li> Great if you can handle a month long transit time.</li>
    <li> The hat was very very small.</li>
    <li> I enjoy wearing them they keep my head warm and they fit my style</li>
    <li> I asked for the black beanie and received a brown one . When I tried it on the beanie looked big on me.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with how it fits and wears. I will say that it took nearly a month to arrive, and no tracking at all.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered three hats, they took over a month to ship. At one point I felt I made a mistake thinking I could&#x27;ve bought the same hat at any clothing store. I was wrong, these hat are nice and thick. Compared to other beenie hats I own, this one is distinctively better. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Most berets I have fall off easily, but this doesn&#x27;t! I love it a lot. The color is very nice.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be black and it&#x27;s brown.  Not any special kind of brown, just BROWN.  Still pretty tho.  Fits alright for the price...</li>
    <li> really soft! a nice loose fit, a dark brown.</li>
