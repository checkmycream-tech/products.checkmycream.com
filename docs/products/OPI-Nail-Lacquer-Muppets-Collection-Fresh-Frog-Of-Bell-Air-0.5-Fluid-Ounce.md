      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The wife and daughter have already had many a nail painting party with this one</li>
      <li>I love OPI.  </li>
      <li>I love the polish makes me feel like a kid again.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;d be a liiiitle better without them.</li>
      <li>I love the sparkle.</li>
      <li>But the color is great, and very sparky and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
      <li>it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>(my wife&#x27;s words), and stays one for awhile without easily chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It went on easy and was easy to maintain.  </li>
      <li>Love this Color and Sparkle, just takes a couple of coats for the  true color pay off..</li>
      <li>It has more silver glitter than what appears in the picture but will still be a fun color to wear.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see this color available that I ordered it without reading the reviews.  </li>
      <li>This color was So cool with gettin miss piggy with it for Christmas</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>It looks great over another green or black, for a nice sparkly top coat .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments because it&#x27;s not a typical color</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look right when I apply it.</li>
      <li>This product is of typical OPI quality, which is to say that it&#x27;s quite good.  </li>
      <li>also have the red Miss Piggy one :)</li>
      <li>Also, pretty for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations.</li>
      <li>this OPI nail polish is pretty.  </li>
      <li>and it came so fast!</li>
      <li>I am very picky about green nail polish and this shade was absolutely perfect since it not ony looked great with my green outfits but outfits of other colors as well.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Fresh Frog of Bell Air if you are looking for a good shade of green nail polish.</li>
      <li>It is very runny and seems to be thinned out.  </li>
      <li>and it really pops.  </li>
      <li>The color is very festive version.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a bit more green in color than what it really is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, but it had really big silver flakes in it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend OPI.</li>
      <li>better than just a matte green for a change!  </li>
      <li>only reason I give this 3/5 (and not 5/5) is because my wife prefers solid colors, and this one has a lot of sparkles that take away from the depth and apparent awe generated by a more solid finish.  </li>
      <li>Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!</li>
      <li>color is a hard to find glad I made the purchase and went with a different color and style.</li>
      <li>Mermaid&#x27;s Tears(a medium bluish green), and \\&quot;Jade is the New Black\\&quot; (a darker green which imparts depth to Fresh Frog of Bel Air).</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the glitter sinks and you&#x27;re basically applying the clear.</li>

<li> O.P.I&#x27;s Fresh Frog of Bel Air has a clear base, which makes it an excellent over layer to a single layer of O.P.I&#x27;s green shades, such as Stranger Tides (a pale green sage),</li>
<li> OPI Nail Lacquer, Jade Is The New Black, 0.5 Ounce]]</li>
<li> I needed 3 coats to really make it sparkly and it has peeled off in one piece, as other glitter nail polishes have, but not right away.  </li>
<li> This is clear polish with green and silver sparkles.  </li>
<li> Maybe this is the way the polish was intended, but it isn&#x27;t like any other OPI glitter polish I&#x27;ve used, and that includes several from the Muppets line.</li>
<li> big pieces of silver glitter with smaller green glitter!</li>
<li> grass green with larger silver glitter throughout.</li>
<li> The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
<li> I purchased this color for my wife, in addition to her other 9,281 OPI colors.  </li>
<li> Cheaper than in the store and just as I expected it to be!</li>
<li> The bottle of polish that I received in the mail was not full and seemed as if it had already been used.</li>
<li> In fact, on your toes it lasts a few weeks.  </li>
<li> If you like green</li>
<li> I used a non OPI base coat and my nails got stained an off yellow color for months requiring me to have my nails painted constantly because they looked gross.</li>
<li> This is a glittery, emerald green shade.  </li>
<li> The color is &amp;#34;Kermit&amp;#34; green.  </li>
<li> Additionally, the polish itself was very thin and had a very strong smell, so bad that my eyes were watering when I opened it.</li>
<li> but you need to apply it after a base because it will leave a very sheer look.</li>
<li> I have TONS of OPI nail polishes and this one seemed weird.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure the opi brand base coat would made a difference or not.</li>

    <li> If you like green this OPI nail polish is pretty.  Also, pretty for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted! big pieces of silver glitter with smaller green glitter! looks great :) yeah yeah</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see this color available that I ordered it without reading the reviews.  It arrived, and I immediately noticed something off about it when I unwrapped the bottle.  It is very runny and seems to be thinned out.  Maybe this is the way the polish was intended, but it isn&#x27;t like any other OPI glitter polish I&#x27;ve used, and that includes several from the Muppets line.</li>
    <li> I received the nail polish and its just as I had imagined. It&#x27;s a nice sparkly touch as a top coat!</li>
    <li> The bottle of polish that I received in the mail was not full and seemed as if it had already been used. Additionally, the polish itself was very thin and had a very strong smell, so bad that my eyes were watering when I opened it. I have TONS of OPI nail polishes and this one seemed weird. I have a feeling it was used and then thinned out with a nail polish thinner or remover. Buyer beware...</li>
    <li> This color was clearly blue. Not like the picture at all. I like it...but it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted at all.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it!!  It is a great color.  I love OPI.  I am really glad I got this color.  I highly recommend OPI.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this color for my wife, in addition to her other 9,281 OPI colors.  This product is of typical OPI quality, which is to say that it&#x27;s quite good.  It coats well (my wife&#x27;s words), and stays one for awhile without easily chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this 3/5 (and not 5/5) is because my wife prefers solid colors, and this one has a lot of sparkles that take away from the depth and apparent awe generated by a more solid finish.  However, if you like sparkles you&#x27;ll probably love this.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than in the store and just as I expected it to be! I even bought an extra one for my sister.</li>
    <li> Color was what I wanted and was perfect. I used a non OPI base coat and my nails got stained an off yellow color for months requiring me to have my nails painted constantly because they looked gross. I&#x27;m not sure the opi brand base coat would made a difference or not.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, but it had really big silver flakes in it. I think it&#x27;d be a liiiitle better without them. But the color is great, and very sparky and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
    <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
    <li> Love this Color and Sparkle, just takes a couple of coats for the  true color pay off..all in all I Love it! better than just a matte green for a change!  and it came so fast! and was expertly bubble wrapped!..so buying more! yay!</li>
    <li> The color received is not the color I ordered and is NOT the color that is shown!!! But it&#x27;s a useable color.</li>
    <li> I love the polish makes me feel like a kid again. The colors remind me of a time when the muppets were always on TV</li>
    <li> I love this polish :), it is amazing!!!!! I love the sparkle. you definitley have to use a shade of nail polish underneath it to get it to show all the sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the red Miss Piggy one :)</li>
    <li> The color is very festive version. The texture goes on well and doesn&#x27;t come out clumpy it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a hard to find glad I made the purchase and went with a different color and style.</li>
    <li> Another great OPI glitter in &amp;#34;Fresh Frog of Bell Air&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant grass green with larger silver glitter throughout. SHAKE WELL and shake periodically during application. Otherwise, the glitter sinks and you&#x27;re basically applying the clear.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I thought it would be a bit more green in color than what it really is. It has more silver glitter than what appears in the picture but will still be a fun color to wear.</li>
    <li> This is clear polish with green and silver sparkles.  The kids love it and makes for cute toes for grown ups too.</li>
    <li> I have always liked using nail polish colors that will go with my outfits.  I loved the Fresh Frog of Bell Air OPI nail color.  It goes perfectly with a great number of my outfits.

    <li> This nail lacquer has a great color but you need to apply it after a base because it will leave a very sheer look. I don´t recommend it...</li>
    <li> I bought this polish for my 30-something daughter.  She has a tattoo of all the Sesame characters around her ankle, in color, including the lamp post.  The color is &amp;#34;Kermit&amp;#34; green.  I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> The wife and daughter have already had many a nail painting party with this one and they say it has already passed the test, best brand out there!  Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!</li>
    <li> Still a totally awesome glitter polish. It looks great over another green or black, for a nice sparkly top coat .</li>
    <li> Perfect bling for the Christmas or St Patty&#x27;s Day bling. I love the glitter. The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
