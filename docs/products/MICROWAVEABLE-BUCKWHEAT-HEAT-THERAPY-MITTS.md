      <li>Nice radiating heat that lasts.</li>
      <li>keep your hands warm.</li>
      <li>just barely warm.  </li>

      <li>later they&#x27;re luke warm at best.</li>
      <li>: OK, it&#x27;s polar-vortex January now, and I&#x27;m more appreciative of these mitts than I was in August.</li>
      <li>Very nice husband put them right on.  </li>
      <li>These mitts don&#x27;t get very hot and don&#x27;t seem to do any good.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t get very warm and it does not stay very warm for long.  </li>
      <li>Mitts do not hold the heat for more than about 1 minute.</li>
      <li>The heat they do provide has alleviated my stiffness and pain more than I had anticipated.  </li>
      <li>My hands are doing much better than they have in quite awhile.  </li>
      <li>BUT I wish they had more of the buckwheat beads inside.</li>
      <li>I love these heat</li>
      <li>I wanted more heat, but they work for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li>If you prefer heat for longer, it would probably be better to use an electric heating pad on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Licensed Massage Therapist, and my clients love this product.  </li>
      <li>Glad I got them.</li>
      <li>Good item and was priced right as they are used on a as needed basis</li>
      <li>They feel warmly moist inside and stay warm for enough time to thoroughly warm my hands.</li>
      <li>I no longer expect them to provide significant therapy, but they sure do provide comfort.</li>
      <li>DO NOT exceed the 30 seconds in the directions and decrease it if you have a strong microwave.</li>
      <li>I love these so much, would be great to have a pair for my feet, thank you so much</li>
      <li>Mostly when you heat the gloves you feel a mild warmth from fabric.</li>
      <li>I had better luck in running hot water in the sink and soaking my hands in the water!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t warm up very well or hold the heat.</li>
      <li>They are a nice fit but never get warm enough.</li>
      <li>COMFORTABLE, but they don&#x27;t warm up as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
      <li>I thought about returning these, because, as so many other reviewers have already mentioned, they don&#x27;t get very warm.</li>
      <li>Nice and warm, just don&#x27;t keep them in too long.</li>
      <li>I do not think the product is worth the money!</li>
      <li>Very warm and hold the heat a long time.</li>
      <li>They feel comfy for the first couple of minutes before getting very luke warm.  </li>
      <li>These are really cool</li>
      <li>really makes my hands feel better</li>
      <li>They do provide a fair amount of warmth, but the heat dissipates rapidly requiring multiple reheats in the microwave.</li>
      <li>I have a high-powered microwave oven and it barely gets this thing warm.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased overall, but buyer beware as they will not work w x-large hands.</li>
      <li>At 60 seconds it was barely warmed than my own hand.  </li>
      <li>I kept them because they&#x27;re not very expensive, and because they do get warm enough to be better than nothing.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>When he actually finally used them he liked them.</li>
      <li>Only stayed warm 1 minute.</li>
      <li>They did not hold the heat and the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; was only slightly warm</li>
      <li>They sure are soft.</li>
      <li>Did not heat up warm enough....</li>
      <li>These mitts are large enough to fit most hands.  </li>
      <li>and it stays warm for  a very long time.</li>
      <li>As others have said they dont get really hot.  </li>
      <li>I would love to return them and get my money back</li>
      <li>Tried it several times...to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user error, or to see if it would get warmer with use.  </li>
      <li>Glad Wrap bag or similar before placing in your freezer.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>I would most definitely recommend them</li>
      <li>I just wish they stay hot longer</li>
      <li>We burned our first pair in 45 seconds.</li>
      <li>Like most of the other low rating reviews, the mitts feel so nice for about three minutes.</li>
      <li>They do seem to be the only gloves on the market with finger relief, so they certainly are better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>Great for arthritic hands, but only to use if you are sitting still, they are a bit bulky and not very practical.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t think it is worth it unless you are very sensitive to heat in the first place.  </li>
      <li>They are very relaxing and don&#x27;t get too hot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These mitts don&#x27;t get very hot and don&#x27;t seem to do any good.  I am disappointed and would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Very comforting to my hands.</li>
    <li> Handy for the joints like knees.</li>
    <li> They were shipped promptly, appear sturdy and fit my wife&#x27;s small hands and my large hands. The buckwheat filling is what warms up in the microwave and gets cold in the freezer. It seems that the amount of this filling is fairly sparse and clumps up when compared to other more expensive microwaveable heat/cold buckwheat back wraps. The result is that the mittens do not stay warm for much more than 15 minutes. If you prefer heat for longer, it would probably be better to use an electric heating pad on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;. or try to find a type of mitten/glove that can be plugged in. If you intend to use these as cold wraps, be sure to enclose them in a Gallon size Glad Wrap bag or similar before placing in your freezer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who has circulation problems and she loves her mittens.</li>
    <li> Some pockets did not have much buckwheat in them</li>
    <li> This winter the mitts have been a life saver for my girlfriend.  She takes them to work and heats them before she leaves so that her hand are warm while her car heats up.  The mitts have prevented the pain she had before because her hands were cold and achy.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I&#x27;m a Licensed Massage Therapist, and my clients love this product.  It&#x27;s currently extraordinarily cold (temperatures near 0 F), so they all appreciate the extra warmth.  I put a few drops of essential oils on the mitts to make them smell nice, too.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Did not heat up warm enough....even at the maximum time limit stated in instructions....just barely warm.  Tried it several times...to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user error, or to see if it would get warmer with use.  Returning them.</li>
    <li> This was a gift-haven&#x27;t had any complaints</li>
    <li> great gift for someone with arthritis in their hands</li>
    <li> had older set made by someone else. they worked great for YEARS, just falling apart. Bought these for wife that has a bad hand from a  car wreck. They do not warm up. They say 30 sec, tryed up to 2 mins on high in a brand new microwave oven. If you left these on the dash of our truck they would get warmer. it was not about the price as don&#x27;t care about the cost, just want them to work. We know how it should be having used this type for over 8 years. They just plain don&#x27;t work, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY&amp;#60; DO NOT BUY. I am going to try to return as they are junk.</li>
    <li> They work OK when heated in the microwave but the heat doesen&#x27;t last long.  Also after you have one on it&#x27;s hard to put on the second one.</li>
    <li> I HAVE PURCHASED THREE PAIR OF THESE GLOVES,  I HAVE ONE GLOVE LEFT...THE OTHER FIVE HAVE EITHER CAUGHT ON FIRE, OR STARTED SMOKING AND BURNT A HOLE IN THE THUMB OR BODY  OF THE GLOVE . WHEN THEY SAY TO WATCH THE GLOVES WHILE IN THE MICROWAVE THEY MEAN IT,,,YOU DONT KNOW IF THEY WILL  START A FIRE WHILE HEATING UP...I HAD TO HEAT FOR A MINUTE TO GET THE PROPER HEAT FOR USE OF THE HEATING QUALLITY OF THE GLOVES...IF THEY DIDNT SMOKE OR CATCH ON FIRE THEY WOULD BE PERFECT FOR COMFORT OF YOUR HANDS....BUCKWHEAT IS NOT SAFE TO USE IN THE MICROWAVE......</li>
    <li> Does not retain the heat.  sent it back....</li>
    <li> I have issues with the thumbs but that is my issue not the mitts.  I have neropathy in my hand so I can&#x27;t feel to get my thumb in.  I love these heat really makes my hands feel better and I can sleep with these so my hands stay warm all night.  I would most definitely recommend them</li>
    <li> Followed directions for heating the mitts in the microwave and they did not get very warm.  I had better luck in running hot water in the sink and soaking my hands in the water!</li>
    <li> Bought them for a gift and she loves them.</li>
    <li> They did not perform as advertised.  They did not hold the heat and the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; was only slightly warm</li>
    <li> These are really cool BUT I wish they had more of the buckwheat beads inside. Mostly when you heat the gloves you feel a mild warmth from fabric.</li>
    <li> this item was sent as a gift, she is very pleased.</li>
    <li> Found that these gloves require a little time in the microwave before each use as compared to the instructions. Perhaps it&#x27;s a function of the microwave oven&#x27;s power. They do provide a fair amount of warmth, but the heat dissipates rapidly requiring multiple reheats in the microwave.</li>
    <li> The order was shipped promptly and my husband is very satisfied with the mitts.  He sometimes has pain in his hands from work and these give him relief.  He just wishes they would maintain heat for a little longer.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, melted in microwave after a few uses, almost caused a fire.</li>
    <li> Very warm and hold the heat a long time. Very soothing. DO NOT exceed the 30 seconds in the directions and decrease it if you have a strong microwave. We burned our first pair in 45 seconds. They are very heavy so someone with weakness will have to rest their hands on their lap.</li>
    <li> bought for parents who suffer from arthritic hands and they both gave 5 star rating for its use and effect</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied .. They do not get warm .  I had a pair by another company which were wonderful ... These ... Do not get warm</li>
    <li> These mitts are wonderful!  They hold the heat and amazingly feel like they have &#x27;moisturized&#x27; heat after warming them in the microwave for 50 seconds.  But they also hold the heat from your hands when you put them on without warming them.  My husband has found them so comforting for his arthritic hands and fingers.  He puts them on every night when he sits down to watch tv.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough !</li>
    <li> they melted in the microwave. do not let them overlap!</li>
    <li> Use them daily.  The warmth helps my Arthritis and eases the discomfort a bit.  Glad I got them.</li>
    <li> I really like these because they do not have any added aromas. They work great and my mom loves them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  I have a high-powered microwave oven and it barely gets this thing warm.  I was trying to use it while driving to the lab for a blood draw (they have to find veins in my hands) during the winter.  I just don&#x27;t think it is worth it unless you are very sensitive to heat in the first place.  It might help hold heat a bit if you used a pad or hand-warmer or something *inside* it but it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims it will do.  Move along and look for something else.</li>
    <li> Very warm. Recommend for patients who have Raynauds Syndrome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve developed pain I suspect is arthritis in my hands at the base of each thumb.  The right is much worse than the left.  These mittens allow me to apply gentle heat, which soothes the pain.  My only complaint is that having my thumb separated by the mitten is sometimes too uncomfortable due to my particular situation.  I overcome that by putting my whole hand in the main part of the mitten.  I also wish the gloves got just a bit warmer but that may be just the way buckwheat mitts are.  I don&#x27;t want to ruin them by over-warming them in the microwave.</li>
    <li> This are a great remedy for cold hands.</li>
    <li> These were great--10 mins in the m/w snd the heat lasts--I wore them to bed one night.</li>
    <li> I just got these today and have heated them twice.  My hands are doing much better than they have in quite awhile.  As others have said they dont get really hot.  The heat they do provide has alleviated my stiffness and pain more than I had anticipated.  I am unable to use the thumbs due to the thickness of the material between the palm and thumb.  I put my hands in without using the thumb.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.  HOWEVER, depending on what your use is going to be, you should know that the manufacturer warns that the mitts are flammable.  After use they should be cooled in or on a non-flammable surface and should NOT be left on a flammable surface.</li>
    <li> Very nice husband put them right on.  They sure are soft.</li>
    <li> These did nothing for me. Heat in your microwave and less than 5minutes later they&#x27;re luke warm at best. I returned them even though they charged a 30% ripoff restocking fee.</li>
    <li> These made a fine gift, the person loves them, uses them daily.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use but they don&#x27;t get hot enough and don&#x27;t stay warm long enough. I have had other mitts that worked better.</li>
    <li> Do not buy these.  Only stayed warm 1 minute.</li>
    <li> Not only is the heat unevenly distributed, but the heat is gone within minutes. Big Disappointment.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good item and was priced right as they are used on a as needed basis</li>
    <li> These mitts were delivered promptly and would have worked well had they been a little larger. Very pleased overall, but buyer beware as they will not work w x-large hands. Ended up returning for this reason.</li>
    <li> The mitts relieved some of my pain. I wanted more heat, but they work for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> These mitts were a little bigger than I expected, but are nicely made &amp; do work.</li>
    <li> No more cold hands but still a warm heart</li>
    <li> They ARE VERYHELPFUL FOR ACHING HANDS!  LOVE THEM!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I thought about returning these, because, as so many other reviewers have already mentioned, they don&#x27;t get very warm. I kept them because they&#x27;re not very expensive, and because they do get warm enough to be better than nothing. Faint praise, I know. I have RA, and I&#x27;m also a pianist, so I was hoping for a product that might actually provide some therapeutic benefit-I don&#x27;t think these mitts are gonna do it, but we&#x27;ll see-it&#x27;s August now; ask me again in January!&lt;br /&gt;Edit: OK, it&#x27;s polar-vortex January now, and I&#x27;m more appreciative of these mitts than I was in August. I no longer expect them to provide significant therapy, but they sure do provide comfort. And when they lose their heat after only a few minutes, it&#x27;s not exactly a terrible hardship for me to nuke them again for another 60 seconds. I&#x27;ve also noticed that if I use these mitts for a few minutes immediately before playing the piano, my hands are a little more flexible and a little less painful than they would otherwise be. I think I should have given these mitts an extra star and a kinder title in my original review. Mea culpa.</li>
    <li> Great for arthritic hands, but only to use if you are sitting still, they are a bit bulky and not very practical. They would have been perfect if they could be made thinner and more flexible</li>
    <li> A lot of money for mittens that do NOT heat up much...i even put them in microwave for twice the time...not worth that kind of money..too baggy on your hands to give comfort</li>
    <li> These are great!  An inexpensive hot dry treatment for my hands.</li>
    <li> These work very well.  I actually heat them up a little longer than recommended--I think I must have a weak microwave, so some people might need to experiment like I did.  I will probably use them occasionally for my hands, but I actually use them on my feet when I go to bed to stop this aggravating toe pain I get only at night.  (I couldn&#x27;t find a similar product for feet!)  They are especially nice in the winter.  Just don&#x27;t walk on them because you&#x27;ll probably crush the barley husks!  Only put them on in the bed.  Nice radiating heat that lasts.</li>
    <li> the mitts started burning in the micorwave and we heated them for less time than they recommended, they need to learn from bed buddy. We have had two bed buddies for years and you can heat them over and again even over the recommended time and you never have a problem. Don&#x27;t buy the buckwheat mitts.</li>
    <li> My husband had neuropathy from chemotherapy. These microwavable mitts are the best thing I&#x27;ve found to help him. Thank you! They are almost as good as sunshine!</li>
    <li> feels good on my hands but doesnt hold heat well, but i still use them.</li>
    <li> These mitts were recommended by my physical therapist and are very helpful in relieving the arthritis pain in my hands.</li>
    <li> These mitts are large enough to fit most hands.  They can be microwaved for up to one minute and the resulting heat is not very warm.  With severely arthritic and painful hands, much warmer heat would be nice.  They do seem to be the only gloves on the market with finger relief, so they certainly are better than nothing.  Perhaps using them under an electric blanket would help.</li>
    <li> The mittens are great and my hands feel soooooo much better when I use them.  They are soft and just the right size to be cozy but not crowded.  My only concern is that they don&#x27;t maintain the heat quite as long as I would like--about 15 minutes.  But it is enough for me to find relief from the discomfort in my joints.</li>
    <li> Microwaveable Buckwheat Mitts, after 30 seconds in the microwave, are not too hot to touch, and are warm enough to heat up my cold hands within a minute or two.  They feel warmly moist inside and stay warm for enough time to thoroughly warm my hands.</li>
    <li> worked well for my 93 yr old mom!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed,instructions say you can only heat them for 60 seconds. They don&#x27;t warm up very well or hold the heat.</li>
    <li> These work quite well, especially if you have constantly cold hands.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my mom who has arthritis and these help to reduce the pain so she can sleep.</li>
    <li> makes my hands feel good</li>
    <li> i microwaved them for 30 seconds and one of them started smoking&lt;br /&gt;i a hesitant to try again</li>
    <li> I liked the size of mitts, can accommodate larger hands and smaller hands.  They hold heat for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Directions say do not heat in microwave for longer than 60 seconds in that timeframe it doesn&#x27;t get very warm and it does not stay very warm for long.  I do not think the product is worth the money!</li>
    <li> They feel comfy for the first couple of minutes before getting very luke warm.  I&#x27;m not going to get up every five minutes to reheat these.  Find ones that have the cherry pits.  I have one for my neck and it stays warm for  a very long time.</li>
    <li> The gloves really eases  the pain from my arthritis. They keep the heat for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Mitts do not hold the heat for more than about 1 minute. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> These mitts are wonderful! I use them for my arthritis and dry skin. I heat them up, put some lotion on my hands then slip the mitts on. They are very relaxing and don&#x27;t get too hot. I bought a pair for my aunt and she loves them too.</li>
    <li> COMFORTABLE, but they don&#x27;t warm up as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
    <li> They are a nice fit but never get warm enough. Almost as if not filled enough. Waited too long to return them.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband, who has Reynaud&#x27;s.  I should have looked at the reviews first, but they looked like the same ones sold in the VT Country Store, so I purchased them.  They don&#x27;t hold the heat for very long, and the heat level isn&#x27;t much anyway, and a seam came apart within 24 hours of first use.  We&#x27;ll keep them because it isn&#x27;t worth the trouble to return them.  Maybe he will wear them watching TV just as a padded unheated glove, or to defog the car windows.</li>
    <li> Well they are cute but useless almost.&lt;br /&gt;Not much heat at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably toss them</li>
    <li> Husband like these a lot.  I found I had to microwave longer and they didn&#x27;t seem to stay hot for long but well worth the money</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this product there are hardly any filler to heat up and warm your hands. I would love to return them and get my money back just don&#x27;t know how to go about that so...  I recommend that you eliminate this product from your site it is a complete disappointment. DON&#x27;T PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> Mitt doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and you have to remicrowave it frequently.</li>
    <li> When your hands just won&#x27;t get warm, the rest of you feels cold, too.  These mitts really warm you.</li>
    <li> I got these for my  aunt who has Reynards (sp) . Her fingertips are white and very cold. She says it feels so good to heath them up and warm up her hands..I am glad they worked!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my sore hands!</li>
    <li> I followed instructions to the letter and this barely heated up at all.  The instructions warn you not to go over 60 seconds.  At 60 seconds it was barely warmed than my own hand.  A total waste of time and money.  Apparently it works for some people--if you check the reviews--so the quality control on this product must be the worst.</li>
    <li> Great comfort on arthritic hands. And easy to heat in microwave!</li>
    <li> keep your hands warm.</li>
    <li> I love these so much, would be great to have a pair for my feet, thank you so much</li>
    <li> Great I love them they help my hands heal and feel good and look good</li>
    <li> Nice and warm, just don&#x27;t keep them in too long. They&#x27;ll start to smell burnt.</li>
    <li> I got these for my Mom, who has RA and is experiencing cramping in her hand.  She told me that the glove relieves the pain and cramping for about 1/2 hour, which is at least 1/2 hour she doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> When he actually finally used them he liked them. They make his heads feel sweaty but as I explained to him duh they HEAT therapy mittens its going to do that...holds the heat well enough.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware 1 glove burnt a hole in the finger section after 1 min in the microwave.</li>
    <li> Comments rregarding Hlow heat absorbance are correct. However it does have a therapeutic affect.</li>
    <li> They work great I just wish they stay hot longer</li>
    <li> Like most of the other low rating reviews, the mitts feel so nice for about three minutes.</li>
    <li> Good Product. A big help in soothing pain when I need to sleep.</li>
