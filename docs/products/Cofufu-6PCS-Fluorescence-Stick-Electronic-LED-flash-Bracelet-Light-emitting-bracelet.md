### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with them.</li>
      <li>Very nice, thank you!!</li>
      <li>Not all the girls have pierced ears, so they are perfect!</li>
      <li>These are great!  </li>
      <li>These earrings are very bright and stand out, which is great!  </li>
      <li>Very bright while it worked though.</li>
      <li>Love them!!</li>
      <li>These are awesome and fun and basically disposable!</li>
      <li>After I got over the surprise that these were clip-on earring, I realized that they are even better than a pierced earring anyway!</li>
      <li>For that amount of money, you are getting an amazing &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34; For your buck.</li>
      <li>Bright blinking light, great fit, going to wear these to the festival!</li>
      <li>Kinda bulky but nice coversation starter...</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>These were super bright and exacrly what i wanted.</li>
      <li>My kids love them.</li>
      <li>BRIGHT and fun.</li>
      <li>Just buy more.</li>
      <li>My daughter is so excited for these!</li>
      <li>They are very cool but not what I would ware at a night out.</li>
      <li>The clips were strong wnough to clip to our clothes and they all worked when they arrived.</li>
      <li>They work and are cheap.</li>
      <li>I bought these for a race but ended up clipping them to my shoes rather than ears because they didn&#x27;t feel secure.  </li>
      <li>cheap.</li>
      <li>These are a bit huge - like a very large pill.</li>
      <li>Received it quick and all of them worked.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use, tight clip so they don&#x27;t fall off, and super bright.  </li>
      <li>The fit of the clip is solid so they won&#x27;t slip off, and very comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>Batteries are included, and pretty shiny.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll have to keep in mind that they don&#x27;t stay on your ears very well if you&#x27;ll be moving a lot.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>these were super fun but hurt the ears a little bit because they are clip ons.</li>
      <li>They are super cool but a few things that I was not expecting; they are clip on, they are large flat lights not disguised as diamond earrings.</li>
      <li>but you could use them for other areas of your costume or for a bit of fun in your home decor for Halloween.</li>
      <li>The cool-factor of these earrings is high, so a little care and planning to ensure they remain in tact isn&#x27;t much to expect.</li>

    <li> Bright blinking light, great fit, going to wear these to the festival!</li>
    <li> These earrings are very bright and stand out, which is great!  They are rather bulky and since they are clip-ons you&#x27;ll have to keep in mind that they don&#x27;t stay on your ears very well if you&#x27;ll be moving a lot.  I bought these for a race but ended up clipping them to my shoes rather than ears because they didn&#x27;t feel secure.  I have small earlobes so this could be the issue.  Perhaps someone with big earlobes would have a different experience.</li>
    <li> they are so so big that you cannot wear them as earrings.</li>
    <li> used for glow party, lasted all night and still got power. BRIGHT and fun. cheap. must have for glow party.</li>
    <li> Received it quick and all of them worked.</li>
    <li> Kinda bulky but nice coversation starter...</li>
    <li> Batteries are included, and pretty shiny. My kids love them.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Super easy to use, tight clip so they don&#x27;t fall off, and super bright.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> They are super cool but a few things that I was not expecting; they are clip on, they are large flat lights not disguised as diamond earrings. They are very cool but not what I would ware at a night out.</li>
    <li> After I got over the surprise that these were clip-on earring, I realized that they are even better than a pierced earring anyway! I plan on using these for several things and one would be a gift bag goodie at girls bday parties. Not all the girls have pierced ears, so they are perfect! The fit of the clip is solid so they won&#x27;t slip off, and very comfortable to wear. Only issue I foresee is that to turn them off you twist the front loose to disengage the battery connection and then there is a chance the front will fall off and batteries fall out. So basically, you wear them in &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; mode all the time and when you want to turn them off, they go into a container that keeps everything together in case it comes apart. The cool-factor of these earrings is high, so a little care and planning to ensure they remain in tact isn&#x27;t much to expect. Plus, did you see the price?! For that amount of money, you are getting an amazing &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34; For your buck. Anyone who complains that these are &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; is living in la-la-land! Any further engineering for an on-off switch etc would drive the price up to 15.00 a pair. These are awesome and fun and basically disposable! Just buy more. Love them!!</li>
    <li> These are a bit huge - like a very large pill. Did not fit with what I was looking for but you could use them for other areas of your costume or for a bit of fun in your home decor for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Horribly made. Horrible material. They work and are cheap. I. Can&#x27;t give less stars. They are what they are.</li>
    <li> Very nice, thank you!!</li>
    <li> These were super bright and exacrly what i wanted. The clips were strong wnough to clip to our clothes and they all worked when they arrived. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve barely opened the package and one of the clips is broken already.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made.  Mine didn&#x27;t last through one night before it fell into pieces.  Very bright while it worked though. Won&#x27;t waste my money again.</li>
    <li> these were super fun but hurt the ears a little bit because they are clip ons. I wore them for Halloween but had to take them off before the night was over</li>
    <li> My daughter is so excited for these! She can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
