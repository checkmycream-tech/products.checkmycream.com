      <li>and I am perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>...but it still worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>Price was fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t feel or appear greasy; it provides the SPF 15</li>
      <li>This is a great daily moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
      <li>Even with 4 squirts per face &amp; neck it lasts for around 3 months, making it a great value -- especially at the Amazon price.</li>

      <li>afterwords.good job loreal for such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>The first time I put this lotion on my boyfriend told me that my face looked that that of a movie star&#x27;s. : )</li>
      <li>The product makes my skin glow and its velvety texture is light and it doesn&#x27;t take much to use on your skin.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price</li>
      <li>This is nice daily moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>One that is a replacement for this old favorite.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a soft feel, evens my complexion, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and healthy without an oily feel to it.</li>
      <li>If I am going out I put this on first, then pile on cool-touch Neutrogena SPF 55, then I am ok for several hours</li>
      <li>first putting this on before I go out</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>I have noticed they are better but not totally gone</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and received within timeframe.</li>
      <li>It shrunk those pesky pores and left a shimmer of it&#x27;s magic wherever it touched.</li>
      <li>First off, the reason why I started using this was because it was a gift.</li>
      <li>I was trying different items and your prices were so much better than the store even with a coupon.</li>
      <li>I have been unable to find it in retail stores, so I&#x27;m very happy to get it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>It makes my face SUPER SOFT!</li>
      <li>First of all I am very angry,Why you send me the goods are expired cosmetics?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now and, along with the loreal serum concentrate and ROC under eye correxion, the fine lines I was starting to get from the 11 years I smoked cigarettes (I quit now and am 26) around my eyes and mouth have pretty much disappeared.</li>
      <li>Your company&#x27;s reputation is so poor?I really angry,How do you deal with this problem?Selling expired products too hateful</li>
      <li>I was really upset when it came off the market.</li>
      <li>And the results are nothing short of fantastic.</li>
      <li>The Youth Code product has a higher SPF of 25, but is oilier, and does not firm the skin tone as well.</li>
      <li>No wonder the bottles are expired.&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal pulled this item so no new stock would be available.</li>
      <li>I used to be so angry of my T-zone with oil and many acnes on it,but after a month using this product,my acnes are nearly disappeared and my skin is like silk with smoothly and tighter-skin feeling,just as decribed!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try the new product and review it separately as Youth Code etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obvious, it contains alcohol, so be aware of this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The following is my review, keep in mind a few things about me: I have lupus, my skin is dry, oily on the T-zone AND sensitive, so it is a challenge to find good</li>
      <li>I am 80 trs old and look like 50.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, we are talking clinical, because I have lupus.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, L&#x27;Oreal pulled it, replacing it with Youth Code, which is just not as good.</li>
      <li>I highly doubt you will be able to find anything else since L&#x27;oreal discontinued this line and tried to replace it by Youth Code or something of the sort, which sounds worse than this</li>
      <li>(so I am not a total eating-clean freak or something), I don&#x27;t drink normal soda if I can help it</li>
      <li>As some of you will point out, I shouldn&#x27;t be using this anyway because I am only 28, although I am almost 30, but I am NOT in my early 20s and was prone to acne when young</li>
      <li>Needless to say it gives you an amazing, not-too-obvious glow.</li>
      <li>Also, the pump broke, probably because the stock was old and not stored properly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it feels so smooth when applying it on my skin. i really love this stuff and will continue to purchase it. i&#x27;ve looked in stores but cant seem to find this caliber of product</li>
    <li> The first time I put this lotion on my boyfriend told me that my face looked that that of a movie star&#x27;s. : ) Needless to say it gives you an amazing, not-too-obvious glow. It makes my face SUPER SOFT! Like a baby&#x27;s bottom. It does a great job protecting from mild daily exposure to UV from walking outdoors. Superb product for not being too fancy. Great for faces prone to acne as it won&#x27;t clog, also it is suitable for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now and, along with the loreal serum concentrate and ROC under eye correxion, the fine lines I was starting to get from the 11 years I smoked cigarettes (I quit now and am 26) around my eyes and mouth have pretty much disappeared.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this moisturizer go on absorbs leaving my face comfortable and not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great daily moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used for years. Even with 4 squirts per face &amp; neck it lasts for around 3 months, making it a great value -- especially at the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> The cosmetics had expired,I have buy 3 products in  Gregory S Parks.All of them had expired. The code are FD221AAV  FF155  FC363.  If you don&#x27;t believe meyou must have a try!!!!</li>
    <li> In my land of giant pores, there finally came a savior in a tube. It shrunk those pesky pores and left a shimmer of it&#x27;s magic wherever it touched. Magic in a bottle.</li>
    <li> First off, the reason why I started using this was because it was a gift. I am 28 now and have lupus, which affects skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun. Before I got sick I was using this and I only use it when I go out or I am by a window for too long. The following is my review, keep in mind a few things about me: I have lupus, my skin is dry, oily on the T-zone AND sensitive, so it is a challenge to find good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A small note to the people who bought expired products, I bought this years ago, since it is no longer in the market and have been using the expired product and I am perfectly fine. I highly doubt you will be able to find anything else since L&#x27;oreal discontinued this line and tried to replace it by Youth Code or something of the sort, which sounds worse than this is and I have zero desire to try (if anyone has any recommendations though I appreciate it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so the PROS---------:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is a good all-around product. It does moisturize/hydrate and firms the skin, gives it an all around glow like it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It protects from the sun to the SPF 15 it claims&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It lasts for a LONG time, I have been using this for years, not consistently since I don&#x27;t go out everyday (at night sometimes I use the companion Skin Genesis without the SPF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does not make me break out. As some of you will point out, I shouldn&#x27;t be using this anyway because I am only 28, although I am almost 30, but I am NOT in my early 20s and was prone to acne when young so I have a lot of scars and such. I have noticed they are better but not totally gone, I still have brown spots, however, this seems to minimize their past effect. If anyone knows of a good brown-spot product for ultra-sensitive skin let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONS----------------:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have extremely sensitive skin, we are talking clinical, because I have lupus. If I am sweaty or have done something to be exposed to the sun and don&#x27;t cleanmy face first putting this on before I go out it DOES burn. It&#x27;s obvious, it contains alcohol, so be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It only protects within a limited SPF range, which is 15 SPF. If I am going out I put this on first, then pile on cool-touch Neutrogena SPF 55, then I am ok for several hours but then I have to reapply sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have recently stopped eating crap (8-9 months ago or so) which means I bake my own treats and only have a snack or two over the weekend (so I am not a total eating-clean freak or something), I don&#x27;t drink normal soda if I can help it (I drink diet hansen&#x27;s coke) and drink LOTS of water and herbal tea, which has resulted in me virtually having almost no breakouts at all. I am saying I no longer have to use any salycic acid (acne preventer) cleansers at all whatsoever, which made my face burn even more while putting on this cream and going out into the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am trying to say is that perhaps the combination of taking better care of my body has something to do with me not breaking out anymore more than the effectiveness of this lotion. Just something to consider if you have tried this and break out, otherwise then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY----------------:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS a good product, I lucked out that this was the first skin regimen I have ever tried thanks to it being a gift. I want to continue to use this, but I know they have discontinued it and eventually will have to replace it with something. If anyone has replaced this product successfully with another please comment. Until then, Skin Genesis it is.</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic product!  I have been unable to find it in retail stores, so I&#x27;m very happy to get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this face lotion because of a medication interaction I&#x27;m avoiding (this lotion is salicylate-free). I really like it! It goes on smoothly but doesn&#x27;t feel or appear greasy; it provides the SPF 15 it claims; and it smells great - a light, perfumy scent.    The only drawback is the price for what you get. The actual container is smaller than the bottle appears - it&#x27;s one of those fake-bottom packages. Seems like a steep price for a couple oz. of lotion.</li>
    <li> This is nice daily moisturizer.  I love the Skin Genesis line- it&#x27;s all good quality for a great price.  It makes my skin feel nice and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two months now. And the results are nothing short of fantastic. Whatever technology is used in this product it works well. I have noticed a drastic improvement in my skin texture and apperaance. I also recommended this product to my sister and she loves it. It transformed her face. This is a must have in my skin products. five stars. And it deserves twice that.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  It is a Christmas Gift for my daughter and she only uses this L&#x27;Oreal product.  Price was fantastic.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> The product arrived about 1-2 months before the expiration on product. Also, the pump broke, probably because the stock was old and not stored properly. You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Very happy that I was able to find this item on Amazon.  Cannot find in stores anymore as L&#x27;Oreal must have discontinued this product. Exactly what I wanted and received within timeframe.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001DNZHZG L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Oil-Free Lotion 1.7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a product that does what it is supposed to! I used this moisturizer every day on my face. I is wonderful. It gives my skin a soft feel, evens my complexion, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and healthy without an oily feel to it. Great on sensitive skin. I was really upset when it came off the market. Luckily I am able to find it here on Amazon for a great price. Try it for a week, and you will see a difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jenn  :)</li>
    <li> ...but it still worked just fine.  Did not smell great but not too terrible either.  I would use it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. Unfortunately, L&#x27;Oreal pulled it, replacing it with Youth Code, which is just not as good. The Youth Code product has a higher SPF of 25, but is oilier, and does not firm the skin tone as well.</li>
    <li> I love it. It provides almost a matte finish on skin which is good for oily skin plus spf 15...</li>
    <li> I apply on damp face and neck morning and night...before I use any makeup....I am 80 trs old and look like 50.  helps to keep the wrinkles under control....</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  Had a friend that recommended it and getting this loreal prodct for the price listed made me very HAPPY!</li>
    <li> First of all I am very angry,Why you send me the goods are expired cosmetics? Most of them are 2008 product,You let me how to use ?Your company&#x27;s reputation is so poor?I really angry,How do you deal with this problem?Selling expired products too hateful</li>
    <li> this product was okay. I was trying different items and your prices were so much better than the store even with a coupon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t worry too much about the fake bottom of this product if you have used L&#x27;Oreal before,because this item worth your money. I used to be so angry of my T-zone with oil and many acnes on it,but after a month using this product,my acnes are nearly disappeared and my skin is like silk with smoothly and tighter-skin feeling,just as decribed!</li>
    <li> The product makes my skin glow and its velvety texture is light and it doesn&#x27;t take much to use on your skin.  It also minimizes my pores and makes my skin smooth.  I love it.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASE BUT THOUGHT HEY SINCE PEOPLE HAVE BROUGHT IT UP BEFORE THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY IT CAN HAPPEN TO ME, NOPE THE MOISTORIZER IS EXPIRED IT ALSO INCLUDED EXPIRED COUPONS FROM 2009.</li>
    <li> The cosmetics had expired,I have buy 2 products in Gregory S Parks.All of them had expired. L&#x27;OREAL .The code is：FD134AAU</li>
    <li> No wonder the bottles are expired.&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal pulled this item so no new stock would be available. The products are leftovers from at least two years ago being sold a discount price on Amazon.  Expired bottles are all that&#x27;s left probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been replaced at least in name with Youth Code Skin Genesis.  There are two formulas. One that is a replacement for this old favorite. And another formula that supposedly clears discolorations and spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try the new product and review it separately as Youth Code etc.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and is the only lotion I have been able to use that doesn&#x27;t make me oily or itch afterwords.good job loreal for such an amazing product! Well worth the price</li>
    <li> I like i lot, since i try last year now i always buy it it makes my skin silk ....</li>
</ol>
