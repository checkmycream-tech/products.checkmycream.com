      <li>Great comb to keep in the shower.</li>

      <li>Glad I purchased this!</li>
      <li>Love this comb!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>All of the teeth (which are mounted on their own strip of plastic) just snapped off in one piece.</li>
      <li>I got a purple comb and it&#x27;s been so nice.</li>
      <li>My hair breaks easily and this comb does a good job of de-tangling without snagging on knots.</li>
      <li>Comfy to hold, moves through the hair with ease, feels good on my scalp, and hangs securely.</li>
      <li>Luckily, rose-pink was a good color for one of my bathrooms.</li>
      <li>Love the shower caddy  feature</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and has a great hook that can hang just about anywhere.</li>
      <li>Wish it had more   OOMPH though.</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this comb, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>If it was more of a rubberry plastic, I think it would hold up a lot better.  </li>
      <li>It was OK while it lasted.  </li>
      <li>I have never had a better shower comb.</li>
      <li>Love these combs, if your hair tangles this is</li>
      <li>I have switched over to the Conair shower comb, which feels more durable</li>

      <li>Perfect for getting the tangles out of my long, curly hair.</li>
      <li>and I love how strong it is.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect comb for getting the snarls out of your hair when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to hold,plus</li>
      <li>Liked this product - reasonable price, does what it says.</li>
      <li>My hair is virtually tangle free when I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Color is too important to me.</li>
      <li>Great with long hair</li>
      <li>The spacing of the teeth is good for someone with curly hair, it grips fairly securely in your hand, and although the hook appears to be &amp;#34;iffy,&amp;#34; it does actually stay hung up without falling in to the tub.</li>
      <li>This comb is a great, durable, wide toothed comb.</li>
      <li>Much more gentle on my hair that way.</li>
      <li>It broke the very first time I used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She had much better luck with the &#x27;Tangle Teezer Original Professional Detangling Brush&#x27;</li>
      <li>so   my needs are especially high.  </li>
      <li>It also massages my scalp and feels good unlike other combs and brushes that have pointier teeth.</li>
      <li>All the teeth just ripped right off.</li>
      <li>I love that its got wide teeth which make it easy to use and painless.</li>
      <li>Perfect comb for my 4b natural African American hair.</li>
      <li>This is a good little investment if you struggle with tangled hair.</li>
      <li>the plastic   is light in the hand, not heavy.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what&#x27;s needed to get the tangles out.</li>
      <li>Nice sturdy comb for wet hair.</li>
      <li>Very durable!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t ever recall having something as simple as this break so easily.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the manufacturers.</li>
      <li>My hair is really curly and with this comb I don&#x27;t have to ever brush my hair.</li>
      <li>I have had THREE of these combs break on me over the last year (one broke, Goody sent me a free replacement one, that one broke, etc.)</li>
      <li>My hair is so much easier to deal with, not having to struggle with a brush.</li>
      <li>I love this comb; I have it in two other colors.</li>
      <li>The only problem was when my last one broke after using it for more than a year</li>
      <li>could live without it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t suppose my hair is a big challenge for this comb since it is fine and thin, but given that, I love this comb.</li>
      <li>purchase choice, the manufacturer and Amazon do not expect it to have a long useful life.</li>
      <li>Bought it to replace another one exactly the same, which I broke.</li>
      <li>Nice comb for natural hair 4b not good for detangling kinky wigs.</li>
      <li>Bends with snags in my hair - but doesn&#x27;t clear them.   </li>
      <li>and so far is holding up for me.</li>
      <li>It worked great for about two months until thin spine broke in a few places.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy duty last forever comb,   </li>
      <li>This comb helps distributes the conditioner and the wide tooth helps to gently detangle.  </li>
      <li>The tines are not   particularly long.  </li>

<li> This comb helps distributes the conditioner and the wide tooth helps to gently detangle.  </li>
<li> The tines are not   particularly long.  </li>
<li> Now I use about a half to a third of my normal application each time I wash my hair, run the comb through it and rinse it out the very last before I get out of the shower.</li>
<li> Came in a different color than pictured, but I don&#x27;t care about the color as long as the product works well--and it does!</li>
<li> However, I am deducting a star because instead of getting a white comb, as pictured, I got a medium pink color.</li>
<li> She has long thick straight hair.  </li>
<li> They have all broken in the exact same way: one or two teeth break off</li>
<li> The comb is sturdy and the teeth are wide enough apart that it goes through my wet hair with a minimum of work.</li>
<li> The inner spine broke after   about a year of use (of my previous one)</li>
<li> Got a pink one and it is for my son.  </li>
<li> I have thin, stick straight, shoulder length hair -</li>
<li> It worked well for a few months but recently broke while I was using it in the shower.</li>
<li> , i use it for a couple of days with the missing teeth, then the entire &#x27;row&#x27; of teeth snaps off from the handle.</li>
<li> not sure how it&#x27;s different than another comb</li>
<li> I have thick long hair</li>
<li> I have thick, long wavy hair and before purchasing this comb, I was going through a lot of conditioner,</li>
<li> Its design has a little give, warning me of knots before I break any hair.</li>
<li> Bought in late December - broken in early March.</li>
<li> the tooth started braking off just after two used in combing my hair, complete waste... additionally I received the wrong color.</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> I have very curly thick hair and have struggled with painful tangles.  </li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t even pulling hard when it snapped, which says something about the quality of the plastic.</li>
<li> I have extremely thick hair</li>
<li> so i do not recomend it for those with thick hair.</li>
<li> He was not happy with the color.</li>
<li> The plastic used for this comb is too brittle for pressure that the thin spine is subjected to in detangling.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this style of the Goody comb again - there is something wrong with the design of the teeth/the way the teeth attach to the handle.</li>
<li> Painful to use on my kids.</li>
<li> Broke my comb :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Liked this product - reasonable price, does what it says. But the comb snapped in two after 3 months. I wasn&#x27;t even pulling hard when it snapped, which says something about the quality of the plastic. I bought another one and it&#x27;s been a couple of months. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t knock my socks off.  Like the hook on the end.   Bends with snags in my hair - but doesn&#x27;t clear them.   It&#x27;s a good shower comb, I have waist length hair so   my needs are especially high.  The tines are not   particularly long.  The inner spine broke after   about a year of use (of my previous one) so I ordered   this one.  It&#x27;s not a heavy duty last forever comb,   but it&#x27;s a comb.  There are no seems and the plastic   is light in the hand, not heavy.  Wish it had more   OOMPH though.</li>
    <li> Great with long hair and it&#x27;s easy to hold,plus the hook let&#x27;s you keep it in the shower ---- out of the way  when not in use.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a retail store for my daughter.  She has long thick straight hair.  It worked great for about two months until thin spine broke in a few places.  The plastic used for this comb is too brittle for pressure that the thin spine is subjected to in detangling.  If it was more of a rubberry plastic, I think it would hold up a lot better.  I guess since this has a &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; purchase choice, the manufacturer and Amazon do not expect it to have a long useful life.</li>
    <li> the tooth started braking off just after two used in combing my hair, complete waste... additionally I received the wrong color.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Bought it to replace another one exactly the same, which I broke. I Love it. Thanks to the manufacturers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suppose my hair is a big challenge for this comb since it is fine and thin, but given that, I love this comb. Comfy to hold, moves through the hair with ease, feels good on my scalp, and hangs securely. I have never had a better shower comb. However, I am deducting a star because instead of getting a white comb, as pictured, I got a medium pink color. In fact, I ordered two and they were both this color.I never buy anything that says &amp;#34;assorted colors -- let us choose&amp;#34; -- never. Color is too important to me. This product didn&#x27;t mention color so I assumed it was &amp;#34;as shown&amp;#34;. Luckily, rose-pink was a good color for one of my bathrooms. So I now have one and a spare, instead of one in each bathroom.</li>
    <li> I got a purple comb and it&#x27;s been so nice. I keep it hanging in the shower. My hair is really curly and with this comb I don&#x27;t have to ever brush my hair. I just untangle all my curls while I have the conditioner in my hair and it is great. It also massages my scalp and feels good unlike other combs and brushes that have pointier teeth. This is a good little investment if you struggle with tangled hair.</li>
    <li> I have had THREE of these combs break on me over the last year (one broke, Goody sent me a free replacement one, that one broke, etc.) They have all broken in the exact same way: one or two teeth break off, i use it for a couple of days with the missing teeth, then the entire &#x27;row&#x27; of teeth snaps off from the handle. I have thin, stick straight, shoulder length hair - so, no curls or length or anything that this comb is fighting through. I have switched over to the Conair shower comb, which feels more durable and so far is holding up for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this style of the Goody comb again - there is something wrong with the design of the teeth/the way the teeth attach to the handle.</li>
    <li> Painful to use on my kids.</li>
    <li> Love these combs, if your hair tangles this is a must have!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what&#x27;s needed to get the tangles out.</li>
    <li> I have very curly thick hair and have struggled with painful tangles.  This comb helps distributes the conditioner and the wide tooth helps to gently detangle.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It broke the very first time I used. I don&#x27;t even have a lot of hair and it still broke!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect comb for getting the snarls out of your hair when it&#x27;s wet.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Got a pink one and it is for my son.  He was not happy with the color.</li>
    <li> It worked well for a few months but recently broke while I was using it in the shower. Looks like I will be trying out a different comb as my replacement.</li>
    <li> Love this comb! Perfect for getting the tangles out of my long, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Broke within two weeks of using it. I have thick long hair so i do not recomend it for those with thick hair. All the teeth just ripped right off.</li>
    <li> Perfect comb for my 4b natural African American hair. Love the shower caddy  feature and I love how strong it is.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy comb for wet hair. My hair breaks easily and this comb does a good job of de-tangling without snagging on knots.</li>
    <li> Nice comb for natural hair 4b not good for detangling kinky wigs. Broke my comb :(</li>
    <li> could live without it. not sure how it&#x27;s different than another comb</li>
    <li> Just what you&#x27;d expect. Great quality for a great price! Came in a different color than pictured, but I don&#x27;t care about the color as long as the product works well--and it does!</li>
    <li> I love this comb; I have it in two other colors. It&#x27;s great to hang in the shower if you comb your hair out after using conditioner like I do. I cannot recommend this comb enough. The only problem was when my last one broke after using it for more than a year I could not find it in stores and therefore had to order it online. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My daughter used this in the shower.  I thought I heard something as I walked by the bathroom door...it was her saying ouch repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had much better luck with the &#x27;Tangle Teezer Original Professional Detangling Brush&#x27;</li>
    <li> I read tons of reviews for shower combs. My big priorities were that it wouldn&#x27;t break and wouldn&#x27;t snag my hair. I&#x27;m very happy with this comb, especially for the price. The spacing of the teeth is good for someone with curly hair, it grips fairly securely in your hand, and although the hook appears to be &amp;#34;iffy,&amp;#34; it does actually stay hung up without falling in to the tub.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this comb. Its design has a little give, warning me of knots before I break any hair.</li>
    <li> It was OK while it lasted.  I have extremely thick hair and it broke after a couple months.</li>
    <li> Very nice comb! Gets through my tangley hair with no problems! Very durable! Glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I use it every time I wash my hair now instead of rubbing/scrubbing my hair together. My hair is virtually tangle free when I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought in late December - broken in early March. What a waste of money. Do not buy. I don&#x27;t ever recall having something as simple as this break so easily. All of the teeth (which are mounted on their own strip of plastic) just snapped off in one piece. Such a shame for &#x27;Goody&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> Great comb to keep in the shower. After conditioning my hair I will sometimes use this wide-toothed comb to help kepp tangles away. Much more gentle on my hair that way.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long wavy hair and before purchasing this comb, I was going through a lot of conditioner, 2 bottles for every 1 bottle of shampoo. Now I use about a half to a third of my normal application each time I wash my hair, run the comb through it and rinse it out the very last before I get out of the shower. My hair is so much easier to deal with, not having to struggle with a brush. The comb is sturdy and the teeth are wide enough apart that it goes through my wet hair with a minimum of work.</li>
    <li> This comb is a great, durable, wide toothed comb. No snaggy-edges!</li>
    <li> The ouchless shower comb is great to keep hanging inside the shower. It&#x27;s very sturdy and has a great hook that can hang just about anywhere. I love that its got wide teeth which make it easy to use and painless. Absolutely a great idea for combing through conditioner in your hair. Not only will it spread it evenly but it will get the tangles out before you even get out of the shower!</li>
