      <li>I received my bottle free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is based solely on my experience having used it.</li>
      <li>I did receive this product for free to review my unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of the oil, replicated from the Alligators uncanny oils that heal and soothe most major skin ailments.</li>
      <li>however I prefer the natural look than if they added fragrances or  dyes to make it look nice.</li>

      <li>Those, of course, were the first spots i thought to try it on when I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY REVIEW.</li>
      <li>what powerful of a product it really was.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using anything like this before.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and has done wonders soothing a sun burn that I got over the 4th of July weekend.</li>
      <li>First, alligator oil....whats that gonna smell like?</li>
      <li>When I first received the alligator oil</li>
      <li>so i try to stay away from products that only hurt my skin and so far i have to say that i&#x27;m loving this product.</li>
      <li>i recived this product for free for exchange of my honest opinion, at first i would have to say when i first recived the box i was confused.</li>
      <li>I will definitely  buy this  product and would highly recommend  it:)</li>
      <li>It does however make my skin feel super soft.</li>
      <li>Easy to coat a kids back with it, or just focus the oil.</li>
      <li>the first thing I had to do was smell it and you can smell the lavender; the scent isn&#x27;t overly strong and pretty much goes away after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>I woke up and my face was much smoother and even toned.</li>
      <li>It is oily so you never need to use that much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried oils that didn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
      <li>I am on the search for oils to moisturize my skin instead of lotion, and my boyfriend works in Construction which causes much skin irritation.</li>
      <li>so you do not need much.</li>
      <li>This product feels great when apply ed and a little Goes A LONG way!!</li>
      <li>I would highly reccomend it, not just for the moisturizing properties but also the healing properties.</li>
      <li>I hope you found this information helpful for you.extremely pleased with this product and with one tiny drop stretching so far plus the fact that I only need it here</li>
      <li>I am pretty amazed at how fast I saw results for that patch, only 2 applications!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and with one tiny drop stretching so far plus the fact that I only need it here</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this product for a week ( Free in-exchange for a review ), I like that it moisturizes my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I also was able to try this on a rash that I had and was in utter shock when by the next day it was already starting to heal.</li>
      <li>So far my skins is softer!</li>
      <li>Tons of these reviews are fake/canned using almost exactly the same terminology.</li>
      <li>That being said the odor does go away quickly and the fact that this  product  is ridding  me of this stubburrn dry skin far out ways the odor.</li>
      <li>The ingrown I am getting is smaller in size but still there so I am not sure if that was from the alligator oil or if it&#x27;s going away on its own</li>
      <li>I love that fact that this alligator oil comes with no just a dropper but also a spray pump so you can actually have options instead of being stuck with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed a little on my hands and rubbed it into my skin and my nails.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this alligator oil isn&#x27;t oily feeling and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel sticky at all.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know really if it&#x27;s helping with the actual healing process or not.</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>It only takes a little bit and it goes a long ways and it is packed full of vitamins and other healthy ingredients for your skin.</li>
      <li>My head isn&#x27;t flaking anymore on that patch although it is still dry, I think a few more applications will do the trick.</li>
      <li>I noticed the color immediately, it&#x27;s kind of a thick gross yellow color, not something I would generally look at and want to put on my skin</li>
      <li>The lavender doesn&#x27;t really cover the other ingredients smell.</li>
      <li>It does have a slight odd scent but the scent is so light that it does not bother me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Never heard of this before . I tried it and really liked it . I will order more for sure . I did receive this product for free to review my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil and it works well with your skin for so many purposes. It is very light and not a heavy oil. It spreads nicely and absorbs nicely into your skin without any issues. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and has done wonders soothing a sun burn that I got over the 4th of July weekend. It only takes a little bit and it goes a long ways and it is packed full of vitamins and other healthy ingredients for your skin. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this product when I signed up to try it for free (in exchange for a review), but I had no idea what powerful of a product it really was. I love the idea of the oil, replicated from the Alligators uncanny oils that heal and soothe most major skin ailments. I am on the search for oils to moisturize my skin instead of lotion, and my boyfriend works in Construction which causes much skin irritation. He gets blisters, heat rashes, cuts, burns, you name it. I was happy to see in the package a spray nozzle - this is an under-utilized tool for oils and serums! The dropper can be messy (especially if left in the hands of a man, lol), and I have had bad experiences with pressure building in the bottle and the dropper actually exploding, and spreading oils all over my walls and carpets. The spray nozzle made it as simple as possible for my boyfriend. We both used some, me on my arm for moisture and him on his underarm for heat rash. By the next morning his heat rash was already decreasing, I was amazed!! The product itself has a very light, nice scent to it and absorbs into the skin great, it does not leave it greasy or oily like other serums. I would highly reccomend it, not just for the moisturizing properties but also the healing properties. My boyfriend has also enjoyed telling his buddies he has been using alligator oil to heal his wounds, haha..great job Caimon Oil!!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would like this product. I am not a big fan of oils, but I decided I would give this a try. My kids suffer from acne, and I have dry skin on my face and feet. So, I applied this last night to my eldest sons back. This morning it&#x27;s half cleared. It&#x27;s not a miracle oil, but it&#x27;s pretty awesome. I woke up and my face was much smoother and even toned. The callus on my foot was softer and smoother as well. The smell, is a little funky. The lavender doesn&#x27;t really cover the other ingredients smell. It&#x27;s not foul, it just takes a bit to get us to. I love that the box comes with a dropper and a spray top. Easy to coat a kids back with it, or just focus the oil. I think we are really going to like this oil!!</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning over the past 2 years due to breakage and my scalp is often very dry. I purchased this product as hoping all the great reviews were true even though they seemed too good to be true. Well they are! My hair is noticeably healthier and thicker after only a few applications and my scalp is healthier too. I am very impressed with this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tons of these reviews are fake/canned using almost exactly the same terminology. Who can take a product like this seriously?</li>
    <li> This is made out of dead alligators.</li>
    <li> i recived this product for free for exchange of my honest opinion, at first i would have to say when i first recived the box i was confused. there is no instructions on the box or bottle, or what it can and can not be used for. my daughter has had a wart on her hand for a few days i figured what can it hurt to try it out. i was not expecting it to actually heal the wart but it in fact did just that. it took a few days before noticing a difference and everytime it was used on my daughters hand she complained that it smelled which it did until it dried but this is defintly a product i will be buying again. alittle goes a long way with this bottle.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer  product was received  for my unbiased  review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this  oil for a week on a patch of  really dry skin on my  elbow,  it has been there for well over a year and nothing I&#x27;ve  tried  has been able to rid me of it. After using the oil for only three days it is almost gone, the skin is must softer now. You don&#x27;t  have to use a lot  either, a little drop is all it takes. The only thing I  didn&#x27;t  care for is the smell  it does not smell like  lavender  at all and is not pleasant.  That being said the odor does go away quickly and the fact that this  product  is ridding  me of this stubburrn dry skin far out ways the odor. I will definitely  buy this  product and would highly recommend  it:)</li>
    <li> This is my first time using anything like this before. It was a little weird at first to think of myself putting some oil from alligators or caimans on my body. However, after the initial shock, I decided to try it and I was pleasantly surprised. This oil does go on oily so you do not need much. I put it on some scrapes that I had on my hand from yard work. My scrapes healed nicely and quickly. I am not sure if it was due to this oil though or just a coincidence. I have applied this to some very dry patches that I have, as well. This has helped the dryness a lot. In fact, they don&#x27;t look dry anymore.  I use very little each time. It is oily so you never need to use that much. It does have a slight odd scent but the scent is so light that it does not bother me. I am looking forward to using this more and cannot wait to see the results. I was provided a sample for quality and testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I had heard wonderful things about this product and then I was given the chance to  received this product in exchanged for my unbiased review. This product works wonders. My son suffers from serve eczema and we have tried everything looking for a cure. The folds of his arms and legs are always red and puffy and the little guy constantly is itching. I put a small amount on his arm(I wanted to test it before I rubbed it all over him) before bed and to my surprise the next morning his arm was completely cleared. I went ahead and put it on his other arm and both legs and his eczema is gone!! So thankful I got to test this product!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to expect when receiving this oil but was eager to try it because the logic in using alligator oil made sense that it could help with the various skin conditions like it claims. I was impressed by the packaging, a very classy looking blue glass bottle in a nice simple branded box. Very pretty. I&#x27;ve read some others&#x27; reviews and so once I opened the bottle I expected to be taken aback by an overpowering stink of alligator but there wasn&#x27;t hardly any smell at all, and the smell I did get did not remind me of fish or reptile in any way. Since I thought for sure it must have been that my nose just isn&#x27;t very sensitive I had both of my children and my boyfriend smell the dropper and none of them said they could smell anything like that either. So from my experience the smell was not an issue at all. I noticed the color immediately, it&#x27;s kind of a thick gross yellow color, not something I would generally look at and want to put on my skin however I prefer the natural look than if they added fragrances or  dyes to make it look nice. A tiny drop goes a Very long way. I used about 2 drops on the crown of my head where I have some psoriasis issues, a drop on the base of my head where I had a huge ingrown hair or pimple trying to fester, and one drop on a cut I have on my arm. My head isn&#x27;t flaking anymore on that patch although it is still dry, I think a few more applications will do the trick. I am pretty amazed at how fast I saw results for that patch, only 2 applications! The ingrown I am getting is smaller in size but still there so I am not sure if that was from the alligator oil or if it&#x27;s going away on its own but since I haven&#x27;t opened it or anything I like to think it&#x27;s the oil. As far as my arm is concerned, ithe cut was small to begin with but did have some redness around it. Its now flesh colored around the wound so I think it has killed the infection but I don&#x27;t know really if it&#x27;s helping with the actual healing process or not. All in all I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product and with one tiny drop stretching so far plus the fact that I only need it here and there I believe this bottle is going to last me a very long time. I received my bottle free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is based solely on my experience having used it. I Would recommend trying alligator oil and actually plan to take it to my sister to try on my nephews eczema. Fantastic product! I hope you found this information helpful for you.extremely pleased with this product and with one tiny drop stretching so far plus the fact that I only need it here and there I believe this bottle is going to last me a very long time.

    <li> This oil is super moisturizing ! I had never heard of alligator oil before, but when offered the chance to review this item I was excited ! I used it on my face instead of moisturizer daily and noticed the effects ! My skin is nice and hydrated and not overly oily !! Awesome product</li>
    <li> I Really Love this Product . I apply to a few little breakouts i have here and there and I clears them up practically over night without leaving skin oily , feeling heavy or clogging up pores. I went to the beach and my Face Always gets so Sunburnt even when I apply sunblock every 45 minutes. I put the Caimon Alligator Oil on my face and the next morning I had a nice Sun kissed glow and even prevented my Skin from pealing. This product feels great when apply ed and a little Goes A LONG way!!:) **Disclaimer * * I received this Product in Exchange for My Unbiased Review.</li>
    <li> I had to go 5 star on this one. First, alligator oil....whats that gonna smell like? I immediately thought swamp. Hehehe. But no. Its not bad at all. Now for the really good part. I  have had a couple surgeries and some of the scars ended up... (lets just call it) weird. Those, of course, were the first spots i thought to try it on when I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY REVIEW. It hasn&#x27;t been long and even the scar that reminded me of a busted blister is changing. The skin no longer feels flimsy and loose. And the oil absorbs so well that it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my shirt. This is a great product. Wish I had known about it when i had my surgeries so i couldn&#x27;t have used it sooner.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and extremely oil skin so i try to stay away from products that only hurt my skin and so far i have to say that i&#x27;m loving this product. I&#x27;ve tried oils that didn&#x27;t really do anything and i&#x27;ve tried oils that were just as amazing but with a bigger price so I&#x27;m happy i found something that is within my budget and still works great. This is a great product and I did receive this item free/discounted for my unbiased opinion but honestly once this is empty, i WILL be repurchasing</li>
    <li> I was biased prior but this oil is amazing!! It works wonders with dry cracked feet and hands. I love the hint of lavender scent. ( sent for review)</li>
    <li> Although I have not had this oil for long, I have used it in my hair and on my skin. This oil absorbs well and does not leave a residue. It softens my skin and makes it supple. I&#x27;m not a fan of the lavender fragrance but it dies of and is in noticeable after a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I did not pay for this product. I did receive it free for review.</li>
    <li> I started trying this product because of all the items it promises to do.  So far my skins is softer! And cant wait to see further results as this help with your hair, nails and more.  I am so glad I have an opportunity to review this prod.</li>
    <li> I have never heard of Alligator Oil before so when I came across this Caimon Alligator Oil I was a little bit on the nervous side. When I first received the alligator oil the first thing I had to do was smell it and you can smell the lavender; the scent isn&#x27;t overly strong and pretty much goes away after it&#x27;s dry. I love that fact that this alligator oil comes with no just a dropper but also a spray pump so you can actually have options instead of being stuck with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed a little on my hands and rubbed it into my skin and my nails. I was pleasantly surprised that this alligator oil isn&#x27;t oily feeling and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel sticky at all. It does however make my skin feel super soft. It absorbs quickly and evenly. I also was able to try this on a rash that I had and was in utter shock when by the next day it was already starting to heal. I would definitely recommend this Caimon Alligator Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this product for a week ( Free in-exchange for a review ), I like that it moisturizes my dry skin. Although the smell could be improved but I can always use it when I plan on staying home. Besides giving my skin a bit of moisture, that&#x27;s all that I&#x27;ve noticed, but it&#x27;s too soon to see other improvements.</li>
