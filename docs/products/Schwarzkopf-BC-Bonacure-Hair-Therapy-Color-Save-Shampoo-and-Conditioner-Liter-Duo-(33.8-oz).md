      <li>What more could I ask for!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and it got here quick!  </li>
      <li>and she liked it also.  </li>
      <li>I hdecided to switch shampoos, and I really liked the one that I replaced it with.</li>
      <li>okay, but not as good as the one from the salon.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo has a nice scent, it reminds me of the 1970&#x27;s shampoo &amp;#34;Gee</li>

      <li>I bought this one about a year ago, and really liked it.</li>

      <li>I have been a user of many of these Canadian-made Schwarzkopf products for many years and have been incredibly happy with the color save and sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE what it does for my hair!</li>
      <li>High quality at a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not as good as the original.</li>
      <li>Almost an \\&quot;over clean\\&quot;, if that makes since, also leaves my hair with a static feeling.  </li>
      <li>(Amazon is awesome about that), and I have been visiting my local salons and beauty supply stores to buy out their Canadian products.  </li>
      <li>I love the conditioner but the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well unless I use a lot of it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Great price for the product and shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and you will have healthy shiny hair that maintains its color.</li>
      <li>I love the BC Bonacure shampoo and conditioner but the picture indicates that I would be getting the purple bottles.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Schwarzkopf hair dyes</li>
      <li>Love the way the se products leave the hair</li>
      <li>I love the 2 products.  </li>
      <li>but when I unscrewed the top, I could tell immediately that it was not the smell I have come to love.</li>
      <li>The product is authentic.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better now that it is reformulated.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and it lathers easily so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to wash your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and smells great after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser uses Schwarzkopf hair color, which is one of the very best world wide.  </li>
      <li>I really loved this product the first time around, but I was genuinely freaked out with the quality of this product this time around.</li>
      <li>It is the best I have found for my color-treated, curly, fine, dry hair.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and looks much better.  </li>
      <li>I did not realize that color safe shampoo does not lather, I used tons of the product and never felt like my hair was clean.  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery and nice set</li>
      <li>Hair looks VERY healthy and keeps my color vibrant!  </li>
      <li>but mine is fine</li>
      <li>Also I cannot find this brand in town easily and the price was fantastic.</li>
      <li>she likes that it is sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>Since I was a virtual prisoner in my own home, I figured I really had nothing to lose.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, a friend who is a hair dresser suggested about a year ago that I try Schwarzkopf color save shampoo &amp; conditioner because she said that it was sulfate free &amp; that might help my scalp.</li>
      <li>Even came with a free lunch tote.</li>
      <li>I have used the original Q-10 Bonacure Schwarzkopf shampoo and conditioner for years</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this product on Amazon for a fraction of the price.  </li>
      <li>but this shampoo/conditioner makes my hair feel great and smell good also.had to start dyeing my hair recently and this shampoo is supposed to make the color last longer which it seems to be doing its job</li>
      <li>New bottle and great new smell!</li>
      <li>If you like shiny clean hair do not buy this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I guess I will compromise the color to get my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>I ordered right away!</li>
      <li>I have always purchased same from my hairstylist but figured the price was good from this seller so why not try it.  </li>
      <li>It rinses clean and the conditioner works quickly for the work day mornings.</li>
      <li>Not only was it a whole lot cheaper, came with pumps, and a nice bag, it was delivered right to my door!!!</li>
      <li>it is so hard to find schwarzkopf products, but thanks to amazon i found them and at a great price!</li>
      <li>It keeps the color from highlights looking fresh and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth giving it a try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, sulphate-free. Well priced, well below retail competition.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Schwarzkopf hair dyes but this product has an odor that gave me a headache.  I wish that you would say if the shampoo and conditioner is scented or unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.  Gave it away to a friend</li>
    <li> This is horrible shampoo and conditioner. I think maybe it is a really old I could not find any dates on the bottles. If you like shiny clean hair do not buy this shampoo. Very hard to rinse out as well. Hard to comb was a real waste of money. Fragrance not appealing either.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for this product. This shampoo is salon grade and it does wonders for my hair. It keeps the color from highlights looking fresh and moisturized. I love the way it smells and it lathers easily so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to wash your hair.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive allergies and found that Schwarzkopf&#x27;s Color Save shampoo and conditioner to be a product that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I was so excited to find this product on Amazon for a fraction of the price.  Alas, it was too good to be true.  I used it only once and found my scalp to be extremely irritated and the smell was overwhelming.  I had to throw it out; I assumed Amazon would not let me return it, although I didn&#x27;t ask.</li>
    <li> I have bought this one thinking it would help to keep my hair smooth after getting some highlights, first I got the wrong item in the mail, so i sent that back waiting for this.used it 2 times, results are horrible...my hair hard all tangled up the brush wouldnt go thru,i ended up ripping my hair.Seriously????? you get a pantene conditioner from CVS for 4 dollars that would make your hair feel smoother than a 30$ set.I feel i wasted my money and my time waiting for this set of COLOR SAVE.to me you people your money and hair by not using this one...</li>
    <li> Keeps my wife&#x27;s hair the color she wants it and the price is significantly less than at the salon.</li>
    <li> The product works well -- very well, in fact -- but, I&#x27;m almost 90% sure that mine has been watered down quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased the Schwarzkopf Bonacure products from my salon several times over and the shampoos and conditioners have always been relatively thick and required very little product to achieve results.  With these liters, I practically require an entire handful of both the shampoo and conditioner to saturate my shoulder length, very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, the price is low enough that I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s still not a decent deal.</li>
    <li> This is a completely different product from the one I ordered the first time. It smells like vanilla formaldehyde instead of vanilla cookies like it used to- really I am being serious. The color of the product was different than the last one, even the packaging was different. I really loved this product the first time around, but I was genuinely freaked out with the quality of this product this time around. I don&#x27;t think anyone should be using this stuff. Scary. I hdecided to switch shampoos, and I really liked the one that I replaced it with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done so much reading on psoriasis, and there is so much trial and error involved.  I am very anti-medication since the drugs they usually give you for this condition are way over the top and often dangerous side effects. My new diet and this shampoo/conditioner helped immensely, I would highly recommend!  it&#x27;s very soothing on the scalp and does leave your hair super soft!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this shampoo and conditioner years ago. It is the best I have found for my color-treated, curly, fine, dry hair. When he ran out, I tried others and their performance was poor compared to this stuff. This size will last a long time and is cheaper than when I get it at the hair salon. Pair with the Color-Save Split Ends treatment and you will have healthy shiny hair that maintains its color.</li>
    <li> I was iffy about this product when i purchases it.. Wanting somthing to keep my hair dyes longer lasting.. And to my suprise it dosent rinse ny dye out like other shamppos.. Id tell any one who dyes there hair and wants that fresh dye look this is ur shampoo and conditionar.  Great buy</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended to me.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference in this product saving the color of my newly dyed hair compared with other color save products, even less expensive ones.  I&#x27;ve never used this product before, but I did feel like the shampoo was \\&quot;watered\\&quot; down compared to other shampoos I have used.  I saw another review with the same comment which I found interesting.  I do feel like it is a great price for the amount you are getting, for both a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve reordered this product.  Good size/amount for the money too.</li>
    <li> I ended up receiving two bottles of the conditioner, instead of one shampoo and one conditioner. I was still working through my old shampoo and conditioner so didn&#x27;t open this package until recently by which time the 30 day return window had expired :( Now I&#x27;m stuck with two conditioner bottles and no shampoo. Just posting this so others check their order carefully as soon as they receive it.</li>
    <li> I have very bad psoriasis, in my nails, over 90% of my body, and on my scalp. I could hide everything with clothing except my head; it was so bad that when I bent over, it would look like a snow storm in progress, not to mention the pain. I had tried everything my dermatologist gave me, both over the counter &amp; prescription, some things helped a bit, but nothing worth the shower caps all night long &amp; the smell... Anyway, a friend who is a hair dresser suggested about a year ago that I try Schwarzkopf color save shampoo &amp; conditioner because she said that it was sulfate free &amp; that might help my scalp. Since I was a virtual prisoner in my own home, I figured I really had nothing to lose.  Within 2 weeks of using this product, my head was much better and within a month, it was completely cleared up. No more psoriasis. My nails on my hands are cleared up with an occasional break out. I also use it on my skin and although that&#x27;s not gone, the itching has lessened and it&#x27;s greatly improved. It&#x27;s great for my hair as well. Try it on your scalp, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have used the original Q-10 Bonacure Schwarzkopf shampoo and conditioner for years and I love it. I thought I would try the Color Save version, but it is too drying for me. It&#x27;s okay, but not as good as the original.</li>
    <li> I have used other Schwarzkopf products but this one seems to weigh my hair down and does not leave my hair feeling clean.  I am not sure of the supplier but as some others have said, I think the composition of the shampoo is \\&quot;altered\\&quot; somehow.  Overall, I will not be buying this product again from the retailer.  I will stick with buying it in a store not online.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really great!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.  My hair is shinier and is thicker.  After using many other shampoos for several years, I found this one to be much better.  My hair feels clean and looks much better.  It was definitely worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have very thick colored long hair and have been using Pantene and other \\&quot;hair care\\&quot; products for years to care for my hair.  I grew weary of all the leave in treatments to smooth the color treated look and researched highly recommended shampoo and conditioner until I discovered Schwarzkopf.  I AM SOLD!  My hair is stronger, not breaking and it&#x27;s just a two step process, shampoo and condition.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It&#x27;s even better now that it is reformulated. New bottle and great new smell! Leaves hair super soft and saves color.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine but thick hair.  It breaks easily and is hard to comb through even when not damaged.  This stuff stops it from breaking and makes it soft as silk.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE what it does for my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed these have helped to maintain the shine and color of my hair after coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that I don&#x27;t feel the conditioner is as nourishing as I would like.</li>
    <li> Performs well and leaves hair feeling very soft. Color does seem to last much longer than other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Not the same colour or sent as the product I buy from my local salon.  Its okay, but not as good as the one from the salon.  This one is white in colour and the salon product is pink.  Could this be old stock?</li>
    <li> I have ordered Schwarzkopf BC Bonacure Hair Therapy Color Save Shampoo &amp; Conditioner before &amp; it was great.  This one is different.  It has a different color &amp; smell-I am not fond of the smell.  I do not know if it is a different formula or if someone switched out the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  What I have ordered in the past has been white in color &amp; had a more pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I found this product through Amazon as a combo unit to be the least expensive one on the internet.  The product arrived in a timely fashion. It was just as I wanted.  What a relief not to have to buy them separately at twice the price.</li>
    <li> What a rip off. I&#x27;ve used SCWARTZKOPT Bonacure for years and it did wonders for my blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this, used it about 5 times and it completely stripped my hair of any natural moisture, tone and general health. An objectively marked difference than before. I couldn&#x27;t even comb my wet hair.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that color safe shampoo does not lather, I used tons of the product and never felt like my hair was clean.  I guess I will compromise the color to get my hair clean.  Now I&#x27;ve got to spend the money to buy the regular shampoo, plus the money I&#x27;ve lost on this purchase.  Please note that I have been very pleased with the other Bonacure Hair products, just don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
    <li> This product line is absolutely wonderful for adding moisture while not flattening the hair. It rinses clean and the conditioner works quickly for the work day mornings. The conditioner can be left in a bit longer on the weekends for added softness and is safe for processed hair. Only disappointment was that one of the two pumps arrived broken so I had to improvise.</li>
    <li> The bottle has different color from the one showed on Amazon website. Smell is different. I bought this one about a year ago, and really liked it. But this order is so disappointing and I&#x27;m returning it. Such waste of my time!</li>
    <li> When these products arrived the shampoo was like melted licquid. It is not like it should be[[ASIN:B000XHPOF6 Schwarzkopf BC Bonacure Hair Therapy Color Save Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Duo (33.8 oz)]] and although I would like to return the items I do not want to pay shipping back so I will just use it up. I was disapointed as I am an good customer of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. The size is a real bonus. Also I cannot find this brand in town easily and the price was fantastic.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this type of Shampoo and Conditioner for years and like it a lot.  The hair feels cleaner, smooth and more manageable, my wife&#x27;s hair color lasts longer and the price is right for the larger bottles.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER!    I have medium/thin hair, but tons of it.  This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so soft and smooth without making it greasy.  It takes away fly-aways and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go without these products!  The sulfate-free shampoo is so amazing!  My curl is coming back and I shed about half as much as I did before!  The conditioner has improved the texture and split ends more than any other conditioner! I highly recommend for curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints but I have no praises for these products either.  They seem to require a larger amount of product for me to get the result I want.  I actually prefer John Frieda for my colored hair.</li>
    <li> It seems a little harsh for my hair.  My hair felt stripped and dry after washing with this product.  I will not continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels both damp and dried with a hair dryer.  Smell is great!  Hair looks VERY healthy and keeps my color vibrant!  I would DEFINATELY order this product again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the quality</li>
    <li> Nice product &amp; good service. I have used it for years, you should try it also you will like it.</li>
    <li> This package deal is awesome.  I love the 2 products.  Work perfectly for my hair.  Shipment was delivered timely and packaged well.  Great product!</li>
    <li> On the back of the bottle there is a warning: Keep out reach of children, may cause skin irritation..Well I was the 1 person this caused skin irritation to. I used it at night, and by the time I woke up the next morning I had a huge open sore on my scalp that was oozing clear sticky fluid (like a blister) I loved the way it made my hair feel, but it burnt my scalp so I have to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the keratin non-sulfate shampoos b/c I feel a residue with those.  This one does too!</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I thought  it was a great book.  He writes a really great mystery.  I could hardly put it down.  Mystery books are my all time favorites to read.  I loaned it to a friend and she liked it also.  I can&#x27;t wait for the next one in the series to come out.</li>
    <li> I saw this roduct at my hairdressers and wondered if I could find it cheaper on Amazon.... Which I did almost half the price!  At first it&#x27;s different feeling when using compared to other shampoos that contain sulfates, etc.  But I found that the more I used the product the better my hair felt and looked.. and the color does last much longer than with other color treated shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> I HATED IT. IT IS OLD AND STALE. AT THE END, IN THE SHAMPOO,  THE CREAM AND THE LIQUID WERE SEPARATED!!! I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW HOW BAD IT WAS UNTIL I OPENED A TRAVEL SET I BOUGHT AT THE SAME TIME, AND THE SHAMPOO WAS CREAMY AS IT IS SUPPOSSED TO BE!! I TRIED TO RETURN IT, BUT THEY TOLD ME &amp;#34;THE TIME TO RETURNET HAD LAPSED. SO I HAD TO USE IT UNTIL THE END WHEN I FOUND THE CREAM SEPARATED FROM THE LIQUID!!! WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> ii bought this as a gift for my mom. she loves schwarzkopf shampoo for her colored dark brown(almost black) hair.  she likes that it is sulfate free.  it is so hard to find schwarzkopf products, but thanks to amazon i found them and at a great price! nice smell as well</li>
    <li> Love the way the se products leave the hair</li>
    <li> They changed the formula but the shampoo lathers very nice, the conditioner is thinner and more like a leave in.  Great price for the product and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I had just purchased the duo for $60 from my hairstylist! When I saw I could get them from Amazon for ALOT less I ordered right away! Not only was it a whole lot cheaper, came with pumps, and a nice bag, it was delivered right to my door!!! What more could I ask for! Get product want a REALLY great price! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and nice set</li>
    <li> Love this product combo!! Bought it originally in Ulta and in smaller sizes for double the price! Great deal from this site. A little disappointed the pumps did not come in the package. It shows the pumps in the picture but not listed in the description.</li>
    <li> BEWARE:  Schwartzkopt BC Bonacure Hair Therapy Color Save Shampoo and Condition Liter Duo (33.8oz) - Perhaps I should have been wary because of the low price.  This product is definitely not SCWARTZKOPT Bonacure shampoo and conditioner. I have always purchased same from my hairstylist but figured the price was good from this seller so why not try it.  WRONG! First off it smells completely different.  Also my hair did not feel at all like it normally does with the shampoo I buy at the stylist.  This leads me to conclude that it is either very old, or more likely counterfeit packaging of another product.  I was very disappointed and feel I was ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schwartkopt has stellar hair care products which I have used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned - pay full price and get the real thing!</li>
    <li> I have used Schwarzkopf Color Save shampoo and conditioner for a year now. I have bought them both in salons and online. I have even purchased them from this seller before. I have never noticed a difference. My last shipment, however, was different than other orders in the past. First the shampoo/conditioner duo did not come with the pumps or the pink bag. I could live with that but when I unscrewed the top, I could tell immediately that it was not the smell I have come to love. I checked the conditioner. Same thing. I decided to do a little investigating. I squeezed some shampoo out from my old bottle onto a plate and then some shampoo from the suspect bottle onto the same plate. THESE ARE NOT THE SAME SHAMPOO!! They are not the same color, they are not the same smell nor are they even the same texture. This new stuff is yellow, has a strange smell and more watery in consistency. It looks like Suave. Beware. These bottles have been tampered with. Props to Amazon for promptly refunding my money.</li>
    <li> Pumps not included... photo is misleading.</li>
    <li> To start I&#x27;m a guy but this shampoo/conditioner makes my hair feel great and smell good also.had to start dyeing my hair recently and this shampoo is supposed to make the color last longer which it seems to be doing its job my dye has lasted 4 weeks at this point.this is a little expensive but should last awhile because they are big bottles and some said the bottles they received seemed watered down but mine is fine its very thick shampoo.good luck</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it got here quick!  I will always use sulfate free products and this one is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> She absolutely loves these. High quality at a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell great too. Come with pumps so you can get as much or little as you want.</li>
    <li> I like using this on my hair, price is good and lasts me awhile. I have been using this product for over two years.</li>
    <li> The Schwarzkopf products are wonderful and I&#x27;ve used them for years.  The conditioner is not greasy.  You get the best price for these items on Amazon.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase these items.</li>
    <li> The produce arrived on time but the bottles were dirty and it looked as though the labels have been torned off and the bottle recycled?  I haven&#x27;t used the product yet and am hoping nothing is wrong with the actual shampoo and conditioner because I have always liked this product but have previously purchased it from a salon.</li>
    <li> I love the BC Bonacure shampoo and conditioner but the picture indicates that I would be getting the purple bottles. What I got was the red bottles which are the sulfate free version. I didn&#x27;t want to order those because I was afraid it would not be as good as the purple.  I peviously had the other bottles. I can now say they are both excellant products. I have a friend alergic to Sulfides so I&#x27;m going to giive her some to try and you may have a new customer,</li>
    <li> I will continue buying this product online and save half of the money. i am wondering what else she was overcharging me for??</li>
    <li> I love getting the good stuff in economy size. It is good for the planet and my pocketbook.  I like the pump dispensers which keep me from using too much.  I read the reviews first but find this product works very well for my fine, shoulder length highlighted, nearly 60 year old hair.  I keep this at my boyfriends and so alternate it with a different product at home (Nexxus)</li>
    <li> I never believed shampoo could make a difference, but a stylist used this on my hair before a haircut. I loved the smell. My hair is very soft and smells great after I&#x27;ve used it. I have never found it&#x27;s equivalent. If your hair tends to dry out at the ends and you color, this shampoo is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent transaction.  I love the product, and it came with two push pumps for ease of use, as well as an attractive carrying case.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner did not meet my expectations.  After shampooing, my hair was kind of sticky even after the conditioner.  I will not buy this again.  I will buy this product only if it was made in Canada, not Germany.</li>
    <li> Pumps shown in picture was not included, I would have paid extra for them but I didn&#x27;t see that option</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses Schwarzkopf hair color, which is one of the very best world wide.  The signature shampoo products maintain color integrity and shine.</li>
    <li> Great products! My hairdresser uses them.</li>
    <li> The product looks diluted not the dense thick quality I buy at the salon....is cheaper but dried my hair badly. Arrived on time tough.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair very soft.  Will buy again soon!  Product arrived in a timely manner and the package was easy to open.  Even came with a free lunch tote.</li>
    <li> For the name that I know all these years all over the world that I travelled  and lived, it dried up my hair on the first use, I used it only 2 times with the same result, It is still sitting in my bathroom, looks more like imitation for the famous brand that I used all my life, I WISH I CAN RETURN IT BACK?!&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Buy this product!!</li>
    <li> The bottles I received  did not fit any of my other standard pumps, so I ended up transferring the contents into other bottles.  The shampoo has a nice scent, it reminds me of the 1970&#x27;s shampoo &amp;#34;Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific&amp;#34;.  The conditioner doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all, but it did condition my hair well.  I&#x27;ll use what I have but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Pump on Shampoo gets clogged with white sandy substance. When I shake it, there is a gritty characteristic to the actual shampoo (this is what is at the bottom of the bottle and is clogging the pump). So, I was basically not &amp;#34;shampooing my hair&amp;#34; with everything the bottle has in it.</li>
    <li> So far I like this, it protects the color for sure, but it leaves a weird feeling.  Almost an \\&quot;over clean\\&quot;, if that makes since, also leaves my hair with a static feeling.  But when push come to shove, no iching feeling after using and the color seems to be holding up well.  I will be trying it again</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It lasts for a looooong time.  I wash my hair every 2-3 days so the product has lasted over one year! I purchased from this seller the last time and will buy from them again.  The product is authentic.  Smells great, works great.</li>
    <li> The price for both was what I usually pay for just the conditioner. I love the conditioner but the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well unless I use a lot of it. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference for how long my color looks vibrant and is much more reasonably priced than some of the other salon care products out there.</li>
    <li> The price is right and delivered as promised.  The stores can&#x27;t supply this product at these prices and you don&#x27;t have to leave home to receive them.</li>
    <li> What is pictured is the product that is made in Canada, which is absolutely AWESOME and FABULOUS.  The product that was shipped and is being shipped to salons and beauty supply stores currently is made in Germany (you can tell by the packaging \\&quot;Innovation 100% color shine\\&quot; and reading the back label).  I have been a user of many of these Canadian-made Schwarzkopf products for many years and have been incredibly happy with the color save and sulfate free.  The shampoo from Germany leaves my hair with an awful residue feeling.  The conditioner from Germany leaves my hair feeling very weighted down and the new fragrance is very powerful and not that pleasant.  I have sent these German products back (Amazon is awesome about that), and I have been visiting my local salons and beauty supply stores to buy out their Canadian products.  Really disappointed that Schwarzkopf changed their formula and manufacturing facilities. Yes, it was wonderful to have a nice price reduction on Amazon, but not at the expense of a formula change.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Schwarzkopf BC Bonacure Hair Therapy Color Save Shampoo and Conditioner for years and love their products! Although it arrived in the same exact bottles, the product was completely different!!! I am not sure if they changed their formula, but I was extremely disappointed! The Shampoo was a completely different texture and the conditioner literally smelled and looked like a cheap floral lotion. I would not purchase or even recommend this product if this is what you&#x27;ll be getting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before but purchased at my salon.  The order I got from Amazon, shampoo was watered down.  Not sure if the bottle was tampered with, but its not the same.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Nothing like i have been buying at the salon. im not sure what this stuff is but I am willing to bet it is not the real stuff. The conditioner was was extremely watered down and the shampoo wasn&#x27;t great either ... Never again!</li>
