      <li>It is clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Why?&lt;br /&gt;Who knows - many tried and true get bumped for &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34; I like to stick with favorites&lt;</li>
      <li>I ove perfume and once I found this &amp;#34;RAIN&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;CHINA RAIN&amp;#34; just &amp;#34;RAIN&amp;#34; I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, always gets noticed, makes me happy wearing it…used to be in stores - now only on line.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is great to rub on the scalp when you have to go an extra day before washing your hair--such a clean smell.</li>
      <li>Unique fragrance gets me compliments everywhere I go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of flowery at first, a little bright, but after a bit it softens and is more clean and powdery.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m into good, natural smells and this one strikes me just right.</li>
      <li>this roll on has more staying power than essential oil and smells great after a long work day.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, simple clean fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It has a clean smell, yet has enough musky fragrances to be sexy.</li>
      <li>It is extremely light, subtle and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Once the fragrance dries down on your skin, it has a fresh floral essence to it that is very refreshing, and the scent lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I had never tried this before , I received this today and have fallen in love with the scent I am actually going to order the body mist to layer the scent .</li>
      <li>I really like the way this one dries down on me, and the way I can still smell it on my clothes days afterward -- not in a strong way, but a nice, soft reminder of the perfume.  </li>
      <li>Been a favorite for summer for a long time.</li>
      <li>It smells a little bit like soap--which is nice, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend the $20 again.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
      <li>The same clean accent I&#x27;ve always known.</li>
      <li>The scent is definitely very clean, as other reviews have said.</li>
      <li>My normal perfume is Jessica McClintock which is also very floral smelling</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the smell of this.... but the fragrance in this wears out very quickly.</li>
      <li>the scent seems to last much longer then the perfumes with an alcohol base to them, one happy buyer :)</li>
      <li>but Rain has replaced hat and is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like old grandpa&#x27;s stuff.  </li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s comprised of essential oils, the scent stays around (ie: don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
      <li>The last few year&#x27;s I hadn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent since the late 70&#x27;s,was nice to find it on line at such a reduced rate !</li>
      <li>Each is elegant, noticeable and yet subtle.  </li>
