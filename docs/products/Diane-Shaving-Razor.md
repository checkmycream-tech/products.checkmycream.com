      <li>I&#x27;ll probably have it for many years to some.</li>
      <li>so you need to order more blades with it</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I figured at these prices this would be the better of the two.</li>

      <li>it okay fore</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair and other peoples, so when its time for the shape up the hair, i use this product and the best part is that its very cheap.</li>

      <li>It is a great, cheap way to get into straight razor shaving.</li>
      <li>Really good durable straight razor.</li>
      <li>The whole experience was good.</li>
      <li>condition.i&#x27;d say a good starter product if you want to learn about shaving with a straight razor blade.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s easy to fix.</li>
      <li>The blade easily falls out.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to cut your face to ribbons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i finally got it so its in great condition and worked fine.</li>
      <li>Cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea..</li>
      <li>But it definitely gets the job done and it feels great when shaving.</li>
      <li>SO CHEAP</li>
      <li>but, the plastic is too cheap and brittle for this application.</li>
      <li>Item is too cheap to return.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve said that switching to a straight blade was the best personal grooming change I&#x27;ve ever made!  </li>
      <li>The plastic is super bendy and cheap</li>
      <li>Other than that, the razor is good, my boyfriend was pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Its too large to hold in your hand while your trying to outline, its ok</li>
      <li>Razor blade is just good enough from Gillete</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good and simple product.</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more from this company, Thanks.</li>

      <li>Cheap and of course broke with the first use .</li>
      <li>I use this item all the time to keep my shape up fresh saves money on going to the barbershop</li>
      <li>I liked it for carry-on travel because you can get a pack of blades for 2-3 bucks at just about any Wally or big chain drug store.</li>
      <li>I am debating whether or not it is worth the effort to assemble all of the parts</li>
      <li>I shave bi-weekly, and it sill holds the blades right.</li>
      <li>To replace the blade you pull out an insert that holds the blade in the right place.</li>
      <li>I do not know if this is right.  </li>
      <li>RIGHT.</li>
      <li>It took a little practice to get good at using it now</li>
      <li>This is my first razor.</li>
      <li>Note that I traveled with the first one for over a year before a TSA agent decided he didn&#x27;t like</li>

      <li>work exactly as described.</li>
      <li>and I love it, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>But, at this price I was prepared to replace it as many times as necessary.</li>
      <li>Just got mine today, should have checked the reviews first.</li>
      <li>It is cheaply made though I would have preferred a little better built quality.</li>
      <li>However, it can be made much better with minor</li>
      <li>Great product this is the 3rd one that I&#x27;ve purchase, I purchase one for myself &amp; the other 2 for my cousins that are going to barbershop school to become a barber.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not the best thing i gotten</li>
    <li> I bought one of these, because I wanted to do a cleaner mustache and sideburns grooming.  This type of Razor does a good job.  Note, it does feel a little bit flimsy, and I do not expect it to last.  The plastic isn&#x27;t too sturdy, bends easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I suggest do not even try the blade this razor comes with.  Throw it out and get a decent razor blade.  Now, here is where it get&#x27;s dicey, especially for all the men who&#x27;ve seen this type of razor on old movies, they are dangerous.  I&#x27;ve nicked myself a few times, very light nicks, but they are  due to my inexperience using this razor.  If you do choose to get this style razor, remember to be gentle, because the blades are sharp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s work good but it rust the fist time I used it and only come with one blade so you need to order more blades with it</li>
    <li> No instructions included, and in Amazon illustration there is not blade inserted or another picture to show where blade fits.  No way to know proper blade stick-out.  After more than 30 minutes of the blade slipping and not being in tight, I finally got the blade to stay in.  The blade stick-out was about 1/32 to 1/16 of an inch...I do not know if this is right.  However, on amazon search for \\&quot;Pala srw straight edge razor\\&quot; and you will see the illustration shows a blade inserted that seemS to be 1/4 inch of more stick-out.  Also, it comes with instructions with visual aids showing exactly how to insert the blade.  The shave was poor..maybe the blade is not inserted correctly.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS THE AMAZON ILLUSTRATION SHOWS THE BLADE INSERTED, AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE INCLUDED, OR I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT BE A HAPPY CAMPER WITH MANY BLOODY CUTS!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> product arrived as advertised - well packaged and in perfect condition.i&#x27;d say a good starter product if you want to learn about shaving with a straight razor blade.</li>
    <li> Its a great product I&#x27;m very happy with it. it holds the blade in tight, and it gives you a close shave. I cut my own hair and other peoples, so when its time for the shape up the hair, i use this product and the best part is that its very cheap. Also when you first get the straight razor, make shore you run the blade threw a few times to loosen it up.</li>
    <li> Just the average shaving razor, I use it to keep my hair and eyebrows shaped up, saving me money by not having to go to the barber shop.</li>
    <li> i honestly wish it came with an instruction manual on how to put the blade in but after 15 minutes of trying i finally got it so its in great condition and worked fine.</li>
    <li> Just got mine today, should have checked the reviews first. Your order will be conspicuously missing an important part.... a razor. This is a frame only, and should be explicitly labeled as such.</li>
    <li> Cheap and of course broke with the first use . Cracked in half and the slide where the blade goes in blades don&#x27;t fit properly  the notches don&#x27;t align with the blade but with a little squeeze they fit but once in and u try to put line the blades straight it goes to deep inside and it disappears .</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s probably the cheapest straight razor on here, holds the blades tight. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, get it.</li>
    <li> With a bit of practice, patience, and studying, this far outperforms any cartridge razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Be prepared for nicks if this is your first straight razor experience, but they&#x27;re nothing that can&#x27;t be cleaned up with a septic pencil. It is a great, cheap way to get into straight razor shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product this is the 3rd one that I&#x27;ve purchase, I purchase one for myself &amp; the other 2 for my cousins that are going to barbershop school to become a barber. I would recommend this product, I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more from this company, Thanks.</li>
    <li> Tested the product, and it works great, holds the blade well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t call this a razor. Aren&#x27;t sharp enough. I see no results whatsoever! How can I return this thing? ugh</li>
    <li> This product blows, the black part always detaches from the silver piece &amp; i cannot find a razor that will fit the silver piece since this company don&#x27;t send an actual razor with the product. Absolutely awful..</li>
    <li> Great product! Great service!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who was contemplating switching to a straight edge shaver. He used it a couple times but I think he preferred the convenience of his electric and his ability with a triple blade razor. So, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, it just wasnt for him.</li>
    <li> This is my first razor. It holds the blades well and saves me a lot of money. I&#x27;ll probably have it for many years to some.</li>
    <li> Bottom line its a great barber razor but when I received mine it came like stained and a little bended from where you place the blade. But it definitely gets the job done and it feels great when shaving.</li>
    <li> The handle for this straight razor is made from incredibly flimsy plastic, and the product doesn&#x27;t even come with a single razor, so it&#x27;s literally useless unless you purchase blades yourself. There are other straight razors on Amazon that cost just as much but are overall better products and come complete with an actual razor (because what good is a straight razor without the razor part?). Don&#x27;t waste your time on this one. Even if you&#x27;re a first-time straight razor user - look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The blade easily falls out. This is a very inexpensive razor, but it can seriously harm you if you are not extremely careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware. All the positive reviews seem to be written in the same manner. I suspect they  are paid reviewers from overseas.</li>
    <li> This knife is plain Jane, I;ll probably use it to cut stuff, (not me or anyone), maybe crafts or stuff</li>
    <li> Good product for a great price. Used it with derby razor blades and they fit perfect. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well - as good as it can get for $3. Using it is difficult though - need good practice.</li>
    <li> Gotten it earlier then I expected, came in good condition but it looks like it been use kinda expected clean new like it was on the view but it came in good condition but need to buy the razor for it it comes separate.</li>
    <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
    <li> Looks very cheap. Broke after just a couple of uses. Will not buy again. The plastic is super bendy and cheap</li>
    <li> not good buy..was not able to use it since i bought..take at ur own risk and do some good research before buying</li>
    <li> Its too large to hold in your hand while your trying to outline, its ok</li>
    <li> I cannot believe this stroller is still in the market. Worst stroller ever! I have owned a few strollers with this one being the worst. The wheels are a major issue. The will give you the hardest time trying to move stroller in any direction. I had read some good and bad reviews and hoped to be one of the lucky ones who would absolutely love this stroller. I should have listened to the bad reviews. Horrible Stroller EVER.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for 5 weeks now and I love it, especially for the price.  Take it slow and concentrate. Get a hundred derby blades and shave for half a year for ten bucks total.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap razor and I have had no problems with it after 5 months of owning it. It took a little practice to get good at using it now I save a lot of money on razor blades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and simple product. Cheap enough for beginners to see if they like that kind of razor. The whole experience was good.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the razor that the barbars use. This razor move around when I use it it is very easey to cut your self.I was loking for the one pice.</li>
    <li> Perfect handle feel for a clean cut shave</li>
    <li> thanks for this, i was  looking for the best and i think i found it ,i recommended to anybody kj</li>
    <li> it okay fore the price could have been more solid but overall gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;disnt look like the picture actually</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few months.  It takes forever to load the blades. They have to be inserted so that the indentations line up perfectly with the razor.  The pin finally came loose, and the whole razor fell apart.  I am debating whether or not it is worth the effort to assemble all of the parts together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle feels like a real flimsy piece of plastic.  It is not worth more than a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves ok.  Try to find something better if you can.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to have as a backup, but I tested it for a month before writing a review. The handle is made of a low quality plastic and has gotten somewhat loose with the day to day use. The blades don&#x27;t fit easily in the metallic arm that holds them, but after pressing hard enough it will fit into place (kind of dangerous because the blades are really sharp). The blade sticks out of the safety edges just enough to give you a proper shave. Overall it worked well for the first couple of weeks, although it was a pain when changing blades. Towards the end of the month I noticed the handle was coming loose and the metallic safety edges began to bend outwards. If you are looking for a razor that will last you for years to come, this is not it. If you want something that will probably end up in the landfill within a few months, this is it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, too bad i didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t come with the blade. Good if you already have a blade or plan on buying one.</li>
    <li> Be careful I cut myself the first time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and so I do not shave with straight razors. I didn&#x27;t know that some came with blades and some did not. I would have preferred if the description had mentioned that this razor needed blades and did not come with any. Other than that, the razor is good, my boyfriend was pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea.. Razor blade is just good enough from Gillete</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this is a very cheap (price) shavette that gets the job done. However, it can be made much better with minor modifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s begin with how these things work: you get a razor that at first glance looks like a traditional straight razor. But when you unfold it you see that the business end is actually a holder for half of a DE (double edge) blade. To replace the blade you pull out an insert that holds the blade in the right place. It has little bumps molded into it that fit the hips of the half blade. Once you have the blade in place you slide the insert back into the receiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The receiver is made out of a piece of sheet metal that has been folded into the shape of a tall triangle with a narrow bottom edge. The blade then protrudes where the two tall sides of the triangle come together. The problem is that the sheet metal is rather thick and has square edges. The blade only protrudes a little bit from the top of the triangle and that can make it difficult to get just the right blade angle against your skin. The thick edge of the receiver holds the blade up and away from your skin. But it&#x27;s easy to fix. Get a flat file and file away the thick corner. Of course you would want to make sure you have the insert and blade removed while you file. It will only take a few minutes of work because these are made of a pretty soft metal. My close up pictures of the reciever show what mine looked up after a little filing to take down that corner. Once you get a nice bevel on the receiver part of the shaver this becomes a great shaving unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used a shavette before:&lt;br /&gt;+ You don&#x27;t need to sharpen or strop. When you blade gets dull you throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;+ I liked it for carry-on travel because you can get a pack of blades for 2-3 bucks at just about any Wally or big chain drug store. Then I can still have my straight edge shave on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are also disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;- DE blades are not really made to be used in shavettes and as such they have square edges that are irritating and can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful. If you really don&#x27;t like the square edges I recommend a Personna style hair dresser&#x27;s shaper. They are quite easy to shave with and have longer blades, but the blades are a little more expensive and difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;- Disposable blades can be TOO sharp for a novice shaver. Especially when they are new it&#x27;s easy to cut your face to ribbons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I bought this one after a similar product was confiscated by TSA. They said that since it could hold a blade it was still not acceptable as a carry-on even if there was no blade in it. But, at this price I was prepared to replace it as many times as necessary. I traded just under four Washingtons to get mine. Note that I traveled with the first one for over a year before a TSA agent decided he didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you travel carry-on only and want a straight edge shave I would say this is by far the best way to go.</li>
    <li> it broke off the black cover making it quite dangerous now.</li>
    <li> The price was obviously great since other ones are pretty expensive, but the blade that came with it was not good. Had to buy refills from amazon just to get a good blade.</li>
    <li> Cheap design - arrived cracked on far end. Blade holder was intact. Contact with vendor was a quick reply with no resolution. Item is too cheap to return. I think the razor / shavette is a nice idea but, the plastic is too cheap and brittle for this application. Buy at your own risk!</li>
    <li> work exactly as described. I used it and it works great. It is cheaply made though I would have preferred a little better built quality. But nothing performs like a straight razor.</li>
    <li> Great Razor, Great Price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been toying around with purchasing a razor for a while. They give you that real tight pronounced hair line. They can be intimidating but I just searched some online videos to get instruction and now I feel like a pro. I definitely recommend these for anyone in the market and don&#x27;t let the price fool you. These are an inexpensive brand but not cheap. And with this being my first one maybe a more expensive razor is that much better but this will get the job done.</li>
    <li> For the price of this razor and the cost of the blades. I think this is the best value out there. I also like the that this system doesn&#x27;t produce any waste that will end up in a landfill.  The blades are recyclable and so is the razor if and when it breaks. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year and still works. I shave bi-weekly, and it sill holds the blades right. FYI some nice cheap blades that go in accord with this shaving razor are these blades:[[ASIN:B006JVTHIU Derby Professional Single Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count (Pack of 2)]]. This is a very cheap alternative to buying the conventional shaving products since they&#x27;re much more expensive. Anyways, for the price of this, I really recommend to buy this and the blades since this product doesn&#x27;t come with any razors.</li>
    <li> THIS IS TRASH IT DOES NOT WORK RIGHT. IT DOESNT EVEN GET ANY HAIR IT FEELS SO CHEAP ITS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. I DONT WANT SOMEONE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON SOMETHING SO CHEAP LIKE THIS DONT BUY THOS FROM THIS SELLING.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. Very stable. Recommend its use. Has a visibly acceptable quality compared to the price, the better. Thanks</li>
    <li> I opened the package, put a single blade in the holder then closed the blade while I washed my face in preparation to shave. As I closed the blade, it split in half at the non-hinge end. Clearly the two sides of the plastic handle were barely glued together. I would 100% recommend the MD brand straight razor handle. In fact it comes with an order of 100 single blades from the MD Barber Supply company. The MD Barber handle as a rivet at the non-hinge end so the issue I had with this handle is very difficult to have happen with the MD Barber handle.</li>
    <li> i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product works great and it was deliver on time. i would recommended this product to other users.</li>
    <li> i like is good  works good safe when i put on blad  this one goog i give five right good</li>
    <li> The only hard thing is putting the blade in because its not made right a little bit but its ok better then all the other ones I&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> Really good durable straight razor. Fits your grip nicely. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was because this product DOES NOT come with an actual razor, but does fit fine with the derby razors.</li>
    <li> I use this item all the time to keep my shape up fresh saves money on going to the barbershop</li>
    <li> I recently purchased another razor for about the same price that came with 100 blades. I figured at these prices this would be the better of the two. Although I haven&#x27;t shaved with this one just yet I can&#x27;t honestly attest to it&#x27;s capacity for doing it&#x27;s job. I just didn&#x27;t think it would be a great idea considering the amount of \\&quot;play\\&quot; that occurs with the blade when it&#x27;s in the position that you are supposed to shave with it in. I dont trust it is the bottom line but what can you expect for the price. Probly will make a nice gift to someone else that might try their hand at this. Might even give it to my barber.</li>
    <li> Super good. I save in blades a lot. just one page of blades goo for $2 and it fix perfect in this item. thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve said that switching to a straight blade was the best personal grooming change I&#x27;ve ever made!  This handle has been very good and have no regrets in buying.  The only negative I&#x27;ve noticed is there&#x27;s a little rust in 2 spots when it holds the blade.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the handle or the blades but I wasn&#x27;t expecting since both are stainless steel.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived quickly, not the product that was pictured on this site. For the price why complain. I make the best of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking I would be able to use this for shaving, but the blade was dull and it cut my face up. Dont buy!</li>
