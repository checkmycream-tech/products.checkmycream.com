      <li>This stone is awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best out of all pumice stones</li>
      <li>Best callous remover I have purchased.</li>
      <li>Not as impressed as I thought I would be, but it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>but this is the best buy I have gotten in ages!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This is a great product</li>
      <li>read the great reviews.</li>
      <li>This works surprisingly well.  </li>
      <li>And the pricing cannot be more reasonble!  </li>
      <li>This stone thingy is absolutely amazing and my feet no longer stick like Velcro to the carpeting.  </li>
      <li>Amazing-</li>
      <li>catching on my hosiery, socks, slippers, bed sheets, even the carpet...</li>
      <li>I liked it -  does the job well.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best pumice stone I have ever purchased!!!</li>
      <li>and I love having nice looking nails to go along with my sandals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to hold!</li>
      <li>Happy overall, and my feet are happy too.</li>
      <li>lol*)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
      <li>An easy and effective callous remover, leaves feet, elbows, knees and hands very smooth</li>
      <li>I love wearing sandals</li>
      <li>This is a magic stone.</li>
      <li>Works way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried on my callused heels.</li>
      <li>This stone has made my feet soooooo smooth!</li>
      <li>Much better than a pumice.  </li>
      <li>Cuz, dontcha know, every time you find a product you love, they discontinue it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not, &#x27;mostly&#x27; gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The eggs were pretty good.  </li>
      <li>the stone is nice looking and easy to hold, but the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; surface side is awfully mild.</li>
      <li>(it didn&#x27;t happen of course, as far as my callouses went; but the hot water and zzzzzz-vibration-thingy did feel wonderful,</li>
      <li>The size and shape of the stone also makes it very easy to use, no awkward handle.  </li>
      <li>This callus stone is hands down one of the best beauty products I have purchased.  </li>
      <li>and my heels look and feel fantastic.  </li>
      <li>stone is small but fits my hands perfectly.</li>
      <li>More gently than a rasp.  </li>
      <li>Does what you need it to do and lasts a good long time.  </li>
      <li>BTW, Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp Brown is really great on heavy callouses that don&#x27;t respond to a gentler approach.  </li>
      <li>At times,  I would cut pieces of my skin off, not so fun.</li>
      <li>Mr. Pumice was a pretty good one but by itself it leaves your feet rough.</li>
      <li>While still lathered, I applied the Green-side of the stone to my foot first, (the Green-side of the stone is rougher than the White-side), and, of course, you rub it across your heels, (or wherever), just like you would a Pumice</li>
      <li>This one is hands down my favorite one!</li>
      <li>I can say I pretty much have tried everything in the market for my feet.</li>
      <li>heels are soft and the price was about as good as any other stone.</li>
      <li>Stone is a much &#x27;finer&#x27; grit.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s real pumice stone.</li>
      <li>I said, I don&#x27;t know what this Stone is made of, but the Green-side is a tad rougher than the White-Side... but not by much.</li>
      <li>like THIS is really gonna work, geez&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I even use my specialized Vitamin A &amp; C Facial Serum and Moisturizer on my feet just to try to stay ahead of the game as best</li>
      <li>Not as effective as a plain pumice stone in removing calluses.</li>
      <li>Having unwrapped the package with little hope of the Stone working, (I&#x27;m quite sure I sighed fifty times whilst doing so), I stepped into my shower and first washed my feet.</li>
      <li>had hoped it would be at least slightly closer to the quality and effectiveness of their Pedro foot scrubber, which is the best I&#x27;ve used, but this is nowhere close.</li>
      <li>what&#x27;s one more fiver down the drain in my quest, eh?</li>
      <li>and you barely have to do anything for your feet to be super soft.</li>
      <li>I love the shape of this little guy.</li>
      <li>Water where I live has ruined my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun from Pumice stones to gritty Body Washes to various Lotions to taking special care and soaking them in one of those Foot-Bath contraptions.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t use the white mild side as much as the rough porous side.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, I cannot complain.</li>
      <li>but there is a considerable difference</li>
      <li>One side for really rubbing down the callous and the other side to make your skin smooth and soft afterward.  </li>
      <li>an aside, I bought this &#x27;Tweezerman Callus Smoothing Stone&#x27; at our local New Frontiers natural health-food store for $4.99.</li>
      <li>but, there ya go.s Smoothing Stone&#x27; at our local New Frontiers natural health-food store for $4.99.</li>
      <li>quickly applied the White-side of the stone to my foot, and then followed suit with this same procedure to my other foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Decided to buy several and give as gifts to people i live.</li>
      <li>It really does help keep my feet from being so dry and cracked.</li>
      <li>That makes it so much easier to really go to town on your feet, polishing away all the dead skin.</li>
      <li>One side is rough and the other side is to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>I did not have to scrub hard to get my feet smooth.</li>
      <li>I really expected more based on the reviews, or maybe I just have extra rough calluses compared to the other reviewers.</li>
      <li>This stone works pretty well but is a little smoother than I like.</li>
      <li>Indeed, when I first took it out of the package and felt the Stone on both the Green and White sides, it was so smoothe, I thought, &#x27;</li>
      <li>Just apply soap and use the green side first and then the white side.</li>
      <li>After unsuccesfully attempting to cure my dry, cracked, rough heels with a standard double sided callus remover, I bought this stone based on the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>And all thanks to this little</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m in our local New Frontiers health-food store the other day and, while standing in line at the checkout, my eye caught a rack that had this Stone on it.</li>

<li> , I&#x27;m in our local New Frontiers health-food store the other day and, while standing in line at the checkout, my eye caught a rack that had this Stone on it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not rough enough to quickly remove my rough foot skin, at least compared to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
<li> i guess i had expected something more dramatic, in terms of effectiveness.  </li>
<li> Other than a professional pedicure, that is.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how long these Stones last, but I&#x27;m not taking any chances.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t know the other side was green, but it didn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a long time.</li>
<li> It does work, just not very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
<li> My heels were cracked and dry and literacy had jagged edges.</li>
<li> Pumice was always so rough on my heels... too rough, too coarse.</li>
<li> I use it for my knees since it does not take off rough dry calluses on my feet.</li>
<li> one side a bit rougher to actually file the nail down; with the other side finer to smoothe-out the left-over rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The results last for a few weeks before having to do again.</li>
<li> This had absolutely no effect on my calluses.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t do what I expected from the reviews.</li>
<li> /&gt;Or, &#x27;not exactly gone, but not quite as rough as they were&#x27; gone, either.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have bought other stones, and this one to me gets the job done.  </li>
<li> I had very rough heels and nothing worked till I got and used this callus stone.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m gonna buy at least ten of them them and keep them stocked away.</li>
<li> This is no better or worse than the usual generic pumice stones you&#x27;ll find in the drugstore, just with a modest markup for the Tweezerman name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I never thought I&#x27;d see the day I found a product for less money at a brick-and-mortar store than here at Amazon...</li>
<li> I never thought I&#x27;d see the day I found a product for less money at a brick-and-mortar store than here at Amazon...</li>
<li> /&gt;In one fell-swoop, this little Stone has wiped away my calloused feet, my tears from those cracked and bleeding callouses, my frustration in trying to find a product that actually worked, and my resentful resignation that calloused feet were my sad lot in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works surprisingly well.  Much better than a pumice.  More gently than a rasp.  BTW, Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp Brown is really great on heavy callouses that don&#x27;t respond to a gentler approach.  Between the Tweezerman product and the Microplane Rasp, callouses don&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
    <li> This product is a life changer for me. Decided to buy several and give as gifts to people i live.</li>
    <li> I love the shape of this little guy. It&#x27;s really easy to hold! That makes it so much easier to really go to town on your feet, polishing away all the dead skin. And rounded edges so no more slips and scraping yourself! I didn&#x27;t know the other side was green, but it didn&#x27;t really matter to me. I like the dual side idea but I don&#x27;t use the white mild side as much as the rough porous side. Happy overall, and my feet are happy too.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical but it works like a charm!  And the pricing cannot be more reasonble!  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is no better or worse than the usual generic pumice stones you&#x27;ll find in the drugstore, just with a modest markup for the Tweezerman name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped it would be at least slightly closer to the quality and effectiveness of their Pedro foot scrubber, which is the best I&#x27;ve used, but this is nowhere close. Of course the cost is over $10 cheaper than Pedro, but for what it is, this is still overpriced.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best pumice stone I have ever purchased!!!</li>
    <li> Well... it finally happened. I&#x27;m callous-free. And all thanks to this little Stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from badly calloused heels ever since I moved to the mountains... some 10-years ago. So badly in fact, that my heels would actually crack and bleed every winter season, *sigh*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun from Pumice stones to gritty Body Washes to various Lotions to taking special care and soaking them in one of those Foot-Bath contraptions. Yes, I sprung for the cost of one in the hopes I would find relief, (it didn&#x27;t happen of course, as far as my callouses went; but the hot water and zzzzzz-vibration-thingy did feel wonderful, *lol*). I even use my specialized Vitamin A &amp; C Facial Serum and Moisturizer on my feet just to try to stay ahead of the game as best I can. But, the callouses are still there... catching on my hosiery, socks, slippers, bed sheets, even the carpet... ugh!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m in our local New Frontiers health-food store the other day and, while standing in line at the checkout, my eye caught a rack that had this Stone on it. Of course, I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I&#x27;ve wasted over the years on whatever devise/lotion and whatnot has been proffered concerning calloused feet but, I thought, what the hell... what&#x27;s one more fiver down the drain in my quest, eh? So... I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOD!!! Having unwrapped the package with little hope of the Stone working, (I&#x27;m quite sure I sighed fifty times whilst doing so), I stepped into my shower and first washed my feet. While still lathered, I applied the Green-side of the stone to my foot first, (the Green-side of the stone is rougher than the White-side), and, of course, you rub it across your heels, (or wherever), just like you would a Pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt my heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be? Am I being deceived? Do I dare hope? Is that &#x27;SMOOTHNESS&#x27; I feel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly applied the White-side of the stone to my foot, and then followed suit with this same procedure to my other foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it. ALL MY CALLOUSES ARE GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I mean GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not, &#x27;mostly&#x27; gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, &#x27;kinda&#x27; gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, &#x27;not exactly gone, but not quite as rough as they were&#x27; gone, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I MEAN GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one fell-swoop, this little Stone has wiped away my calloused feet, my tears from those cracked and bleeding callouses, my frustration in trying to find a product that actually worked, and my resentful resignation that calloused feet were my sad lot in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what this Stone is made of. It&#x27;s different than a Pumice stone. Pumice was always so rough on my heels... too rough, too coarse. And it never got rid of the callouses! Oh, it would smoothe them somewhat, but they were always still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Stone is a much &#x27;finer&#x27; grit. Indeed, when I first took it out of the package and felt the Stone on both the Green and White sides, it was so smoothe, I thought, &#x27;Oh, yeah... like THIS is really gonna work, geez&#x27;. I saw my fiver circling the drain, *lol*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m eating those words today... and quite happily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I don&#x27;t know what this Stone is made of, but the Green-side is a tad rougher than the White-Side... but not by much. It reminded me of the nail files we lasses use... one side a bit rougher to actually file the nail down; with the other side finer to smoothe-out the left-over rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m sold for life. I don&#x27;t know how long these Stones last, but I&#x27;m not taking any chances. I&#x27;m gonna buy at least ten of them them and keep them stocked away. Why? Cuz, dontcha know, every time you find a product you love, they discontinue it. Well, I don&#x27;t wanna turn 70 and not have these Stones for my feet. Besides, even if they do remain on the market, by the time I&#x27;m 70, they&#x27;ll cost $30-bucks-a-piece!!! *lol*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I bought this &#x27;Tweezerman Callus Smoothing Stone&#x27; at our local New Frontiers natural health-food store for $4.99. I never thought I&#x27;d see the day I found a product for less money at a brick-and-mortar store than here at Amazon... but, there ya go.s Smoothing Stone&#x27; at our local New Frontiers natural health-food store for $4.99. I never thought I&#x27;d see the day I found a product for less money at a brick-and-mortar store than here at Amazon... but, there ya go.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what I expected from the reviews.</li>
    <li> Does what you need it to do and lasts a good long time.  I like the two sides of the stone block too.  One side for really rubbing down the callous and the other side to make your skin smooth and soft afterward.  I will buy this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> This had absolutely no effect on my calluses. Next!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Water where I live has ruined my skin. This stone has made my feet soooooo smooth! Other stones did not work.!!!</li>
    <li> Works way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried on my callused heels. I feel like I should stock a couple in case i can&#x27;t find it again.</li>
    <li> I can say I pretty much have tried everything in the market for my feet. I love wearing sandals and I love having nice looking nails to go along with my sandals. Mr. Pumice was a pretty good one but by itself it leaves your feet rough. The eggs were pretty good.  At times,  I would cut pieces of my skin off, not so fun. I had a wand that came with different heads. This one is simple. It has two sides. One side is rough and the other side is to smooth it out. This one is hands down my favorite one!</li>
    <li> I really expected more based on the reviews, or maybe I just have extra rough calluses compared to the other reviewers. I use it for my knees since it does not take off rough dry calluses on my feet.</li>
    <li> As a stay at home mum, I hardly ever get the chance to get a pedicure. I had planned to get one before summer but days rolled into months and I couldn&#x27;t get the time so I looked for a stone for a DIY pedi. I got this by chance, irritated that I had to pay for shipping but this is the best buy I have gotten in ages!&lt;br /&gt;This stone is small but fits my hands perfectly. I did not have to scrub hard to get my feet smooth. It hangs in the bath and has not disintegrated yet.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I cannot complain. I plan to stock up on this.... just in case.</li>
    <li> Amazing- read the great reviews. This works !! My heels were cracked and dry and literacy had jagged edges. This cured it. I have tried every cream, razor and pedicure and this is the only thing that worked.</li>
    <li> i guess i had expected something more dramatic, in terms of effectiveness.  the stone is nice looking and easy to hold, but the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; surface side is awfully mild.</li>
    <li> Just apply soap and use the green side first and then the white side. It really does help keep my feet from being so dry and cracked.</li>
    <li> Not as impressed as I thought I would be, but it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;My heels are soft and the price was about as good as any other stone.</li>
    <li> Best callous remover I have purchased. An easy and effective callous remover, leaves feet, elbows, knees and hands very smooth</li>
    <li> Not as effective as a plain pumice stone in removing calluses.</li>
    <li> I hate to give away this great secret because I&#x27;m afraid everyone is gonna order it and they&#x27;ll run out. It&#x27;s the best out of all pumice stones and I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s real pumice stone. I don&#x27;t know why or how it works it just does.</li>
    <li> I have bought other stones, and this one to me gets the job done.  The results last for a few weeks before having to do again.</li>
    <li> This stone is awesome. I can see the difference in just 4-5 days of use. Recommend this over any other expensive products.</li>
    <li> This is a magic stone. It works so well and you barely have to do anything for your feet to be super soft. Loved it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a long time. I had very rough heels and nothing worked till I got and used this callus stone.</li>
    <li> I liked it -  does the job well.</li>
    <li> Other than a professional pedicure, that is.  This stone thingy is absolutely amazing and my feet no longer stick like Velcro to the carpeting.  Yippee!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend and she was amazed as this has been the only callus stone she&#x27;s used that&#x27;s actually worked for her.</li>
    <li> This stone works pretty well but is a little smoother than I like. It&#x27;s not rough enough to quickly remove my rough foot skin, at least compared to what I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s very smooth. It does work, just not very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
    <li> After unsuccesfully attempting to cure my dry, cracked, rough heels with a standard double sided callus remover, I bought this stone based on the positive reviews.  This callus stone is hands down one of the best beauty products I have purchased.  I have only used a couple of times after a shower but there is a considerable difference and my heels look and feel fantastic.  The size and shape of the stone also makes it very easy to use, no awkward handle.  A must have for your beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
