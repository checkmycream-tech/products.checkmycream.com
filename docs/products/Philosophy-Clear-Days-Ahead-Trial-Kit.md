      <li>Great brand and works wonders!</li>
      <li>I like the spot treatment serum the best!</li>
      <li>And the best part is the products are all made with salicylic acid, not benzoyl peroxide, so no bleached clothes or bedding!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m beyond impressed.</li>
      <li>Great deal and works great!</li>
      <li>pimple serum works incredible</li>
      <li>Very satisfied!</li>
      <li>Great for oily</li>
      <li>great product and</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still seeing great results.</li>
      <li>packed great and as described.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>this worked great.</li>
      <li>I even use the face wash on my shoulders in the shower and it works great for that too.</li>
      <li>Loving this kit!</li>
      <li>I read good reviews about this and thats why i decided to try it out</li>
      <li>Ahead Trial Kit is good to try out the product without spending too much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It also smelled good, but I will not be using this product again.</li>
      <li>After researching the Philosophy line, I figured it would be a good kit to try</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to treat their skin problems, as I can already tell it is a good product</li>
      <li>good luck n</li>
      <li>, it didn&#x27;t do me any good.</li>
      <li>I use in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;The Fast-Acting Salicylic Acid Acne Spot Treatment was good to have</li>
      <li>It  smells really good</li>
      <li>This is the best results I have had from an acne product, it is pricey for the full size kit</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>got to love technology!)</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing that Philosophy sells its own toner and exfoliant</li>
      <li>The bonus part is that it also smells nice.</li>
      <li>However, since I added my own moisturizer + sunscreen for the day, it has been OK.</li>
      <li>I would also recommend using an additional moisturizer in the morning, and making sure to use a nice night cream -</li>
      <li>the moisturizer seems to be very effective, and that goes on first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At that point I was able to increase the treatments to 2x per day.  </li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena Naturals as an addition to the Philosophy treatment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, that&#x27;s my report :)</li>
      <li>after reviewing online for a while i noticed this kits was reveled by so many people.</li>
      <li>Had I stuck with it longer and ordered another kit, I probably would have had more things to say.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people.</li>
      <li>I plan on trying one more month of it before i give up.</li>
      <li>Oil-Free Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment &amp; Moisturizer was ok</li>
      <li>Now things really do look great.</li>
      <li>Maybe you will have better luck if you can stick with it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this skincare system.  </li>
      <li>My favorite pieces are the moisturizer and spot treatment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m determined to use for the thirty days I paid for and see if it gets better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the soap is great, and it doesnt leave my skin as tight as the neutrogena oil free acne wash (this is a good thing!)</li>
      <li>- I sure will be buying more of it, it&#x27;s worth the price (and also cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sephora)!&lt;br</li>
      <li>but if you order it be sure to order the moisturizer in full size.</li>
      <li>My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect, but I actually feel like I can step out of the house without makeup and still feel pretty.</li>
      <li>not to mention my skin is oily with huge pores.</li>
      <li>, it was too light</li>
      <li>my forehead is finally smooth again.</li>
      <li>but if thats it I am thrilled, to have clear skin and to be free of the Acutane curse!</li>
      <li>But so far it&#x27;s not looking good.</li>
      <li>The face wash and cream/pads are much more gentle than what I had been using, and my face already felt better.</li>
      <li>I was so excited about using this product.</li>
      <li>Just be patient with the beginning side effects because the result is well worth it!</li>
      <li>My skin looked so much better the morning after my first use.</li>
      <li>small for the price but the best deal for all products.</li>
      <li>After reading the many positive reviews here, I was excited to give this a try.</li>
      <li>I believe this product depends on your skin type and how clean you keep your skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing so far!</li>
      <li>I will probably order the cleanser in full size.</li>
      <li>be purchasing the full size bottles</li>
      <li>The full size product is pricey</li>
      <li>I made sure to follow the directions precisely  and by the second day there was noticable improvement:)</li>
      <li>I am older and love Philosophy products...</li>
      <li>Maybe just mild acne.</li>
      <li>i saw a couple of blogs mention this line, and since i was able to get a trial size for a decent price, i gave it a shot.</li>
      <li>Every other part of my face is just fine acne wise.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 5 weeks now and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite</li>
      <li>the face wash is very good and has helped with the break outs, and there seems to be enough to last a full 30 days.</li>
      <li>I was really good at maintaining the regimen at first and then missed a few days when I wasn&#x27;t able to tell a difference.</li>
      <li>, I think I&#x27;m going to purchase a more natural face</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
      <li>love this- helped clear up my son&#x27;s face.  </li>
      <li>but I apply a second moisturizer (aside from their own moisturizer)</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it promises...and quickly.</li>
      <li>Right now, I am working on clearing up the acne on my chin.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right, NONE.</li>
      <li>Thus far she has experienced no trouble with these products and they appear to be comparable to On A Clear Day.  </li>
      <li>it shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>I followed the Philosophy application directions exactly.</li>
      <li>I love Philosophy&#x27;s products and use them on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the whole kit was useful and convenient for travel use.</li>
      <li>just looks pretty.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that cleared my face up :)</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m getting married soon</li>
      <li>This product really works!  </li>
      <li>First time using this product and could see a difference in a couple days.</li>
      <li>caution is that it can be very drying if used twice a day right off the bat.</li>
      <li>It could really use an additional oil free moisturizer to complete the set.</li>
      <li>the product overall didnt really work for me, but the spot control is very useful and works!</li>
      <li>Since my daughter has sensitive skin I sent this trial kit for her to try before purchasing full size products.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the product overall didnt really work for me, but the spot control is very useful and works!</li>
    <li> The products in this kit have really helped cleared up my skin without the redness and irritation that I get from other products.  I use the cleanser in the morning and use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity cleanser in the evenings.  When I&#x27;m suffering from a particularly stubborn breakout, I use the spot treatment during the day or the moisturizer during the day and the treatment pads at night. The combination of those two products really takes care of any breakouts. If you suffer from irritation from products sold in drug stores, you should definitely give this a shot. While the price might be a little high, I&#x27;ve had this kit for 3 months and I still have product left. With all of the products, a little goes a long way so this kit could easily last 3 or 4 months.</li>
    <li> This product is working very well with my combination skin and would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> This product really works!  This works better than Proactive, hands down! I didnt have any irritation, no excessive drying, I&#x27;ve seen a decrease in the amount of break outs and the length of a time a break out would stay around.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Omg tried so many products from pro active to clean and clear and nothing has given me results like this. I love it! I know a few reviews said dried out skin but I actually didn&#x27;t has this problem. I have very sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I have had the most awful acne my entire life. I get cystic acne, surface acne, blackheads etc. not to mention my skin is oily with huge pores. Basically, God thought it would be funny to give me terrible skin. I have tried everything from proactive to actual prescriptions, nothing has ever worked. I ordered this on a whim and I&#x27;m beyond impressed. After 3 days of use my ski started itching and getting dry. I guess from where it was drying out my pores. By day 8 I had no acne what so ever and my pores were almost invisible by day 14. I will never use anything else!! The full size product is pricey but I just buy one trial kit a month, it&#x27;s way cheaper. If you are looking for an acne wash that will really clear your skin, this is it! Just be patient with the beginning side effects because the result is well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that cleared my face up :)</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy&#x27;s products and use them on a daily basis. I was really excited upon receiving this kit but was skeptical when it claimed to clear up acne significantly within 3 days. I made sure to follow the directions precisely  and by the second day there was noticable improvement:) Following the directions I began to gradually increase the times I use the product daily, so by the third day I applied the cleanser, moisturizer, and spot treatment in the morning and the cleanser and treatment pad before bed. I noticed my skin was a little irritated and red but paid little attention. The next morning when I looked in the mirror I noticed my skin had peeled around my nose and underneath my left eyebrow. AHH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this experience I always thought of my face as being oily, I am a teen afterall, but after some research I discovered having combination skin is really normal! Meaning some parts of my face are dry (cheeks, nose, etc) and some areas are oily (t-zone of course). I was a little scared off for a few days but have gradually begun applying a small amount of cleanser around my t-zone and some acne spot treatment when needed. In addition to the small amount of this product I&#x27;ll put on my face daily, I think I&#x27;m going to purchase a more natural face cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn&#x27;t feel like reading my review here are just a few pros and cons:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Does clear up acne in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;- Trustworthy product overall.&lt;br /&gt;- Great for oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not good for sensitive skin, as product is very strong.&lt;br /&gt;- May lead to peeling D:</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after reading a few reviews.  My middle age skin was suddenly acting worse than my teen age skin had! But I&#x27;ve been using the system for a month now, and have not seen any improvement.  It may be that my problem is deeper than &amp;#34;surface&amp;#34;, so I&#x27;ll be seeing a dermatologist.  At least the products did not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about using this product. The make up artists in Sephora made it seem like it was the greatest thing. I was assured that it would start working in 3 days, here I am two weeks into strictly using the product properly and nothing. It&#x27;s gotten worse if anything. Not buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have had moderate to terrible acne since I was 11 years old, I am now in my late 20&#x27;s. I went through my teen years on Acutane, and after I got married I went off of that last year, and now my face has been awful again with the cystic demons that pop up all over my face.  I have tried every major maker of acne product, except for Philosophy, and when I was showering with some margarita body wash, it gave me an epiphany to see if they made an acne, and I found this. I used as directed in the morning and at night, I coupled the cleaning with a Clarisonic with the deep pore brush, but within a week, no new break outs (the first time in over a year), my pores had decreased in size and were barely there, my redness had decreased and was no very easy to manage with makeup and after 2 weeks of use was gone! This is the best results I have had from an acne product, it is pricey for the full size kit but it has worked for me, I just hope my skin doesn&#x27;t get used to it, but I am so pleased with the results, I have had in the 30 days 1 small white head on my chin but if thats it I am thrilled, to have clear skin and to be free of the Acutane curse!</li>
    <li> If you feel your skin is at all sensitive do NOT use this product.  I used it ONE time.  I washed my face and used the moisturizing cream.  Two days later I ended up paying my dermatologist a lot of money to treat my chemical burns.  Apparently, my skin is too sensitive for this.  There really does need to be some sort of warning on this box.</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old and have always struggled with acne.  Usually my skin does not tolerate salcylic acid but this seemed gentler than average. Tried a lot of products over the years and this is one of the best.  The bonus part is that it also smells nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and, while I never had the face that was covered in massive pimples, I have consistently and simultaneously had cystic acne under/on my jaw, white heads on my chin, black heads on my nose, at least one big pimple on my cheek, at least one big pimple on my forehead, and those little itty-bitty under the skin pimples that make skin feel like sandpaper since I was about 17 (I was a late bloomer, acne-wise.). Supposedly, I have the kind of skin that ProActiv is supposed to work miracles on, but I saw little to no improvement with the product; the same goes for AcneFree and every other over-the-counter acne treatment system. If it is out there, I have tried it- homeopathic included. I have tried every prescription except Acutane and none of them affected my skin in the slightest, except to make my skin flaky and rash-ridden while somehow still maintaining its thick, oily sheen; this goes for ProActiv and AcneFree, as well. I have tried giving up alcohol, going vegan, going organic, going sans-makeup, and giving up my occasional cigar, each for at least 3 months at the time; nothing has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy has changed my life. It is worth the price if you are an adult woman who is tired of getting carded for cigars when you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup. It&#x27;s not flattering. It&#x27;s embarrassing. My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect, but I actually feel like I can step out of the house without makeup and still feel pretty. I didn&#x27;t think I would ever feel that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH! ALSO, I have SUPER sensitive skin; like, if you look at me wrong I get a rash. I have blepharitis and super horrible allergies. If I wear the wrong makeup my face swells up like a basketball. I texted a picture of it to my dad once and he immediately commanded me to go to the hospital; my dad&#x27;s not the overprotective type, either. Anywho, Philosophy is the only product to which I have had, brace yourself, ZERO adverse reactions. That&#x27;s right, NONE. I don&#x27;t dry out, get flaky, develop a rash, swell up to the size of sports equipment, or even itch. I just get clear skin. Freaking. Fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could preach forever, but hey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. What do you have to lose? You&#x27;re going to spend the money on some form of acne treatment, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if you don&#x27;t glob it into your hand, the trial size should last you a month. The chick who said she&#x27;s been cutting her little pad things in half has the right idea. I actually did the same thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month now and I feel that it is helping a bit.  The first week was rough.  Lots of dry itchy skin with peeling that followed.  During the second week my skin started getting used to the product and the drying improved.  At that point I was able to increase the treatments to 2x per day.  I&#x27;m happy enough that I will continue using it, especially while having active breakouts.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;use ance.org instead. it is a miracle. the price of it is very resonable too.&lt;br /&gt;I finally found a product that really works for me. go to acne.org.</li>
    <li> Great product. Speedy delivery. Seems to be working well. My skin is a bit dry, but noticeable clearer. I recommend that you use a philosophy moisturizer with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid forties and still suffer from cystic acne...annoying. I have tried and used everything out there from accutane to proactive.  A friend I work with just started using Philosophy and her skin just looks pretty. So I ordered the Clear days ahead kit after reading the reviews. My skin looked so much better the morning after my first use. My skin was not ruddy and the cysts I had was so much smaller...Yay!!!  The drawback is that the products dried my skin out.  So I just ordered Purity skin cleanser and alternate between the two.  It&#x27;s only been a week but I think I&#x27;m going to be a Philosophy girl.  And because Philosophy is quite pricey, I will continue to order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line faithfully for almost a month and I have definitely seen a difference. My skin had lately been breaking out worse than it ever had in high school, and at age 25, I was tired of it! I had tried Proactiv, and other lines with no luck, plus bleached clothing and bedding. After researching the Philosophy line, I figured it would be a good kit to try (I was willing to try anything at this point, having been stuck in a rut of generic Target products). I have semi sensitive, combination oily/dry skin. After the first use, my skin felt much different. The face wash and cream/pads are much more gentle than what I had been using, and my face already felt better. And the best part is the products are all made with salicylic acid, not benzoyl peroxide, so no bleached clothes or bedding! The one downfall to this line is that is does dry out my skin, but I expect I will eventually adjust to that. For now, I use a small dab of a natural face serum lotion whenever it feels dry and that does the trick. And while I won&#x27;t claim that my skin is perfectly clear and a million times better, I definitely see an improvement in how it looks and feels compared to my old routine, just after three weeks of use, and I know if I continue, it will keep improving.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to treat their skin problems, as I can already tell it is a good product - I sure will be buying more of it, it&#x27;s worth the price (and also cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sephora)!&lt;br /&gt;*****Update******&lt;br /&gt;After writing my review, I kept using Philosophy, only to have my skin become more and more dried out. Even after using them every other day my skin was still so dry it was flaking and breaking out because of it. I stopped using all steps and now only use the morning lotion, and the face wash every few days. I have since switched to a different skin care brand, Andalou, and it has worked very well and does not dry my skin out at all.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product, when i first started using it my breakouts became worst and more frequent but after using it for three weeks they seemed to clear up. I believe this product depends on your skin type and how clean you keep your skin. I plan on trying one more month of it before i give up. It also came a week late to my house i am unsure why.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it promises...and quickly. After three days, I noticed a difference.  This is my new favorite</li>
    <li> I am older and love Philosophy products... This item dried out my face... Next time I will try some samples before making another purchase like this...</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great because it&#x27;s philosophy,but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for bad acne... Maybe just mild acne. It says clearer skin in three days and that it won&#x27;t over dry your skin. My skin was pretty bad, so I though I&#x27;d give it a shot. After two days my skin had never looked WORSE. But  it may have been my make up so I stopped using that. I&#x27;ve now been using it for a little over a week and I have seen a reduction in bumps but my skin is red, tight,extremely dry and peeling... It hurts! And along with the redness, it seems like my scars are really standing out. I&#x27;m determined to use for the thirty days I paid for and see if it gets better. But so far it&#x27;s not looking good.</li>
    <li> This has been clearing up my acne well!</li>
    <li> Not enough product for the 30 days. This product did not do any better than my previous regimen, I actually feel my skin got a lil worse. I give two stars because it was gentle in my skin and did not dry me out. It also smelled good, but I will not be using this product again. I need something a bit stronger for my acne and oily skin.</li>
    <li> I think my acne problem is on a whole other level. I read good reviews about this and thats why i decided to try it out, it didn&#x27;t do me any good. My acne isn&#x27;t even that BAD (thinking this was going to work for me) but its still there and I don&#x27;t like it :,( A friend recommended Clinique, so thats my next thing&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of facial products.  This really cleared my skin.</li>
    <li> Great brand and works wonders!</li>
    <li> this is quality product, but didn&#x27;t help much with my breakout. i still use the spot treatment once in a while, and sometimes the wash with my clarisonic (after i&#x27;ve removed makeup)</li>
    <li> Loving this kit! Since starting to use it my skin has noticeably cleared up and the hyperpigmentation left from old blemishes is fading quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only caution is that it can be very drying if used twice a day right off the bat. I had to cut back to once a day after initially using it too often, and since then my dryness had gone away and I&#x27;m still seeing great results. I may build up to twice a day again, but it might not be necessary. Also, half of one of the astringent pads is more than enough for my entire face so I&#x27;ve cut mine in half to make them last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I never had problems with acne until I hit my 30&#x27;s. I have been to dermatologists, tried numerous prescriptions and nothing really worked for me. I decided to give this a try. I noticed the change in my skin within a week off using. It&#x27;s been 5 weeks now and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time. I even use the face wash on my shoulders in the shower and it works great for that too. Give this product a chance. I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
    <li> So I have REALLY sensitive skin, but I have been breaking out only on my chin for a couple of years now. Every other part of my face is just fine acne wise. But I&#x27;m getting married soon so I decided it was time to figure this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the trial kit and while I don&#x27;t use the entire kit every day (I find it dries my skin out TOO much to use the cleanser, moisturizer, spot treatment, and overnight treatment EVERY day... ), I use at least some part of it once or twice every day. My favorite pieces are the moisturizer and spot treatment. I am considering going back to my old cleanser (which doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin) but still using the moisturizer and spot treatment, and the cleanser and overnight pads a couple times a week as part of a weekly deep exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, that&#x27;s my report :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and i&#x27;m disappointed to say the least. I&#x27;ve seen NO CHANGES in my skin and still have breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 and have been seeing a dermatologist for at least 10 years to try and treat cystic acne on my chin. I&#x27;ve tried numerous prescriptions, each of which would work for a while and then....nothing. I picked up this trial kit after my Aczone prescription made my chin explode into cystic acne.....when I got the kit I had about 10 painful bumps on my chin, and was getting one new pimple every. single. day.  After using the face wash, spot treatment and moisturizer in the morning, and the pads at night, I saw a major improvement in my skin after a month. The frequency with which I got pimples lessened, and they cleared up within two or three days as opposed to two weeks.  My spots from previous pimples also faded.  I did find that once I started using the pads twice a day, I got a weird itchy, burning rash on two small spots on my face. So I would recommend treading lightly to see how your skin will react - I&#x27;ve dialed back the treatment and the rash is healing with a daily application of cortisone cream.  I would also recommend using an additional moisturizer in the morning, and making sure to use a nice night cream - I love Neutrogena Naturals as an addition to the Philosophy treatment.</li>
    <li> I used Philosophy for two weeks. Did everything the directions said to do. It broke me out worse than I have ever broke up. I had cystic acne on my chin on both sides of my cheeks. Right now, I am working on clearing up the acne on my chin. I really felt bad about myself after using this trial kit. I would not recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> Even though it has only been a day I already like it! It  smells really good it doesn&#x27;t smell harsh like other face cleansers.And after using it my face isn&#x27;t back to being oily.</li>
    <li> Gave this a try because the Clinique 3-Step program had started not to work for me after a number of years using it. I followed the Philosophy application directions exactly. While I didn&#x27;t see the promised improvement in 3 days, nothing got worse which was a plus! The only problem I had was that my skin was oily feeling. I&#x27;d always used a toner before but since this kit didn&#x27;t include one, I&#x27;d not been using toner for 3 weeks. I began using my Clinique toner along with the Philosophy products at night, and the oiliness disappeared. Now things really do look great. I also use an exfoliant (also from Clinique) a few times a week. I&#x27;m guessing that Philosophy sells its own toner and exfoliant but since I had the Clinique at home that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne my whole life so i&#x27;m always looking for something to try. After reading the many positive reviews here, I was excited to give this a try. I used it for about 3 weeks, and it did not work. Even made my acne worse. I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people. Just not me</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any change in my skin from using this. I was really good at maintaining the regimen at first and then missed a few days when I wasn&#x27;t able to tell a difference. Maybe you will have better luck if you can stick with it. Atleast they have the trial sizes!</li>
    <li> I have very frustrating skin, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun and I had hoped I&#x27;d finally find a solution. the face wash is very good and has helped with the break outs, and there seems to be enough to last a full 30 days. However, everything else is WAY to small. I ran out of the moisturizer with in a week. It is also very drying, I have very oily skin but if I use it as instructed my face gets so dry if peels and burns. I would def recommend the face wash but if you order it be sure to order the moisturizer in full size.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this skincare system.  I have oily skin and this actually helps control the oil, relieve/prevent acne plus it makes my skin super soft.  I really only use the Clear Days Ahead products at night, combined with an exfoliating scrub (by Simple) and moisturizer (Olay Total Effects) in the morning.  Since I only use it at night it lasts much longer than one month (except for the wipes - there are only 30 of those). Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid thirties with okay skin that tends to be congested, but neither especially oily nor dry.  This has made a noticeable improvement in clogged pores and has generally reduced breakouts.  I did find the system as a whole too drying, but I use the moisturizer and the overnight treatment pad regularly.  The wash and the spot treatment I use much less frequently, and only as needed.</li>
    <li> Great product for my thirty something problem skin!  It cleared my face without drying it out or making it overly sensitive!</li>
    <li> I am 42 year old and have tried 100 different products to clear my adult acne.  Nothing has worked until I tired Philosophy&#x27;s Clear Days Ahead.  Within 2 weeks, my skin feels and looks like it did in my early 30&#x27;s.  I have had several people compliment my skin and I haven&#x27;t heard that in a very long time!</li>
    <li> Great deal and works great! Purchased this kit for my dtr and it has really helped her skin. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I did see some results after using this product.  Had I stuck with it longer and ordered another kit, I probably would have had more things to say.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used Philosophy&#x27;s On a Clear Day products for several years.  Recently philosophy discontinued that line and this \\&quot;Clear Days Ahead\\&quot; is the apparent replacement.  Since my daughter has sensitive skin I sent this trial kit for her to try before purchasing full size products.  Thus far she has experienced no trouble with these products and they appear to be comparable to On A Clear Day.  This kit is enough for approximately one month.  Will update at end of that time.</li>
    <li> A little pricy for something you could probably pick up at walmart. I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for the past week and the right side of my face has gotten clearer and spots have lightened, but the left side has gotten worse. Not sure on the reason behind this, maybe I sleep on my left side? I like the spot treatment serum the best! I would recommend trying other avenues and less expensive measures before purchasing this kit</li>
    <li> For years I have been trying everything to treat my acne. And this stuff works wonders. It does drys my face a little but I apply a second moisturizer (aside from their own moisturizer) I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> 49yo with adult acne.. this worked great.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter suffers from acne and this product has helped her. It has not taken her acne away completely but has cleared it up quite a bit. Unfortunately, the face wash just dried out her skin too much, even with using the moisturizer. Now she just uses the pads instead.</li>
    <li> great product and it shipped very fast. small for the price but the best deal for all products. packed great and as described.</li>
    <li> Dryies out my face if i use daily&lt;br /&gt;the pimple serum works incredible that is the only thing i like about this kit&lt;br /&gt;so next time i will just buy the pimple serum only</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised!  So far a month has passed and my skin is clearer.  However, I have not used the entire system: nighttime wash and cleansing pads, it still has made a difference.  I hesitated because of slight pealing at the start with the morning regimen, but will try incorporating the evening regimen within these next 30 days.  I hope it will all go away! Definitely worth the purchase.  But, the moisturizer is enough for only a month; one dollop will do ya...I guess!?!?  I&#x27;ve purchased full sizes of the entire system and will use the trial remnants for travel. Cheers!  (Micah&#x27;s wife(I)purchased and wrote this review, hick-up with web site from email connections...got to love technology!)</li>
    <li> love this- helped clear up my son&#x27;s face.  I use the wash and it has banished any acne I had.  I will def. be purchasing the full size bottles</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had bad oily/combo skin (lots of breakouts, long term acne scars, and lots of bumps underneath the surface that i could never clear out) since i was preteen- so about 10 years now. my mom has similar skin and has tried lots of different products, but her skin didnt clear up until she hit her 40s. i resigned myself to that same fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a particularly bad breakout i got fed up and decided to google what worked for other people; i figured my cheeks and forehead were so scarred up i had nothing to lose. i saw a couple of blogs mention this line, and since i was able to get a trial size for a decent price, i gave it a shot. it&#x27;s amazing so far! my skin calmed down within a week, and older scars lightened up faster than they normally would have. my forehead is finally smooth again. one area on my cheek thats been uneven and bumpy for quite some time has actually started to clear up from underneath, so its actually becoming smooth and the pores look smaller! i started to notice a difference after a week. i&#x27;m 3 weeks into this trial kit now, and my skin has maintained that improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the soap is great, and it doesnt leave my skin as tight as the neutrogena oil free acne wash (this is a good thing!) im not sure how well the pads work, since i&#x27;ve always tended to wake up with blemishes, instead of noticing them before bed-but i havent had a breakout in the 3 weeks i&#x27;ve used this kit. the only thing that doesnt seem to do much is the spot treatment; ive read that other people love it, but it didnt seem like it did much for me- the moisturizer seems to be very effective, and that goes on first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, i&#x27;d say give it a shot if nothing else has been working for you- you might be pleasantly surprised (i was!).</li>
    <li> Made my skin worse! Would not reccomend if you hav really oil skin good luck n ur acne up n downs</li>
    <li> I have normal-to-dry skin, and I found and this kit painfully dried out my skin. It could really use an additional oil free moisturizer to complete the set. However, since I added my own moisturizer + sunscreen for the day, it has been OK.</li>
    <li> after reviewing online for a while i noticed this kits was reveled by so many people. i dont have terrible acne, just a break out here and there. in the end this make my skin feel brand new with little to know effort. balances out my tone, and the kit includes everything i need!</li>
    <li> This Philosophy Clear Days Ahead Trial Kit is good to try out the product without spending too much.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Overnight Repair Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment Pads, its thin and soft, it&#x27;s not abrasive. My skin feels softer in the morning and the redness disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;The Oil-Free Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment &amp; Moisturizer was ok, it was too light so I&#x27;m having to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;The Oil-Free Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment Cleanser I use in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;The Fast-Acting Salicylic Acid Acne Spot Treatment was good to have but I didn&#x27;t have much use for it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the whole kit was useful and convenient for travel use. I will probably order the cleanser in full size.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and could see a difference in a couple days.</li>
