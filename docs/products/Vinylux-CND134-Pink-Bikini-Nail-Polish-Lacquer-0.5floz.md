      <li>It is removed easily with acetone, no soaking!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colors of Vinylux.</li>
      <li>I love this polish.</li>
      <li>I love this brand of nail polish</li>
      <li>but I do like gel better for the strength it provides the nails.</li>
      <li>Love it and get plenty of compliments.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Love this color and love this polish.</li>
      <li>So pretty!!!</li>
      <li>Good nail polish and a great bright hot pink color.</li>
      <li>Color stayed true and shiny for more than a week.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it for doing my own pedicures.  </li>
      <li>I loved the color and the staying on longer than a day or 2 before the chips started however after using for 3 weeks and removing my polish this last time my nails were stained with the color.  </li>
      <li>It goes on and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Color is not as dark/vibrant as the picture but still very pretty.</li>
      <li>Love, love the nail polish looks very nice on my complexion, got a few compliments from only wearing it once....</li>
      <li>a bright pink that isn&#x27;t too neon.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect pink for me!</li>
      <li>This is the most durable polish that I&#x27;ve found short of doing gel nails.</li>
      <li>Dries fast too!</li>
      <li>Stayed on pretty well after I got it on.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time using Vinylux.  </li>
      <li>Great long lasting polish!</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly, and the product did not work for me.  </li>
      <li>have this polish in 9 colors and absolutely am hooked!</li>
      <li>Although the color was very pretty and did last for a week, the polish stained my nails since there is no base coat.</li>
      <li>It is such a great pink color for summer.</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
      <li>When I use it with the vinylux topcoat it lasts about 5 days on my nails which is better than the normal polishes which usually last about 3 days on my nails before chipping.</li>
      <li>Very close to Strawberry Daiquiri.</li>
      <li>before it showed too much wear.</li>
      <li>Really lasts a week.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;barbie&#x27; pink.</li>
      <li>I will say that the polish dried incredibly fast which was nice.,</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need a uv light, just put on and dry in 8 minutes.....</li>
      <li>So far the pink bikini polish is my favorite color from the Vinylux line.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend for durability.</li>
      <li>love that this polish dries fast and hard like the gel without using the UV lights to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I find this polish will last a week if you properly prepare your nails - make sure they are clear of any old polish and wash with soap and dry your nails right before applying polish.  </li>
      <li>Lasts 2weeks on busy hands ...longer on ties!</li>
      <li>This color is a very pretty pink.</li>
      <li>it dries and hardens with natural light.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It does stain your natural nails an orange color</li>
      <li>I have invested in several colors and the price is beyond reasonable.</li>
      <li>and I had a little trouble putting it on - if you use more than one brush stroke it wipes off the first stroke.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps my expectations were too high, since I regularly wear OPI Gel Color on my nails.  </li>
      <li>This really does last as long as advertised.</li>
      <li>This probably wouldn&#x27;t be a big issue with the paler colors but you can&#x27;t just go to &#x27;clear&#x27; nails w/o the stain.</li>
      <li>You have to put it on pretty quickly because otherwise you&#x27;ll have weird drying patterns on your nail.</li>
      <li>There is no base coat so with weak nails that I have</li>

    <li> Perhaps my expectations were too high, since I regularly wear OPI Gel Color on my nails.  I hoped to get at least seven solid days of wear out of this system, but it wears (chips) just like regular nail polish on me.  Also, since you &amp;#34;don&#x27;t need&amp;#34; a base coat, this color also slightly stained my nails.</li>
    <li> This polish says that it will last for 7 days...my color only lasted for 2 before it began chipping.  I followed the instructions exactly, and the product did not work for me.  I like the color, but I wish that it would have stayed on for the entire cycle as advertised.  I will say that the polish dried incredibly fast which was nice.,</li>
    <li> It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of nail polish and I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect pink for me! This is not the color that it appears to be online but in person it&#x27;s like a bubblegum pink. So pretty!!!</li>
    <li> Polish works great and lasted about 10 days on my finger nails. before it showed too much wear. Lasted even longer on my toe nails. The &amp;#34;Pink Bikini&amp;#34; color does not look anything like it is pictured. It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;barbie&#x27; pink. I knew this ahead of time before I ordered it since I picked the color at the nail salon so I am happy with the color.</li>
    <li> The color covers nicely!</li>
    <li> Great nail polish.  Color is not as dark/vibrant as the picture but still very pretty.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors of Vinylux. It is such a great pink color for summer. I will be getting a lot of wear out of this shade!</li>
    <li> Really lasts a week. Dries fast too! I won&#x27;t be using any other polish. My job is really hard on manicures but this polish goes the distance! Stands up to lots of hand washing and glove wearing! I have invested in several colors and the price is beyond reasonable. It is removed easily with acetone, no soaking! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this polish. The color is great!  Very close to Strawberry Daiquiri. I purchased 2 colors and I am happy with both.  I mainly use it for doing my own pedicures.  The color lasts for 2-3 weeks and does not chip. It does work best if you use a top coat. After placing my order, it took about 1 week to arrive.  I am very pleased with this seller and I would purchase from them again. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Great summer color and dries so quickly! You have to put it on pretty quickly because otherwise you&#x27;ll have weird drying patterns on your nail. Really happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Although the color was very pretty and did last for a week, the polish stained my nails since there is no base coat.</li>
    <li> I loved the color and the staying on longer than a day or 2 before the chips started however after using for 3 weeks and removing my polish this last time my nails were stained with the color.  There is no base coat so with weak nails that I have it evidently seeps into the weak bed.  I won&#x27;t be using this any longer and gone back to Nailtiques/OPI.  This probably wouldn&#x27;t be a big issue with the paler colors but you can&#x27;t just go to &#x27;clear&#x27; nails w/o the stain. Sad.</li>
    <li> Terrible! It peels away. Within a day, it was peeling off. Definitely not &amp;#34;weekly&amp;#34; polish. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting polish!</li>
    <li> This really does last as long as advertised. Color stayed true and shiny for more than a week.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to gel and shellac at the salon so this is a perfect alternative! this polish lasts several days longer than OPI without chipping and losing shine.  the lighter colors I can wear easily as long as 10 days without looking bad and the darker colors I can go about 7-10 days with a little touch up to last longer. OPI usually only lasts about 5 days without chipping or fading in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this polish dries fast and hard like the gel without using the UV lights to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;. it dries and hardens with natural light.&lt;br /&gt;I have this polish in 9 colors and absolutely am hooked!</li>
    <li> This polish does what it claims.  It stays on with only little wear for 7 days.  Love it and get plenty of compliments.</li>
    <li> So far the pink bikini polish is my favorite color from the Vinylux line.  ITs a bright pink that isn&#x27;t too neon.  It does stain your natural nails an orange color but since I paint my nails opaque colors this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I have tried to use the CND sticky base coat but I found it doesn&#x27;t pair well with the Vinylux products.</li>
    <li> Best polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  Lasts 2weeks on busy hands ...longer on ties!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  It goes on and dries quickly.  I find this polish will last a week if you properly prepare your nails - make sure they are clear of any old polish and wash with soap and dry your nails right before applying polish.  This color is a very pretty pink.</li>
    <li> Good nail polish and a great bright hot pink color. When I use it with the vinylux topcoat it lasts about 5 days on my nails which is better than the normal polishes which usually last about 3 days on my nails before chipping.</li>
    <li> Gel nails without a trip to the spa!!  Don&#x27;t need a uv light, just put on and dry in 8 minutes.....no smudges and lasts a week!</li>
    <li> Love this color and love this polish. This is the most durable polish that I&#x27;ve found short of doing gel nails. It holds up for two to three week on average for me, and I&#x27;m not gentle on my nails.</li>
    <li> Love, love the nail polish looks very nice on my complexion, got a few compliments from only wearing it once....</li>
    <li> This product line is amazing!  As a nurse, my hands are constantly in water and my manicure lasted a week!  Highly recommend for durability.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Vinylux.  It is a strange consistency and I had a little trouble putting it on - if you use more than one brush stroke it wipes off the first stroke.  Stayed on pretty well after I got it on.  I would use it again but I do like gel better for the strength it provides the nails.</li>
    <li> Application is the same as any other nail polish, the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me (I am VERY hard on my nails). Other reviews talk about an nightly applications of oil, which I am not doing so maybe the polish would last longer if I did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can change my polish weekly without dedicating an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to UV rays. The color selection is fairly vast with this product. I have recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so as well as continue to purchase and use the product myself.</li>
    <li> Great color but no matter what I do it chips a few days in. Be advised you cannot return this even if not used.</li>
