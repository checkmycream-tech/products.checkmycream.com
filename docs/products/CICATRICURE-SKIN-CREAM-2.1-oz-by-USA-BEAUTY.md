      <li>but, I just love the feeling of smoth and moist skin...</li>
      <li>so it takes a while to absorb into the skin, maybe the gel would be better to go under makeup</li>
      <li>I will buy another one!!!I HAVE THREE MORE FRIENDS USING THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;laser\\&quot; significance of a change, but it is a change and worth it!!</li>
      <li>I like this cream my face looks smooth.</li>
      <li>I am 54 years old and am VERY pleased.</li>
      <li>You just have to use it as it says and absolutely works:)</li>
      <li>It really comes in handy for a lot of things, since I am young, (not intended for wrinkles)</li>
      <li>well hello soft smoth skin, also goodbye acne, (did not have much but every once, one here and there), great for dry skin</li>
      <li>Very caring!  </li>
      <li>Anyways I tried cicatricure skin cream and from the first time I put it on my face</li>
      <li>I had really dry skin, I&#x27;ve tried many different creams and most of them made my face shiny or greasy and gave me acne...</li>
      <li>Is a really working cream for what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would work this fast</li>
      <li>My mom is 58 used this product I really noticed the difference in just weeks</li>
      <li>but I would recommend the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; version because it is a lot more light weight and do not have to wait a long time for it to dry!</li>
      <li>It does smell kind of weird, not bad just different, when you first put it on but that goes away</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like too much was the smell, now, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell that good either, tho the smell goes away after 10mins or so.</li>

    <li> Doesn´t work!! False ad</li>
    <li> Very good cream for sensitive skin  will recomend to my firends</li>
    <li> Is working. I have been used for a month and I seen the different.</li>
    <li> My mom is 58 used this product I really noticed the difference in just weeks I will start using it too</li>
    <li> I use this product for the scars that my pimples leave behind or have left, and it works!! it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;laser\\&quot; significance of a change, but it is a change and worth it!! It also speeds up the process on \\&quot;new\\&quot; pimples!!! I apply asap!! It really comes in handy for a lot of things, since I am young, (not intended for wrinkles) wrinkle-use I cannot vouch for that area! &#x3D;) but I would recommend the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; version because it is a lot more light weight and do not have to wait a long time for it to dry!</li>
    <li> good cream to soften scars</li>
    <li> Make me burn and redness of my face</li>
    <li> I like this cream my face looks smooth.</li>
    <li> I wish I had taken before and after shots, been using this product for 30 days and have had great results, frown lines greatly diminished along with improved skin texture and tone. I am 54 years old and am VERY pleased. BTW, i bought this same size at Walgreens for $14.99.</li>
    <li> Very caring!  Good delevery!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Is a really working cream for what it says it does. You just have to use it as it says and absolutely works:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been three weeks and I can already see a difference in the depth of my acne scars. I didn&#x27;t think it would work this fast and I wish I would have had this back in middle school. It does smell kind of weird, not bad just different, when you first put it on but that goes away or maybe you just get use to it. It&#x27;s kind of a thicker cream so it takes a while to absorb into the skin, maybe the gel would be better to go under makeup but I just put it on before I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> Really good i look 10 years younger now .</li>
    <li> met expectations, I recommend this seller</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> The product looks that is making a difference in my face, I am starting to like. It was delivery on time but I was a little disappointed for the delivery charges to high.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference, yet</li>
    <li> The best face cream ever.</li>
    <li> I hraed this is great for wrikles so im going to try it i will let you know is also great for burnes and othet things</li>
    <li> Very good product!!! I loved. I will buy another one!!!I HAVE THREE MORE FRIENDS USING THIS PRODUCT AND THEY ARE IN LOVE!</li>
    <li> have used it for three months, have not seen or feel any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Received the package, and my wife is happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Very good cream, no problems with the vendor :-)</li>
    <li> I did not like the lotion cicatricure, it made my skin feel horrible and it made me get acne as soon as I started using it. I had never had acne until I started using it. I feel like I wasted my money on this product and would want it back.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had really dry skin, I&#x27;ve tried many different creams and most of them made my face shiny or greasy and gave me acne... Anyways I tried cicatricure skin cream and from the first time I put it on my face I felt the difference, well hello soft smoth skin, also goodbye acne, (did not have much but every once, one here and there), great for dry skin and it seems to help wrinkles too, did not see too much difference in the few lines I have but, I just love the feeling of smoth and moist skin... The only thing I didn&#x27;t like too much was the smell, now, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell that good either, tho the smell goes away after 10mins or so. So Yes I DO RECOMMEND IT!</li>
