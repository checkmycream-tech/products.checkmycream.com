    <li> EXCELLENT IN EVERY RESPECT!  SELLER A+++</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years &amp; still love that it keeps me regular even now when my metabolism is slowing down.</li>
    <li> I have a balanced digestive system thanks to this product, I use it daily and it keeps my very poor digestive system working as it should. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Purchase these in the four pack and save a little bit of money. I take these to have a regular bowel movement every day. Works amazing. Also shared them with a friend of mine who was having stomach issues and she said they worked for her as well.</li>
    <li> I use this to help make bowel movements.  I have since gone for a major colon purging and now I don&#x27;t have to use this product anymore, but it was very useful for many years prior.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; acted like it had a mind of it&#x27;s own...It leaned in one direction over the course of a week, then shifted in the opposite. Back &amp; forth it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking this product (one capsule a day) since Oct &#x27;12, You might say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m now a regular kinda guy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have used for more than 2 years now and well satisfied----if you have this related issue the I recommend this Product!!!</li>
    <li> Very effective and works. Not harsh or cramping at all, no side effects. You can use everyday am and pm</li>
    <li> I was well placed with the product, and would recommend it to a friend,</li>
    <li> I have had this product and have taken it many times. It works very well to keep me regular. This morning I just happened to noticed the bottle says Menstrual Reg. I was like what in the world!!??!!  They look exactly like the LBS II bottles, so it gave me no reason to inspect them. And the crazy thing is the way they were packaged when they came, the side I saw, was LBS II. I was sent 2 of each, which is NOT what I was supposed to get. Now it makes sense why I haven&#x27;t been regular and why the little 9 year old girl I gave one to never went. Grrr.....this is ridiculous. I understand issues can happen, but a little irritated I never caught this until now. I&#x27;m also having issues with my period lasting longer than it should and having to call my OBGYN to schedule an appointment to see what&#x27;s going on. Hope this isn&#x27;t the reason why I am irregular this month. Never had this issue before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 16 years. It has never let me down. Excellent price here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> very good product.delivers what was promised.i buy it all the time,always looking for the best buy.only problems it cost too much.</li>
    <li> Great price and good product</li>
    <li> Have suffered with bowel problems for years and now it is over .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Nature&#x27;s Sunshine for making an all natural product that works!</li>
    <li> It works for sure. It makes you go to the restroom the next morning. I have poor bowel movement. The first time I took it I went to the restroom 5 fives in one day. More times that I normally go in a week.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this because it simply did not work for me.  After reading other reviews, I was hopeful, as I have always tended towards constipation.  I used it faithfully for a week, and it seemed to bind me even more.  Finally, out of desperation, I took a handful of these capsule, and wound up STILL constipated, but holding water as well. I felt like a blimp!&lt;br /&gt;I stopped taking them, went back to my tried and true Cascara Sagrata, and am feeling much better.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Nature Sunshine LBX, but had a hard time finding it and so I went with this one. It works good, but caused me some discomfort and wasn&#x27;t as good as the LBX in my opinion. If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive stomach I am sure these would work great for you, but if you tend to have issues I would search for something else.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is original and at the great price. Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Quality is great. Love love the price. Great shipping and absolutely no complaints. nice smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, fresh supply, thank you.</li>
    <li> Used it many years ago, then local dealer stopped carrying it and I couldn&#x27;t find it locally. Happy to find it on Amazon...it works GREAT...naturally!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent herbal laxative.  I&#x27;ve used other herbals which were not as effective or pleasant.  This one is the best for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  My last order was for 6 bottles, I didn&#x27;t notice when I received that one bottle was a different product that I did not order nor can I use and I was stuck with it.  My fault for not checking the labels when they came in rather than assuming the order was correct.</li>
    <li> I have a big problem with constipation and a friend turned me on to this.  Three pills every night and Thank goodness.  Will NOT be without this especially while traveling.</li>
