      <li>and they are the perfect size to be able to try colors on and see if I like them!</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find the collection of minnie mouse, I waited patiently for it&#x27;s arrival</li>
      <li>The polishes in this set are beautiful and the packaging is very cute.</li>
      <li>So many great shades to try!</li>
      <li>I thought it was a great price for so many bottles of nail polish!</li>
      <li>I bought them here because this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen and the shipping was free and no tax was charged so it is a win/win for me.</li>
      <li>These are sure to get a lot of wear in our house!</li>
      <li>Nice samples.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving most of these to a friend for her birthday-she will love them!</li>
      <li>All of these colors are fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love the colors.</li>
      <li>I love the colors of the OPI minis.</li>
      <li>So glad I found them.</li>
      <li>I OPI and love these colors</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments on both of them.</li>
      <li>I purchased this set today for my daughter and I, who both love Minnie and all things Disney.</li>
      <li>But I love the fact that you get 4 colors.</li>
      <li>so I can try more colors for a lower price.</li>
      <li>and I love these colors.</li>
      <li>I love OPI nail products, but have come to really love these mini sets because they give you an opportunity to take colors for a test ride before</li>
      <li>I love OPI polishes</li>
      <li>but i guess it&#x27;s cute</li>
      <li>Glad I bought this pack.</li>
      <li>cute package.</li>
      <li>for this set, the colors are perfect for children as they are not extreme and fit in well with a child&#x27;s color palette.</li>
      <li>They are great to spice things up and try some new colors.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of anything Minnie Mouse, and I love having painted toes.</li>
      <li>I love OPI minis because as a nail poish aficionado, I rarely use a nail color more than twice unless I really really love it.</li>
      <li>Its so fun and has a nice feel once it is on the nails.</li>
      <li>these bottles are much smaller than i thought they would be but perfect for travel or your purse for a quick on the go nail job.</li>
      <li>really easily</li>
      <li>The brush is way better on a full size bottle.</li>
      <li>then buy the full size i you love it.  </li>
      <li>The colors are very pretty!</li>
      <li>I am also a huge fan of OPI</li>
      <li>is a great way to try the colors in the collection to see which you like and then purchase a larger bottle.</li>
      <li>She loved the sentiment and the tiny bottles provide an opportunity to try colors you might not want to commit to in a full-size bottle.</li>
      <li>These tiny nail polishes are great for travel - with the new foil packets of remover, you can refresh your mani-pedi or do your own polish change while on the road and these classic colors are a sure-hit!</li>
      <li>, the solid red was stunning too great with a red bikini, the liquid sand is kind of a strawberry red and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>So far we have tried Chic from Ears to Tail and Innie Minnie Mighty Bow and we love them both.</li>
      <li>They are all good nail polishes not watered down or cheap.</li>
      <li>The baby pink is very cute, the hot pink was my fave looks great with tanned skin</li>
      <li>but it came pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I would choose these OPI polishes even if they weren&#x27;t Disney themed because they are simply rich, classic nail colors.</li>
      <li>This cute little set of nail polishes are adorable.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping from seller.</li>
      <li>The make me want to go back to Disney, they are truly Minnie inspired; and such a great price.</li>
      <li>Love the liquid sand polishes, dry super fast!</li>
      <li>Bought these for an eight-year old friend who is a huge Disney fan.  </li>
      <li>but they are lovely, especially the liquid sand.</li>
      <li>colors are pretty.</li>
      <li>Right now i am wearing two of them and looks so nice, i really like it, but it is starting to vanish and i only have 3 days with it</li>
      <li>The colors are all all very red-dish</li>
      <li>The formula is great, and I did not find the mini bottles to be difficult to work with for these particular polishes.</li>
      <li>I wish the bottles werent so small but the colors were cute it</li>
      <li>or if you want to buy a full size bottle of one color at essentially the same price.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my five year old niece who is into girly things after I bought this for her six year old cousin.</li>
      <li>the pink was all about the bubble-gum...but not too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; - just the right color.</li>
      <li>I did not like the pink that much.</li>

<li> I did not like the pink that much.</li>
<li> She wears nail polish all summer long and said she can&#x27;t wait for sandal weather to try them all!  </li>
<li> Other colors were great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other two from the set!</li>
<li> I did not realize how small mini is so that makes using the brushes harder.</li>
<li> Gave this as a little Christmas gift for a friend who met her husband while working at Disneyland.  </li>
<li> It was a mixture of reviews, one color in particular was very difficult to remove.  </li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a mini bottle of nail polish that was THAT small.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t even used them because the brush is so tiny it would take forever to paint my nails and holding a nail polish brush that small in your fingers is extremly uncomfortable and awkward.</li>
<li> Opi mini bottles can be very hard to use.</li>
<li> i am not very good at applying nail polish, but was advised to bring it to my salon and they will apply it!!</li>
<li> When they arrived in the mail I was so disappointed.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t shop on that vendor&#x27;s site again.</li>

    <li> So many great shades to try! I&#x27;m giving most of these to a friend for her birthday-she will love them! Great service-fast shipping-Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find the collection of minnie mouse, I waited patiently for it&#x27;s arrival and then I got the package.  Its was the bond girls collection.  I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t shop on that vendor&#x27;s site again.</li>
    <li> Bought these for an eight-year old friend who is a huge Disney fan.  They were a big hit.  So glad I found them.</li>
    <li> these bottles are much smaller than i thought they would be but perfect for travel or your purse for a quick on the go nail job. the box was smashed when i received it but it came pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of anything Minnie Mouse, and I love having painted toes. So, regardless of the colors, I was going to buy this inexpensive set of OPI colors for my next Disney trip. I was so tickled when the set came. I&#x27;ve tried two of the colors, and have been beyond please with both of them. I&#x27;ve received many compliments on both of them. I would choose these OPI polishes even if they weren&#x27;t Disney themed because they are simply rich, classic nail colors. And since they are OPI brand, I know that they are quality. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other two from the set!</li>
    <li> cute package. colors are pretty. i am not very good at applying nail polish, but was advised to bring it to my salon and they will apply it!!</li>
    <li> It was a mixture of reviews, one color in particular was very difficult to remove.  After reading further it was referred to as liquid sand.  Other colors were great.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to try the colors in the collection to see which you like and then purchase a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> had to get 2 of these minnie mini packs. on is a gift. the best polish ever! i  collect miniatures of every type and just happened upon these cuties</li>
    <li> I did not realize how small mini is so that makes using the brushes harder. But I love the fact that you get 4 colors. They are all good nail polishes not watered down or cheap.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my five year old niece who is into girly things after I bought this for her six year old cousin. This is going into the Christmas stocking this year. I love OPI nail products, but have come to really love these mini sets because they give you an opportunity to take colors for a test ride before or if you want to buy a full size bottle of one color at essentially the same price.&lt;br /&gt;As for this set, the colors are perfect for children as they are not extreme and fit in well with a child&#x27;s color palette. My niece likes mimicking her mom, but these colors are all hers and Disney inspired. I bought them here because this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen and the shipping was free and no tax was charged so it is a win/win for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this in November as one of my daughter&#x27;s Christmas gifts. She loves the colors.  She wears nail polish all summer long and said she can&#x27;t wait for sandal weather to try them all!  Perfect gift at a good price.</li>
    <li> I wish the bottles werent so small but the colors were cute it just chips really easily but i guess it&#x27;s cute</li>
    <li> Right now i am wearing two of them and looks so nice, i really like it, but it is starting to vanish and i only have 3 days with it</li>
    <li> I love OPI polishes and I love these colors. I like the minis so I can try more colors for a lower price. Super fast shipping from seller.</li>
    <li> I love the colors. Opi mini bottles can be very hard to use. My suggestion is to get this i you think you might like a color then buy the full size i you love it.  The brush is way better on a full size bottle.</li>
    <li> I OPI and love these colors and they are the perfect size to be able to try colors on and see if I like them!</li>
    <li> This cute little set of nail polishes are adorable. In my opinion the Liquid Sand, Magazine Cover Mouse is the best. Its so fun and has a nice feel once it is on the nails. If you haven&#x27;t tried any of these nail polishes then you must.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty! I thought it was a great price for so many bottles of nail polish! When they arrived in the mail I was so disappointed. I know they are &amp;#34;Mini&amp;#34; bottles but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a mini bottle of nail polish that was THAT small. I haven&#x27;t even used them because the brush is so tiny it would take forever to paint my nails and holding a nail polish brush that small in your fingers is extremly uncomfortable and awkward. I say invest your money in the bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> All of these colors are fabulous! I wore them all and finished every bottle! The baby pink is very cute, the hot pink was my fave looks great with tanned skin, the solid red was stunning too great with a red bikini, the liquid sand is kind of a strawberry red and beautiful.  Glad I bought this pack. Love the liquid sand polishes, dry super fast!</li>

    <li> I purchased this set today for my daughter and I, who both love Minnie and all things Disney. I am also a huge fan of OPI so this purchase was a no-brainier for me.

The formula is great, and I did not find the mini bottles to be difficult to work with for these particular polishes. These are sure to get a lot of wear in our house!</li>
    <li> I love OPI minis because as a nail poish aficionado, I rarely use a nail color more than twice unless I really really love it. The polishes in this set are beautiful and the packaging is very cute. I collect OPI minis with the packaging so I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the colors of the OPI minis. They are great to spice things up and try some new colors. The make me want to go back to Disney, they are truly Minnie inspired; and such a great price.</li>
    <li> These tiny nail polishes are great for travel - with the new foil packets of remover, you can refresh your mani-pedi or do your own polish change while on the road and these classic colors are a sure-hit! I especially like the sparkle red and the pink was all about the bubble-gum...but not too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; - just the right color.</li>
    <li> Nice samples. The colors are all all very red-dish but they are lovely, especially the liquid sand. I did not like the pink that much.</li>
