    <li> This is the second time I purchased this item.  The first time it was not packed correctly and the cap for the conditioner bottle completely cracked.  Needless to say there was conditioner all over the box.  It ruined a textbook that was shipped in the same carton not sure why they would pack am open textbook with liquid.  But anyways, Amazon took care of the issue and I reordered.  Very happy!!!!!!</li>

    <li> I Think This Product Has Been Reformulated.  When it arrived, the bottles seemed different than what I am used to, and the ingredient list is different than my old bottles.  It doesn&#x27;t do as good a job at thickening my hair as the old one did.  Maybe I purchased the wrong formula and didn&#x27;t know it, but it is so confusing to have so many varieties of the same product and very little way to tell them apart.  I am not sure if I got the wrong thing or if this is the new formula, but this particular item did nothing for my thin hair.</li>
