      <li>you don&#x27;t like to use a rinse off conditioner, Infusium&#x27;s leave on conditioner is still my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have used Infusium 23 for many years.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>It is one product that I will continue to use as a part of my healthy hair growth regimen.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite rinse</li>
      <li>We Love this product.  </li>
      <li>My all time, go-to favorite.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>I love Infusium</li>
      <li>but it made my hair feel very clean</li>
      <li>I purchased this leave in treatment after reading a lot of great reviews on a message board I frequent.</li>
      <li>Make sure you buy the &amp;#34;Repair&amp;#34; type #3 if they stop manufacturing the original.</li>
      <li>This has been a tried and true conditioner I have used for many years.</li>
      <li>woks fine on her hair....</li>
      <li>I originally used it full strength as a leave on conditioner but for many years I have diluted it with water and use in a spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for adding body to limp, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Huge bottle.</li>
      <li>It came in a huge bottle, almost 34 oz.  </li>
      <li>We used to get it through the stylist who cut our hair, before it was available in retail stores.</li>
      <li>Great product, in larger volume, delivered to my door.</li>
      <li>great leave in conditioner, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Its a good detangler, but did not leave my hair feeling all that soft, which the SHH certainly does!!</li>
      <li>i live off this stuff and it makes my hair amazing.</li>
      <li>I have fixed this by replacing the top with the top of a spray bottle.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for curly hair since curly hair tends to be dry.</li>
      <li>: Put it in a spray bottle and spray it daily on your hair for optimum conditioning.</li>
      <li>It makes the hair straight and smooth as well as strong.  </li>
      <li>I tried the other versions and wasn&#x27;t happy at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used INFUSIUM products, I love this one especially because it made my hair more thicker and stronger.</li>
      <li>I have a chronic illness and take a strong medication that has affected the texture and health of my hair, and Infusium 23 Original Formula has stored most of the prior health of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Went without for about 5 weeks, my hair was frizzy and dry looking and just didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
      <li>This product is by far the best leave in treatment that DOES NOT weight down your hair, DOES NOT leave dandruff (like gel and moose).</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and more manageable.</li>
      <li>The bottle arrived with no leakage of any kind and externally sealed to keep the cap from moving.</li>
      <li>put in spray bottle and keep it right by the shower when i get out.</li>
      <li>I spray it into my hair while in the shower, right after washing my hair, and it leaves it tangle feel, moisturized and stronger.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>love this product enough to ignore the parabens in it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products I couldn&#x27;t possibly count them all, and this one was another</li>
      <li>I love that I could find it in a larger size.</li>
      <li>Just purchased and the shipment was FAST!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference but for the price it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and will use it as long as they make it</li>
      <li>I burnt my hair going blonde and used this for a good 2 years (this one bottle lasted that long).</li>
      <li>With a fine mist, spray each side and the back once and then run your fingers through.</li>
      <li>Too runny and doesn&#x27;t detangle very well.</li>
      <li>; but it is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Much thinner than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>This product lasts forever and really does help your hair.</li>
      <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t have any fancy perfumes and if you can&#x27;t stand pouring a dime-sized amount into your hand to rub through your hair, put is into a spray bottle - just don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
      <li>it leaves my hair very manageable.  </li>
      <li>The original formula is always my favorite for long curly dry hair.  </li>
      <li>The Original formula is the only one I use.</li>
      <li>It detangles, adds sheen, body and silkiness to anyone&#x27;s hair... or other furry creatures :)  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item received as described.</li>
    <li> been using this product for years.  conditioner without the heavy feeling of regular conditioner. i get the big bottle and put it into smaller spray bottles to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this for years, great hair treatment. Ive purchased this the product from reseller,  formula seems to be fake,  is not the same. I had to return the item to vendor.</li>
    <li> Great product, in larger volume, delivered to my door. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> The cap of the bottle flips up and you have this little hole that just squirts out the leave in conditioner and makes it hard to get nice, even coverage. I have fixed this by replacing the top with the top of a spray bottle. As for the product itself, it works great. My hair feels soft and more manageable. It comes in handy after bleach and heat damage.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected as a leave in treatment. I have natural hair and need something that would moistures my hair without weighing it down too much but this product over dried my hair but it made my hair feel very clean so I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that works for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hated this product, have had this bottle for several months and only used it twice to give it a try, the bottle is full. It left my hair so dry and frizzy like hay. the product itself was very watery which i feel the top was terrible for, it needs a better design.</li>
    <li> Not does what it says, make my hair even worse, dry and dull... I stop use it after 3 try.</li>
    <li> been using this after shampooing for years. Love it. Adds body and makes it easier to reveal my natural waves if I let my hair air dry.</li>
    <li> love this product enough to ignore the parabens in it.</li>
    <li> Much thinner than I anticipated. Almost like water. Not much is needed to condition hair.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle. The original formula is always my favorite for long curly dry hair.  I love infusium, smooths the frizz.</li>
    <li> As good as any leave in conditioner you could buy in the salon....</li>
    <li> Still a wonderful product, after all these years. Started using sometime after getting hairdressers license in 1979.&lt;br /&gt;A great leave in conditioner and not just for humans. May be a bit funny, but this conditioner is great for animals as well- turned Arabian&#x27;s mane and tail hair, into silk.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like to use a rinse off conditioner, Infusium&#x27;s leave on conditioner is still my favorite. I use a good spray bottle, to apply. It detangles, adds sheen, body and silkiness to anyone&#x27;s hair... or other furry creatures :)  And it does not weigh the hair down. Shampoos and conditioner alike. Truly an inexpensive, yet wonderful line of products</li>
    <li> I have been using this leave in conditioner for many years!!!  It is a great detangler and I refuse to comb my hair without it.  It has a nice smell to it also.  I put it in a spray bottle and spray it on my hair, after washing or when it&#x27;s dry.  It combs through quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Great for your hair.  ring life back to your hair.</li>
    <li> THE BEST leave-in conditioner for damaged/processed/color-treated hair.  No, it doesn&#x27;t have any fancy perfumes and if you can&#x27;t stand pouring a dime-sized amount into your hand to rub through your hair, put is into a spray bottle - just don&#x27;t apply too much. I use it after I shower as a detangler. If you want something that has a nicer smell, mix it with some Chi or Biosilk or other leave-in product.</li>
    <li> I used this product when I was a young teen and relaxed.  I am now fab 50 and natural, and it works fantastically on my 4a coils.  It has strengthened my hair and I have no split ends.  I mix this with a little aloe Vera  juice and coconut oil.  It is one product that I will continue to use as a part of my healthy hair growth regimen.</li>
    <li> I have wavy to curly hair. This product is by far the best leave in treatment that DOES NOT weight down your hair, DOES NOT leave dandruff (like gel and moose). It DOES help with taming curls, waves from the humidity, it DOES treat your hair as you go about you day, it DOES work and it smells extremely good. FEW POINTERS:  1)buy a salon spray can so you may transfer the formula 2) as you work out spray some onto your hair and wrap it in a bun or braid the heat will give it a boost 3) if you want it to last a while dilute is a tad with water. 4) pay close attention to ends and roots.</li>
    <li> I thought Infusium had gone away.  So happy to find it online and begin using it again.  Perfect for adding body to limp, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Better than the more expensive brands on the market. I&#x27;ve been using Infusium for years. Love the product.</li>
    <li> I love Infusium it leaves my hair very manageable.  I have hair that is very frizzy, but with the infusium is leave very soft and no frizz.</li>
    <li> The longer I use it the healthier and more lustrous my hair becomes.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. put in spray bottle and keep it right by the shower when i get out. coat my hair using the spray bottle then put it up in a towel until i&#x27;m ready to comb and blow dry. i also use a conditioner in the shower but like the leave-in treatment for removing tanlges.</li>
    <li> Not bad, not great.  I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference but for the price it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used INFUSIUM products, I love this one especially because it made my hair more thicker and stronger. I am noticing ess breakage and falling when I use my comb.</li>
    <li> Too runny and doesn&#x27;t detangle very well.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This has been a tried and true conditioner I have used for many years. It isn&#x27;t heavy, gives my hair lots of shine and completely untangles hair. I like spray it from a mister bottle.</li>
    <li> Great formula! Works very well. I would recommend this to anyone who can&#x27;t control the frizziness of their hair. The only complain I have is when I received this product two bottles were spilled in the shipment box.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and it is as good today as when I started using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for as long as I can remember. I put it in a spray bottle and use is daily to wet my curly, frizzy hair. I love this stuff and will use it as long as they make it</li>
    <li> Has not helped my hair at all. ..</li>
    <li> USED IT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS...I WILL ALWAYS LOVE IT, CAN DILUTE IT FOR SOFTER STYLE, OR LEAVE AS IS FOR EXTRA HOLD, I SPRAY IT ON MY HAIR..GOOD CONDITIONER</li>
    <li> This product lasts forever and really does help your hair. I burnt my hair going blonde and used this for a good 2 years (this one bottle lasted that long). Just put in a spray pump and spray on and massage into tips of hair.  Just purchased and the shipment was FAST! Bottle wrapped and protected not to leak. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has a texturizer in it.  It makes the hair straight and smooth as well as strong.  Would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Both my wife&#x27;s sister and her brother highly recommended this product, and the price was okay, especially considering how expensive shipping anything liquid really is.  The bottle arrived with no leakage of any kind and externally sealed to keep the cap from moving.</li>
    <li> My all time, go-to favorite.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product and finds it helps his thinning hair...We Love this product.  It disappears in my household!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this leave in treatment after reading a lot of great reviews on a message board I frequent. I have very thick, curly hair and of course, frizz is a huge problem. I&#x27;ve tried so many products I couldn&#x27;t possibly count them all, and this one was another failure.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is overpowering and chemical. It did nothing to improve my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product ame service, awesome prices!</li>
    <li> HAIR. CRACK. i live off this stuff and it makes my hair amazing. i usually buy 2 or 3 bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this leave-on conditioner for over 30 years. I have curly hair and this conditioner calms the frizz and leaves my hair in beautiful ringlets. I have tried many other products over the years and every single one leaves my hair sticky. The labeling has changed to a grey color. Make sure you buy the &amp;#34;Repair&amp;#34; type #3 if they stop manufacturing the original.</li>
    <li> My family has been using Infusium for 30+ years. Its perfect in every way.&lt;br /&gt;It detangles, adds definition without being crunchy, adds softness and reduces frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried tons of others because lets face it, this is kinda spendy, but nothing works like this.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to agree, the spout/pour design on these bottles is a joke. My family has been pouring it into spray bottles for as long as I can remember.</li>
    <li> great leave in conditioner, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> After waiting about a month for the Infusium 23 to arrive it performed very well as a static reducing leave in product, I wish it would also have something in it to leave a slight sheen.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to keep down his cowlick. He hates stiffness in his hair and this works without making it feel glued down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Infusium for years.  I originally used it full strength as a leave on conditioner but for many years I have diluted it with water and use in a spray bottle.  I have dry curly frizzy hair and I spritz it with the water/Infusium when my hair is damp before styling.  It gives my hair a little extra conditioner and it also has silicones which help control frizz.  My hair stylist recommended that years ago (he used it that way to dampen hair again after cutting &amp; before styling).  I also use it when I don&#x27;t have time to wash or wet my hair down and just want to dampen a little before styling.</li>
    <li> I use INFUSIUM 23 Orginal Formula Pro-Vitamin Leave-In Hair Treatment daily. It keeps my hair in place and is good for it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this leave in treatment for 28 years, it is the best! I have tried going without, thinking my hair was addicted to it and I would give it a break. Went without for about 5 weeks, my hair was frizzy and dry looking and just didn&#x27;t feel good. This is a great product for curly hair since curly hair tends to be dry. I&#x27;ve tried other leave ins before and cream type of leave ins and I always go back to Infusium.</li>
    <li> Needed a moisturizer for my hair, so my daughter recommended Infusion.  I use it 3 to 4 times a week and I am more  than satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I use this for both myself and my son. I have very dry hair and my son has curly, when dry, frizzy hair. This gives a nice tangle free base and a lovely shine.</li>
    <li> This not only functions as a detangler but it helps retain style and eliminates frizz</li>
    <li> If your immune system is compromised or weakened AT ALL avoid this product. It gave me  a royal case of eczema. I had used it briefly years ago and decided to try it again. I noticed the old formula was not available and this new one was. Then I found out that the old formula had been discontinued due to &amp;#34;environmental&amp;#34; concerns. This is not safe!</li>
    <li> Infusion 23 is an excellent product. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I can&#x27;t find it at stores anymore so I was thrilled to find it on line. I have curly hair. I mix this with water in a spray bottle &amp; mist my hair to bring the bounce back to my curls. I also use it as a leave in treatment instead of regular conditioner sometimes. After using this, you will not have any split ends!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking it was a cream for my wife.  Turns out it is a very thin liquid that did not do much of anything to soften or condition her hair.  She was not pleased with this product and does not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used Infusium 23 for many years.  I love that I could find it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> If you have hair that could use some conditioner, but using conditioner leaves it flat and weighted down, this is for you !!&lt;br /&gt;I put some in a spray bottle and use it as soon as finish washing my hair and before I wrap it in a towel.&lt;br /&gt;Squeeze the water out of your hair, spray on the Infusium23, and wrap it up. Finish your shower. That way you&#x27;re not spraying it on and then toweling it off to dry your hair. Don&#x27;t saturate your hair with it. With a fine mist, spray each side and the back once and then run your fingers through. The Original formula is the only one I use. I tried the other versions and wasn&#x27;t happy at all. As with most things, stick to what works.</li>
    <li> I have very fine curly hair.  I use a spray bottle to apply this product.  I mix this product with water and put it in a spray bottle.  It helps condition and detangle my hair.  I still use a lotion type leave-in conditioner because my hair can get frizzy.  I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have used this product for years. It is a great leave-in conditioner. I also cut my own hair and I like to use this to help keep tangles out and comb it when cutting. Not sure why I&#x27;ve never seen the product sold in a sprayer bottle. I always transfer the solution into a sprayer bottle for easier application.</li>
    <li> To be fair I didn&#x27;t realize this was a liquid or I would not have bought it....but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me and it makes my hair feel weird.</li>
    <li> Nothing helps my curls to form more perfectly then the infusium 23, If you have curly hair, you definately need the infusium 23!!</li>
    <li> I use this product brand for years, this time I change Orginal formula is too heavy stay on hair. it need wash off after use it.</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter...woks fine on her hair....thak you PRO 23</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the &amp;#34;Sexy Healthy Hair&amp;#34; but it is much cheaper. Its a good detangler, but did not leave my hair feeling all that soft, which the SHH certainly does!!</li>
    <li> Does what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite rinse &amp; I can&#x27;t get it here</li>
    <li> This stuff has helped my brittle, dry, breaking gray hair tremendously.  I spray it into my hair while in the shower, right after washing my hair, and it leaves it tangle feel, moisturized and stronger.  I have a chronic illness and take a strong medication that has affected the texture and health of my hair, and Infusium 23 Original Formula has stored most of the prior health of my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and clearly see an improvement.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for years and love the light and effective formula and appealing smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product I didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was this big wow thx so much</li>
    <li> The product is as described.  It came in a huge bottle, almost 34 oz.  That amount should last me a long time for several washings.  It came with a cap that has a tiny hole in the flip-up top so when you pour it out in your hand, it is a controlled measured amount so as not to waste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Put it in a spray bottle and spray it daily on your hair for optimum conditioning.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve used this stuff before, you already know it&#x27;s a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Keeps my hair manageable and shining. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use it every day and have for years.  We used to get it through the stylist who cut our hair, before it was available in retail stores.</li>
