      <li>I LOVE my Deva Curl AnGel light hold!</li>
      <li>Best light gel for holding soft curls ever ..holds curls all day</li>
      <li>My favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>(my hair is somewhere between 2C-3A), and in fact I would say that my hair was MORE frizzy for having used this gel.</li>
      <li>Also, many products will give me scalp acne.  </li>
      <li>I love and embrace my curls now.</li>
      <li>This works great on my very naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Just the right amount of hold - very light - very easy to use</li>
      <li>great for curly hair no residue, not sticky leaves hair soft</li>
      <li>I really love the DevaCurl Low-Poo Shampoo and thought I would enjoy the gel.  </li>
      <li>it helps create awesome waves (my hair is SLIGHTLY wavy SOMETIMES).  </li>
      <li>says- creates a light cast around curls as it dries (just dont touch it)</li>
      <li>and then I lightly scrunch again to break the crunchy cast.</li>
      <li>It says light hold</li>
      <li>In reality, this stuff is cheap for a reason.</li>
      <li>The entire line of Devacurl is great-</li>
      <li>great product, not the sticky kind of messy gel that are out there on the market.</li>
      <li>hair nice and soft!!!</li>
      <li>Not a bad smell just really strong.</li>
      <li>The great thing is I can run my hands through my hair through out the day and it won&#x27;t fall flat.  </li>
      <li>&quot;  It has a nice fragrance but some in my household find it strong for their sensitive noses.  </li>
      <li>I bought it the first time after visiting the Deva salon and had used many products before and after -</li>
      <li>But it is a super product.</li>
      <li>This seller was quick with the transaction, quick with email info on shipping and tracking.</li>
      <li>I have long curly hair and this gel is just perfect - lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard, but seems to minimize frizz, smells nice.</li>
      <li>It has great hold and can be touched up with a little spray of water.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing -- it has totally changed both my hairstyle and</li>
      <li>All the Deva products are well worth the money.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own, the only problem is the frizz factor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even had good results going to bed with wet hair if this stuff is in it.  </li>
      <li>but this is NOT the right texture for this gel.</li>
      <li>The hold on this gel is just right</li>
      <li>Still works &#x27;well&#x27; but not the right way - don&#x27;t bother unless you don&#x27;t mind settling.</li>
      <li>This is not the right version of this product.</li>
      <li>(My hair is color treated, so I don&#x27;t want to use anything that is going to dry it out more!).</li>
      <li>Works perfect, wet or dry, cant tell its in your hair when you touch it but can see that its holding curls and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>I tried it 4 times, applying varying amounts and applying at different times (more wet hair, more dry hair, etc) and could never get a good result.</li>
      <li>I admit, the first couple times It didn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
      <li>I use this consistently.  </li>
      <li>This gel didn&#x27;t work that great on my really thick curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different products for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>how much time I have to spend!  </li>
      <li>Helps sculpt the curls while not weighing the down, and allows them to be great and natural.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, wavy, frizzy, partially grey therefore colored hair.  </li>
      <li>Good curl defining product, although sometimes my hair feels too stiff in order to get the desired definition.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for a product that is light enough but does the right job of maintaining your style and</li>
      <li>The real AnGel Light Hold is more liquid like, not as firm as this gel</li>
      <li>Truly remarkable... would never go back to use any other gel again.</li>
      <li>It really does melt into your hair when you massage it in.  </li>
      <li>Then put the gel in gently.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s in your hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend buying AnGel from Amazon!</li>
      <li>I do use a styling cream  (Bumble &amp; Bumble) before using this, but I have found that it&#x27;s the gel that really makes the difference.</li>
      <li>I use it when I style as curly or straight.  </li>
      <li>but this is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>It creates shiny silky smooth curls and waves that last ALL day!  </li>
      <li>Devacurl did not get rid of the frizz, when it dried my hair had some nicely shaped curls</li>
      <li>I use this on conjunction with the styling cream; this first and then the cream with damp; newly washed hair.</li>
      <li>On top of it, I bleach my hair to both blend in the grey and to help give it a little more body, but that meant I either had to blow dry it smooth, then use a curling iron, or else have very frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>Once my hair was dry, it felt like straw and tangled easily.</li>
      <li>DevaCurl light gel now allows me to scrunch about a quarter size dollop into my hand, hold my head upside down, work it in, and then just let the hair air dry with light scrunching or else just blow dry the top if I want a lot of volume.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product left my fine curly hair heavy and crunchy when dry.  I did not obtain great curls and my hair just got dirty feeling before the day was over.  I tried using different amounts but nothing seemed to work.  After a week I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> This gel for curly hair is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Not sticky, does not dry on your hair with crispy ringlets but actually feels silky and conditioned. Truly remarkable... would never go back to use any other gel again.</li>
    <li> This is not the right version of this product. I have used these products in the past and I don&#x27;t know if they were stored in the wrong temp, or mixed with something else but this is NOT the right texture for this gel. I have curly hair and KNOW my stuff, and this purchased in the store shortly after, is not the same. Still works &#x27;well&#x27; but not the right way - don&#x27;t bother unless you don&#x27;t mind settling.</li>
    <li> love it for my curls! i like my curls a little crunchy and this provides that.</li>
    <li> I used to use a tacky sticky styling cream and swore by it. After changing stylists, my new stylist cut using the Deva method and used this. I was skeptical, but I find it holds my curls and manages my crazy hair (I have fine, but very curly hair on top and more wavy in the back and underneath that&#x27;s prone to frizz) but also stays soft--no more sticky goo in my hair. I do use a styling cream  (Bumble &amp; Bumble) before using this, but I have found that it&#x27;s the gel that really makes the difference. The cream works to additionally fight frizz, but when I have run out of the gel, that is when my hair becomes a nightmare! I buy it here on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best price I&#x27;ve found and is more convenient than trying to find a salon or place that sells it and schlepping there and back. Highly recommend buying AnGel from Amazon!</li>
    <li> It says light hold and it is. You really can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s in your hair. I can&#x27;t say this lasts all day as my hair is frizzier at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> great product, not the sticky kind of messy gel that are out there on the market. This is geared for curls and it holds the curl well. Play around with how much your hair needs as using too much will give the &#x27;hard&#x27; gel type curls which dont look natural. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Just the right amount of hold - very light - very easy to use</li>
    <li> I feel like a lot of the users and reviews of this product are because of user error not product deficiency. Here is the thing. I&#x27;m a bi racial girl who has been suffering with my hair for over 20 years (lets just call it twenty, I didn&#x27;t start caring until middle school heehee). I&#x27;ve have used every product conceivable in that time and never really found one that didn&#x27;t require lots of fuss time. DevaCurl is my saving grace. I admit, the first couple times It didn&#x27;t seem to work. But you have to realize that using the entire product line is key. Ditch those sulfates! They are hell on your hair. I would recommend buying or going to the library and getting the book Curly Girl. Read that. Life changing! Secondly use the products right. I have very thick Asian hair and very curly and coarse African American hair. It used to be a hot mess, frizz, poofyness. Ugh. Use the this AnGel in the shower if you have coarse hair like me and use Arc AnGel if you have finer hair. Yea it sounds gross, using gel in the shower, I thought so too! But this is what you do. Condition your hair but don&#x27;t completely rinse it out and bend over and let your hair hang. Then put the gel in gently. Just grazing your neck and crown and smoothing it towards the ends. Then hold your hair above your head as you turn off the shower and step out. Plop your hair into an old tee shirt. NO MORE TOWELS! Ditch em, they too are hell on your hair. then twist the towel up so it stays a bit like a turban and after about 10 min (do makeup, make breakfast, pick clothes for the day, whatever) take the towel down and let it air dry. I get compliments everyday on my hair now and I can wear it down and it doesn&#x27;t get crazy. I love and embrace my curls now. Get the book and find a routine that works for you.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair very dry.  Only one day did I get the results expected. I returned the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great lightweight gel, perfect to keep curls defined and frizz-free.  It smells great and does not cause build-up on the hair. ( I would know since I never use shampoo to cleanse). The entire line of Devacurl is great- especially the no-poo, one condition, and this angell.  Would definitely encourage the entire line for curly &amp;/or frizzy hair- check out the website for tips on the use of the products   ( [...] ) - but buy them on  Amazon for the best price.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that curls nicely on it&#x27;s own, the only problem is the frizz factor.  Devacurl did not get rid of the frizz, when it dried my hair had some nicely shaped curls but the rest was just as frizzy as before but harder.  It left my hair feeling dirty, and stiff.  It did not take the frizz away.  This product did not work for my hair, but for my friend who has thicker, more textured hair it does shape her curls very nicely.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me as a air dry curl enhancer and I almost sent it back.  I have very fine, wavy, frizzy, partially grey therefore colored hair.  Putting DevaCurl Angel in wet hair and letting it dry just resulted in wet looking frizzy waves.  Very disappointing.  Before I sent it back, I put on wet hair and used my Conair hot air curling brush and WOW!  It creates shiny silky smooth curls and waves that last ALL day!  The bounce in my hair is incredible.  The great thing is I can run my hands through my hair through out the day and it won&#x27;t fall flat.  I have never found any product that would do that.  Also, many products will give me scalp acne.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  Love, love, love it!  Lastly, the product combos I use are Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree shampoo, Loma Peratin Thermal Styling Protector, and DevaCurl Angel or Hair One, Loma Peratin Reparative lotion, and DevaCurl Angel. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Ouidad girl, but my college budget tells me to get a discount whenever I can and save some money. Two bottles for less than $20.. I thought whoa, I deal! In reality, this stuff is cheap for a reason. -.- Dried out my hair SO bad… I&#x27;m sorry Ouidad. I&#x27;m coming back to you!! I learned my lesson.. And my hair paid the price.. Cause now it&#x27;s like straw -___-</li>
    <li> The hold on this gel is just right, it doesn&#x27;t leave my curls crunchy when I let them air dry. After a while it does make my hair a little dull so I mix in a little conditioner intoi the gel and that helps a lot.</li>
    <li> This gel didn&#x27;t work that great on my really thick curly hair.  Instead of holding my thick ringlets together it tended to separate them into many smaller ringlets resulting in my hair looking bigger and \\&quot;poofier\\&quot; than desired. It leaves a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feel to my hair.  I tried using more/less of the product but still have not been able to get the desired results.  I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the smell. Very strong and overpowering smell. Not a bad smell just really strong. Sorry, I really did want to love this product. So far I&#x27;ve had the best results with Suave&#x27;s mousse and gel lines for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Best gel I have ever used!  Leaves you hair nice and soft!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because my own gel wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  After using the anGEL, my curls were better formed and not frizzy at all, but my hair was drier than ever!! This is only my second day of usage, so I will wait a couple more before considering returning it.  (My hair is color treated, so I don&#x27;t want to use anything that is going to dry it out more!).</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly, frizzy, difficult hair and I love the idea of products for curly-haired folks as it&#x27;s truly needed. I generally like the way this gel feels in my hair and it seems to create less frizz than other products I&#x27;ve tried. You have to use a LOT of it though. But, I really do NOT like the synthetic chemical scents Deva uses and this one is way too strong - it reminds me of the 80&#x27;s when everything was fake and overdone. The scents are too strong, fake smelling and long-lasting in most of the products. This stuff irritates my hairline. The irritation is minor and I am very sensitive and generally use only 100% natural products. I wish I could find a truly natural product out there that worked well.</li>
    <li> This seller was quick with the transaction, quick with email info on shipping and tracking. My item was delivered in a timely manner. I would do business again with this seller. I also love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. Try it, you will love it!!!</li>
    <li> Best light gel for holding soft curls ever ..holds curls all day</li>
    <li> I use this consistently.  Good curl defining product, although sometimes my hair feels too stiff in order to get the desired definition.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Deva Curl AnGel light hold! I bought it the first time after visiting the Deva salon and had used many products before and after - it&#x27;s still the best! And it smells sooo good. Leaves your curls boing-y and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product, absolutely love it! I am always looking for a product that is light enough but does the right job of maintaining your style and this is it. Thank you for making such an excellent gel that works for my crazy curly hair!</li>
    <li> I really love the DevaCurl Low-Poo Shampoo and thought I would enjoy the gel.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that I find it just, \\&quot;O.K.\\&quot;  It has a nice fragrance but some in my household find it strong for their sensitive noses.  It&#x27;s extremely light in hold and not very effective nor curl-enhancing for my medium thick, somewhat fine hair.  I also think it may be causing some bumps in my scalp.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with it but so far I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great price! Works perfect, wet or dry, cant tell its in your hair when you touch it but can see that its holding curls and not frizzy. Best product ever.</li>
    <li> Arrived just as described and seems to be the regular product that I am used to using.</li>
    <li> I use this on conjunction with the styling cream; this first and then the cream with damp; newly washed hair. I then scrunch my hair with my head upside down. I wait until my hair has dried completely and then I lightly scrunch again to break the crunchy cast. It then looks natural and the curl still holds.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing -- it has totally changed both my hairstyle and how much time I have to spend!  My hair is slightly wavy and very very fine but thick -- I have a lot of individual hairs, but they all tend to like to lay right next to each other in flat, greasy looking clumps.  On top of it, I bleach my hair to both blend in the grey and to help give it a little more body, but that meant I either had to blow dry it smooth, then use a curling iron, or else have very frizzy hair.  DevaCurl light gel now allows me to scrunch about a quarter size dollop into my hand, hold my head upside down, work it in, and then just let the hair air dry with light scrunching or else just blow dry the top if I want a lot of volume.  I&#x27;ve even had good results going to bed with wet hair if this stuff is in it.  Somehow it turns my mild waves into glorious shining loopy curls that last for days.  I&#x27;m having to wash my hair less, thus saving me time, and I get lots of compliments on my pretty waves.  If it ever gets flat, I just use the DevaCurl lavender spray and it bounces right back.  Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> For curly girl hair, the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  All the Deva products are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Hold the curl but never feels like you have gel in your hair.  My favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> For medium to thick hair, add to wet hair, it adds texture it&#x27;s an awesome product&lt;br /&gt;Need only a small amount, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great product! Not heavy and gives a great hold! I like it much better than the Firm hold.  The Firm hold really didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.  It really does melt into your hair when you massage it in.  There&#x27;s no residue at all left on your hands.  it helps create awesome waves (my hair is SLIGHTLY wavy SOMETIMES).  It has great hold and can be touched up with a little spray of water.  I don&#x27;t recommend leaving it in for for than 2 days because it clots up your hair when you sleep and can cause breakage.  But it is a super product.</li>
    <li> This is great for curly hair. It holds curls without being stiff.</li>
    <li> Love love love this gel.  It is the only gel I&#x27;ve used since a stylist recommended it years ago.  The DevaCare/DevaCurl line is awesome!  I have long curly hair and this gel is just perfect - lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard, but seems to minimize frizz, smells nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it smells amazing and works like it says- creates a light cast around curls as it dries (just dont touch it) then when you scrunch it the cast goes away with no residue and soft curls are left.</li>
    <li> A wonderful hair product.&lt;br /&gt;Works so well and smells terrific.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to get curls that look great and last days.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product everyday and get complements on the curls I can achieve.</li>
    <li> great for curly hair no residue, not sticky leaves hair soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like DevaCurl, it&#x27;s that what&#x27;s in side this bottle is not the quality of DevaCurl that I have used in the past when I bought it form salons in the Boston area. I&#x27;ve been sold DevaCurl but this is not the real thing. The real AnGel Light Hold is more liquid like, not as firm as this gel and it smells nothing like it. I got ripped off but never again.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this with the fact that I&#x27;ve been following the Curly Girl Method for months, so my hair is properly hydrated. Following the CGM, I applied this in the shower, after &amp;#34;squish to condish&amp;#34; and just before plopping my hair. This gel immediately made my hair sticky and crunchy, no matter the amount I used. It was impossible to comb it though my hair with my fingers--it felt like I was applying cement. Once my hair was dry, it felt like straw and tangled easily. It did nothing at all for my frizz (my hair is somewhere between 2C-3A), and in fact I would say that my hair was MORE frizzy for having used this gel. I tried it 4 times, applying varying amounts and applying at different times (more wet hair, more dry hair, etc) and could never get a good result. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I do like the smell.</li>
    <li> This works great on my very naturally curly hair.  I use it when I style as curly or straight.  My daughter with thick, straight hair loves it, too.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products for curly hair.  Helps sculpt the curls while not weighing the down, and allows them to be great and natural.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thinning, tightly curled hair.  I scrunch this into my roots and use  Deva volumizing mousse.  Hair has more body.</li>
    <li> This is all I use now, I love it!  I bought it at the salon and it was much more expensive.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to check the ounces and then discovered that you are paying for 24 ozs instead of for 32 ozs. Don&#x27;t bother&lt;br /&gt;with this, just pay the shipping.</li>
