      <li>Good quality good price good company</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>We are very satisfied.</li>
      <li>They should be changed monthly for your own health.</li>
      <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t realize that they were sent to me until a couple of weeks after it said I had received them I dug to the bottom of one of the boxes I received and there they were.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, how does one review an air filter?</li>
      <li>They may be just as good a filter as the genuine ResMed product.  </li>
      <li>The filters were exactly what was needed for my S9 and work great.  </li>
      <li>like it because is better for allergies.</li>
      <li>and it is top of the line.</li>
      <li>There are a lot places where I love to save a buck, but using knock-off parts for my CPAP isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
      <li>Cheap foam filters!</li>
      <li>:) 9 more words.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast delivery</li>
      <li>These are the correct part - I can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
      <li>They might be a better product for all I</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get them through my insurance provider, so I&#x27;m glad to be able to get them here.</li>
      <li>I was wondering why doesn&#x27;t anyone sell more than 2 or 3 at a time?</li>
      <li>That one makes noise but works much better.</li>
      <li>So it must do more then the regular filters in my brilliant scientific knowledge. :)</li>
      <li>comes in sleep restfully packaging and say&#x27;s resmed style, that being said they fit filter housing perfectly and since i started using them my allergy symptoms go away at night, i had just the standard filter before, and it dose say made in USA.</li>
      <li>I am happy to have a new, clean one and a spare.</li>
      <li>Easy way to buy these filters in a pack.  </li>
      <li>Not fun to have Apnea, but the S9 system with the pillow mask is the best I have tried.</li>
      <li>But they work fine.</li>
      <li>I quickly ordered some more.</li>
      <li>Appears to be the genuine article</li>
      <li>The ResMed filter is a great product - it&#x27;s the one I actually ordered from this seller.  </li>
      <li>But they fit the ResMed S9 machine.</li>
      <li>Since I suffer from allergies as well, the quality of the filter is indeed important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It fits OK, but if you really want the quality of the original ResMed filter, you will probably want to make sure that the seller confirm that they will indeed sell you the ResMed filter.</li>
      <li>fresh air again!</li>
      <li>The replacements they sent me were equivalent to the original.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference the very first morning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was a real convenience to be able to purchase this item on line.  </li>
      <li>The price is more reasonable</li>
      <li>The filters were exactly as advertised and arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>As always, very fast delivery time!</li>
      <li>The difference this filter makes over the standard is amazing.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re well worth the investment.</li>
      <li>I have used a CPAP for many years and find that the one upside is that the filters combined with the humidifiers provide a &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; source of air which results in my waking each morning with a clear sinus.  </li>
      <li>It was well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>These fit better and last longer.</li>
      <li>No complaints here, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they will clog up quicker, but for the price, its easy enough to replace, and I get a better peice of mind from the extra filtering these provide.</li>
      <li>Right filter at the right price, factory sealed</li>
      <li>The items were what I needed and the price was right for me.</li>
      <li>Now I can breath right</li>
      <li>These are cheep enough to keep yourself healthy.</li>
      <li>but price has doubled since I first bought.</li>
      <li>Now I change these more regularly.  </li>
      <li>They are exactly like the orgional.</li>
      <li>I just wish I could find more such items because this was cheaper, even with my co-pay.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED</li>
      <li>The fiber mesh is more open than filters I receive from my CPAP supplier.</li>
      <li>Looks just like my old filters except these are clean.</li>
      <li>Works and better price than the Rip Off Medical Supply House Cigna wants me to use.</li>
      <li>With this filter it pretty much eliminates that smell where I am no longer doing that.</li>
      <li>sure you get the ResMed filter, it is the same high quality as their equipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m updating the original review from 1 to 4 stars (not a 5, due to the inconvenience).  </li>
      <li>The regular filters are good- probably better than the regular filters for other machines, but I need this finer one.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH,</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>There are lots of seller&#x27;s filter &amp;#34;cut to fit&amp;#34; the S9 offered for sale but these were the real deal from ResMed</li>
      <li>Much thinner than the OEM version.</li>
      <li>This filter works very well.</li>
      <li>This is the real product shipped in ResMed packaging.</li>
      <li>These appear to be made of paper and are much lighter in weight.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>They are not packaged in resmed bags, but they are sealed in a bag &amp; are the real thing.</li>
      <li>I have a resmed S9 machine &amp; really need the finer filter because I have a lot of allergies.</li>
      <li>It really does catch more dust and other things.  </li>
      <li>I would only recommend these as an alternative if you have no source for the original, filters.</li>
      <li>I find that they did not filter as well as the original version that came with the machine, and have since ordered replacements from my local supplier.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While these would work in the short term, I don&#x27;t believe they work as well as the original products nor</li>
      <li>The filter made a different for me became it gives me security, knowing I&#x27;m breathing clean air.  </li>
      <li>But good enough considering the cost was much less.</li>
      <li>I did have an older Phillips machine that I use on my RV.</li>
      <li>I would prefer to be able to buy a larger quantity - such as a dozen - at one time.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The filters were fine but were not what I expected.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I emailed the company and expressed my wish to return these items, indicating that they were obviously nothing like the description they provided nor were they the right size filter for my machine.  </li>
      <li>finally received what &#x27;looks&#x27; like the right product, but not in factory packaging, so unsure if it is in fact resmed product or another type of no-name.  </li>
      <li>Was very fast shipping, got a week earlier than the estimated delivery date.  </li>
      <li>And it is, but only for the first hour or so.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For now, I&#x27;m giving the benefit of the doubt that this was a simple shipping error, but I&#x27;m leaving the original review in case others have a similar problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect size, cheap, and works like a charm. You can even wash these gently with some water and reuse them an extra 1-2 times.</li>
    <li> This is the real product shipped in ResMed packaging. The difference this filter makes over the standard is amazing. Even if my snoring were cured, I would still wear my CPAP with this filter just for the difference it makes in not dealing with all the allergy problems that I usually wake up with. These filters are awesome!</li>
    <li> Works great in my CPAP machine!</li>
    <li> Right filter at the right price, factory sealed</li>
    <li> I have seasonal allergies and also Sleep Apnea.  I have used a CPAP for many years and find that the one upside is that the filters combined with the humidifiers provide a &amp;#34;scrubbed&amp;#34; source of air which results in my waking each morning with a clear sinus.  What can I say about these filters?  They work, simply said.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive, but exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Now I change these more regularly.  Can&#x27;t​ beat the price.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Honestly, how does one review an air filter? Especially a refill? It either works or it doesn&#x27;t, and if you&#x27;re ordering a refill, hey, you already know the answer to that question as it pertains to you. No complaints here, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Today the medical world does not give enough filters for your CPAP. Insurances give you one every 3  to 6 months which is not enough. They should be changed monthly for your own health. These are cheep enough to keep yourself healthy.</li>
    <li> Looks just like my old filters except these are clean. :) 9 more words. They are white and fit in the little holder.</li>
    <li> I have a resmed S9 machine &amp; really need the finer filter because I have a lot of allergies. The regular filters are good- probably better than the regular filters for other machines, but I need this finer one. I can&#x27;t get them through my insurance provider, so I&#x27;m glad to be able to get them here. They are not packaged in resmed bags, but they are sealed in a bag &amp; are the real thing. This filter works very well.</li>
    <li> There are lots of seller&#x27;s filter &amp;#34;cut to fit&amp;#34; the S9 offered for sale but these were the real deal from ResMed and I could tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get the ResMed filter, it is the same high quality as their equipment. I am not affiliated with ResMed in any way. Just a consumer.</li>
    <li> They are exactly like the orgional. I have been getting the filters from a local source and they were not the same as came with the C-pap. These fit better and last longer.</li>
    <li> This is my third cpap machine. It is by far the worst. I bought it because it was soundless. And it is, but only for the first hour or so. I sent it back for repair, same thing. I sent it back again, same thing. The heated supply line is excellent and that is why I gave it a 3. I will now try a dental approach. I did have an older Phillips machine that I use on my RV. That one makes noise but works much better. George</li>
    <li> fresh air again! woohoo.  I was wondering why doesn&#x27;t anyone sell more than 2 or 3 at a time? just curious</li>
    <li> not as good quality as what I had originally, not quite as thick.  But good enough considering the cost was much less.</li>
    <li> M insurance only covers this product twice a year. But after 6 months when I went to change it. I noticed it was grey with dirt. I realized omg this is what I am breathing in nightly on my cpap machine. I quickly ordered some more. And recommend people order these products well in advance.</li>
    <li> Not genuine ResMed product. But they fit the ResMed S9 machine.</li>
    <li> The items were what I needed and the price was right for me. I recommend this company RESMED because of the customer service and they have good descriptions of their items. I will do business with them again because of their good business practices and good pricing.</li>
    <li> The filters are just as advertised and even arrived sooner than I expected. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> They look good but I honestly didn&#x27;t realize that they were sent to me until a couple of weeks after it said I had received them I dug to the bottom of one of the boxes I received and there they were.  They are rather small...</li>
    <li> It was not like the one&#x27;s I had used before and did not filter as well</li>
    <li> There are a few items you can buy for your CPAP machine that don&#x27;t require a prescription. I think it&#x27;s some companies way to jack up the prices. No prescription needed to buy these, which makes them a whole lot cheaper than buying them from the medical service company that services my CPAP machine. I just wish I could find more such items because this was cheaper, even with my co-pay.</li>
    <li> a little flimsy but received in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> Showed up in generic packaging. It works but seems pricey for what it is.</li>
    <li> Not hypoallergenic! Cheap foam filters!</li>
    <li> I ordered these filters as a replacement for my ResMed CPAP machine, along with a replacement ResMed mask and tubing.  The mask and tubing were equivalent to the original products I received with the machine and substantially less expensive than those offered by my local supplier, but these filters were not of the same quality.  These appear to be made of paper and are much lighter in weight.  I find that they did not filter as well as the original version that came with the machine, and have since ordered replacements from my local supplier.  The replacements they sent me were equivalent to the original.  Since I suffer from allergies as well, the quality of the filter is indeed important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these would work in the short term, I don&#x27;t believe they work as well as the original products nor do I think they would last as long.  I would only recommend these as an alternative if you have no source for the original, filters.</li>
    <li> I purchased these filters for my husband and myself. They work great and fit perfectly. The price is more reasonable then other places and it is top of the line. We are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This saved me, and my insurance company, over 75%. It was well worth every penny. I received the correct filters that were factory sealed and were the ResMed brand. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good find.  Easy way to buy these filters in a pack.  As always, very fast delivery time!</li>
    <li> I recently found that the dust allergies I suffered as a child have returned.  I needed new filters for my c-pap, I have been using the regular foam filters.  I decided to try the hypoallergenic ones to see if they would help with my allergies.  Tried for the first time last night, but have not realized any difference yet.&lt;br /&gt;  Was very fast shipping, got a week earlier than the estimated delivery date.  I will update the affectivness later after I&#x27;ve tried for awhile.</li>
    <li> Not the Resmed version as advertised and pictured. Very thin and flimsy that won&#x27;t really stay in the holder. Poor packaging. USPS had to add an extra wrapper to it as the packaging didn&#x27;t hold up in transit.</li>
    <li> Not fun to have Apnea, but the S9 system with the pillow mask is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> The filter made a different for me became it gives me security, knowing I&#x27;m breathing clean air.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m updating this product review because the company has shipped me the correct product which are the right size for my machine and sealed in official Resmed bags, after I wrote this scathing review (below).  I&#x27;m updating the original review from 1 to 4 stars (not a 5, due to the inconvenience).  Anyway, I will likely order from this company again to give them another chance.  It&#x27;s an awful lot of fuss over such a small product, but it would be nice if I could find a \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; company to get my supplies from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m giving the benefit of the doubt that this was a simple shipping error, but I&#x27;m leaving the original review in case others have a similar problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m still trying to sort this out with the company, so if I have a good outcome I might update this posting, but so far I&#x27;m totally underwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received was a not an official Resmed product; it didn&#x27;t come in an official sealed Resmed bag, and they don&#x27;t look a thing like the picture.  What I got was some tiny little filter with some weird little tab on it that is smaller than the filters I currently use.  They came in little ziplocked baggies, so lord knows who/how/where they were packaged, and they come complete with a sketchy extra block of grey foam that may or may not have something to do with making it hypoallergenic.  Basically it looks like something I could put together with some parts from the hardware store, so I&#x27;m obviously not going to use it on a machine that filters the air that I breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company and expressed my wish to return these items, indicating that they were obviously nothing like the description they provided nor were they the right size filter for my machine.  They responded with one question, asking me to confirm the model of my CPAP, which I did.  I get a sneaking suspicion that I&#x27;m not getting my money back, so I already ordered the filters from another company that had no problem providing the correctsized filters that were in sealed Resmed bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I wouldn&#x27;t order filters from these people.  I did order another part for my CPAP from the same company and I received the correct item, sealed in a white Resmed bag, but this filter thing is really sketchy.  There are a lot places where I love to save a buck, but using knock-off parts for my CPAP isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> The filters were exactly as advertised and arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive but they do the job. Next time ill shop for a better price.</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference the very first morning. I&#x27;ll never go back to the standard filter. I don&#x27;t know how long they last yet, however.</li>
    <li> The filters that I received MyRespiratorySupply were not official ResMed S9 hypoallergenic filters and did not properly fit in my ResMed S9 CPAP.  The filter was thinner than a standard ResMed S9 filter and had gaps around it when inserted into my machine.</li>
    <li> The ResMed filter is a great product - it&#x27;s the one I actually ordered from this seller.  However, the seller sent me a product that was not a RedMed product.  It fits OK, but if you really want the quality of the original ResMed filter, you will probably want to make sure that the seller confirm that they will indeed sell you the ResMed filter.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Product is good.</li>
    <li> Item worked as expected, but was suspicious of the product as it came in only a small clear plastic baggie. No manufacture information or specs were provided, besides the reciept.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten my CPAP at the worst possible time.  The pollen was going through the roof and with the CPAP on my face each night I was basically mainlining pollen into my sinus cavity.  I would up with a terrible cough and bronchitis. Within two days of having this filter my head began to clear.  Now after a month I have absolutly no symptoms of sinus problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather they come in larger quantity packages but they&#x27;re well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a filter for a cpap machine what can one say</li>
    <li> Same quality and Much lower cost than from the physicians office.</li>
    <li> Now I can breath right</li>
    <li> took 3 tries to finally get the product, received cheap no-name brand type products 2 times that were not hypoallergenic.  finally received what &#x27;looks&#x27; like the right product, but not in factory packaging, so unsure if it is in fact resmed product or another type of no-name.  Took a month to correct the problem.  Company did respond quickly, but incorrectly unfortunately.</li>
    <li> It was way past time for me to get a new filter. You should have seen my old one. No, don&#x27;t look at it. I am happy to have a new, clean one and a spare.</li>
    <li> THANKS SO MUCH, EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED</li>
    <li> Good quality good price good company</li>
    <li> Ordered these filters and received them promptly.  The filters were exactly what was needed for my S9 and work great.  No issues.</li>
    <li> Appears to be the genuine article</li>
    <li> Who knows how real effective these filters are on the air we breath. I just know that I use to put a wet cotton ball with some drops of various essential oils by the filter to have a nice smell to breath before I used this filter. With this filter it pretty much eliminates that smell where I am no longer doing that. So it must do more then the regular filters in my brilliant scientific knowledge. :)</li>
    <li> The filters were fine but were not what I expected. The filters that came with the C-PAP were thicker than the filters I received and I tried to judge based on a picture.  But they work fine.</li>
    <li> These do just what you would expect them to do. These help relieve my seasonal allergies while I&#x27;m sleeping and they&#x27;re quite a bit less expensive than from my local provider.</li>
    <li> Prompt, as Stated, Pleased&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a real convenience to be able to purchase this item on line.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These filters are a consumable part for my CPAP machine, and have to be changed monthly. These are the correct part - I can&#x27;t say much more than that. The advantage to me by ordering through Amazon.com is that I don&#x27;t have to make the long drive to the VA Medical Center and then stand in long lines to get some, even if they are free. I subtracted one star because of the small quantity (two). I would prefer to be able to buy a larger quantity - such as a dozen - at one time. They are small enough and light enough (less than 0.5 g each) that the postage will almost certainly be the same, and it would be amortized over the larger quantity. I would recommend these for anyone who needs these for this model CPAP machine.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great delivery. Overpriced product.</li>
    <li> Save your money and buy a good cheese cloth instead. Seriously, I received my filters and they don&#x27;t seem any different than the aforementioned cheesecloth.</li>
    <li> Much thinner than the OEM version. Will see how it works over the next few days to a week.</li>
    <li> works with my machine</li>
    <li> comes in sleep restfully packaging and say&#x27;s resmed style, that being said they fit filter housing perfectly and since i started using them my allergy symptoms go away at night, i had just the standard filter before, and it dose say made in USA. so its up to you but i&#x27;ll buy agin. Used for one week so far, will update if any negative artifacts come up.</li>
    <li> Fits my machine and filters the air just what you would expect</li>
    <li> The filters I received are not in ResMed packaging.  If indeed they are ResMed filters, they have been repackaged.  This seems most unlikely.  They did go to the trouble of printing \\&quot;36855\\&quot; on the package which is the ResMed part number.  They may be just as good a filter as the genuine ResMed product.  They might be a better product for all I know.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t believe that they are ResMed filters which is what I paid for.</li>
    <li> These are a finer filter then the coarse stock filters that came with my cpap. I&#x27;m sure they will clog up quicker, but for the price, its easy enough to replace, and I get a better peice of mind from the extra filtering these provide.</li>
    <li> Filter package was labelled as pollen filters, not hypo-allergenic.  The fiber mesh is more open than filters I receive from my CPAP supplier.</li>
    <li> Works and better price than the Rip Off Medical Supply House Cigna wants me to use.</li>
    <li> Wow this really is a must have product, especially if you have allergies.  The difference between the regular filter and the hypoallergenic is mind blowing.  I used the regular filter and in 3 months it looks almost like new, hardly any dirt caught.  I then used the Hypoallergenic one, and in one month it was filthy grayish color. It really does catch more dust and other things.  I would recommend this over the regular filters, which I know feel are worthless.</li>
    <li> Work well but price has doubled since I first bought. You can see the stuff it filters out of the air.  The regular filters do nothing.</li>
    <li> I got this filter to replace the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect replacement for the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because is better for allergies.</li>
