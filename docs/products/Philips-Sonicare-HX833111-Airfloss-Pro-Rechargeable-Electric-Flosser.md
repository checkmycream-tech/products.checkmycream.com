### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>being said, I&#x27;m the perfect market for this.  </li>
      <li>Great Product - Thank You!!</li>
      <li>I called Philips and they suggested the best route was to return it to my dentist where I bought it yesterday.</li>
      <li>That was the best part – I could still get a refund within 90 days.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent at removing food particles caught between your teeth.</li>
      <li>When it worked, it was wonderful.</li>
      <li>So if I&#x27;m so impressed why didn&#x27;t I rate it 5 stars?</li>
      <li>Great idea, in theory.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>On manual, I feel hesitant about pushing the button, lol, like it is going to hurt.  </li>
      <li>Great checkups from my Dentist because of this unit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Feels great and seems to do the job.</li>
      <li>good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be in a good position.</li>
      <li>Good product...</li>
      <li>It seems to work about as good as floss.  </li>
      <li>I could not use it anymore, but fortunately I can return it because the best customer service from amazon.</li>
      <li>Air Floss seemed like a good alternative to the interdental brush, and it is.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why it is best for me to just put it on automatic and run through it quickly.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps that will improve with time as I get more experienced, or perhaps it is the nature of the airfloss.</li>
      <li>I rated Philips Sonicare Airfloss Pro 4 stars because it is a nice flossing alternative.</li>
      <li>The tri-burst feature is nice, but…..</li>
      <li>It is nice that it takes up a minimum amount of space.</li>
      <li>They also claim that Airfloss Pro is clinically proven as effective as string floss in removing plaque.  </li>
      <li>but I wanted to be honest with this review.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame that this happened because I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Effective.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is well designed to feel nice in the hand, and the controls are placed where they are very easy to use whether it is on manual or automatic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is just very strong to me.  </li>
      <li>word of warning: It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally trigger it and spray your floor or walls.</li>
      <li>word of warning: It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally trigger it and spray your floor or walls.</li>
      <li>It is VERY easy to fill.  </li>
      <li>While the Airfloss may remove plaque as well, we didn&#x27;t find it effective in removing food particles stuck between teeth (though the FAQ claims it should do most food particles).</li>
      <li>This is ideal for me, since it really does get into all of the spots</li>
      <li>No, it is best to just keep your mouth down towards the sink and fairly shut around the applicator when using this.  </li>
      <li>I love this Philips Sonicare Airflosser and would buy this product again.</li>
      <li>Got this about March 2015, seemed to work ok until about the beginning of May.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>many broke doesn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>The mouthwash that comes with it, as well as many or most that you buy, contains xylitol.</li>
      <li>Charge it up, the charge lasts from 11 days to many weeks (depending on the setting).</li>
      <li>While I use the tradional floss 3-4 times a week because it&#x27;s quicker and more convenient.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Never have I been able to go all the way around my mouth w/o the unit stalling.  </li>
      <li>Put it between a couple teeth, press the button on top, there you go.</li>
      <li>You can set it to work on manual, then press the button at the top for it to do one tooth.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this hoping it would be easier than flossing, something which I need to do more often.</li>
      <li>A more week after that, this problem happened again and could not be used anymore.</li>
      <li>and we look forward to hearing more from you.</li>
      <li>If you have any questions please contact Philips Care &amp;#62;  Sincerely,  The Philips Team</li>
      <li>Mechanical floss is still better for some jobs, like removing a tightly-wedged chunk of something between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One day after that, it worked again, and I was thinking that was ok.</li>
      <li>I love the 3 burst levels.</li>
      <li>If you can get the discount coupon/rebate coupon, it is even better.</li>
      <li>The product does not do anything it suppose to be able to do.. and nobody in Philips know what is going on with my refund ....</li>
      <li>I love the way it cleans between my teeth.</li>
      <li>The mouthwash that comes with it, as well as many or most that you buy, contains xylitol.</li>
      <li>Each day my mouth felt better.  </li>
      <li>I always promise my dental hygienist that I will do a better job, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Very easy to hold and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>She fills it with a pain relieving mouth rinse and uses it to relieve discomfort while providing a very clean environment for her teeth.</li>
      <li>I use it on the first setting which is the lowest and have good results.</li>
      <li>really rather pleasant to use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and NO wrapping floss around my fingers.  :-)</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m quite comfortable that the review here on Amazon helps more people.  </li>
      <li>You can use mouthwash OR water - or diluted mouthwash which I find most comfortable.</li>
      <li>It is a lot faster and more comfortable than flossing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
      <li>It is a lot faster and more comfortable than flossing to me.  </li>
      <li>3 is good, it really cleans well between the teeth.  </li>
      <li>easy to use, follow directions &amp; it seems to do a very good job in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>I have used the Philips Sonicare Airfloss, the original one, for many years.  </li>
      <li>One would think that the newer version would be better than the original.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use.  </li>
      <li>My mouth has never felt more clean, that&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would clean better.</li>
      <li>or they work just fine, so if can get one to work by the end of 2.5 years</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not powerful enough, but would be perfect for my purpose as a supplement to the great Opalpix (look them up if you don&#x27;t like flossing).&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Airfloss is painless, easy to use, and with mouthwash it does give a distinctly fresh feeling--seemingly better than just rinsing with mouthwash alone.</li>
      <li>The long and short of it is that I personally think you really have to use string floss to get the best cleaning for your teeth, and while this is a good product, I think it would be best used in addition too, not in place of floss.  </li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend buying it because it is able to blast away stuff that a toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get to.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and my mouth feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>Fortunately Phillips had a satisfaction guarantee, which Amazon honored</li>
      <li>like gadgets and tend to use a gadget if it makes things easier and more fun.</li>
      <li>The redesigned tips no longer fit into the gaps between the teeth.  </li>
      <li>You can use straight mouthwash, warm water, or a mix of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The electric brush is great for your gums but obviously isn&#x27;t going to do as well for getting between teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a religious flosser because I&#x27;m prone to cavities, and I&#x27;m happy with the Airfloss Pro&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>Continue moving in one direction like this, one tooth at a time, and you&#x27;ll get fast, effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>She said she couldnt tell (i think they get free stuff from philips</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and my mouth feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>I think this would be great for developing a daily routine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has three settings, and I found all of them comfortable.</li>
      <li>The concept is still great and the Pro cleans the gaps but not as well as the original (I’ve had 5 in total over a 3 year period).</li>
      <li>The Pro version feels nicer than the first one, the tip is more comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You can choose to have it shoot one, two, or three quick bursts automatically, and it adjusts easily with a touch of a button.</li>
      <li>This really is a quick and easy and thorough method.</li>
      <li>As someone who hates traditional flossing this is an amazing device!</li>
      <li>When I bought it I was really confident because I have a Sonicare toothbrush for years that&#x27;s never failed - I trusted in my experience and that&#x27;s why I chose this dental</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> easy to use, follow directions &amp; it seems to do a very good job in a short amount of time. I like the slim design and setting options.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to make it work. My dental hygienist told me to spray mouthwash under bridges, and doing that with my old waterfloss would waste a lot of mouthwash, which is not exactly cheap. Unfortunately, Philips did not deliver:&lt;br /&gt;1. The shape of the spraying tip makes it hard to correctly position it between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2. At certain positions, mostly at the lower jaw, it makes screeching sounds and even interrupts the spraying cycle.&lt;br /&gt;3. After a few days, it got stuck in permanent shooting mode, at which point I requested a return from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, really, because when you manage to aim at the right spot and Airfloss works as intended, it does a pretty good job. Won&#x27;t replace flossing completely - it&#x27;s not powerful enough, but would be perfect for my purpose as a supplement to the great Opalpix (look them up if you don&#x27;t like flossing).&lt;br /&gt;Maybe next model will be better.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning around difficult places and filled with Chlorsys instead of water it gives an extra boost to gum health.</li>
    <li> My older version of this device eventually stopped working after two years.  I purchased this version (3/10/15) with high hopes of continued maintenance of dental health.  For the first month I enjoyed the new features.  At 6 weeks it stopped working abruptly, as others have reported here.  Contacting customer service has been an ongoing nightmare since 4/27/15.  I started with a phone call and was assured that I would promptly receive an email with a return mailing label.  48 hours later no label.  Initiated a chat session and again assured a label would be sent.  Got the label 24 hours later and immediately sent the device.  Seven days later another email with a label appears and a separate email notifying me that a new device is being shipped.  Another week and no device has materialized.  Called CSR who couldn&#x27;t find any record of these interactions/notices.  I sent the documentation of my interactions as we spoke, and after prolonged periods on hold, my info was validated and I was told that &amp;#34;the new unit would be shipped within 7-10 business days.  Today I receive notice: &amp;#34;backordered and expect delivery 6/19/15&amp;#34;.  The really galling aspect is how these CSRs unctuously &amp;#34;sympathize&amp;#34; to cover up their clueless ineptness and inability to do anything more than make empty promises.  Such a contrast with having good results with a product that unfortunately was defective.  Philips has a long way to go to catch up in the CSR realm.</li>
    <li> I rated Philips Sonicare Airfloss Pro 4 stars because it is a nice flossing alternative. Let&#x27;s be honest here, the only reason I got this product is because I don&#x27;t floss everyday and thought if this is easy enough, it may entice me to create a daily habit of flossing/airflossing. It did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, it splash all over my face, mirror and sink. Sooo messy, so I use it in the shower now. I use it on the first setting which is the lowest and have good results. Scared to try it on the high third setting, then it will get everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good; it replaces the need to use a separate mouth wash afterwards since I pour that in the container which freshens my breath that way. It charges really fast, which is a perk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback, the inside of my teeth still felt grimy so I had to use this twice, once one the exterior and once on my interior sides; which took tice as long as regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice alternative for flossing but it seems I&#x27;m using it only once a week. While I use the tradional floss 3-4 times a week because it&#x27;s quicker and more convenient.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of use it got stuck in autofire mode.</li>
    <li> Got this about March 2015, seemed to work ok until about the beginning of May.It seemed to get stuck on auto fire so it would just keep running until I held the power button down to force it to turn off. I chatted with phillips online and they offered to send me a new one. Must be a pretty common problem since they didn&#x27;t even want the old one back and didn&#x27;t want to see the receipt. They said I would get it within a few days but these things must break a lot since I got an email saying that they ran out of stock and it would take a few weeks to send a replacement. I got the replacement at the end of May but that one broke within a week (same problem, keeps firing). Unfortunately I am out of the 90 days money back guarantee that phillips offers so I will have to try to get another replacement.  Another annoying thing, they have replaced my airfloss twice and given me codes for 10 dollars off on Philips-store.com but in both cases the promotional codes were invalid.   After six months when i went back for my cleaning, i excitedly asked my hygenist if my use of the air floss paid off. She said she couldnt tell (i think they get free stuff from philips so she cant complain) but at the end she did say that i need to make sure i floss everyday</li>
    <li> As someone who hates traditional flossing this is an amazing device! It also allows you to use mouthwash so it&#x27;s really flossing and rinsing your mouth at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for someone like me who hates spending the time on oral hygiene but is obsessed with having a great smile and clean mouth!</li>
    <li> Good product...WHEN IT WORKS!!  After the first one stopped working, I contacted Philips and they sent a replacement.  However, they sent a single burst and I had a triple burst.  Contacted them again and told them of their mistake.  After a month of waiting, they finally sent a triple burst like the one I had.  It stopped working last week.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  I am now on my 4th one and it just stopped working!</li>
    <li> way better than the older model , for me anyways</li>
    <li> Flossing was always a royal PITA for me until I purchased this product.  Now I floss every day.  That pretty much says it all.</li>
    <li> The airfloss quit working after three weeks.  Can&#x27;t return to Amazon because return window expired three days ago..Customer service replaced the first one.  the second one works sometime if I tap it on the side of the sink.  It was working until I&#x27;m about halfway through flossing and then quit.  Now doesn&#x27;t work at all. Great concept, but poor quality.  This product does not deserve the Norelco name.  I have used their products (electric shavers, Beard trimmers, Electric toothbrushes) for years with no problems.  Have scrapped this and bought a Water Pik. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent at removing food particles caught between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Works well and keeps mouth fresh</li>
    <li> This product broke within a month of using and I even barely used it! The settings won&#x27;t change out of a particular mode anymore. I should&#x27;ve listened to the other reviewers having their Airfloss breaking within a few months.</li>
    <li> My teeth are crooked as a result of having teeth pulled when I was a teen. As a result, flossing has always been difficult. This is ideal for me, since it really does get into all of the spots I couldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three settings, and I found all of them comfortable. You can use mouthwash OR water - or diluted mouthwash which I find most comfortable. It holds enough for two brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I notice is that I tend to get messy using it. Perhaps that will improve with time as I get more experienced, or perhaps it is the nature of the airfloss.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping it would be easier than flossing, something which I need to do more often. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t feel like it left my teeth as clean as when I floss. It just cleans at the gum line but does nothing for in between the teeth. It also splashes a lot, even with your lips closed. It is nice that it takes up a minimum amount of space. But not sure this product is really going to be useful to me.</li>
    <li> It has problem only used 2 days, it fires automatically when power on , can&#x27;t stop it until hold on power button to make it power off, I can&#x27;t believe that Philips&#x27;s product becomes so terrible. I&#x27;ve requested  refund to Amazon</li>
    <li> Returned it immediately. Fortunately Phillips had a satisfaction guarantee, which Amazon honored</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t tell my dentist, I don&#x27;t floss regularly.  List an excuse, I&#x27;ve used it and still do.  I get the importance, so it&#x27;s not a matter of that.  It&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t do it.  I don&#x27;t like it.  I don&#x27;t like the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m the perfect market for this.  I love it.  That&#x27;s about as clear as I can get.  It&#x27;s great. So easy to use.  Charge it up, the charge lasts from 11 days to many weeks (depending on the setting). You can have it go 1 burst, 2 burst, or 3 burst. Put it between a couple teeth, press the button on top, there you go. Fill it with water or mouthwash. It comes with a small bottle of mouthwash.  Very easy to hold and easy to manage. Though, my interest in watching it work the first couple times resulted in some splashes on the bathroom mirror.  It shoots a quick burst of air mixed with liquid, and that&#x27;s it.  My mouth has never felt more clean, that&#x27;s the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like gadgets and tend to use a gadget if it makes things easier and more fun. This really is a quick and easy and thorough method. It&#x27;s a little pricey, to be sure, compared to regular floss.  But, it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ll actually use versus regular floss. My teeth and gums are worth it.</li>
    <li> It took me years to develop a consistent, daily flossing habit, despite the biannual cajoling of my dentists-but now I do use string floss daily, and have good checkups as a result. Reading the Airfloss Pro FAQ on Philips&#x27; website, they state that string floss is the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34; by which your personal dental care is measured. They claim that the Airfloss Pro is not aimed at replacing your string flossing habit, but is intended to improve your daily interdental cleaning routine. They also claim that Airfloss Pro is clinically proven as effective as string floss in removing plaque.  Evaluating these claims: I certainly believe that most people would enjoy/prefer using this device to floss than string floss. For years I hated flossing, and had a lot of painful bleeding and felt little guilt for skipping flossing in the evening. The Airfloss is painless, easy to use, and with mouthwash it does give a distinctly fresh feeling--seemingly better than just rinsing with mouthwash alone. I think this would be great for developing a daily routine. But I question whether or how it would encourage a person to be more consistent in using string floss--unless perhaps by reducing the gingivitis and related gum pain, so you don&#x27;t mind string-flossing as much. More likely, it seems, someone may just prefer to continue using this instead of string floss.  While the Airfloss may remove plaque as well, we didn&#x27;t find it effective in removing food particles stuck between teeth (though the FAQ claims it should do most food particles). Also, while using the product, as it&#x27;s puffing air in your mouth, I found it hard to keep a little trickle of drool from coming down the nozzle, which did nothing to help reverse my wife&#x27;s stereotypes about men. The long and short of it is that I personally think you really have to use string floss to get the best cleaning for your teeth, and while this is a good product, I think it would be best used in addition too, not in place of floss.  **Update--the Airfloss quit working on us after a few months, and Philips customer care was great and sent a replacement unit that is working fine.</li>
    <li> Stopped working properly within 6 days. The unit got stuck on auto-fire and nothing worked to fix it. Had to send it back. Very disappointed with product, but Amazon was prompt with refund.</li>
    <li> SPrays water/mouth wash all over including the mirror.  The water-piks I have used seem to be easier ti use</li>
    <li> The Airfloss Pro is a marked improvement over the original model, which I returned after the battery stopped working after a few months.  The new model has three settings and signals when it needs recharging and when it&#x27;s done recharging.  I may have overtaxed the battery of the original pre-Pro model by leaving it on the charger all the time, which may exhaust a battery.  I&#x27;ve used the Pro for a couple of months but am careful not to keep it on the charge continuously.  I love the way it cleans between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product for travel but went back to my Waterpic for my daily cleaning as it gives a longer cleaning period.</li>
    <li> Airfloss Pro did not clean nothing ..completely useless.. I returned it back the next day April 25 and have not received my refund until now June 11th ... I called 20 times and talked to several supervisors including (D)... everytime they tell me they will escalate it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am right now on hold for 30 minutes because the supervisor (D) put me on hold ...  It is June 11th still literally fighting to know where is my money and why I have not received my refund yet ....  The product does not do anything it suppose to be able to do.. and nobody in Philips know what is going on with my refund .... I can not believe Philips still in business with all the confusion and extremely poor management they have.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love the 3 burst levels.</li>
    <li> I ended up giving this away. I have some issues getting my teeth clean in between and such so my dentist recommended this to help better maintain them. Great idea, in theory. Even on healthy gums this thing rips them open like a chainsaw, I bled less during my last scaling. Next time I get the urge to to this to myself I will go to a self-serve carwash and use the high pressure sprayer, it will only cost me $1.25 to make my mouth hurt so much I have to eat soft food.</li>
    <li> Feels great and seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> It definitely does the job.  I&#x27;m a somewhat lazy flosser but still sting floss a couple of times a week.  The Pro version feels nicer than the first one, the tip is more comfortable.</li>
    <li> This comes with a bit of mouthwash that you can fill the chamber with.  The chamber in this holds enough for one person to use once.  It is VERY easy to fill.  The first time I used it, the mouthwash burnt the crap out of my mouth though, leaving it very sore.  It is just very strong to me.  The next time, I used 1/2 water and 1/2 mouthwash.  I would really recommend starting this way, or at least trying a bit of that antimicrobial wash first to see if you can handle it.  I normally do use mouthwash, but to me this brand was VERY strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This charges on a base that looks like an upside down T on a circle.  Once charged, it works for 12 hours, which is a LOT of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a variable setting.  3 is good, it really cleans well between the teeth.  You can set it to work on manual, then press the button at the top for it to do one tooth.  We have ran it on automatic. (My husband had to try it out as well.)  On automatic, you just have to move to the areas between your teeth and point it, and it goes -whap whap wham- and you get bursts of air and liquid at a high speed.  It sounds a bit scary to me- like there&#x27;s a spring loaded combined with that feeling at the eye doctors&#x27; before they puff the air in your eye.  That&#x27;s why it is best for me to just put it on automatic and run through it quickly.  On manual, I feel hesitant about pushing the button, lol, like it is going to hurt.  IT does NOT hurt.  It feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well designed to feel nice in the hand, and the controls are placed where they are very easy to use whether it is on manual or automatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really rather pleasant to use but do not look in the mirror.  Oh that&#x27;s a MISTAKE- I tried it and found that I had to clean my mirror immediately, because the liquid and probably some spit and plague went everywhere.  No, it is best to just keep your mouth down towards the sink and fairly shut around the applicator when using this.  If not, it goes EVERYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have checked with a dental scaler after using it several times now, and it is definitely getting the plaque out from between my teeth.  It is a lot faster and more comfortable than flossing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/7/2015  Mine quit working right a few months after I got it.  It still works, but I can&#x27;t use it manually anymore - once it starts- it goes until it runs out of liquid.  It does stop on its own, but only after several minutes.several times now, and it is definitely getting the plaque out from between my teeth.

    <li> Below is my original review. I am editing it and reducing the star value from 5 to 2 because it has stopped working after just a little over a month of usage. I had the same experience as another reviewer and my unit got stuck on auto-fire and would not stop until the battery died. Nothing I did would help. I recharged it and hoped it was a fluke, but the first time I touched it the same thing happened. Since my unit was a sample for review, it will not be covered by warranty so I can&#x27;t comment on customer service. It&#x27;s a shame that this happened because I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a consistent flosser. I always promise my dental hygienist that I will do a better job, but I don&#x27;t. The Sonicair AirFloss is designed for people like me that don&#x27;t floss regularly, so I looked forward to giving it a try. I charged it up overnight and read the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to fill, and comfortable to grip and depress the trigger button. The handle is slightly textured for better grip. It&#x27;s very simple to operate, even a child could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was instructed to hold the button down to get the liquid started. I used the mouthwash that came with it. I was not prepared for the force it used, and sprayed my bathroom wall with mouthwash. I then began using it between my teeth, with my mouth closed. I could really feel the power as it went between my teeth! I went around the outside first, then angled it around so I could blast from the inner side outward. It was easy to maneuver through the tricky spots, although I accidentally sprayed my mouth a few times because the button is so sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can choose to have it shoot one, two, or three quick bursts automatically, and it adjusts easily with a touch of a button. When I set it to three, it used a full reservoir of mouthwash for one cleaning session based on the amount of time I spent with it. You can use straight mouthwash, warm water, or a mix of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and my mouth feels fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t replace the need for old fashioned dental floss if you have large particles of food stuck between your teeth, but it works well for general use. It&#x27;s more fun that flossing, and I&#x27;ve found myself much more likely to use it than dental floss. The company says healthier gums are just a couple of weeks away with regular use. My dental hygienist should be happier with me when I see her next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning: It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally trigger it and spray your floor or walls. If you have dogs, please watch for this. The mouthwash that comes with it, as well as many or most that you buy, contains xylitol. Xylitol is poisonous to dogs and even a tiny amount can be bad for them.or a mix of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and my mouth feels fantastic.

    <li> Within few days got problems, the on and off bottom did not work properly.</li>
    <li> Veer disappointed ... Bought first air floss ten months ago and it developed a fault and wouldn&#x27;t work so exchanged it for an air flow pro least Friday.  Now it auto fires when switched on ... They clean really well but blimey are they unreliable.  New one going back to who asap.</li>
    <li> Great checkups from my Dentist because of this unit.</li>
    <li> It was broken after 1 month.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electronic flosser before.  I must admit that I don&#x27;t floss at all unless I have something stuck in my teeth.  I know, it is bad that I don&#x27;t floss but I wanted to be honest with this review.  My gums took a beating at first using this device.  The first couple of days I saw some blood coming out of my mouth.  Each day my mouth felt better.  After using this flosser I would then use mouthwash and man did my mouth feel clean.  I don&#x27;t use this every day but I have been using it it at least twice a week and I love it.  I would certainly recommend buying it because it is able to blast away stuff that a toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get to.</li>
    <li> The jet extender comes off during use.  After three weeks of use, the appliance stopped operating completely. The limited troubleshooting information that came with the product was of no help.  Now seeking a return.</li>
    <li> Great Product - Thank You!!</li>
    <li> The concept is still great and the Pro cleans the gaps but not as well as the original (I’ve had 5 in total over a 3 year period). The redesigned tips no longer fit into the gaps between the teeth.  They’re not as effective for me and that’s frustrating &#x3D; why did you do THAT?  In a fit of “corporate controlism” Philips prevents the old tips from fitting the new unit?  My old one is dead so I can’t use my supply of tips – have to buy new – gee, why? The tri-burst feature is nice, but….. Never have I been able to go all the way around my mouth w/o the unit stalling.  It just makes a soft beep and stops working.  This happens on average 2-10 times before I make it around my mouth.  Of late, it would fail to restart unless tapped on the counter.  Finally, it wouldn’t restart at all.  Back to the local retailer it went!!  Overall, it died in 86 days - returned to store for refund. That was the best part – I could still get a refund within 90 days.  My recommendation is: don’t get one.  But, if you do – buy it locally and keep the receipt. Watch for the return period and get a refund.  Buy a competitive model with a water tank and little hose.  You know what I mean   *******  I guess that Philips didn&#x27;t like this review - they rejected it.  Never mind - there are only 9 reviews on their site so I&#x27;m quite comfortable that the review here on Amazon helps more people.

    <li> I love this Philips Sonicare Airflosser and would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used the Philips Sonicare Airfloss, the original one, for many years.  After it finally didn&#x27;t work, I bought the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Sonicare Airfloss Pro.  One would think that the newer version would be better than the original.  Was I wrong.  After using the Airfloss Pro, it simply didn&#x27;t work after only 1-1/2 weeks.  I called Philips and they said they would mail new a new replacement and to return the one to them so they could &amp;#34;evaluate it&amp;#34;.  Okay, the new one arrived and I plugged it in and waited the required 24 hours prior to using in.  After about 2 weeks, it failed, as well.  I again called Philips and they said that a second replacement would be sent to me, but that this was the last time they would replace it.  Guess what?  After using the second replacement for almost 2 weeks, it again stopped working this morning half way through my using it.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Obviously, the new Airfloss Pro has manufacturing issues.  Be warned.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase! After one month the main button will stop working. Regualr mint floss does the same job and will not give you a hassle.</li>
    <li> Poorly manufactured garbage. This item crapped out after 2 weeks. I&#x27;m too busy to get it serviced so I opted for a Water Pic instead.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to complement my Waterpik. I like them both and would suggest that reviewers who rate this poorly based on performance against a &amp;#34;Water Flosser&amp;#34; do not understand the product. Think &amp;#34;sand blaster&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;power washer&amp;#34;. A waterpik is not a Flosser and never will be. It is an high-power oral irrigator that helps you clear food and bacteria from between teeth and inside deep gum pockets. The Philips Air Floss is for blasting away bacteria and calculus growing in interdental spaces. I have periodontal pockets as well as large interdental gaps, so up until now I had to use the Waterpik, brush, floss, then brush with Oral-B interdental brushes. That&#x27;s brushing between each tooth, both sides, 2-3 times daily. It was exhausting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Air Floss seemed like a good alternative to the interdental brush, and it is. In a fraction of the time it took to interdental brush I can blast with the Air Floss. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and have come away with better results than my brushes! So if I&#x27;m so impressed why didn&#x27;t I rate it 5 stars? I rated a 3 because it broke after just the second use and I&#x27;m not very happy with the inconvenience; however, I&#x27;m so tired of the interdental brushing that I&#x27;m willing to go through literally dozens of failed units to get a good one, whatever it takes. When I get one that lasts I&#x27;ll bump to a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not concerned about the failures because: A.) It comes with a 2 year warranty that Philips extends another 6 months if you register, after which I&#x27;m fine having to pay for another one; B.) I&#x27;m sending the unit back to Amazon within the return window for a replacement as defective, so the warranty period begins again with the replacement; and, C.) It seems from the reviews like they either fail right away or they work just fine, so if can get one to work by the end of 2.5 years I&#x27;ll be in a good position. It looks to me like all the reviewers complaining about customer support were given freebeta-units to review and are just upset that Philips stopped replacing after the 3rd time. That&#x27;s kind-of the point of doing these types of tests, to see if you&#x27;ve got the product right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all we know Philips knows/knew about the quality problem and may have taken care of it. If so, these Amazon sellers are not on Philips list of authorized retailers and there may be no way for Philips to call these units back before they make it to consumers. It would be like if you or I bought 100 units to resell from Walgreens...how would Philips know you had them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I&#x27;m writing this review for people like me that have to use an interdental brush multiple times a day. As I mentioned, I also have periodontal pockets (some up to 5mm) that necessitate the Waterpik, so I can speak to the fact that really their only similarities are that you stick them both in your mouth and use them both for periodontal care. I wouldn&#x27;t want someone to miss out on the benefits because other reviewers don&#x27;t understand the difference.</li>
    <li> It is completely unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it replaced in first month. It stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement unit is broken in 2 weeks (it does not stop working after use)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this one by the first gen.</li>
    <li> I purchased one and it worked for less than three weeks.  It continues to want to work but all I get is a little whistle sound and nothing else.  When I bought it I was really confident because I have a Sonicare toothbrush for years that&#x27;s never failed - I trusted in my experience and that&#x27;s why I chose this dental tool.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I could get some help to troubleshoot or get some directions from the on-line tech support with this.  There was nothing anywhere on the website to give me a direction and when I tried tech support the screen read they were all busy and to try again later.  I did try again later, three times, and every time I got the same busy message.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with this one.  Wish I had read all the reviews before I decided to buy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay , but now , it&#x27;s down , can&#x27;t work , as I&#x27;m in china , how to repair ??</li>
    <li> When it worked, it was wonderful. My teeth had never felt so clean. But it stopped working after two weeks. Philips was great to deal with and they are sending a new one, however it has been on back order for about a month and won&#x27;t be shipped for another month. I hope the delay is because they are fixing the problem because when it worked it was terrific.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean as well as dental floss.  I was hoping it would clean better.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. And when I say &amp;#34;I hate flossing&amp;#34; I mostly mean &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t floss&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this thing, though. It&#x27;s simple to use and seems like a good match for my electric toothbrush. The electric brush is great for your gums but obviously isn&#x27;t going to do as well for getting between teeth. This Airfloss system handles that part. It couldn&#x27;t be easier to use. Fill up the reservoir and move it between your teeth. If you hold down the button it does a &amp;#34;shoot / pause / shoot&amp;#34; routine to give you a second to move between teeth or you can just press and release the button to set your own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable electric and comes with everything you need. Definitely worth it if you hate flossing but realize you should probably floss. It comes with a small sample bottle of mouthwash but you can use whatever you like for refills (I use Listerine. Manual says you can use any mouthwash or water.)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend at the recommendation of someone familiar with the device. She was a recent recipient of braces on her teeth and was experiencing the myriad difficulties associated with them. She fills it with a pain relieving mouth rinse and uses it to relieve discomfort while providing a very clean environment for her teeth. We have found the device travels well too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  If you can get the discount coupon/rebate coupon, it is even better.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6823cd2d862b6d89f5166e27ca949dad]]The functions looks better than the previous version while it worked. But it stopped to produce pressure after one week use. One day after that, it worked again, and I was thinking that was ok. A more week after that, this problem happened again and could not be used anymore. When I pressed the button, it did nothing but the buzz noise. I could not use it anymore, but fortunately I can return it because the best customer service from amazon.</li>
    <li> Stopped working on first use. I didn&#x27;t even finish my top row of teeth and the device began making a long beep sound instead of pumping water or air. I can hear it attempting to pump but it just beeps. I called Philips and they suggested the best route was to return it to my dentist where I bought it yesterday. I called my dentist and since they are not a typical retail store, it isn&#x27;t a transaction they are used to doing. They said they might have to mail me a check after I drop it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews here I&#x27;m definitely not going to get a replacement, just a refund. I&#x27;ll stick with floss.</li>
    <li> Initially I thought the pressure of water was not as strong as the last model, but I got used to it and like it very much now.</li>
    <li> it does not completely replace flossing if anything (like parsley) is really stuck between the upper part of your teeth, this is more for the area between the gum and the small gap between the teeth. But I love it, very few times per months I need to floss now, keeps gum healthy too. and a must have with braces. I use it with the one pulse setting, probably increasing its life, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 months now every day sometimes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- maybe find a way to make the mouthwash compartment larger to contain more liquid to reduce the number of times of fills/use.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I HATE to wrap floss around my fingers -- I know -- I am weird.&lt;br /&gt;But my gums were suffering. So I bought this as a last resort. And truthfully, I had no expectations that I would get anything less than the usual tongue lashing at my bi-annual visit to the dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I had only been using it three weeks before my appointment.&lt;br /&gt;And my hygienist said I had NO plaque under the gum line of my teeth -- imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;THAT has never happened in my life and I am no spring chicken.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it! It&#x27;s easy to use and NO wrapping floss around my fingers.  :-)</li>
    <li> Not sam as described?!?!? The box says its the new sonicare but when I open the box i found the old version of it 😐</li>
    <li> The unit stopped working within a week of my receiving it. I only used water. I&#x27;ve called Philips and after their laughable trouble shooting, they said a replacement would be sent to me. Two weeks later nothing received.  Save your money this isn&#x27;t worth your time of money. Not at all durable  Called Philips after not being able to find my first complaint they discovered that this is on back order. tells you haw many broke doesn&#x27;t it. it may ship by July 19th (Currently June 23, and it was supposed to ship out two weeks ago).  I&#x27;m not holding my breath for any help from Philips</li>
    <li> This item quit working today, July 14th.  I ordered this in May.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this product for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Effective.  It seems to work about as good as floss.  I tested by flossing after eating a starchy meal and using this Airfloss Pro.  The floss came out almost completely clean.  The results after flossing were very similar.&lt;br /&gt;- Fast, with practice.  Once you get used to positioning the head, cleaning all your teeth and gums goes pretty quickly.  About as fast as flossing, and I am a fast flosser.&lt;br /&gt;- Ability to use mouthwash or water.  The package included a trial size of some mouthwash.  I now use mouthwash or peroxide between cleanings, to sanitize the unit before sharing with others in the household.&lt;br /&gt;- Versatility.  For those with braces, arthritis, or other disabilities, this tool makes effective flossing much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes practice.  At first it seems awkward.  Then again, the same is true of regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;- Tank size sometimes seems a bit small.  If I&#x27;m really going to town it occasionally runs dry before I finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Use the three-pulse mode.  For each of the three pulses, aim to have first pulse (#1) land between teeth, #2 in the middle of the tooth, and #3 on the other side of that tooth.  Continue moving in one direction like this, one tooth at a time, and you&#x27;ll get fast, effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- Practice.  At first, keeping your mouth closed, and the feeling of the air/water blasts, is a little strange.  It becomes second nature with a couple of days of practice.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t throw away that floss yet.  Mechanical floss is still better for some jobs, like removing a tightly-wedged chunk of something between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this tool is well designed and executed.  I continue to use it.  I&#x27;m a religious flosser because I&#x27;m prone to cavities, and I&#x27;m happy with the Airfloss Pro&#x27;s performance.</li>
