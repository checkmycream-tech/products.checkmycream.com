<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Paid for a duo....counting on that as a gift.  Only ONE arrived.</li>
    <li> Love my bags. I bought them to organize my purse better and they work wonderfully! I received the cosmetic bags in only a few days. I am very pleased with the product and delivery.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and I what I needed!</li>
    <li> great price, great item, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Just the right size for miscellaneous travel items, just wish the color/pattern was different.</li>
    <li> Bags were brand new and zippers work and everything! I always love these Clinique bags.</li>
    <li> Great for travel - larger one will fit all my makeup and brushes. Cute pattern too</li>
    <li> This a cute set and very much a good value given the price.  Very functional and sturdy.</li>
    <li> The colors look really pretty online. I&#x27;m returning these bags. The colors are really dark and ugly and the material is pretty poor.</li>
    <li> Super cute bag. It holds all my makeup and it left room for some more! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little bag is quite little, but would be good for hair ties, clips, bobby pins, lipstick or change.</li>
    <li> This is a great cosmetic bag set. The large one fits all of my make-up for traveling (moisturizer, foundation, powder, eyeliner, mascara, etc), and the small one fits perfectly in my purse for everyday items (small comb &amp; brush, lip gloss, nail file, etc). I&#x27;m very happy with this set!</li>
    <li> I love this make up  bag. Holds alot of cosmetic and very durable.</li>
    <li> I like the big bag but the small bag is too small</li>
    <li> This was a great buy very durable and the big bad is very big and just what I needed!</li>
    <li> The quality of these bags was good, but the large bag was too large and the small one was too small.  I gave them away.</li>
    <li> I love this, it holds so much things that i forget i put stuff in their. this is the best! would definitely purchase! i have had it for 6 months, durable and very strong! including the zipper.</li>
    <li> Received my bags today, 3 days behind delivery schedule. I did get a email a few days ago from Seller, saying they resent it out again.These things happen, so I was satisfied with the contact, and once it was shipped again, it got here fast! Bags are bright, small bag is very small. But I will find a good use for it, too peppy &amp; cute not to use :)</li>
    <li> These work great for traveling. Love the size. Love the color. Have had it for a while now and it seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this set of bags. The big one fits all of my makeup and the small one works well for my odds and ends. I use it for my meds.</li>
    <li> Not sure why people keep complaining about the size. Yes, the small bag is a change purse. I use it for change and barrettes.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the big bag is large - really about the size of a purse in its own right. However, the sizes were listed in the description. I knew what I was getting, and they work just fine. AND, they fit long items like brushed and liner pencils that have to go in angled in other bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look exactly like the picture and the quality seems ok. No sticking zippers and the metal pulls were plastic wrapped so they wouldn&#x27;t get damaged in shipping. Nothing wrong with these bags if they happen to be the size you want. Check the description first.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my teenage niece.  She loves the color purple and seemed to like the two cosmetic bags.</li>
    <li> Got 3 of these and they are very pretty.  My granddaughters, 5 and 8, are at the age they love things like this.  I gave them to them at Easter instead of candy and put chap sticks and the like in them.  They loved them.  I see they&#x27;re now in their backpacks for school holding pencils in the larger case and lunch money in the smaller case.  The extra one went into a honeymoon shower basket I packaged up as a gift and she loved it also.  The colors are vibrant and appeals to all ages.</li>
    <li> perfect for my pocketbook. only need to change these when changing pocketbooks.</li>
    <li> I love the size.  The colors are great too.</li>
    <li> Good quality product for the price.  Love the bright colors!</li>
    <li> This is practical and color true to picture.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for teen daughter. Seems worthy. Will update review after use (Christmas) if cheaply made or durable.</li>
    <li> Very vivid colours. A gift that I think will be appreciated</li>
    <li> very nice bags.  Great for make up or small things in your purse.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup case.  Not really big on makeup so I solely purchased it to place all of my prescription and non prescription bottles in.  Got tired of digging in my purse trying to find them.</li>
    <li> Item is just as described!</li>
    <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;  At first I thought the bigger bag was huge compare to what I had seen on the computer but its a sweet little cosmetic bag, holds everything in place perfectly</li>
    <li> Beautiful and comfy enough to p as ck the make up securely. No broken make up pallets anymore</li>
    <li> Wife loves this bag.. Perfect size and quality for her needs.</li>
    <li> Great size, fits all my makeup and brushes without being too large and bulky.</li>
    <li> A nice and affordable make up bag.  It holds everything I need and carries well.</li>
    <li> It is .... . I recommend you buy a makeup bag when Forever 21 is on sale.</li>
    <li> Lovely cosmetic bag, very feminine. Ordered it as a gift for a friend and she seems to like it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty, feminine, also practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a little bit fragile so don&#x27;t put too much in it. It&#x27;s only meant to be a cosmetic bag~!</li>
    <li> Great value! Bought these as gifts and am anxious to buy more!</li>
    <li> Super cute, great sizes - one for home and one for purse. Have stayed clean through many travels, zipper still works, haven&#x27;t torn etc., and I&amp;#34;m pretty hard on travel gear - home, car, office, gym, car, home, repeat. Had these for several months and they still look fresh and new.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews have said, the larger bag is extremely too big for normal day to day use. However, if you need something for at home, it&#x27;s perfect. I managed to put a Bare Minerals kit in a metal container in the larger one. The smaller case is extremely too small. My brushes could not fit in there and neither could most of my pens or eyeliners/eyeshadows. I would&#x27;ve thought they were a lot more proportionate. However, they are cute.</li>
    <li> Nice bags.  Small is very small.  Maybe use for a few lip sticks and lip balms for your purse.  Or give to a small girl.</li>
    <li> Nice colors.but big bag is made of hard materials an small bag is soft an closest easier then big bag.there are not made of the same material .this is big buu</li>
    <li> Pretty, colorful, very cool looking in person.  But, and you knew there would be a but...the &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; bag just misses in being too large for tossing make-up in for my purse.  And too small to store make-up in my carry on to travel by airplane.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; bag is pretty small.  I guess I could have used it in my purse for maybe one lipstick, and maybe a small mascara.  Instead, I gave it to my tween niece, and she LOVES it.  All and all I think I spent $4.95 on shipping, and like one cent on the product.  Maybe they could not sell the product because maybe it was some kind of store gift with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know.  But its cute enough for a five buck gift to a tween.</li>
    <li> I bought the bags to use the big on as a travel migraine kit for my purse. Fortunately I have a large purse because the large bag is large and hold a lot. The small bag seems impractical because it&#x27;s so small, but I&#x27;m going to use it as a change purse.&lt;br /&gt;The bags are as shown and are very cute, although the fabric is a bit rougher than I expected. For the price, you really can&#x27;t pass it up, especially since you get two bags, and the large one is quite big and will hold all my makeup for traveling if I used it for that purpose (and I travel with a lot of makeup).&lt;br /&gt;The bags are well made, as expected from Clinique, and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The large one holds a ton, and the small one holds a compact, lipstick, and coverup crayon. Little crowded in the small bag but holds what I intended it to. :)</li>
    <li> Purchased mainly for the smaller bag to keep small items together in my purse. Seems well made and the small bag is just the right size, works a number of items and doesn&#x27;t take up much room. The larger bag will make a nice travel cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> The cosmetic bags are  well-made  and the pattern is nice with bold colors. The  large bag is a good size for travelling or at home used. It is a little to big for a everyday makeup bag for your  handbag. The small  bag is  completely useless to me, I thought it was a joke when I first saw it. This bag could only hold a small lipstick and a small eye shadow. Regular size makeup is a no go, I guess you can put coins in it.</li>
    <li> Love it very handy and the smallest one is good to keep loose change</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for, the correct size and the material is ok, the colors are bright and cheerful. I cant really complain.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my cosmetics.  They bag fits perfectly into my purse and  it is large enough that i can even stick my full sized powders and compacts.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for gift givinh</li>
    <li> The big one is MUCH larger than I had anticipated, the small one is just too small for much of anything I have. They are very nice. I hope to order more for my daughters little toys (like Polly Pockets) so they can easily tote them in their backpacks on car trips and on airplane travel. Pattern is just too fun and cute!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice makeup bag and found this. even comes with an extra bag for smaller items. Great price and i&#x27;ll buy from this company again for future items. very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great bag fabulous price</li>
    <li> Cute size to hold all my makeup. I use the smaller one to hold my id and credit cards.</li>
    <li> Prettier in real! Love the material too!</li>
    <li> For the price these bags are great! The bigger bag is perfect size to carry all you makeup and brushes. Strong zipper. The smaller bag is nice to put a lipstick and mirror/compact into a clutch. Overall very happy</li>
    <li> I really like these two cosmetic bag duo.  I like the wider bottom so it will stand up and also give me more room inside.  I like the bright colors and also the nice lining in it.  Quality seems very good.  Company was quick to ship.  I got it in 2 days.  would buy from them again.  it was as described.</li>
    <li> I like it, wanted to replace one I had been using for over 15 years.  Bright, pretty, and a nice change.  Seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> Great large bag great quality the smaller one is good for change</li>
    <li> Love the print, color, sizes, and price. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother, she loves them</li>
    <li> Great piece for traveling with cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful pattern!</li>
    <li> Great price but didn&#x27;t use the large bag yet</li>
    <li> Love the 2 sizes.  Small one for purse with touch up cosmetics. And the larger one for the array of cosmetics in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I have a compact, blush, roll on perfume, and solid perfume in the small one, with room for lipstick and more.&lt;br /&gt;The larger one in the bathroom has all of that, BB, lipliner, eyebrow pencils, blush, lipsticks, eyeshadows, blushes, mascara&#x27;s, eyelash curler, all the different brushes and room for more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty, even if it is kinda loud.  Inside was a receipt dated Oct. 2013 from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Cute, but nothing special--the orange color in the print is a disappointment.  They are nice enough, but a bit too pricey for what they are.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this bag, sturdy, and really big. I use it for my morning routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great, bigger-than-usual cosmetic bag for almost all of my make up products. I love it. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> I loved these bags. They are super cute and for the money you can&#x27;t beat them to organize your purse.</li>
    <li> Love this bag. Colors are bright and fits all my make up that I use on a daily basis. Even fits my 5&amp;#34; diameter amplified mirror. Actual space in side is about 6 1/2&amp;#34; deep by about 9&amp;#34; wide. The base of the bag at the bottom is about 3&amp;#34; but you can stuff quite a bit in there if that makes any sense. It&#x27;s still somehow seems compact enough to fit into most of my purses. The little bag on the other hand is kind of small, but if you&#x27;re going on an overnight or 2 stay somewhere can hold your rings, minor jewelry etc. I was looking for the make up bag, so the little one was just a bonus for me.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and thin&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you you pay for</li>
    <li> The small one is the perfect size for my purse and the big one is the perfect size for my make up :)</li>
    <li> Bought a set for my mom and myself to coordinate with new purple purses for us both. Never hurts to have plenty of bags to keeps things in a purse or tote bag.</li>
    <li> Love it bought two one for my sister and myself</li>
