    <li> Small of stature, big on results.  I&#x27;m new to make-up, but when my daughter told me to get something that I thought I would have better control with, I found this foundation brush. It took a little while, but when it finally arrived, AWESOME.  After washing and drying, I applied the smoothest foundation that I have ever had.  Great job.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and quite useful. One of my favorite brushes I reach for daily!</li>
    <li> I have used other foundation applicators, sponges, brushes even my own fingers. This is my favorite! It gives a nice even application, it spreads a small amount for nice even coverage. It makes my foundation products last longer. I will definitely be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;Also very quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the brush! It&#x27;s small but amazing! Nice and thick so great for full coverage foundation, powder or liqued!  However shipping took about 3 weeks!</li>

    <li> Love this brush! Just ordered my second one! I ordered it for applying setting powder, but later discovered it apples foundation flawlessly. This brush is seriously the best deal for anyone on a tight budget. It&#x27;s easy to clean and the bristles have not fallen out yet, I cleaned it 5 times. The size does not brother me, it&#x27;s kinda medium. And fits perfectly in my hand.  The shipping does take some time, it&#x27;s coming from China, but it&#x27;s well worth the wait. Took about 20 days to arrive, and came 1 weeks earlier than I was told. Can&#x27;t wait for the second one to get here! (:</li>
