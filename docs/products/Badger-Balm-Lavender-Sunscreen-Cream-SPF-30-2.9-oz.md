      <li>Very nice people.</li>

      <li>They make a good product and I am happy to recommend it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and did a great job preventing me from getting a burn!</li>
      <li>Maybe it works great for a camping trip, or a sporting event if you don&#x27;t care about looking good.</li>
      <li>I bought this tube of Badger Sunscreen after reading many wonderful reviews on the product.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice too!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my 30-something fair skin with great results.</li>

      <li>It has a pleasant scent, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and protects against sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Company is top notch, I sent an email to them about a vendor listed on their website not carrying the sunscreen and received a very pleasant email</li>
      <li>it stays on better and is very good quality.</li>
      <li>#30.First of all,it doesn&#x27;t smell to good.</li>
      <li>Come to think of it, this product might be best for those with light skin.    </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
      <li>Loved the smell though.</li>
      <li>But we soldiered on to give it a fair shot.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>reason I gave it three stars instead of two is that I know it will still be good to use on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product not expecting it to be as good as it is.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good thing, b/c</li>
      <li>but i assured her that its highly-rated, organic and even made her read the good things about it.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>It is still a good product.</li>
      <li>This is a good buy for your baby and your wallet.</li>
      <li>The cream smelled good too.</li>
      <li>- that&#x27;s why I buy the good stuff.  </li>
      <li>I also care about looking good.  </li>
      <li>It feels like it is GOOD for your skin and is never drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ingredients are good, but it didn&#x27;t protect me from getting sunburn.  </li>
      <li>But I still think the Badger sunscreen is a good option, and I think Badger is a good company.</li>
      <li>And I gave the Badger sunscreen a good run for the money</li>
      <li>I was so upset since I had initially loved this product and the fact that it was chemical-free.</li>
      <li>My son has fair skin, chronic eczema and nut allergies (we carry an epi-pen).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never been that good at applying sunscreen when I should.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> too thick.  try livestrong</li>
    <li> I like the scent and the fact that it does not have chemicals but other than just using around the garden and house.  I cannot really use when I go out because it does go on a pasty white and does not blend well.  it is a very thick consistency, almost like cream cheese.  I think it would be fine for kids but not for adults.  It does not work well with any makeup at all, too thick.</li>
    <li> I like the product but I was mailed the unscented one instead of the one pictured for face &amp; body. I was bummed. It is still a good product.</li>
    <li> As a lupus (sle) patient, I have to be extremely careful in the sun. I have tried nearly EVERY sunscreen available and Badger is the ONLY one that works - I can be in the sun, in the water, and not get burned at all. My daughter&#x27;s are fair skinned and burn easily...I can apply this once all day and they only get a slight tan. Yes, it&#x27;s thick...yes, it can be gritty (but rubs in if you smoosh it together)...yes, you might be a little more whiter than usual...BUT - not having to be burned is WORTH it :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on our babymoon in Jamaica. I&#x27;ve always preferred natural products, especially now that I&#x27;m expecting. I used it faithfully, but I still ended up getting pretty bad sunburn on my back, chest, and arms. I think this would be fine for people whose skin is already on the dark side, or who live far from the equator. But in the Caribbean, for a fair skinned person like me, it&#x27;s not adequate. Also keep in mind it&#x27;s not waterproof, so you have to keep applying it. Frankly I would rather just use chemicals for 5 days than to get horribly burned like this. It&#x27;s very pricey for how effective (not) it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect because it&#x27;s hard to rub in but it works and it&#x27;s not the micronized zinc.  I&#x27;m recommending it to anyone who asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also hold up pretty well after an ocean beat down.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen stays on for hours and doesn&#x27;t drip into your eyes and burn them. It works and protects well. Doesn&#x27;t have strong odor. I find I have to reapply it after about 4 hours.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t expect it to have so much density. It&#x27;s white and chalky when you apply it. Heavy and thick! Oh well:(</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It takes a little while to rub the sunscreen in completely, but it works!  It&#x27;s amazing the difference between this and the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; sunscreen that soaks into our skin (EEK!).</li>
    <li> The sunscreen works great - very sunny, hot day on the beach and I didn&#x27;t get burned at all.  I have pretty light skin so I thought I may get burned because this sunscreen needs more rubbing to make sure it spreads evenly.  However, it turned out that I didn&#x27;t get burned at all.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other sunscreens and has almost no odor - smells faintly like wax.  Rated well on EWG&#x27;s website so overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to find this on amazon, as i usually have to drive quite a distance to get it. It is difficult to work in to the skin, but it works better than anything i have used. I wear sunscreen almost every day, and i recently used this on an 8 hour ride. I did not reapply it ( although i should have) and had no burns at all after 8 hours in full sun on pavement. I had even doused myself repeatedly with water. It takes some extra effort to work it into the skin but its well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other sunscreen stings my face after using it a few days. With this i have no issues at all, and it actually cleared up some minor skin irritations. I always include a tube of this with gifts to outdoorspeople.</li>
    <li> I bought the scented version for my daughter this year. It has worked very well. It does leave a white residue on her skin unless you rub in for longer than a toddler will tolerate, but she&#x27;s two and not bothered by that kind of thing. Also, many of her peers here in Portland, Oregon also use safer sunscreen so it&#x27;s not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue for us is that bees and wasps seem markedly more interested in her when she is wearing the sunscreen, to the extent that she has been stung. We love Badger, but will be switching to the unscented version.</li>
    <li> May provide good protection, but does not absorb, so you have a white sheen that just gets worse as you sweat. Also, has an unpleasant smell. Regret that I bought 2 tubes and very unlikely to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have long struggled to find the perfect sunscreen for my fair skin. After extensive and tiring research I thought I&#x27;d give Badger Sunscreen with SPF 30 a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did.    Smell: The smell is very mild. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a typical sunscreen, which is a good thing for me. I work with kids and if I smell like sunscreen it is very distracting to them.    Texture: This stuff is thick, almost like toothpaste. It is easy to squeeze out of the tube and goes on the skin smoothly.     Application: You must work this sunscreen onto your skin otherwise you will be left with a ghostly, bluish hue. I put this on my daughter who is quite a bit darker than me and I had to make sure to rub it in completely. Come to think of it, this product might be best for those with light skin.    Efficacy: This product works great! It is important to use a sunscreen that provides both UVA and UVB protection and Badger Sunscreen does just that. I walked my dog on a bright, sunny day for 2.5 hours and for the first time ever I did not burn. That&#x27;s enough evidence for me:)</li>
    <li> I have been trying different natural sunscreens for years and this is by far the best I have found. It has the best rating as far as carcinogenic, toxic chemical, it spreads on much better than California Baby (which contains parabens), it does not attract insects as some others I have tried do, and it works! I used it all day on myself to test it out and no burn at all. My baby has used it with no reaction or problem as well. I bought three more for myself and ordered some for my father whose eyes burn with every sunscreen but this one. Great product, I will be using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and doesn&#x27;t blend in to skin. I also got some sun burn.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this Badger Sunscreen.  It goes on very smoothly and has a light, pleasant scent.  It also works wonderfully, keeping me burn-free all afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use a ton.  When I put on a light, even coat and rub it in well, I have none of the problems that some reviewers have mentioned (white streaks, grittiness, residue on clothes).  I do get a little white stuff on my hair when I put sunscreen on my part, but that&#x27;s no worse than the oily residue other sunscreens leave.  (If you&#x27;ve never gotten sunburn in the part of your hair, count yourself lucky.  A little white on my hair is a small price to pay!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan to keep using Badger Sunscreen.  It works very well and doesn&#x27;t have the unpleasant chemicals (particularly oxybenzone and benzophenone) found in most products.  I want to try the unscented version, but I don&#x27;t mind the mild scent that this has.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I bought this based on all the positive reviews and mostly because of its great ratings here.  But... yuck.  Its thick, medicinal, not at all under-the-makeup friendly.  So what Im doing is mixing a bit of it with my Devita sunscreen moisturizer (also very safe and recommended by EW) and together they go on smoothly.  Now I don&#x27;t have to return this one, and the Devita is more expensive so I can make it stretch longer.  Nice solution.  But on its own... no thank you.</li>
    <li> Sweats off easily, highly water soluble and smells bad.  The *slightest* amount of perspiration will run it off your skin, even if you apply 1 tbsp to each arm, each leg, and your face.  I would NOT recommend this sunscreen for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hiking&lt;br /&gt;* Biking&lt;br /&gt;* Swimming&lt;br /&gt;* Surfing&lt;br /&gt;* Jogging&lt;br /&gt;* Rock climbing&lt;br /&gt;* Walking&lt;br /&gt;* Casual walking&lt;br /&gt;* Sitting next to the pool&lt;br /&gt;* ...or any other activity where you may sweat or be exposed to the sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product did not smell so offensive--you&#x27;ll smell like you just stepped out of a low-rent head shop in Eugene, OR--I might recommend it for sedentary activity with sun exposure, such as driving or sitting next to a window.  However, since it smells so bad, about the only activities I would recommend this sunscreen for are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Riding on the Green Tortoise&lt;br /&gt;* Hitching a ride to a Dead concert (assuming you&#x27;re standing in the shade)&lt;br /&gt;* Attending a revival showing of Easy Rider--indoors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call this the perfect sunscreen for lazy hippies except its priced above what I would think most hippies would be willing to spend on sunscreen.  I&#x27;m totally confounded by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened this product up again because I couldn&#x27;t locate my other sunscreens and it had SEPARATED.  I don&#x27;t believe the shelf life is any more than 6 months.</li>
    <li> Last year we suspected our youngest son was allergic to sunscreen.  His face would become bright red (looking sunburnt) after using the normal brand our family buys (Banana Boat Kids).  The redness went away after a dose of Zyrtec.  I tried other \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;hypo allergenic\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands, not knowing exactly what chemical it was that he was allergic to.  All ended with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a last resort I ordered Badger brand since it&#x27;s all natural.  No rash!  YAY it works on his skin!  Badger covers well.  We&#x27;ve spent the last week at the beach and in the pool ALL DAY LONG and absolutely no burns.  I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews on here and we have experienced none of what they have.  Badger spreads well.  Initially it&#x27;s light white, but you rub it in and there&#x27;s no color.  It has a light smell, but nothing bad.  It lasts at least as long as the chemical stuff on the skin.  I still use Banana Boat on my older son and us.  I saw no difference between the two... other than one has no chemicals and doesn&#x27;t give my 3 year old a rash!  We will likely be switching the whole family to Badger Brand!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find a reasonably priced more natural sunscreen, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other sunscreens. I wore it and burned for the first time in years. Maybe it would work if you constantly reapplied? Not something I have time for. I think I&#x27;ll take my chances with the store bought stuff.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are good, but it didn&#x27;t protect me from getting sunburn.  I used plenty, applied before going into sun and re-applied while in sun.  It wasn&#x27;t even that sunny and I am now bright red!  Also, left a slight white residue.</li>
    <li> This product works above expectation. My wife and I needed a sunscreen for my 16 month old son. He loves being outside. It needed to protect against sun exposure AND be hypoallergenic. My son has fair skin, chronic eczema and nut allergies (we carry an epi-pen). We were nervous about using any product. We were even more nervous when his new daycare advised all children would require 2 applications DAILY for outdoor play. I wouldn&#x27;t dare keep my son inside so finding the right product was very important. It&#x27;s August now. We&#x27;ve been using BADGER 30 SPF daily since May. NO PROBLEMS, NO BURNS, NO ALLERGIC REACTIONS. I would recommend this product to anyone. We also use BLUE LIZARD sunscreen which works equally well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews mentioned burn problems. We&#x27;ve never had a burn using this product. I use it on my face during day-long bike rides. It holds up against a lot of sweat. Other reviewers complained about a white film on skin. A white film is possible if you don&#x27;t put an effort into proper application. But, in my experience, most good sunscreens have a similar issue.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Amazon for a long backpacking trip. The sunscreen was very thick and super white. I guessed that&#x27;s due to the difference in ingredients. I didn&#x27;t burn so it worked. My friend used it on his face a few times and it started to make his skin really bad, it gave him wrinkles!!...it was incredible. I didn&#x27;t use it on.my face thankfully. When he stopped applying it on his face his skin went back to normal. The other thing was the plastic tube cracked on top by the seam and the whole time it got so messy using it and the white pastey stuff got on all my backpack gear. Loved the smell though.</li>
    <li> Good product, however, have to use more to ensure coverage.  Comparable to California Baby SPF30 Sensitive, but more runny. Also, has a very nice lavender smell.</li>
    <li> I really like that this sunscreen is natural and safe for babies--I use it on my 5 month old son. However, it&#x27;s pretty greasy and I find I have to wash my hands after applying because it leaves a slick film on my hands no matter how long I try to rub it into his skin. It does provide excellent sun protection and my son hasn&#x27;t burned at all since we&#x27;ve been using this. You definitely need to knead the tube before you apply as the directions state because the product does separate a bit. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on myself because of the greasiness, but for my infant son it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> My daughter is allergic to sunscreen (many ER visits after using &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunscreens) and until I came upon this formula I had to compound her sunscreen from scratch at my home which was not only lots of work but quite dangerous because some of the ingredients are harmful if inhaled. I found this sunscreen at a natural life market near my home and it is no longer available there. Thank goodness Amazon carries it still.</li>
    <li> One of the better all-natural physical sunscreens.  It is a bit pasty and oily and is not very cosmetically elegant -- it takes some time to spread and rub in, and it does leave an oily, whitish cast.  But it provides full-spectrum protection and doesn&#x27;t contain any of the chemical ingredients that can be potentially harmful.  (A dermatologist friend told me that she believes physical sunscreens are the best option for people prone to melasma or freckles, because they reflect UV rays rather than absorb them.  Apparently chemical sunscreens, which absorb UV rays, heat up and can contribute to melasma and other pigmentation issues.)  I was reasonably satisfied with this sunscreen, but I think there are better options available now.  For example, I have found the Trukids zinc oxide sunscreen to be much more easily applied (something that&#x27;s important when you have a squirmy or impatient child), and it has a more liquidy, less greasy texture.  Trukids is also somewhat more cost-effective.  But I still think the Badger sunscreen is a good option, and I think Badger is a good company.</li>
    <li> I did use this product and I also used it on my kids and the sunburn protection was excellent.  The product is a thick white cream and the packaging was small compared to other sunscreen products. Once you apply the product you do have a bright white look to your skin which I didn&#x27;t care for much.  I do feel like it was alot more waterproof than other sunscreens bc of the texture of the cream.  All in all, I would buy this product again because I bought it to protect me and my kids from being sunburned and it worked excellent without any re-application.</li>
    <li> Badger was really highly rated as a safe sunscreen, so I purchased 2 of them before a group of 8 of us went rafting.  It was great protection when we were dry but disappeared completely through the rapids, so I burned to a crisp.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen got a lot of press last year because it was supposedly one of the safest sunscreens on the market.  The safest meaning it has the fewest potentially harmful chemicals in it.  For quite a while it was impossible to buy it as the manufacturer was overwhelmed by the demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was finally able to give it a try on a recent trip to Florida.  My first complaint is that it has a medicinal smell.  I didn&#x27;t think I would notice it outside but several people asked if I was wearing an insect repellant.  My main complaint with this product is the consistency.  It does not spread very well.  Its like spreading toothpaste on your body.  When I got to the pool the first time using this sunscreen my friends asked if I had stopped breathing.  I was so pale they thought was something was wrong with me.  In the shade I did look blue.  Finally, not only is it hard to get on your body, its just as difficult to get out of your clothes.  And because this stuff doesn&#x27;t get absorbed, it gets all over your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving this two stars is that it is a long lasting sunscreen.  I was in the sun for hours and I didn&#x27;t burn or even tan much, despite going in and out of water.  It just wasn&#x27;t worth the funny smell and the odd way it made me look.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It is an effective sunscreen and I feel better that I am applying a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.  I only wish it was a little easier to rub in, but in the end I guess it&#x27;s worth rubbing a little longer.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work well, I plan to use on my son when he&#x27;s old enough to be in the sun, so really it&#x27;ll be 20 + years or so to see if it keeps him from getting skin cancer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I read the EWG sunscreen report and found this sunscreen as an alternative to the commercial ones I&#x27;ve been using.  You don&#x27;t need too much of it, so although it is expensive it goes a long way.  One of the impt things though is that it does need to be re-applied, particularly around water use.  If you want to save shipping chgs, I also found it later at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> This was a great sunscreen!  It did it&#x27;s job by keeping out the rays (no burnt children on my watch) and best of all did not make my face sweat!  I would definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It smells great and makes your skin soft. If you&#x27;re outside and sweat a lot, it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. And according to the Environmental Working Group, it&#x27;s one of the very top sunscreens in a test that measures both how well it screens against the sun and how safe it is. (The vast majority of sunscreens have toxins in them. Check it out. [...]) It can make you look pale, but if you let it warm up on your skin it becomes thinner. Then it spreads better so you don&#x27;t inadvertently put too much on and end up looking like Casper. That&#x27;s my tip.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and many products like this give me a very strong rash, but this one since i started using it, no problem. Thank God.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on like paste and leaves your skin white.  I didn&#x27;t feel it worked better than any other sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t love the way this sunscreen goes on, it is thick and a bit hard to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s still worth it&#x27;s weight in gold to me. A couple of years ago, my young son started getting contact dermatitis from ANY sunscreen we tried, even other barrier, rather than chemical, sunscreens.  We tried everything and this is the only one that does not cause the rash, including other \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot; formulas from Whole Foods and other natural products sources.  I don&#x27;t know what it is he is allergic to, but it isn&#x27;t in this sunscreen!  Plus, it IS effective at preventing burns.  Since it&#x27;s the only one that works for us, it&#x27;s, by definition, the best ;).</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, given the fact that it is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group in terms of being non-toxic and it is a brand whose other products I have liked.  However, I have gotten two bad burns using this stuff!  I am a religious user of sunscreen, and I know that it needs to be applied 30 minutes or so before sun exposure and needs to be reapplied periodically while you are out in the sun.  Even following these sunscreen guidelines, I don&#x27;t fail to burn to a CRISP wearing this stuff.  I don&#x27;t get it.  I will certainly not repurchase or recommend this to anyone, and I will likely toss the remainder of the tube that I own.  I am really disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smells good, rubs in well, but DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST SUNBURN, which is the main job of sunscreen! I put it all over my shoulders &amp; chest but used a different 30 on my face. My husband used it on his neck (where he burns most often) but used NO AD 15 SPF on his arms and face. My shoulders and chest are now burnt to a crisp and so was my husband&#x27;s neck. My face and his face/arms were totally fine - no burn at all. We reapplied as directed. I was buying organic to protect my skin against the unsafe chemicals but caused more damage by getting sunburned. Am trying to return this. Maybe it was expired but if you need sun protection - this is NOT the way to get it.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it smells nice on the skin, rubs on easy as it has a creamy texture and it protects against burn all day. Unfortunately, this product caused my toddlers face to break out around his nose and mouth. Otherwise, I would recommend this product as he played for most of the day in the sun and in the water with this stuff on and absolutely no burn.</li>
    <li> I get horrible contact dermatitis from any sort of chemical sunscreen except for sunscreens that contain only octinoxate. I used to use an SPF 15 Olay moisturizer that had only octinoxate and zinc oxide in it, but they changed the formula on me without me knowing, and, lo and behold, on the first application, I got what resembled a chemical burn and did not go away for 3 weeks. In my search of octinoxate or zinc oxide products, I stumbled across this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale and easily burning skin. Applying this sunscreen somewhat liberally (about a peanut-sized amount for each arm, for scale) every 2 hours or so keeps me from burning at all, and leaves me with either my original skin tone or only slightly darker, lightly tanned skin. Yes, it is difficult to apply, and yes, you are still going to have whitish residue wherever you apply it even after a full minute of vigorously rubbing it in -- but, if you just keep rubbing at it, eventually, it WILL blend decently enough. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for dark-skinned people, because the whitish residue would be too obvious, but for fair-skinned people, the skin tinting will be subtle enough. The smell of this sunscreen in the bottle is kind of weird, but you can&#x27;t really smell it at all after rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to get it, use it quickly or store it in a cold space -- the oils in it will settle out and some will solidify after a while. Squeezing the bottle while it&#x27;s closed, however, should do the trick if it just won&#x27;t come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One main drawback that I should mention is that this will not absorb completely into your skin and it thus leaves a creamy layer on top of your skin. For beach-goers like me, that means you need to avoid laying directly in sand as much as possible or else it will stick to you and it will NOT come off until you take a shower. I&#x27;d still rather look like a sand monster than get an itchy sunburn, though.</li>
    <li> We were shocked to find how hazardous most sunscreens are.  It made me feel like a bad parent to have been slathering my children with those supermarket brands.  I feel so relieved to find such a wonderful product that is healthier and more effective.  I find the mild lavender scent to be pleasant and the texture to be excellent.  I don&#x27;t take any extra time to rub it in.  My children are happy because it doesn&#x27;t cause them to itch after application like other brands.  Overall, we are very happy with Badger and will use it exclusively.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen, it is still thicker than the chemical laden versions but not as gooey/sticky/thick as some other natural kinds. It smells fine (not to strong or weird). I like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my retarded son who was going to a tennis camp in San Diego CA. With winter just ending, he hadn&#x27;t had much time outside and I knew he would need some kind of sunscreen. I don&#x27;t use products that contain chemicals so I searched for something natural. That is how I found Badger Sunscreen. It seemed to have decent reviews, so I purchased it. It was far from inexpensive, but I thought it would be worth the price to have him free of something chemical. He returned home after five days in San Diego, having played tennis in the sun for a number of hours each day, and he was sunburned on every part of his body that had been without clothing. I asked if he had used the Badger Sunscreen he took with him since he resembled a tomato. He said he had used it daily, and actually put it all over himself each morning before leaving the hotel room, then again before returning to the tennis courts after lunch. He said his coaches even helped him put it on the back of his neck. I am highly disappointed in this product, especially after what I paid for it. I will now have to search for another chemical free sunscreen for his trip to Greece where he will participate in the Special Olympics World Games. I know his sun exposure there will be almost constant, and the Badger Sunscreen is no long a possibility.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I gave this a try after browsing through the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s sunscreen report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it well before being out in the sun (though not full sun -- more like 1.5 hours in the car and then an exposed body part here and there as the sun worked its way around an awning). The most exposed areas during that time did not burn, and I have fair skin. So, from that point of view, it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any separation problems -- it came out of the tube like toothpaste (with a similar consistency -- maybe even a bit thicker than toothpaste!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s safe and it works and it&#x27;s not messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that it leaves a white haze on your skin that I wasn&#x27;t able to get rid of by rubbing the lotion in for quite some time. This might be OK on your arms, but on your face it not only looks weird (not as bad as a mime, but it would definitely make people think of a mime) and feels like you&#x27;re wearing a second rubbery skin (and an oily one, too). I had to wash my face three times at the end of the day and even then it didn&#x27;t all come off. I also had some residual redness which might be from blocked pores -- it is pretty impenetrable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ll keep using it but I&#x27;ll probably see if I can find a different sunscreen for my face.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It works. I haven&#x27;t burned while wearing this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has a pleasant smell (in part to the essential oils used \\&quot;Essential Oils of Lavender, Moroccan Blue Tansy, Ylang Ylang, Lime &amp; Sweet Orange.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;3. The white hazy look of the sunscreen is not bad compared to others (and is to be expected with any mineral-based sunscreen). It is not streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four instead of five stars because it is a little expensive for the amount you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen tip: I like to keep it in the refrigerator so it will last longer and not degrade as quickly (since there are so many oils in it).</li>
    <li> I am a big animal lover. For years I have hoped that someone would design a sunscreen product for our furry forest friends. So, naturally, when I discovered [[ASIN:B0012ZMBDQ Badger Sunscreen SPF 30]] my heart soared! I picked up a case of this stuff and headed straight out to the nearest forest determined to do my part in protecting our local badger population from the ravaging effects of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long until I ran across my first badger, she was sleeping contentedly on a rock while soaking up the warmth of the midday sun... 3 of her baby badger cubs napping nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Poor simple creatures,\\&quot; I thought to myself as I popped open a tube of the Badger Sunscreen SPF 30 and quietly crept towards them so as not to disturb their nap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Look at them laying there oblivious to the harmful UVA/UVB rays. If I can help just a few...\\&quot; I squirted a generous portion from the tube onto the nearest badger cub. The tube made that faux-farting noise that sunscreen tubes make when you squeeze them. Naturally, I burst out in a fit of uncontrollable laughter at the sound as I always do. This apparently startled the badger mother who clearly misinterpreted my benevolent intentions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next week I will be completing my final round of painful rabies shots. For those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with the treatment, it involves a 3 session series of 20-30 painful shots administered around the bite wound location. Out of modesty, I won&#x27;t mention my exact bite wound location, but suffice it to say that it is just north of my scrotum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the [[ASIN:B0012ZMBDQ Badger Sunscreen SPF 30]] 3 stars, because I still think it&#x27;s a noble idea... to take care of God&#x27;s creatures who have no laboratories, no access to investment capital, and an insufficient knowledge of chemistry that would allow them to manufacture their own sunscreen products. I think the product would be better if it came with some protective gear... heavy gloves, possibly an athletic cup. And if the engineers could find a way to eliminate that hilarious farting noise.s could find a way to eliminate that hilarious farting noise.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s great, all natural, and the scent is natural too. Company is top notch, I sent an email to them about a vendor listed on their website not carrying the sunscreen and received a very pleasant email and they even offered me a tube. Very nice people. All of the companies products are &#x27;green&#x27; and only go up to 2 on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database website. Highly recommended product too, make sure you kneed the tube like it says before you use it. After showering and scrubbing off my skin felt moisturized... good stuff!</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s another sunscreen, uv natural,  with similar ingredients and price point which goes on a little more transparent.  this one&#x27;s like kabuki makeup.</li>
    <li> Both my kids and I have sensitive skin and avoid many ingredients common to suncreams and other skin products.  We&#x27;re pale enough to need sunblock year round off and on, so having a good one matters.  Badger not only works well, we can all use it without any breakouts, rashes or other reactions, and the kids even ask for it when going out in the sun!  Among the more natural suncreams on the market, Badger is highly effective at a good price point, readily available and reliable across batches.</li>
    <li> We like badger sunscreen, it is less watery than loving naturals and has a clean smell. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t blend in very well, though.</li>
    <li> I always always apply sunscreen each morning and at lunch time during the summer months.  After hearing about Badger products, I thought I&#x27;d give the sunscreen a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent about twice as long applying sunscreen and still had a noticeable whitish tint to my skin. I used only 1/8th of the container per application - far less than the recommended amount of sunscreen (a single application should use about one ounce of sunscreen, or 1/3 of the container, as stated on the Badger website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked very well as a sunscreen.  I was working outside in the sun for the entire afternoon and did not get burned.  An added plus - the sunscreen did not irritate my eyes when sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not wear this to a party or out in the public, since the white tint is very noticeable.  But for working outside in the summer, it prevents sunburn very well.</li>
    <li> I really like the Badger SPF 30 sunscreen, I ordered a tube because I wanted to find a good natural, paraben-free sunscreen that will protect my super-sensitive pale skin. I have the sort of fair skin that burns in the time it takes to go outside and get the mail. And I gave the Badger sunscreen a good run for the money, I covered my face and arms with it and spent a long HOT sunny sweaty day walking around the Renaissance Faire, and by the end of the day I had a light browning on my arms but NO face sunburn, which for me is a WIN. Plus, I didn&#x27;t take the time to re-apply any during the day which I probably should have, but even still I didn&#x27;t get burned after all the sweating. This stuff goes on pretty thick and white, and you can rub it in so that the whiteness mostly goes away. The lavender scent is nice, and it soaks into your skin pretty well as you wear it... I even put mineral makeup over mine and I wasn&#x27;t a greasy mess. It&#x27;s definitely a little heavier than &#x27;regular&#x27; sunscreens that aren&#x27;t all natural, but the protection is superior. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind a little thicker coverage for the benefits it provides. And once it soaks in, when I sweat it doesn&#x27;t run in little white rivers down my face and sting my eyes, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with other sunscreens. All in all, if you need a hardcore broad-spectrum sunblock, I definitely recommend trying this stuff.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this sunscreen, as I&#x27;m eager to stop using invasive chemicals on my kids.  The smell is a bit strong.  One of my sons liked the thickness of the lotion, the other didn&#x27;t.  But I did notice that my kids got pink color - not burnt - after a few days wearing it, which doesn&#x27;t happen with Banana Boat.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Pros: pure and natural ingredients, one of the safest sunscreen on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: hard to rub onto the skin, greasy, leaves white steaks, not recommended for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Although it says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, it still has a tiny oily smell.  It does not bother me that much but my kids don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I avoid chemical based products, so finding Badger Sunscreen was a must for me.  I spend a lot of time in the water surfing and swimming, and this product totally holds up.  It also works great as a morning moisturizer, keeping the skin hydrated all day long.  It&#x27;s a little greasy when first applied, but soon soaks in and gives excellent protection. I usually reapply twice in one day.. if I&#x27;m in the Sun for extended hours.  Safe for kids, too.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on the safest sunscreens for babies (no hormones present in urine, natural products, etc.), and Badger came out near the top. Many of the safer sunscreens are niche brands that cost $30 for a tiny bottle, but badger is also pretty reasonably priced. This is a good buy for your baby and your wallet. Plus, it has cute pictures on the bottle!</li>
    <li> the product met  all my expectations and I am totally satisfied and Iwill purchase again. The cream smelled good too.</li>
    <li> I had melanoma at the young age of 18 so needless to say, I am a sunscreen fanatic.  I always purchase sunscreens from the EWG&#x27;s annual sunscreen guide.  Last year I spent a small fortune on a bottle of the highly rated UV Naturals, but it worked.  This year, I thought I&#x27;d give the Badger brand a go since it was a little less expensive.  Let me also state that I know how to apply sunscreen well and always apply half hour before going out.  My two daughters have never been burned before, but when using Badger, they both got their first sunburns.  I know this isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but I don&#x27;t want their precious, virgin skin to ever be burned - that&#x27;s why I buy the good stuff.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and will not be using this brand again.</li>
    <li> Like many, I found this product on through EWG.  I looked at many sunscreens and finally decided on Badger.  I was excited to get my products in the mail since it is pool and beach season and I wanted to give them an extra coat of protection, chemical free.  We have a pool and go to the beach frequently....and have since they were babies, every summer.  They have never, ever had sunburns in their lives!!  I used Badger SPF 30 on them today, applying a good, heavy coat.  I was shocked to see how badly both kids were burnt!!  I will not buy this again and I am very disappointed in this purchase.  It is costly and a tiny tube, which is OK if it WORKS!  Is is confusing, too, how inconsistent the reviews for this product are.  Some say they thought it definitely was waterproof while others reported that it worked fine if you stayed dry but it comes off in the water.</li>
    <li> I can tell that Badger sunscreen blocks a broad spectrum of rays as my skin does not turn red after being in the sun.  My spf 15 does need to be reapplied periodically.  It does have a medicinal smell and I agree that it needs to be rubbed in thoroughly.  It separates into an oil and a paste.</li>
    <li> got burned. we have a couple other natural sunscreens we like, but which are very expensive. we read all the good reviews, so we tried this several times, having several family members use it.  but regardless of the thickness with which we applied it, we just kept getting burned.</li>
    <li> This product is TERRIBLE and a WASTE OF MONEY. My girlfriend bought 2 tubes of the SPF 30 for our vacation to Florida. I lathered it on heavy before the beach and several times while there and I fried like never before. I seriously think I would have been better off not wearing any sunscreen as opposed to this crap. Don&#x27;t waste your money, or your skin. Save both and buy a reliable product from a reliable company.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t burn easily, in fact, I have been sunburned a total of 3 times in my life and I&#x27;ve never been that good at applying sunscreen when I should. That being said I have never been burned as badly as with this sunscreen, and I was diligent in applying it regularly. I applied the sunscreen every hour and immediately after getting out of the water. I didn&#x27;t want to get sunburned and miss out any opportunities on my vacation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I&#x27;m writing this review from the couch in my hotel room on a beautiful, sunny, Maui day because my legs are so badly burned, I cannot walk. I would never recommend this product to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t protect from anything and leaves you feeling sticky (after application) and miserable (after being in the sun).</li>
    <li> Did not burn when we spent a weekend at the ocean and I am a fair skin red head.</li>
    <li> After being excited to find a chemical free sunscreen, I purchased Badger SPF 30 for a trip to Cancun, Mexico. I reapplied the sunscreen, according to the directions, throughout the day, and wound up being burnt so badly that I couldn&#x27;t swim the rest of our trip - I couldn&#x27;t even go outside in the sun without feeling uncomfortable. I&#x27;m on day 4 of my sunburn and it is still very, very bad. I applied - one time - a scar cream with SPF 30 to a small scar on my stomach.. what do you know, that spot is completely white, and I only applied it once. I will be returning this sunscreen and sticking to chemicals - chemicals &gt; skin cancer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are interested, here is a photo on my burn: [...]</li>
    <li> Yes, its thick, but this stuff works! We like the light scent. Even after a long day of swimming and sweating, no burns in sight.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen because it was well rated by the Environmental Watch Group and posed fewer health risks than other sunscreens.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good sunscreen and does its job since our son doesn&#x27;t burn while wearing it.  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it has a not-so-pleasant medicinal smell and, like many sunscreens, leaves our baby feeling a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> I love that this is organic and it actually works. my family wore and it helped protect us when we were on vacation. If you are going to be in direct sunlight for hours I recommend re-applying. As long as you do so you should be fine.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried a few natural sunscreens now, and i don&#x27;t mind rubbing a bit more if it means no chemicals. i tried laroche posey, but this is cheaper, esp if you go through a lot. i think it works well as a sunscreen, but is quite thick. i did rub and rub and it absorbed, but it left me feeling stickier than i wanted &amp; i wondered if it was clogging my pores (not great for face). also, the tube made it really difficult to squeeze out at the end, so i felt i went through the tube fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also take note as to whether you&#x27;re getting the scented or unscented. i did not, and the scented one was a little smelly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but their bug stick is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen. I purchased it because it was rated well by the Environmental Working Group as one of the least harmful sunscreens for your skin.  It works well.  The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s thick and takes a bit more effort (than typical sunscreens) to rub in.  I like it but I definitely prefer thinkbaby sunscreen to this which goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for face-use. the smell is not overwhelming, and it seems to last quite a while.  Took it tubing over the summer and only re-applied once or twice over the course of a water-filled 8 hour day.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re sticklers about making sure our kids aren&#x27;t exposed to unnecessary chemicals. We used the EWG 2010 sunscreen guide to identify sunscreens with low toxins, then cross-referenced with Amazon to find something we could easily get online. This fit the bill, and of the sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried, is the least greasy and easiest to put on. We order it in bulk at the beginning of the summer now!</li>
    <li> I just spent the day at six flags on a very sunny day and I used the product and it worked effectively.  It goes on white, but you must rub it in to lessen the appearance.  It is made with all natural ingredients- no chemicals.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at my local Whole Foods Market in the Unscented variety for $16.00 for this size, which is more then what Amazon has it advertised for!  But honestly, I do love this item.  It does go on thick but I was prepared for that based on others reviews, so I just squeeze out a tiny dab and just rub it in more.  So, it does seem more cost effective. The unscented is not gritty at all.  Just thick and smooth.  It is also kid friendly, which is good, cause I am pregnant and am looking for double duty here.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and I am thrilled its nice and natural.  I use it in the morning and I keep it in my purse and reapply it on my hands and neck and arms whenever I go back out before lunch and before driving home.  It is a nice size tube and fits in my cosmetic purse..</li>
    <li> This is a really good product if you are concerned about the cancer causing chemicals in most commercial brands of sunscreen.  The reason for 4 stars is it gets on your bathing suit and then you are stuck with that stain for the remainder of the day.  Does protect well.</li>
    <li> I did not expect this. In first few months of use, it worked pretty well and was relatively easy to rub in but left skin on my face a little dry. But now it has left the skin on my face painfully dry, with skin peeling off on my cheeks! I will NOT be buying this again! I&#x27;ll just try to finish rest of bottle on my body.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunblocks, in that it does what it says it will do. It smells great, and if you rub it in enough, you won&#x27;t have much of a white residue (but it IS still there, especially if you have any amount of hair in the area of application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it has left white, greasyish stains on my swimwear, even after repeated washings. I&#x27;ll have to buy new swimsuits this summer because every single one from last summer (that I wore in conjunction with this sunblock) looks pretty disgusting.</li>
    <li> I recently figured out that stinging sensation when I applied &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sunscreen to my face was not due to alcohol but an allergy to the contents. Online research suggested trying this product as one of the best physical barriers to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;It works! It doesn&#x27;t sting. The smell is pleasant and I don&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions to apply and re-apply and you will have no issues while in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend washing your face well once you are no longer in the sun.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find an all natural, no animal testing sunscreen, so on those points, Badger fits the bill.  On the downside this sunscreen was way too greasy to wear under make up.</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen recently on a trip to Miami. What I like is that it&#x27;s all natural, so unlike with Banana Boat or other products it actually felt effective and healthy, leaving my skin smooth at the end of the day. However, the product is REALLY greasy and takes a lot of effort to rub in to get rid of the whiteness. It felt a bit like slathering petroleum jelly on my skin, it was all thick and gross. It did work well though, as my skin didn&#x27;t seem to have aged or burned under the hot Florida sun. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok to use if you go on vacation to a hot and humid place as you probably won&#x27;t feel the greasiness after a while in the heat anyways, but definitely not for normal day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also smells like lavender (not really in a good way though) and felt weirdly warm when I rubbed it in, like a wasabi body mask I once tried. It was rather strange.</li>
    <li> According to my readings online, this sunscreen truly is harmless (unlike so many others out there that are labeled natural and safe). The Badger brand leaves a white sheen which actually prevents all UV rays to even get to your skin, because the rays simply are reflected away from your skin. No harmfull chemicals whatsoever. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for several years.  I recently ordered two tubes from the retailer Reiss Innovations, LLC.  One tube has an expiration date of June 2012.  Considering it is almost April I&#x27;m not happy I was sent a tube that has been sitting around for a while!  The other date is February 2013.  Definitely buy this product, but I would check your expiration date and consider buying from another retailer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Badger for about 3 years and it&#x27;s the first thing I look for in sunscreens. It&#x27;s safe for use on children, especially toddlers. I find that on myself I do not need to reapply, but I do so on children just to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it has a white sheen when you first apply it. If it doesn&#x27;t, then you&#x27;re not doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheen will go away (mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been sunburned where I have applied Badger, and that goes for the children as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is expensive and you can pretty well expect to use the whole tube on an outing if you are using it on 3 adults (arms and legs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Burts Bees, it has a slight Play-Doh smell, which doesn&#x27;t offend anyone. With the scented, there is a faint ylang-ylang smell (quite pleasant), but this quickly dissipates after 30 minutes in sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, if you CAN&#x27;T FIND Badger there are ingredients in sunscreens you should AVOID:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Avoid any sunscreen that is sprayed on or is a powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Avoid any sunscreen with vitamin A (look for &#x27;retinyl palmitate&#x27; or &#x27;retinol&#x27;). Everyone by now knows vitamin A is a photocarcinogenic (it makes your skin vulnerable to UV, substantially increasing your risk of skin cancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Avoid any sunscreen with ooctylmethoxycinnamate, octrocrylene, oxybenzone, 4-MBC, or Padimate O. You&#x27;ll see OXYBENZONE in most sunscreens. Not a very nice chemical (absorbed through the skin).</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm in the high mountains where there was lots of snow.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I opened the box.  The product has a \\&quot;light lavender scent\\&quot;.  No where on this description OR ON THE PICTURE does it reveal that the product is scented.  Many folks are sensitive to fragrances (yes, even natural ones) and it would be professionally responsible to provide ALL information on the product available.  The product clearly says that is scented with lavender on the front of the tube but somehow ( i cannot figure out how or why) this seller has REMOVED THOSE WORDS FROM THE PRODUCT PICTURE SHOWN .  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012ZMBDQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  It definitely turns you white when you sweat.  I don&#x27;t mind it but apparently my fashion wife doesn&#x27;t like it.  I&#x27;m more concerned about getting burnt and having chemicals in my body then if I look white or not when I sweat.  In fact, if everyone would get rid of the chemical lotions and we all used zinc or titanium, there wouldn&#x27;t be an issue about looking white because everyone else will as well.  If I&#x27;m not sweating, the product can be rubbed in so you can hardly notice it. I have yet to get a sun burn while wearing this product and that includes swimming and sweating during bike rides and long runs.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after seeing its high rating in the Cosmetics Safety Database ([...]).  I wear 15+ SPF sunscreen every day, and wanted something less toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Badger sunblock has an ingredient label full of plant names, a nice fragrance which obviously comes from real flowers, and a thick consistency which some of us remember from the olden days of pre-PABA sunning.  You know how the lifeguards in those Sixties beach party movies always have white noses from the sunblock they&#x27;ve pasted on?  Badger sunblock has the same ingredient-- zinc oxide-- and the same masking quality.  This lotion can double handily as zombie makeup on even the most fair-skinned.  That&#x27;s pretty much my only gripe about the product, and it&#x27;s certainly a minor one, considering the alternatives, which include freckles, sunburn, and melanoma.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only sunscreens that people with autism should use.  It is free of chemicals and only contains zinc oxide.  Most natural sunscreen has titanium dioxide in it - which is not recommended for people with autism.  It also blocks the sun well -my son has not had a burn or even gotten very tan at the beach with this product.  I like the way it smells, too - just like natural botanicals - not chemicals.</li>
    <li> The whole knock on regular sunscreens is that they protect you from one cancer at the expense of exposing you to harmful chemicals that potentially cause other types of cancer. Well this might not expose you to harmful chemicals but it is not a good option for protection from the sun if you are going to be exposed to water. Although they label it as \\&quot;water-resistant\\&quot; it is not in the least. When I have used it out of water it is OK, however just dipping in the pool or beach and it seems to lose it protective effect. It is also whitening, even if you rub it in, and it smells horrible. A much better natural sunscreen is the Aubrey Natural line: not whitening, smells great, works well in and out of water, and natural (active ingredients are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide).</li>
    <li> We love this sunscreen and I was so happy to get it for a decent price and in a timely manner. I would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the great reviews.  After using the product several times, I&#x27;m not sure why people rate it so high.  I must have gotten a very old container because the cream is very thick...almost completely dry.  It was hard to put on because it&#x27;s so dry and it leaves sticky white film all over.  It is one of the worst sun screen i&#x27;ve ever tried.  The kids hate the lavender smell; it has a very chemical smell, not natural at all. This purchase was an expensive mistake.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen based on so many good reviews because I wanted a natural/non-toxic sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;The cream covers you like a white paste, gets into all pores and smallest wrinkles in your skin - and you need to use a lot of scrubbing in a shower to get it out. The directions tell you to apply a large amount of it - and then rub in. With all the rubbing, the cream gets into your pores even deeper, but you can still see the white paste covering your skin.&lt;br /&gt;In a process you will definitely touch your clothes and swimwear - that will leave white spots all over it too -  and simple rinsing or swimming will not clean it out. You will need real laundry to get rid of those white spots.&lt;br /&gt;The directions also tell you to re-apply the sunscreen every 40 minutes - good luck with that! It takes so much time to apply it in the first place (trying to spread it to lessen the white paste effect), that all your time on a beach would be spent on application and re-application of a sunscreen. Additionally, just imagine how willing you will be to add more \\&quot;paste\\&quot; to your skin when after you have spent good 20-30 minutes in the water there is still white residue on your body from previous application of this sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;I burnt using this sunscreen - maybe because I could not re-apply it every 40 minutes, even though I tried my best to use it, and usually spf30 was enough to prevent sunburns for me previously. Not with this terrible product though.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to search for something natural that actually works and is usable.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it is very slightly greasy while applying, but absorbs rather quickly.  I love the smell which is very mild and pleasant.  It&#x27;s the safest on the market and very inexpensive compared to others.</li>
    <li> Very good and smells great. Light and natural fragrance. The texture is a bit too thick. Otherwise it&#x27;s great. And it&#x27;s coral safe. That was important for me.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen had far too much oil in it. Very greasy, even when rubbed into the face. It also made me break out, which never happens to me with any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this product because it was all natural. However, I was very disappointed once I actually started using it. It is extremely thick and greasy. It does not absorb well into the skin. My boyfriend actually told me today that \\&quot;it&#x27;s a turnoff.\\&quot; That being said, I will not buy this product again!</li>
    <li> For those who wish to diminish or eliminate the number of toxic ingredients in their sun screens/sun blocks, the Badger SPF 30 is one of the brands recommended by the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s guide to sun screens/ sun blocks with low or no toxins.  Stick with water-resistant creams and SPF 30+ for beach/pool use and ingredients such as zinc, titanium dioxide, and avybenzone.  Try to avoid products that feature oxybenzone, added vitamin A, added insect repellent, powders, and sprays.  Remember to re-apply sun screen/sun block at least every two hours or so when you&#x27;re outdoors (even if it looks cloudy, as the UVA/UVB rays still come through) and especially after dipping in the ocean or swimming pool!</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen on my arms. After only 1/2 hour in the sun I was fried and my legs that I had forgotten to put sunscreen on were not as burnt.</li>
    <li> I have used Badger Sunscreen for two years now and have never had a problem.  I purchased from Amazon confident that I would be happy but I am not.  My son had burned every time I have used it this year.  I have \\&quot;massaged\\&quot; the tube in hopes that if it had seperated it would remix and the problem would be resolved.  It has not.  Sorry to say that I am not very happy.</li>
    <li> Check out the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website at [...].  They are a non-profit which independently tests the toxicity of sunscreens and personal care products, since there is no regulating government agency.  Companies can put basically whatever they want into personal care products like sunscreens and other lotions and cosmetics.  I have little ones, and have read reports that some sunscreens you put on could be more toxic to your body than the sun exposure!  However, Badger was rated high on the EWG&#x27;s list of non-toxic sunscreens because it uses micro-minerals when you rub them in provide a physical barrier, not harmful chemicals that penetrate to provide \\&quot;protection\\&quot;.  There is a bit more work to rub it in, but it&#x27;s better than other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried. I rate it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Typical zinc oxide product -- it&#x27;s quite thick and leaves a white film when first applied.  It does \\&quot;soak\\&quot; in after awhile, and it seems to be pretty water resistant, but my kids think it&#x27;s too white and sticky and won&#x27;t use it.  Has a nice, lavender scent (although my nine year old is not crazy about the smell).  Bought it b/c it scored high on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s sunscreen rating system, but I doubt I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Does well at protecting myself and children from the sun. I feel good about the natural products that are in it. Is a little thick and can leave behind a white residue but that helps me cover us well. I like the smell, seems organic.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, it covers well and you can see exactly where you put it. From the research I did this is one of the \\&quot;safest\\&quot; sunscreens you can use and that&#x27;s why I bought it for my 1 and 4 yr olds. It&#x27;s a little hard to apply to the 1 yr old because it&#x27;s thick and takes awhile to rub in. Also the bottle didn&#x27;t last very long. But overall I feel it&#x27;s the best choice if I am going to put sunscreen on my children.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best stuff on the market as we have researched/bought quite a bit having four boys.  This stuff is a bit thick but it sure does the job.</li>
    <li> I love that this is such a safe, gentle sunscreen for my sensitive face &amp; my kids.  However it is extremely greasy, which is very unpleasant in our humid summers.  Also, the lavender scent is so strong that my 4 year old refuses to wear this sunscreen (I think it smells nice though).  I prefer other mineral based sunscreens instead of this.</li>
    <li> I am ALL for all-natural products.  Especially for our 3-year old, we opt only for non-paraben, natural products.  This summer, I decided to go with Badger since it seems that the price of California Baby sunscreen lotion skyrocketed.  So, my first impression of Badger sunscreen is that the stuff is super-gunky thick.  Following the directions on the back of the tube, I kneaded the tube before squeezing out the product, which is the consistency of a thick cream.  I had to work it into my son&#x27;s skin really well to reduce the purplish white haze all over him.  I figured out that it helps to warm up the cream by rubbing it between my hands--kind of like melting it.  To me, the smell of lavender is a bit overwhelming, but I can live with it if this stuff effectively prevents sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, a couple hours at the pool was enough to burn my husband&#x27;s shoulders, which were slathered with Badger.  Any my son was a little pink, too, which is completely unacceptable.  This was surprising considering how thick the stuff is.  And, yes, I did reapply a few times.  Oh, well.  If it works to prevent sunburn for some people, that&#x27;s great, but I still didn&#x27;t care for the consistency or smell.  I couldn&#x27;t begin to imagine what it would be like to try to use this stuff at the beach.  Yuck.  I definitely will be going back to California Baby.</li>
    <li> Having grown up and lived 50 plus years in sunny California I need to wear sunscreen on a regular basis. This one with less toxic ingredients is my favorite so far. I love the smell and it slides on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen often. It is waterproof and you can go a long time without reapplication. It works well and it is not too greasy, but I try not to put it on my face as often as the rest of my body. The only drawback is the smell is somewhat strange. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, but it is a little strong- it&#x27;s woodsy smelling, like pine or eucalyptus. I have not had any skin problems while using this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work.  My wife searched all of the sites to find a natural product that seemed to be recommended.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know what happened, but this was NOT a good experience.  I am normally not very good at keeping up with putting lotion on regularly, but this time I was.  I applied it several times throughout the day (at the beach).  And the result was that I got burnt to crisp.  I took photos just to document it, since I could not believe how bad it was.  Then it was followed by sleepless nights, as the burn was so deep, it made my skin itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short... I would never, never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to rub in all the way.  You end up walking around looking white as a sheet of paper.  It smells amazing and does end up leaving your skin soft, but it was way too thick.</li>
    <li> I bought this tube of Badger Sunscreen after reading many wonderful reviews on the product.  I have yet to try this particular tube, however, because I am having difficulty getting past the strong zinc smell.  Even stronger than the face stick. If I ever buy this again, I will opt for a scented variety.</li>
    <li> Very thick, but smells good and works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in my ongoing efforts to find effective sunblock that isn&#x27;t filled with some litany of toxic ingredients. This product did ok on my toxicity scale, but failed in every other way. It is gritty and quite difficult to rub in, especially on several wiggly kids. On darker skin, it leaves an odd whitish appearance. The kicker though is it simply did not prevent sunburns. We applied before sun exposure and reapplied 2 hours later and still we had sunburns. I would not use this again; nor can I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I found the sunscreen to spread evenly. There are some lumps in it, but that also spread without problems. I only use a little on my face and that doesn&#x27;t make it look pale. However, it can be a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;So though overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied now, I may try something else in the summer for my face.</li>
    <li> It takes a little extra effort to rub it in, but it&#x27;s a great product that I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I do not burn easily, this was great for me. The ingredients are pure and natural and I know I am getting a good protective sunscreen without harmful chemicals. I will definately purchase again. Check out Skin Deep for the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s database of safety ratings for cosmetics at [...] This product does indeed go on very white, as others have attested to. But if you take a few extra minutes to rub it in, it disappears, and the small effort is worth it. It was rated in Skin Deep a 0 for safety (the safest rating on a scale of 1-10) and was rated high for UVA protection and Medium for UVB protection.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Doesn&#x27;t stink like crap. Smells great, and blends into your skin easy</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. A great all natural alternative to those hazardous chemical sunscreens. It is very thick. You only need about a bean sized amount for face or arms. Absorbs quickly and smells great.</li>
    <li> We used this at a water park, reapplied fairly often, and atill burned badly. Maybe it&#x27;s better for light sun protection.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I absolutely love this sun screen! It was recommended by a friend and we now use it every day. Just use small amount and rub well, it feels very comfortable on my face.</li>
    <li> The only good sunscreen on the market is badger.</li>
    <li> If your little one has sensitive skin like mine, then Badger is it. My daughter is allergic to most run of the mill sunscreens, so we stick to organic and non-chemical types. Badger was recommended by another mom, and so far has not disappointed. I love this Lavender scent too - I was worried it would be strong, but it&#x27;s very subtle and a nice change from that normal coconutty sunscreen smell.</li>
    <li> Few if any chemicals and keeps you from getting sunburned.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product on here I thought it would be the answer to all of my problems.  However, when I tried to apply it...that&#x27;s when my problems really started. Firstly, the Badger was extremely uncooperative and getting the cream spread on him was a real challenge. In fact it&#x27;s been almost a week now and although most of the scratches have been healing nicely, the majority of the bite wounds are still quite painful. Secondly and most disturbing was the issue with the smell of the cream...the Badger, unhappy at receiving the Solar protection provided by the application of this product, also was not thrilled by the smell. His immediate response was to release musk, which mixed with the Pachouli scent in the cream drove us out of the kitchen.  As we were exiting the back door, the Badger bolted past us and headed for the first flower bed he saw, where he proceeded to roll in the dirt/manure...which due to the application of the cream stuck to him like a magnet. I then found myself in the unenviable position of having to give him a bath, which is always an adventure. Needless to say, I will not be using this product anymore as I have found it quite unsuitable for my needs.</li>
    <li> After having done a fair amount of research, looking at a number of consumer websites, this sunscreen really seems to be the safest stuff on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any of the chemicals that are known to (in certain conditions) increase the chances of cancer, and the main ingrediant - zinc oxide - is present in mostly 200 nm sizes or larger.  That&#x27;s a good thing, b/c anything 30 nm or smaller can be absorbed by the skin, and could potentially be absorbed by deeper tissues as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have gone through great lengths to make sure that the product is engineered to be the absolutely safest sunscreen on the market, and it shows in the consumer reports after consumer reports that rate this sunscreen among the very safest.  It also offers good UVA and UVB protection, another plus.  (UVB rays cause sunburns and cancer, UVA rays give you wrinkles and aging...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other sunscreens by contrast only offer good protection for UVB rays, or use chemicals that over long period of time can be harmful.  There actually aren&#x27;t too many sunscreens that are safe and offer wide protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this being said, I have a few gripes with the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It definitely smells a little funny.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far to say that it smells like medicine, but it does smell like some strange herbal tea.  It is not a bad smell, but its not a great smell either.  The scent is not very strong as other users suggest and not really that noticeable, but it is still somewhat annoying.  They should either make it unscented, or make it a more &#x27;normal&#x27; smell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Contrary to what other users say, the sunscreen does not make your face white.  They&#x27;re probably just using too much of it.  With this sunscreen a little goes a long way.  You have to take a very small amount, and just rub it in carefully.  It takes an extra minute or two to apply properly.  The caveat though is that this is definitely NOT a good sunscreen to take to the beach.  It would take a very long time to properly rub this in all over your body, so that it doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks.  I&#x27;d recommend this for a daily use sunscreen for primarily the face and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  In my own case, after several days of use my skin tends to become excessively dry.  I have to take a couple days off.  Not the best for people who tend to have dry skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this being said, I&#x27;d still recommend this product, because it is absolutely the safest stuff on the market.  Ultimately even using a sunscreen like this every other day is probably better than no sunscreen at all.  It&#x27;ll protect against cancer and lessen signs of aging, so I&#x27;m willing to put up with some of the minor hassles associated with the sunscreen.erly rub this in all over your body, so that it doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks.  I&#x27;d recommend this for a daily use sunscreen for primarily the face and arms.     3)  In my own case, after several days of use my skin tends to become excessively dry.  I have to take a couple days off.  Not the best for people who tend to have dry skin either.     All this being said, I&#x27;d still recommend this product, because it is absolutely the safest stuff on the market.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking care of my skin for years and using sunscreen regularly.  I also care about looking good.  This sunscreen in INCAPABLE of both protecting your skin and allowing you to look good at the same time.  In order for the stuff to work properly, you have to smear large amounts of it all over yourself.  Not only will you smell funny, but you&#x27;ll look like a white ghost with visible chunks of white chemicals on your face blocking the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have used other products, including Kiss My Face.  They do a better job of sinking into the skin and becoming unnoticeable and ALSO protecting your skin.  So you can actually go out and look like a normal human being while your getting sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, it will not work if you only use it sparingly, like some of the other products.  You pretty much have to shellack yourself with big gobs of it, enough for you to look like a character from a horror movie, before you get protection from the sun.  It can&#x27;t realistically be used on a daily basis.  Maybe it works great for a camping trip, or a sporting event if you don&#x27;t care about looking good.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. Though it is a lot thicker than the other Sunscreens I have (from Alba botanicals). Also when you rub it into your skin it leaves a white/purple tint which is not too bad if you don&#x27;t mind that. It smells lovely.</li>
    <li> I use this on my baby. It applies well, but my hands always feel greasy afterward. I like the top quality, safe ingredient list, and it works great under the hot Australian sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for a while, and I have no complaints to report. This was rated on the skin deep cosmetic reviews as one of the few without any toxic ingredients.  If you order two, the shipping is free too.  You will not regret purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I received a product that is very close to the product pictured, however, it has 18.75% zinc, not 20.5% as in the description. The product sent was also \\&quot;lightly scented lavender\\&quot; which is not the product sent.</li>
    <li> This is really hard to apply: you need to rub it REALLY hard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, its not suitable for people with dark skin - even after rubbing it in - it is still VERY obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not suitable for people with stubble - seems to get caught in the stubble which makes it even more obvious</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic sunscreen to wear every day under makeup for protection. I am caucasian with slight olive/tan skin. I did my usual makeup routine and then my boyfriend asked me why my face had a white-ish sheen to it. Its hard if you have dark eyebrows. I had to put more bronzer on to cover up the white tint. Then came out looking super tan....not quite Snookie but more than my usual \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x3D;Its not so creamy and easy to glide on. Its thick, so its hard to get out of the tube and you have to rub it in your hands to break down the grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x3D;I didnt break out (I have oily skin). I think this is a great product  for the beach or on vacation when you dont need to look put together...but overall, I am still searching for an everyday easy to apply sunscreen under makeup. If you find one....let me know!</li>
    <li> There are a few key reasons anyone shops for sunscreen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You burn easily and must wear it daily.&lt;br /&gt;2. You need it only when you are in the sun for long time ie pool, vacation etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. You have sensitive skin or you want a sunscreen with ingredients that benefit your skin and/or are not chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was not allergic (or did not consider all the harmful chemicals in sunscreen)and could use a bargain brand sunscreen I would, but I can&#x27;t and this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this sunscreen 5 stars because it is the only sunscreen I have found that does not make my skin hurt. I have not tried tons of sunscreens because they are too expensive for me to experiment with. I most recently used Blue Lizard, but I think badger gives me more reliable protection that lasts and I still had a little sensitivity to BL. I have only recently developed an allergic reaction to sunscreen. I also developed an allergic reaction to my bare minerals (I think it may be the bismuth, but I haven&#x27;t tried the bare minerals without the bismuth yet). I am extremely sensitive to sunburn and will turn pink in 15 minutes of exposure, or I will develop dark spots. I also live on the water and am outside (or would like to be outside) on an off all day. Badger sunscreen goes on easily. It as an oil and sheer butter base and is very creamy, but not in a bad way. (I have had no negative affects from the oil/shea butter on my complexion) I am left a bit shiny and white. I like that it goes on white though because I can be sure that I get good coverage. I can blend it in where it is not too noticeable, but it does seem to make me look lighter (as if I put on a lighter shade of powder/makeup). It smells like lavender, pleasant but not too strong. I have not tried applying makeup over it yet I think I would have to let it soak in a bit first)...Best of all I am relieved  that it actually works. I put it on immediately after I wash my face in the morning and I have been protected all day long. I can go out for as long as I want any time all day and I won&#x27;t get burned or get brown spots (which normally appear almost immediately). If I sweat my sweat beads up and I stay protected. I have not been in the water with it but i wash my hands a lot (careful to not scrub the backs to much) and it lasts well on my hands too.&lt;br /&gt;Does it protect for a long time? YES&lt;br /&gt;Is it good for sensitive skin? YES it worked for me&lt;br /&gt;Is it comfortable on the skin (and I am picky)? YES&lt;br /&gt;Does it make you a little white? YES but for me it is not such a big deal&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell strong or bad? NO&lt;br /&gt;Is it expensive? Maybe. it is more expensive than any run of the mill Coppertone or Banana Boat, (but if you are looking for a chemical free sunscreen, your options are limited) I bought mine at my local public (so happy) for $13.99 for 2.9oz, I am sure I have paid more than that per ounce for wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;Will it last a while? Yes I think so. A little seems to go a long way, and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to reapply throughout the day.cted all day long.

    <li> I&#x27;m surprised this product doesn&#x27;t get better reviews. I was looking for a sunscreen that was natural and that worked. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a cosmetic product. This stuff really works. I put it on my face and a perfect circle on my arm to test it. At the end of the day, my arm was tanned minus the perfect circle and my face fully protected. I have rosacea so I&#x27;ve been looking and looking. All sunscreens bother my face because of the chemicals. With this product I didn&#x27;t have any reaction at all. It is a miracle! Does it take a little bit of time to rub in, yeah, like 30 extra seconds. Is it slightly whitish? Yeah but so is Neutrogena, Coppertone, La Roche Posay and all the others. You need a product with nothing bad in it, this is it, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I picked a tube of this up for $10.99 at our local market after reading on cosmeticdatabase that it&#x27;s one of the safest and most natural sunscreens on the market. It rated a 0, which is the safest rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the tube thick and a little gritty, as others have mentioned, but I had no problem getting it to properly absorb into my skin. It takes an additional five or ten seconds to rub it in thoroughly, which smooths out of the consistency and dramatically reduces the \\&quot;white face\\&quot; effect. I&#x27;m not sure what the big deal is with taking a few extra seconds to rub it in; other reviewers sound like they&#x27;re in a mighty hurry to rush out into the sun :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;ve only been using it for awhile. So far I like it a lot. The scent is mild (way more mild than most sunblocks I&#x27;ve used) and isn&#x27;t medicinal at all on me, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a white/pale face, and so far it seems to provide excellent coverage. It does contain trace amounts of dimethicone, which is explained on the Badger web site; this single additive is widely used and is considered safe. Overall, this is probably one of the very best and safest sunblocks on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, especially for those looking to reduce the number of industrial chemicals they&#x27;re applying to their skin.</li>
    <li> Badger Sunblock is one product I for one will never purchase again. It stays on the skins surface and makes one resemble a ghost. I was exremely disappointed after reading its review.</li>
    <li> I burn easy,and I&#x27;m trying to go organic.So I tried the Badger sunscreen #30.First of all,it doesn&#x27;t smell to good.I really couldn&#x27;t get it rubbed-in good,it was so thick.So I looked a little white all day.The first day in the sun,I burned to a crisp.So no sun for a few days after that.Now my boyfriend put it on the top of his feet,and he didn&#x27;t burn,but also white all day.So I&#x27;m confused.But the smell was too much.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and kids seem to like it. I bought it because of the natural ingredients and price. So far, very happy!</li>
    <li> The sunscreen we usually use fell out of my bag, so I ran to the store and picked this up.  I used it on myself and my 4 year old.  I liked the safety factor as far as a lack of chemicals was concerned, but was not happy that we both ended up burned.  We have used both UV Naturals and Episencials and we never got burned with either one.  I&#x27;ve been burned before and while I&#x27;d rather not be burned, it doesn&#x27;t upset me as much as my 4 year old being burned since that has never happened before and I was hoping wouldn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve ordered some new sunscreen and don&#x27;t plan on using this again.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves the sunscreen.  It works and it smells wonderful!  I would recommend the lavender one.  We tried the Badger unscented sunscreen and it just wasn&#x27;t as nice as the lavender sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I bought this at REI for $15 a tube, having read the EWG.org website on the safety of sunscreens.  Honestly, whoever thought that these companies would disrupt our endocrine systems and worse while the governing bodies tell us nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. Bought it for a Lake Powell trip, and was wonderfully surprised at how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS thick, and has a fragrance. Next time I will buy it without, as reading the afore-mentioned website I found that fragrance is often bad for us. However, this smell was mild and went away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smoothed it on, and did a good job of it as I was worried about being fried in water all day with the sun blazing down in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not reapply as instructed, as I found that though I put it on and it slowly disappeared, when it got wet it was quite clear where it was, as it showed white again.  Frankly it was a relief to know where the darn stuff was, and where it wasn&#x27;t.  I only had to reapply once a day for the most part, unusual for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I do have olive skin, but it burns with the best of them for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this for outdoor sports, but probably not for everyday face use, it is very thick and oily for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this last summer to use on my toddler son, and it was a real mess.  Not only was the sunscreen hard to rub on his skin, it stuck to all of his clothes and would not come out in the wash.  I do appreciate that it has less dangerous chemicals than other sunscreens, but I&#x27;ve tried some of the others and they absorb much more easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product online last year because NOTHING was working for my fair skinned 7 year old.  no matter what the SPF on the bottle said, she would burn and her nose would blister.  I read an article on ewg.org about SPF&#x27;s not being advertised properly because of the chemicals in the sun screen actually counter acting it!  insane, all this money blown for nothing.  so I tried, one last time, and badger worked!  I had no issues with it absorbing into her skin, but I had also been forwarned that a little goes a long way.  she was able to enjoy her summer with no painful sunburn on her face!  and no new freckles ;)  I misplaced my sunscreen from last summer and am now getting ready to buy another one for the so cal sun.</li>
    <li> So, you really ought to take great care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled there is a safe and effective product available for me and my family. The \\&quot;spreadablity,\\&quot; scent and appearance really should not make much of a difference. The active ingredient, Zinc Oxide, is the cause of the \\&quot;inconveniences,\\&quot; but it is also the cause of it&#x27;s efficacy and low toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;We reviewed the scientific literature and government assessments for common sunscreen chemicals&#x27; efficacy and toxicity. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are known as \\&quot;mineral sunscreens\\&quot; or \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot; since they reflect and scatter UV rays. The other actives are called \\&quot;chemical blockers\\&quot; because they absorb and disperse UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies show that unlike other common sunscreen chemicals, little to no zinc and titanium absorb through the skin, and they provide stable UVA protection relative to the other ingredients. For these reasons many zinc and titanium-based sunscreens appear at the top of our recommended product lists. However, zinc and titanium in spray or powder sunscreens are not recommended, since inhalation of zinc and titanium particles is a concern.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Badger&#x27;s products and philosophy, and I use this product regularly. Thanks for supplying our families with safe alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay safe and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;You could always stay out of the sun; it&#x27;s certainly the safest plan.</li>
    <li> All natural and works great! Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so hard to spread.  It&#x27;s thicker than toothpaste.  I haven&#x27;t be able to spread it until it is clear on my face, so when I wear it, my face is a shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells fine.  I don&#x27;t think it makes my skin break out.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here and planning to buy the product, I actually found it on sale at my local Whole Foods.... Used it about 3 weeks ago on a trip to the Yucatan. First, I just loved the smell, which is subtle and earthy, very pleasant! I would just apply a bit at a time, massaging it very nicely into the skin... other posters here are right: it does \\&quot;melt\\&quot; very nicely into the skin if you use a LITTLE at a time for different parts - arms, legs, etc... If you plop too big a dab, it will take much longer to spread around, and, yes, it will look white or ashey. If you get that effect, you&#x27;re just using too much of it! Despite being outside most of the time swimming, snorkeling, biking, etc... under the vigorous Yucatan sunshine, I didn&#x27;t get sunburned at all this time - except where I didn&#x27;t apply it, like up on my thigh where the shorts ran up while I was pedaling! When I&#x27;d come out of the water or rain, even hours after applying it, it was amazing to see how the water would actually \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; on the skin... like on the paint of a bran new car! It didn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy, and a MAJOR plus for me was that it didn&#x27;t give me a flare of adult acne, unlike most sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried on my face over the years. I would fluff on a dusting of loose powder after applying it in the morning, and that seemed to take care of any shine of \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; other have described....what else can I say? I won&#x27;t use anything else, and just sniffing it once in a while brings me right back to Mexico! :-)</li>
    <li> First of all, I am in no way, shape or form, associated with Badger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an environmental engineer working on a comprehensive coral reef study here in Hawaii, where I live. Our research has found that coral reefs are dying largely due to the amount of sunscreen chemicals that get in the water, from the skin of bathers at the beach. If you are planning to come to Hawaii, you should come in the next few years, since we&#x27;ve seen 50% of reefs die over the last 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was looking into sunscreens that I could personally wear that would be the least harmful, I found that the Badger website actually has one of the most significant research studies of the effects of sunscreen on coral reefs posted on their website. They list the chemicals cited in the study as most harmful to reefs, showing how none of the ingredients in Badger are on the list as contributors to coral reef deaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of it may feel different from other chemical laden sunscreens, as I&#x27;ve noticed several people&#x27;s reviews saying. But to me, consistency isn&#x27;t really that important when I think about the bigger issue. And the fact that Badger actually pays attention to the coral reef issue on their website, when others brands don&#x27;t, to me says a lot about this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I buy this product and spend the extra money. Hopefully if someone reads this and heads to Hawaii, they may feel the same way. Cheers.</li>
    <li> Badger SPF 30 is hands down one of the best sunblocks on the market. Those people who are panning it are doing so because they did not read the instructions; they used it like the stuff they buy at the drugstore - all the big brand-name products that cost a lot, say \\&quot;apply thickly and let soak in\\&quot;, and don&#x27;t do nearly the job of protecting your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.  If you do, you will find this is the most effective sunblock you have ever used.  It has NO odor, massages in quickly, leaving NO whiteness on the skin.  The tiny amount necessary assures that this will be the least expensive sunblock you ever buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a redhead with very fair skin and I am particular about reading labels and understanding how sunblocks work - this is the only sunblock I use any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, I neither work for, nor get money from, the Badger Company.  They make a good product and I am happy to recommend it.</li>
    <li> First time used this product. Extremely hard to run it in. I put on lots of them but still got burned badly even I spent most time under umbrella . I never had sunburn before. This product is totally useless. Very disappointed!! Stay away from it</li>
    <li> Started buying this two years ago after reading about all of the cancer causing chemicals in Coppertone and the other standard suncreens. I&#x27;ll admit I was hesitant. It was SO expensive for such a small tube but I was very surprised at how wonderful it is. I have two (soon to be three) small children and with this sunscreen, I only have to apply it once and they have never been burned (unless I miss a spot lol) Yes, it&#x27;s thick. That takes some getting used to but after years of reapplying the drippy garbage that I used my whole life, no wonder it actually stays on and does it&#x27;s job. One tube typically lasts me almost all the way through spring and summer so honestly, the investment it practically nothing at all. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen does not work!  I am religious about applying sunscreen and reapplied multiple times while I was at the beach for four hours and got burnt to a crisp.  I would highly advise anyone looking to buy sunscreen to look elsewhere.  It may smell nice but it does not protect against the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been gradually trying to minimize chemicals as much as possible so I had mostly stopped wearing sunscreen, but this stuff works really well when I want to spend more time in the sun than I can handle without sunscreen.  Love that there are no chemicals and it aborbs into the skin easily.  PLus the Zinc is great to heal sun damage if it happens anyway.</li>
    <li> I got this product after researching sunscreens that DO NOT TEST ON ANIMALS and contain Organic ingredients and I love it and will continue to purchase other Badger products. This product is on the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) &amp;#34;Does Not Test on Animals” List. It&#x27;s also certified as cruelty-free by The Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC).&lt;br /&gt;Badger has also has signed the Compact for Safe Cosmetics, pledging to meet or exceed the formulation standards and deadlines set by the European Union cosmetics directive to be free of chemicals that are known or strongly suspected of causing cancer, mutation or birth defects which I love.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $. Every time i used it and stayed in the sun I got burned. The 1st time around I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t put enough layers or didn&#x27;t reapply often enough. The 2nd time around I was putting it on every 30 min and still got burned. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 12 and has always had sensitive skin. Its easy for her to get a sunburn. Her skin is so sensitive that for years, I just couldn&#x27;t find the right sunscreen for her. I&#x27;ve had several bottles and tubes of sunscreen that were only used once, since almost all of the sunscreen i&#x27;ve bought made her skin itchy. There were times she&#x27;d develop rash within minutes of applying sunscreen. She&#x27;d rather not swim if she had to use sunscreen. I&#x27;ve even tried those sunscreen recommended by her allergist and pediatrician, but none of them worked!...Until this summer when i tried Badger Sunscreen after searching on the web for an effective sunscreen for sensitive skin. She was reluctant to use it but i assured her that its highly-rated, organic and even made her read the good things about it. She tried it when we went camping, and voila, she didn&#x27;t itch, she didn&#x27;t develop rash, and therefore, she loved it! YES, it leaves you whitish, a little difficult to rub on, but hey, she didn&#x27;t itch and she didn&#x27;t develop rash. THAT TO ME means it worked for her! Its well worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last summer after getting rid of my old/expired nasty chemical sunscreen!  It works great!  I did not notice any nasty smell and did not have an issue with it staining on my clothes.  A little definately does go a long way!</li>
    <li> Of all the mineral sunscreens we have tried, this one was the worst. First of all, I love the smell of lavender essential oil, but this stuff is just too strong! My child&#x27;s sensitive nose hated it even more than I did. I had to bribe her to even give it a try. Next, it comes out of the tube alternately as an oily, yellow liquid and then as a thick, gloppy, white paste that--try as you might--refuses to go on evenly. Between the smell and the streaky, white mess, I just about called it quits before we even got out in the sun! But we soldiered on to give it a fair shot. One dip in the pool and I was done with it: We were covered in white beads where it was just lifting off our skin. Not willing to risk a sunburn and already feeling a bit ill from lavender overload, we scrubbed it off the best we could (conversely, when you are TRYING to get it off, it doesn&#x27;t want to budge!) and grabbed some Waterbabies Coppertone (which I hate and is not a healthy alternative, but it was available and we disliked the Badger THAT much). It was an utter failure and complete waste of money for us. We later found Burnout Kids which was absolutely wonderful stuff, but now they have changed their formula, so we are back to square one trying to decide what to try next...</li>
    <li> I bought his for my kids age 2 and 4.  With all the chemicals and junk in products, I am rather particular about what sunscreens I am putting on them.  What&#x27;s the point of saving them from the sun if I am going to put other chemicals on their skin.  Badger is a trusted and great brand  A little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t be scared off by the price.  I even bought one for my dad who had some cancerous moles removed.  I will continue to buy badger products and this sunscreen year after year.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product since it&#x27;s organic and had great reviews, but didn&#x27;t like it in the end. There is a lavender scented oil which is yellow and doesn&#x27;t seem to mix well with the white sunscreen. The result is that the yellow oil leaks out when you try to squeeze the sunscreen out, and you&#x27;re basically putting all that oil on your face. It felt very heavy and I got pimples from applying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for at least three years. I love its effectiveness and it is easy enough to apply. My husband, however, hates how it applies and likes a more lotion-like sunscreen, so I let him buy what he likes. This is a very thick cream. The one thing I REALLY don&#x27;t like about it is that it smudges my car seats - and the smudges NEVER come out no matter what you use on them. I have black leather seats, and every seat and inner door in my car has white cloudy smudges on it. Now I don&#x27;t let anyone put on sunscreen before getting in the car, which is inconvenient. Also on the cloudy thing ... the sunscreen does eventually rub into your skin, but if you don&#x27;t diligently rub it in, you get the white zinc oxide glow. It doesn&#x27;t bother me if it&#x27;s protecting me, but it&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
    <li> I did a LOT of research on safe sunscreens and settled on this one after reading The Food Babes sunscreen report. (Google it!!!) I love the smell (lavender) and while it is greasier than the popular brands, with a few minutes extra rubbing it the white goes away, and at least I know my sunscreen isn&#x27;t causing worse forms of cancer than sunburns do....which is worth any amount of grease in my opinion. Price is obviously higher for these non-nano organic brands, but within that category this was one of the most reasonable for cost. I think the tube will last me about 24 applications on my 5 year old...maybe a bit more. One tip I have for applying, because of the greasiness, is to lay out a towel on the ground and get them to relax and lie down while I apply, that keeps them from getting frustrated with how much rubbing I need to do :)</li>
    <li> this sunscreen is like putting paste on, very heavy, I don&#x27;t use it.  Try livestrong&#x27;s or Alba&#x27;s 30 spf... jason also makes a lighter product.</li>
    <li> Had a question and a small issue with a previous order from Badger, and really questioned how much they cared about their customer base and product---I am happy to say that with many companies today that actually turn a blind eye, the answer is actually very much. After listening very intently, even after telling them I was considering switching to another brand (which I still haven&#x27;t found anything better after looking a the EWG list) they helped inform me that IT&#x27;S BETTER TO APPLY 2 VERY THIN COATS THAN ONE THICK COAT to avoid the pasty white look (or focus on the SPF 15 product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My family and I have used this product religiously for 3 years, and not one of us have ever gotten sunburn (my wife is more fairer skinned than I am, and we&#x27;ve vacationed in the tropics with this).  This is actually even after not reapplying after a few hours, which is necessary for practically ALL sunscreens on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through the WHOLE  EWG Iist, and scrutinized the products &amp; ingredients. One thing I do really usually appreciate is when reviewers provide alternatives in lieu when dealing with a specific product, but given that the ingredients in this item are ABSOLUTELY to prevent overexposure to UVA &amp; UVB, without hormone disruption from products that don&#x27;t rely on reflective measures, I can&#x27;t  find another product to displace Badger, especially with the many options they have (SPF 15,30, scented, &amp; unscented). ---  Just another satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I chose this sunscreen because it is one of two on the market that is not considered toxic or carcinogenic. I was a bit skeptical at first because there were mixed user reviews, most of them noting that it doesn&#x27;t spread well.  True, this product does not spread as well as other sunscreens. However, it also doesn&#x27;t have the toxic chemicals the others do.  We are not talking about any major spreading issue.  It just takes a few extra seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for the summer, I can say that it gives me peace of mind because not only are my children well protected from the sun, but also they are NOT covered with toxic chemicals.  The sunscreen works very well. One of children swims twice a day for about an hour each time, and she has not burned once during the time I have been using this product. I, too, have used the Badger sunscreen.  It does feel a little greasy, but I don&#x27;t care about that too much because when I am out in the sun, I am active and/or in the water.  Also, I have sensitive skin, and this product has not affected me in any negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen I ordered was sent and received on time.  Badger SPF 30 sunscreen worked great sailing in the Hawaiian sun.  No sun burn.</li>
    <li> We have a PALE child. This product keeps her sun-free. We reapply less than every 2 hours if we are at a pool or beach. Other than that, every 2 hours seems to work. It has a pleasant fragrance (will get fragrance free next time b/c it&#x27;s not necessary). It can be clumpy at times, but the clumps smooth out. I wish I could find a larger size and that it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. But, I will continue to buy this product b/c I trust it!</li>
    <li> We have just returned from 2 weeks in Mongolia, including 6 days in the Gobi where the sun is constant and intense.  We used Badger sunscreen every day and found it easy to apply, pleasantly unscented, and very effective.  It is well worth the extra rubbing to avoid looking ghostly (ghastly?) and we highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Badger SPF30 sunscreen is on the scored list from EWG, a group often featured on TV reporting on toxicity of common household cleaning products, cosmetics, etc. Badger Sunscreen is on their list rated with a \\&quot;1\\&quot; score, which is their best score grouping. It is sold by Amazon through a link with the EWG website. It contains only zinc oxide as an active ingredient. I am very sun-sensitive because of a medication I take, and the Badger sunscreen provided great protection recently when I was swimming in bright sun for over an hour. I got no burn and no tan. The sunscreen did not wash off in the water or come off with sweating. Go to EWG&#x27;s site (Google EWG or Environmental Working Group)for more sunscreens on the list.</li>
    <li> I feel bad not giving this a great review.  I love how safe it is and it seems to work well.  It&#x27;s also not that expensive as far as mineral sunscreens go.  I just hate the scent though.  I put it on my son, but use a different brand for myself.  I&#x27;m probably a bit more sensitive to scents than most, but I&#x27;m happier with California Baby, other than the price.  I haven&#x27;t tried the unscented Badger though, and probably should.</li>
    <li> I needed sunscreen to use while awaiting the arrival of supplies (zinc, oils, beeswax) to make my own. After researching safe and natural sunscreens, I selected Badger and found it works very well. Yes, it smells a little funky--kind of medicinal, but not too bad. And yes, it&#x27;s very thick and greasy. Since I use it before I swim, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s greasy. In fact, the oils keep my skin from getting dry and irritated by the chlorine. If you knead the tube first, you shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble dispensing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained that Badger sunscreen is too white. That&#x27;s actually a good thing. When sunscreen goes on clear, that means it contains nanoparticles of zinc. Nanoparticles are sized between 1 and 100 nanometers. The particles in this product average 200 nanometers, according to the packaging. The safety of nanoparticles (whether or not they&#x27;re absorbed by the skin and build up in the body, how they affect our water supply, etc.) has not been fully researched and is still debated. I&#x27;d rather look pasty than coat myself in nanoparticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great sunscreen. I would continue to use it instead of making my own if it were cheaper. According to the Mayo Clinic&#x27;s website and other sources, you&#x27;re supposed to use one ounce of sunscreen per application. So if you apply sunscreen correctly, you barely get three applications from one tube. For me, it&#x27;s cost prohibitive.</li>
    <li> I recently read an article about sunscreens and the possible link to increased skin cancers.  Being a conscientious mother, I went online to find one of the recommended items to use for myself and my children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Badger because it seemed the best for the price/size.  We&#x27;ve only used it once. It DID keep all of us from getting a burn, which is a plus.  But it was extremely thick, with a very greasy feel to it.  I felt as if I had a coating of lard on me all the time.  The kids were really slippery in the pool, as well, which was not good for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tend to be a little more sensitive to these kinds of things when it comes to comfort on our skin.  We don&#x27;t break out or anything like that, but we are less likely to use a product that feels as if we have put on a layer of lard than we are to use something which soaks in quickly with a normal skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balancing the two issues of feel and possible skin cancer is difficult.  I cannot tell another person if they would like the Badger or not.  I can only give my opinion as I see/feel it.  I hope it helps someone else.</li>
    <li> Love Badger Sunscreen. Keeps me from getting burned and is free of all the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; fillers and chemicals they add to sunscreen and tanning lotion nowadays. Pricey, but worth it! A little goes a long way. Does leave you with a thin, white powdery shimmer for a little bit as it soaks in.</li>
    <li> This became a favorite for us at home. It&#x27;s one of the top rated sunscreens in the study that came out recently. This sunscreen is quite thick. At first I didn&#x27;t like it but after two applications I loved it. The thickness makes sense....it stays on better and is very good quality. I purchased a few more of them and will stay with this brand</li>
    <li> After trying several Zinc Oxide all-natural sunscreens, this one was clearly the best bang for the buck. We didn&#x27;t pay much more than we would for the other kind (chemicals) and it smelled good. (The scent may not be everyone&#x27;s favorite, but it goes away after a little while outside, so it is no big deal if you don&#x27;t like it!)</li>
    <li> NO cancer causing ingredients in this one; I recommend it to ALL MY patients</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best - great protection, even if it is thick and takes a while to absorb.  Broad spectrum, great ingredients, very highly rated by EWG.</li>
    <li> we love this Sunscreen.  It does go on thick but we found that if the tube is warm it spreads better. at first the wearer appears white but that quickly goes away. My daughter (8yrs) &amp; I have been wearing this sunscreen for 2 years now &amp; we have Never once gotten sunburned while wearing this or the Kids version (tangerine cream scented) .&lt;br /&gt;Badger brand products are the only products that I have not been allergic to. We buy &amp; use 80% of Badger&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have just about every Badger product. I ADORE their balms and lip products. Now let me say, that I&#x27;m horribly disappointed with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick like clay and no matter how much I rubbed it in, the \\&quot;white face\\&quot; didn&#x27;t go away...and I&#x27;m quite pale to start with. It&#x27;s gritty (for a still unknown reason) and the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant at all. In fact, its awkward and doesn&#x27;t go away. I use sunblock religiously and unfortuantly this just isn&#x27;t what I was hoping it would be.</li>
    <li> This is the first year I&#x27;ve found most commercial sunscreens cause my eyes to burn and constantly tear. I found this Badger Sunscreen that is pretty much all zinc.  Does not bother my eyes at all.  As other reviewers mentioned it is very thick.  It reminds me of the old lifeguard pictures where the cute boy has a totally white nose.  However, if you use only a small amount you can rub it in until it is totally invisible. I think one tube will last through the summer.  I didn&#x27;t really notice the smell.  I tend to stay in the sun WAY longer than I should so I still have a little color on my face and arms even after a week or so of consistent use.  I think with moderate sun exposure and diligent re application you will be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Got to a 1pm football game at about 12pm. Had expected it to be cool and a little overcast...it wasn&#x27;t. Sun was on me the entire game. I had intended to reapply at halftime, but had been too caught up in the game to remember, and luckily, the Badger sunscreen that I had put on a good hour before the game worked for about 5 hours (we had to wait in a long line in the sun afterward for the metro to ferry us back to our car). Haven&#x27;t used it in the water yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Very pleased with this product. UVA protection seems to be better with zinc oxide than with titanium dioxide from what I&#x27;ve read up on, and Badger has zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> Ingredients were not properly stated in listing. This item contains sunflowers to which I  highly allergic.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and when you do your work as a Mime, you can just put this super thick white zinc oxide cream on. It does dual work as sunscreen and street performer mime face paint. It&#x27;s that thick.</li>
    <li> My family and I love Badger sunscreens.  You don&#x27;t need SPF 50 or 100  you just need one that works.  This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t make my face burn like most other sunscreens (avobenzone can cause this burning).  Be prepared to look like a ghost after putting it on and being a bit greasy but for long days in the sun like at the beach or at the pool who cares!! All we want is a safe product that works so we can go to the beach and not have to worry.  Now if your going to an outdoor party where you want to wear makeup and look nice well I suggest wearing something else.  But this is one product I always have in stock in my house in Florida since the sun here is just too dangerous to not be protected.  :)</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to love this sunscreen. I researched forever to find some kind of face sunscreen that I could wear daily but that wasn&#x27;t full of icky ingredients. I thought this would fit the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, like some other reviewers said (and I ignored), it IS hard to rub it all into your skin without a slight white glow. I rubbed and rubbed, but still was left with a thin white sheen and a greasy feel (that never really soaked in). I thought, &amp;#34;Alright, I can ignore this. I&#x27;ll just put on some extra blush and call it good.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT then I realized it was making me break out each time I used it! And I haven&#x27;t had pimples in years, so it was a surprise. I kept blaming it on other things, but sure enough when I stopped using it my skin cleared, and when I would try it again I would get a pimple or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed it didn&#x27;t work for my daily face sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it three stars instead of two is that I know it will still be good to use on my baby&#x27;s skin. I still love that it&#x27;s free of bad ingredients, so I think this would still be a good purchase for babies or kids. They don&#x27;t care if they have a white greasy sheen on them. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I kid you not - this smells like catnip. If not for the annoying smell, I would probably use it although it is much thicker than other all natural (chemical free) sunscreens that I&#x27;ve used. I am allergic to chemical sunscreens and the one I had been using changed it&#x27;s formula and now flakes when I try to rub it in, so I am searching for a new one. Given the very high price, the thick consistency, and the horrible smell, I have to give this one only 1 star. I&#x27;m sure it probably does a fine job of protecting you from the sun, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so I never tested it out in the sun. It does give you a little bit of a white sheen, but so do all the other chemical free sunscreens (it is a physical block after all) so that wouldn&#x27;t have been a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> We have gone through 4 of these bottles this summer b/c we love it so much (and are obviously outside on a daily basis). It gives a great coverage and no one in my family has yet to burn. It is gentle enough that we even put it on our 2 month old.</li>
    <li> Great product. One of the very few without any harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of its great rating from the Environmental Working Group.  It has a pleasant scent, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and protects against sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s white. On a creamy ivory complexion, this is probably not a problem, but it gives my olive skin a pallid cast. This would be great for masquerading as the living dead.&lt;br /&gt;The inactive ingredients are basically all oils and beeswax, so it&#x27;s very moisturizing and extremely waterproof. It won&#x27;t come off in the pool, and it won&#x27;t come off when you rub your skin with a towel. It also won&#x27;t come off when you mightily attack your skin with a loofah. Be warned.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and perhaps most concerning: this sunblock seems to cause me to get heatstroke! I&#x27;ve spent a good portion of my life outdoors in the South Texas summer and am usually fine with it, but not when wearing this. From now on I&#x27;ll stick with [[ASIN:B000FCY95A Vanicream Sunscreen Sport, Spf 35, 4-ounce]].</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and gooey making it hard to slather on. When applying it, it pulls the skin, hair on the skin (I&#x27;m a guy), and goes on in thick white streaks. Further rubbing of this thick goo causes it to spread and absorb with only a bit of whiteness. It provided me good sun burn protection, but it&#x27;s so hard to apply I&#x27;ve found myself leaving half of this overpriced tube unopened, reverting back to the EWG (Environmental Working Group) poorly rated broad spectrum chemical sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen, as well as the face stick, after reading the ratings on ewg.com.  This sunscreen definitely does its job.  I have used it on myself and two kids and have no complaints as far as its sun protection.  As others have said, it is very thick and a little gritty feeling.  But if you take your time, it rubs in fine.  I think the trick is to use more, not less, and it goes on slightly easier.  From articles I have read, people tend to put on not enough sunscreeen, you really should be lathering it on for best protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside we have had is my kids&#x27; reaction to the smell.  It is \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but does have a slight odor.  To me it smells kind of like that thick white paste I used as a kid, and is tolerable.  But it literally makes my kids GAG when I put it on them.  Seriously.  Something about the smell of it triggers a gag out of both of them, and they are not just playing it up.  Next time I will either try the Lavender version, or try another brand from ewg&#x27;s list.</li>
    <li> Works okay. I like the ingredient list. Honestly though,  I think coconut oil with or without lavender essential oil works better for us.</li>
    <li> Tried to go with something natural - but I burned with this sunscreen and don&#x27;t feel I can even use it</li>
    <li> I got this sunscreen for my wife so she didn’t’ need to rub toxic chemicals on her body any longer.  I thought I may be wasting our money because of all the negative reviews regarding that it is hard to rub on, it&#x27;s gritty, stains car seats, clothing etc.  Well…she found none of that.  In fact, her skin feels soft and silky with it on and guess what…no stinky, toxic chemical smell!!!!  And no sunburn either!!!  This is not gritty and it is a touch harder to rub on than hand cream or body lotion, but that’s it…A great working sunscreen without toxic chemicals that doesn’t stain your car seats and clothing at a reasonable price.  What more can we ask for?  Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great but it is too thick to apply.</li>
    <li> The product goes on smoother than other good-for-you sunscreens.  It&#x27;s still quite thick, but we like it.</li>
    <li> Bought it when I became pregnant. Does the job, not super greasy, and not the hardest thing to rub in. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but well worth it.  Yes, it does look white on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in well, but honestly, my kids and I got over it knowing we are well protected by a great product!  My kids do not complain one bit abotu the light scent (which I don&#x27;t even notice).</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a very good spf because I burn easily so I did some research and Badger had great reviews and was safe to use vs all the other harmful chemicals in other products.Can you say GHOST FACE? I new the sunscreen was going to have a white effect like most good sunscreens so I was willing to spend the extra time to rub it in very good but after putting this on my face I had to exfoliate ! not wash but exfoliate my face to get this mess off. I pretty sure it does protect against the sun but there is no way you can make it out the house to give it a try. The only person I would recommend this product to is a white pale pale super pale person then maybe it would work but if you have any kind of color to your skin you can hang it up.</li>
    <li> Another waste of money..Badger was recommended by a pediatrician so i tried it. I have a red head child with very fair skin and she burnt while using this product. I reapplied every 2 hours..and she burned..gave it one more shot and reapplied every hour and she still burned...I will NEVER buy any badger products again</li>
    <li> I tried this product both the lotion and the cream.  I used the cream on my daughters face when we went outside for long periods and yes, I did apply it frequently.  It does not give as much protection as California Baby on her cheeks, nose and under eye area (which are the most vunerable).  We stopped using the cream when we go to the beach and put it away for the fall on park days.</li>
    <li> it was a lot thicker than i expected.  that is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> It makes you look a bit white, but this it the healthiest sunscreen that I know of, so I really don&#x27;t care what it makes me look like.  I am a dog walker and in the sun every day.  I use this every day.</li>
    <li> Like that it has no added chemicals.  I try to purchase all my products organic and this one worked well.</li>
    <li> Total blocks sun and no chemicals</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it a week before going on vacation on 4-14-2012.  I&#x27;ve used this Badger SPF 30 for the last 2 summers successfully.  My son &amp; I were severely burned after 4 hours on the Ft. Lauderdale beach.  My wife, who is a sun worshiper, used a Coppertone suntan lotion with a SPF-8 and was not burned.  She stayed in the sun longer than we did.  There was no difference in our activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are returning this and considering filing a complaint with the FTC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would no longer recommend purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I seem to remember a national news story that showed the makers of Badger sun block and how they were growing rapidly and needed to go to special equipment to keep up with demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like they screwed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m changing to Coppertone Water Babies \\&quot;Pure &amp; Simple\\&quot;  which uses Titanium Dioxide for the sunblock and is listed as waterproof.  The Pure &amp; Simple version is not supposed to use the harmful chemicals - according to EWG.ORG.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews because I am busy with my four little kids.  In fact this is my first review.  I am writing this because of the extreme ineffectiveness of this so-called sunscreen.  Three osf my four kids were burned after three hours in the sun at the lake.  I am in to natural stuff and was trying to do my kids a favor by using a natural sunscreen.  I feel bad that my little kids got scorched.  I know a chemical sunscreen would have done a much better job.  Loving Naturals also absolutely does not work.  Both products are going in the trash.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will. My only issue is that it leaves my face so white. It&#x27;s rather inconvenient for everyday wear or maybe I am just putting it on wrong.</li>
    <li> Great chemical free gentle sunscreen</li>
    <li> I have had skin cancer in the past, and need very good, broad spectrum protection.  Despite the rather high price for a small tube, I thought I would give this a try.  I will not use it again.  It goes on a lot like diaper rash cream--very thick and white.  It eventually soaks in most of the way, but even hours later, I still have little white dots where it settled into every pore.  AND, it is greasy, getting on everything I touch, including white marks on my clothes.  Might be ok for sports, but definitely not what I want to wear on a daily basis, walking around town!</li>
    <li> I like that this is a safe alternative, and is more natural, but found it was very frustrating to apply because it is so thick.  It is also fairly small so does not last long, and for the amount of time I spend in the sun, is not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to organic products and, let me tell you, this sunscreen is great! Sometimes even the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; sunblocks would make me break out or would leave my skin just plain irritated, but not Badger! Whew! Finally! It feels wonderful on my skin, though I use it sparingly and rub it in well to prevent looking like a ghost. I use it beneath makeup without any trouble too. No burning and no freckles either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that 2.9 oz sounds much larger than it is. I&#x27;d go through one tube in a week if I used it everywhere (said the Floridian).</li>
    <li> It works great, just like most people say. Feels like above avg. quality. Goes on smooth and not too thick. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not expecting it to be as good as it is. We are in the sun a lot and wanted to get away from the chemical based sunscreen products available everywhere. This sunscreen stays on really well, gives very good coverage and I really like the smell. It smells a little like chocolate to me. My fianc&amp;eacute; is a surfer so he&#x27;s in and out of the water a lot and is very happy with it.  This is all we will be using from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It rubs in well, and works great for many hours in the sun. I love that it&#x27;s made by a small company, and I feel safe using it on my kid.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. I don&#x27;t care how it looks. The sun is merciless and does not care how it hurts your skin. I use this instead of the petrochemical stuff in the recognizable big brands at the super market or chain drug stores. It&#x27;s a bit greasy and the zinc is white, but so what. It&#x27;s all natural. BTW, this is a good tube size for your face, but if you need SPF 34 protection for the whole body, wear clothes and a hat. By reading the organic ingredients, you could make your own, with some experimentation of course. My only reservation with this type of product is the plastic container. I wish we could buy this stuff in glass or stainless steel containers.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen if you are looking for something without toxic chemicals.  I love the lavender smell and it works - good protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to mention is that it will tint your skin a little white while wearing it.... Also, I used it on my face for a few days and it made me break out.  Best for the body in my opinion.  :)</li>
    <li> One of the best qualities of this sunscreen is that it does not each off immediately when a person goes into a pool or the surf</li>
    <li> Works well but very thick and takes some work to rub in.</li>
    <li> Badger sunscreen replies great protection, esp.on the beach where salt water beads up on your skin like a racecar.  It is harder to put on and rub in, though, and reminds me of the baby diaper product desitin.  The scent is pleasant but it is a bit greasy and leaves a white sheen on your skin at first.</li>
    <li> I looked up my previous daily sunscreen on EWG and it rated quite hazardous.  I was looking for something that rated low in hazard, is good for sensitive skin, and provides great protection.  I tried several similar sunscreens and moisturizers with sunscreen and this is the best.  It does not leave a white film, is not greasy and while I&#x27;m not fond of the smell it disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;m buying as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Thick but not pasty, rubs in right away with no issues, no need to wash off later. I use it for baby and myself. Can&#x27;t give it enough stars!</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen. As another reviewer mentioned, it comes out with a few tiny gritty pieces but they go away when rubbed in. Leaves my face a little white but that goes away after 5 min. The best part about it is that it leaves my skin feeling so nice, which I think might be because of the shea butter. And the scent is wonderful--very natural. If you don&#x27;t like a slight scent of lavender go with the unscented. The only other thing to mention is that in my experience you have to reapply A LOT if you&#x27;re going to be swimming so I generally go with a more commercial waterproof brand for that use.</li>
    <li> but not full of chemicals. needed sunscreen every day, so decided this was much better. If you don&#x27;t care how you look, go for it!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I tan easily . However my eyes are so sensitive to any sunblock , even the \\&quot;Tear Free&#x27; advertisers. This stuff rocks. Just follow the directions. Put some on not the huge amounts as in most products and rub in well. Great for the beach. Totally happy</li>
    <li> Even if the risks aren&#x27;t clear, why take a chance?  Yah, it takes a little longer to rub in.  Rubbing extra or going with white streaks (which wear off) are a small price to me to stay away from unnecessary chemicals.  My seven year old boy likes the scent, as do I, and he&#x27;s not getting burned in the So. Cal. sun.</li>
    <li> This worked great for my 4 year old son!  Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> Worked great. Did not get a sunburn.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but oooh it does not spread well. It&#x27;s like pancake batter sitting on my skin for he first 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  Sure, some people dislike the smell, but I think it&#x27;s a little like chocolate.  It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t make me break out or get a rash, and definitely protects against the sun!  I haven&#x27;t gotten sunburned while wearing it which is more than I can say for lots of other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a Paraben free sunscreen for my 5 month old daughter&#x27;s first trip to the beach. Several moms highly recommended this one to me. With such positive reviews I was excited to order it. After using it on my daughter for nearly a week I was really pleased. The fragrance is light, not overwhelming. My daughter didn&#x27;t burn at all and it didn&#x27;t sting her eyes. I was actually glad that it went on her so thick because I really wanted her to be protected.&lt;br /&gt;However, trying to rub this stuff all over myself was a different matter. I&#x27;m 6&#x27; tall and I felt like it took me 20 minutes to thoroughly cover myself. It just doesn&#x27;t spread well. I&#x27;d have a whole bunch on my leg and I&#x27;d rub and rub and it just really wouldn&#x27;t spread out. It was also really hard to wash off. Of course you want it to stick around when you&#x27;re in the pool or the sea, but after soaping up 3 times in the shower I still felt a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;In the future I will put this on my daughter and my face and I&#x27;ll find another natural brand for the rest of my body. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of slathering my body and my kid in chemicals, so I was hoping to find a good natural sunscreen. This one was disappointing. It&#x27;s thick, hard to rub in, leaves a ghostly white sheen, and the sun protection is not very good. After applying two coats and still turning noticeably pink within an hour, I had to switch over to traditional sunscreen. On the plus side, it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I like this product...it rubs on very well, and you don&#x27;t need much at all...some people complain about it making their faces white, but hey, I&#x27;m WHITE, so I have no prob with that...and that&#x27;s my goal in wearing this...staying white without skin cancer....and it&#x27;s really not that bad...just take the time to massage it in long enough to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I got burned using this...and I was under a tree most of the time.  Not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for me but I plan to scope out other organic ones.  The most recent Consumer Reports also warns about this from this particular product.  will not buy again, sorry.</li>
    <li> My kids aren&#x27;t crazy about the thickness nor the smell, but I love that its natural and safer for the skin then many of the commercial sunscreens and we&#x27;ve used this for several years and it really works as protection.</li>
    <li> We love this product in part because it is so highly rated in the skindeep database online, as a product without harmful artificial ingredients. It is definitely oily and gives that zinc-y white sheen, but living in a tropical place and using sunblock as often as we need to, it&#x27;s a tradeoff I&#x27;m willing to make for my family. It feels like it is GOOD for your skin and is never drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knead the tube thoroughly before use, as it can separate and give you a handful of oil instead of cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it for years. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> It works great as a sunscreen, but it is very thick and leaves a white sheen to your skin. It also leaves your skin a bit sticky so dirt, sand and bugs may stick to you. I do love the short ingredient list though.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. Works well and zinc isn&#x27;t bad for you! Also love the last got lavender scent. My only complaint is how you turn white of it doesn&#x27;t absorb well. But that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s zinc so it is a trade off. I find applying a small amount does the trick for me</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this sunblock! I bought it to wear to an all-day music fest that was outdoors and it held up wonderfully! I did not burn at all, and only applied it once! Granted it was an unusuall low-humidity day in Texas so I didn&#x27;t sweat much. Initially it went on white, but I kept rubbing it in and the warmth of my hand helped work it in. I didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and the lavendar smell dissapated quickly. I am going to buy the unscented one for my husband to wear. I love Badger products and will continue to use them!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED. I applied this sunblock as I have every day since I bought it; however this was a hot and humid day and I was in the sun all day driving. My arms felt like they were burning after about an hour in the sun, and I was sweating. I applied another coat thinking that would help but it didn&#x27;t. That night when I got home and showered my arms were pink and hot to the touch. I was so upset since I had initially loved this product and the fact that it was chemical-free. I honestly don&#x27;t know what I am going to use next.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was well rated on the Sunscreen safety test (link: [...]). I spent a couple of days on the Colorado river using only the Badger sunscreen and reapplied about a half dozen times in the course of 5 or 6 hours but I still got pretty badly sunburned on my chest and shoulders. Everywhere else was fine, but I was a little disappointed that this happened as I was very aware of reapplying throughout the day. Smells nice and rubs in pretty well, and I love that it is organic.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is chunky and pasty to put on. I have light olive skin but this sunscreen makes me very white. When I was trying it out, it made me very oily (I have a combination of oily and normal skin). I no longer use it on my face but instead use it on my body to get some use from it.</li>
    <li> Too thick and oily. Causes pimples if applied to face.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews, I was hoping to love this sunscreen.  Some folks complain that it turns them white, but honestly, all you have to do is rub it in a bit longer and that goes away so there&#x27;s really no problem there.  It has the consistancy of toothpaste, perhaps a bit thicker, so it isn&#x27;t easy to spread around, but it&#x27;s not too terrible and you can work around that.  The issue that I can&#x27;t seem to work around is that it leaves my skin feeling greasy after I put it on no matter how much I rub it in.  It also leaves a shiny film on my face which isn&#x27;t attractive.  It&#x27;s probably not as bad as I think it is, but it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a clean feeling after I apply it which really bothers me.  As far as the smell goes, as a guy I should have ordered the unscented; the lavendar is a bit off-putting to me.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I&#x27;m out, but I&#x27;ll be switching to [[ASIN:B004CDRUOA Thinksport Livestrong Sunscreen SPF 50+, Water Resistant, 3 ounces]] to see if that&#x27;ll do it for me.  Seems like there&#x27;s no perfect sunscreen out there that doesn&#x27;t contain tons of chemicals.  If you know of one, please leave the info in the comments section below for everyone&#x27;s benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this sunscreen, just ask in the comments and I&#x27;ll try and respond promptly.</li>
    <li> Quality product.  We purchase this every year.</li>
    <li> We found this sunscreen needed to be applied thicker and more often. It did not seem to be the best sunscreen for the intense sun where we live.</li>
    <li> This is best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s pretty thick, so I little does go a long way. However, gave me all day protection with only 2 applications during the day.</li>
    <li> This product has a very thick consistency that does not absorb well. It leaves white streaks on your skin. It does work but so does Sunny Days, another top rated sunscreen which absorbs quickly and without the mess. At 2.9 ounces it is more than an ounce LESS than Sunny Days and costs 2 bucks more. It smells terrible and Sunny Days has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, reviews weren&#x27;t not truthful about this sunscreen saying it is one of the best!!!!! i tried to like it but it feels like a wax, super greasy, super sticky, terrible smell stays on you for days!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am really upset It is not eligible for refund!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hate it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing this sunscreen out in public and I&#x27;m absolutely humiliated. Despite putting it on 30 minutes ago, it&#x27;s still wet and thus, there are giant white, greasy patches on my arms, phone and purse.  Furthermore, I spent 10 minutes rubbing it in and it&#x27;s still disgusting.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are AMAZING and make my skin smoother. I use this when I go out for a run and I haven&#x27;t ben burned yet! The only problem is it&#x27;s pretty hard to rub in, well it doesn&#x27;t really rub in all the way but soaks in after 10-15 mins. In reality, I don&#x27;t really care if it rubs in right away because it has such great ingredients. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for kids, it would be hard to rub it in on a squirmy child. Oh and it smells sooo gooood!</li>
    <li> I do a lot of paddleboarding (sup), sailing, and surfing. I&#x27;m dark skinned but spending 4-6 hours in the peak tropical sun will fry you out no matter who you are. I wear a huge lifeguard hat, shades, and badger sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little white, but I don&#x27;t really care. It holds up well to being wiped, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and comes off with one or two scrubs with soapy hands. If you&#x27;re doing sports it&#x27;s important that it stays on and doesn&#x27;t come off so easily, and I feel like this does a good job of being washable but at the same time not coming off your head if you wipe sweat from your brow or wipe water from your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear sunscreen almost every day and put it on my toddler the same, so it&#x27;s important to me to have something that works well and isn&#x27;t loaded with nasty stuff. If you go to the beach a few times a year, maybe do whatever. But if you&#x27;re in the sun as much as I do I think it&#x27;s worth taking a minute to consider what you&#x27;re coating your skin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re surfing or paddleboarding you&#x27;re not in a fashion contest, so if it leaves you a little white, deal with it. Use a little less and rub harder to get the white-out to go away. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
    <li> as you probably know if you&#x27;re reading this, the stuff they put in most sunscreens is bad news (oxybenzone) - it interacts with your skin chemistry to chemically block the sun, but it messes with your hormones,&lt;br /&gt;this sunscreen (and a few others on the market) don&#x27;t use it. instead they work like old-school sunscreen, with an actual metal barrier material (zinc oxide usually). usually these leave a white layer on your skin. doesn&#x27;t bother me but some people don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;it stays on pretty well, and once it&#x27;s rubbed in it doesn&#x27;t feel nasty.&lt;br /&gt;only drawbacks are it&#x27;s expensive (this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found for zinc oxide sunscreen).&lt;br /&gt;the other drawback is that it seems to be whole food&#x27;s default brand - which isn&#x27;t Badger&#x27;s fault, but I try to avoid having anything to do with whole foods or the companies they carry.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub in at all, makes my skin look blue, and is a pain to even get out of the bottle due to how thick it is.  Plus I developed a sunburn within 15 minutes even with this stuff on.  Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> The reviews stated many attributes including &amp;#34;no white,pink or purple color left on skin....well the zinc leaves a combination of those colors. It seems to give sun protection but you look like a dead person.</li>
    <li> I love the scent but I found myself reaching for other sunscreens as it is SO greasy and sometimes even separates in the tube.</li>
    <li> I love that this is organic and natural without all of the toxic ingredients you find in other sunscreens.  I use it on myself as well as my son.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become allergic to chemical sunscreens and I&#x27;ve purchased several zinc-based sunscreens in attempts to find something decent to put on. The reviews say this one is great, so I bought it. So far, no itchiness so that&#x27;s good. It screened the sun well, too. It smells nice. It looks VERY thick coming out of the bottle but it actually rubbed in better than another selection I made that was more lotiony. It rubbed in easily and didn&#x27;t make my skin look white. I may amend this review to 5 if I can&#x27;t find any better and I don&#x27;t find myself too itchy in the next day or two! Thanks Badger!</li>
    <li> While the ingredients in this product may be good, the sunscreen leaves my skin feeling so heavy with sunscreen and oily. I almost have stopped wearing it because it feels so gross. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Badger brand sunscreen always gets ranked highly on ewg&#x27;s list (Environmental Working Group), my kids love the smell and I love that it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t contain toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that I find a safe sunscreen. Environmental Working Group had listed this product as one of their safer selections.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on heavy and white, so you have to be patient and rub it in.  But for the protection it affords you, it is worth taking your time and putting it on your face and after rubbing, letting it fade in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it does NOT sting eyes when you sweat- so many sunscreens and even make up products burn /sting your eyes so that was another important feature to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Badger Suncreen is supposed to be cruelty free- a very important point in purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen, Things you need to know first...you need to use sparingly, rub between your palms so it becomes moist. Otherwise your face will be completely white and chalky.</li>
    <li> I ordered the SPF 34 sunscreen but I received SPF 30... Which is still ok. It seems very greasy but I like the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t spread well at all..not a fan of the smell either!</li>
    <li> We used this every day for the last two weeks. It provided good protection but had two main drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My son did not like the lavender sent.&lt;br /&gt;2. It was greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that it is non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to use the tube but will probably purchase LiveStrong by ThinkSport next. We used that product last year and it did well and had a very light pleasant sent.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was just \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.  It was a real pain in the butt to rub in all of the way (which is absolutely no fun when you&#x27;ve got a baseball team worth of kids to slather with the stuff) and it has to be reapplied very often to continue working.  Plus it&#x27;s greasy.  The only good quality is that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of unpronounceable chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product if I knew it had Lavender in it.  The picture shows one without lavender.  I paid $16.30 for a tube and later that day saw them at Ulta for $16.  I&#x27;ll probably buy my next tube there.</li>
    <li> After searching for a safer, less toxic sunscreen, I decided to use Badger.  I went to Florida for our family vacation and have yet to see either of my two kids (1 &amp; 3) get sunburned this summer.  The only con to this is that it&#x27;s thick and pasty- if it gets on clothes it can be difficult to remove.  I don&#x27;t mind the thickness because it doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes when they are playing in the water.</li>
    <li> I found the sunscreen works. But I find it just too oily. I find that when I try to use it and go out during the day I get oil everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and I feel extremely safe using this on my baby.  Has a nice smell</li>
    <li> Best for very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven, i.e. lavender oil.  Feels like I put cooking oil on my skin and then fried in the sun.  Had the same burn as my husband and he didn&#x27;t wear sunscreen at all.</li>
    <li> Very oily, if you&#x27;re prone to breaking out, this product might not be for you.  I bought it for my girlfriend but it didn&#x27;t work for her. Every time she used it she would breakout with acne.</li>
    <li> Well, should I go to the cosmetics department, test them to see if I&#x27;m allergic and pay $60 for 2 oz of sunscreen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or should I just randomly purchase sunscreens with as many different ingredients as possible to find one I can use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could just consult an allergist for several hundred dollars (alas my HMO has a waiting list for allergists several years long, I&#x27;m out of network) and just find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the user experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick and heavy. very very. You will have to really work it into your skin. If you worry about too much drag on your skin creating wrinkles and stretch, you won&#x27;t like this.  You&#x27;ll know when to stop when the whitish color fades out. Try warming it up in a cup of hot water if you need speed application. It feels more waxy than oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top note of the scent is lavender followed by a distinct but not overwhelming blend of cocoa butter and beeswax, followed by a confusing mish-mash of everything else in the ingredients list. I am sure there is something on that list that you won&#x27;t like and something that you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unlike so many other sunscreens I can use this one. And it doesn&#x27;t cost $60 per tube.</li>
    <li> I have been in and out of dermatology clinics all of my life. I&#x27;m extremely fair and have had skin cancer in the past so needless to say I wear sunscreen everyday. Ironically, all of the chemicals in regular sunscreen can give you cancer and having to wear it everyday is like waiting to get sick. This sunscreen in the best natural sunscreen! It smells good, is pretty light weight, last long, and I don&#x27;t have to feel bad for purchasing it because it is animal testing free. Really great product!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 18 months old and has very fair skin.  Every morning I apply this sunscreen to her and send her off to daycare, where the kids are outside in the sun whenever the weather is nice.  She does wear a hat outside, but this sunscreen has kept her well-protected all summer.  When I first got it, I did find it to be gritty and I had to rub my hands together and let it \\&quot;warm up\\&quot; before it became smooth enough to attempt to put it on my squirmy kid (but after a few weeks, this grittiness went away - now it comes out of the tube perfectly).  This step might be unnecessary if you are applying it to yourself, because you can just spend an extra second rubbing it in.  Since her patience is limited, I have to be quick.  But that&#x27;s one of the reasons I like this sunscreen over other natural brands - there is a lot of oil in it, so the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;dry\\&quot; on their skin quite as quickly.  I found that other sunscreens would get \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; once they hit the outside air, so rubbing them in became difficult after a few seconds.  This sunscreen is easy to rub in, and also gives me a grace period if she breaks free and runs off...I can still rub it in when I catch her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my 30-something fair skin with great results. Even though it is fairly oily, it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, although it might  be different if I used it every day (since I work indoors, I am mostly a weekend sunscreen user).  It might not be ideal for an acne-prone teenager or someone with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragance, I think it&#x27;s light and it mostly smells like lavender.  Which is pretty much what all our natural products smell like, so I think it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Where i applied the sunscreen i got severely burned after about 20 minutes in the sun. I was ver disappointed and confused because it works so well for others.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen does not cause rash/burn on my skin! I am allergic to sunscreens but Badger Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF34 neither sting nor cause rash on my sensitive skin (face). I personally do not mind the texture like some people say it&#x27;s too thick. I take just a dab of this out of tube, and warm in my palm for about 1/2 minute, then the cream gets softer and easier to put all over my face. You only need to use a tiny bit because this spreads like butter! I mix it with a little bit of liquid foundation (BB cream) in the morning before I put makeup on like normal, then put a homemade face powder (cocoa powder, cinnamon powder and cornstarch mix) - This will do trick- stay *put* and not greasy after hours in the office. For outdoors, I sometimes skip the powder part so that I can keep reapplying. I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from sunscreen allergies! No more nasty rash on my face thanks to Badger!</li>
    <li> The reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that it is somewhat difficult to rub in.  It doesn&#x27;t stink like most sunscreens.  It also does not leave a greasy feel.  You can tell you are wearing it, so it&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;administer and never know it&#x27;s there&amp;#34; experience...but it&#x27;s not greasy or slimy.  Overall, it&#x27;s my favorite sunscreen yet.</li>
    <li> Caused my face to break out in a rash- my skin looked like large grain sandpaper. Perhaps I was allergic to the lavender oil, as I am now using another physical sunblock and am not allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot attest to its effectiveness as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It is a little thick and should be used sparingly because it leaves a white, pasty look at first.  Love the smell and did a great job preventing me from getting a burn!</li>
    <li> For everyone using Badger products, keep in mind that they screw all of their employees and fire people with cancer. Their super liberal profile is neither super or liberal. You can just as easily buy a tube of zinc for much less. Just as good and you are not financially supporting a pseudo family business that acts like a corporation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Badger for a couple of years now. It is absolutely the best for the job of protecting my skin.It uses zinc oxide and has a very good integrity (lasting power) despite sweating.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work too well and I am olive tone and still burned with it on. Without it, I don&#x27;t burn. Also, the product leaves a white covering on your skin. Purchased due to score on EWG.org but will look for another product.</li>
    <li> The balm works well and has a nice scent, but it is really thick and hard to smooth onto skin without a lot of pressure,</li>
    <li> Works in the strong Texas sun. Yes, you have to rub it in a little but...I&#x27;m OK with that. Also make sure you reapply after getting wet.</li>
    <li> I have a great deal of sun damage from years of abuse.  My dermatologist insists that I not go outside without at least 30 spf on.  Last year I ruined scores of clothing with regular sunscreen from the reaction that causes red stain.  Plus I have sensitive skin and putting sunscreen on my face often ends badly.  After doing some research I found Badger to be the one I would try.  It met all my expectations and while I wish there wasn&#x27;t that bluish/white tint on my skin, I realize it&#x27;s reflective and necessary.  It&#x27;s pure, it&#x27;s not filled with chemicals and it works.  Not much better than that!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out this sunscreen because it is biodegradable. When I received the product, I was surprised at how expensive the product was for such a small amount. To make things worse, I was disappointed when the sunscreen did not even fulfill its intended purpose. I used it while going to a water park, applied it three different times during the day, but I still got sunburned. Despite the environmental and bodily benefits of using a this type sunscreen, I feel that costs far outweigh the benefits.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and the SPF worked great. It takes a while to rub in, but it&#x27;s worth it to be chemical free!</li>
    <li> It did not feel greasy, but the trade-off is that it was thicker than normal sunscreens.  The kids also did not like the strong lavender scent.  Smelled like old lady.  Husband smelled like an old lady too.  Not sexy.</li>
    <li> It works. It is thicker than normal sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, has a long life - even with lots of water. This is the only sunscreen we now use for adults and kids.</li>
    <li> I just received and was excited to open. But disappointed when I saw the product. It looked from a dirty factory. It looks very old. The packaging have a lot of stains. I do not have a returning sheet. I do not know what I am gonna do with this.</li>
</ol>
