      <li>The brush I bought a year ago softened considerably over time, lost the odor, and was very good to my face.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if that happened just then or if the noise i heard came from something else and the brush was cracked all along.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body brush to use in my skin brushing routine .</li>
      <li>it reinvigorates my face, and I feel more awake after using it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand &amp; easy to travel with because it doesn&#x27;t have a handle.  </li>
      <li>This is great and will last forever!</li>

      <li>Just started dry brushing and this is the perfect brush for my face-gentle enough but still gets results</li>
      <li>As the old brush softened, I could apply more pressure.  </li>
      <li>Love the natural bristles.</li>
      <li>Natural bristles means it dries very quickly after use compared to synthetic.  </li>
      <li>Below is my first review.  </li>
      <li>and i was sure that that wasn&#x27;t there a second ago.</li>
      <li>I used this brush for the first time about 20 minutes ago in the shower.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft but effective and I had no skin issues following use.</li>
      <li>When I went on vacation for 4 weeks, using a good, but different, complexion brush, German, I again got plugs in my pores.  </li>
      <li>It fits nicely in my hand, and is larger than most, probably twice as large as the usual round brush, so it can clean more.  </li>
      <li>My complexion has improved so much that my roommate now wants to buy one as well.</li>
      <li>Really works well for me.</li>
      <li>, that would break my face before it broke the brush, i was just gently rubbing it on my skin.</li>
      <li>The complexion brush is much softer than Dr. Jenson&#x27;s body brush and is useful for brushing sensitive areas of the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great travel body brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not soft enough for facial use.</li>
      <li>This is not a brush for fragile skin, and it needs a while to soften a bit, but the bristles are very fine, which means that there is no gouging, yet the density of the bristles means that your oily skin will be properly cleaned.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that it has an aroma of boar bristle, probably from the very large number of bristles in it, and the fact that it is new.  </li>
      <li>My skin has very thick oil in the pores, even now at an age where I could easily be a grandmother, and if I don&#x27;t clean it out, it stays in the pores and is a problem.  </li>
      <li>but after many years, it got a little out of shape!  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what it was, but i checked the brush and saw a small crack on the side of it.</li>
      <li>I bought my first brush a year ago, and have now bought a second, as I travel frequently, and I like to have two sets of toiletries, so I can pick up the travel toiletries bag and go.  </li>
      <li>It took a couple of times to get used to brushing my face, but the results are fast and I now do it several times a day.  </li>
      <li>However I&#x27;ll be looking for something softer in natural bristles for my face (if that exists.)</li>
      <li>so I went searching for a natural bristle brush and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>It did a better job at getting rid of impurities than any of the facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>If like me you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin you can use this on your face as a DRY-SKIN brush only.  </li>
      <li>This brush left my skin feeling so soft after using it on my face.</li>
      <li>My cheeks are becoming less &#x27;round&#x27; and someone told me my face looks slimmer.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely dry, sensitive skin.</li>

<li> Too bad, cause i actually really liked the feel and the affect of it on my skin.</li>
<li> This one is different from any other I have had.  </li>
<li> Every time I use it (dry brush before showering, or in the morning after I wake up)</li>
<li> I have been using a complexion brush with synthetic bristles in the shower and synthetic bristles take forever to dry.  </li>
<li> I do not have sensitive, delicate facial skin.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t feel to rough.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s still wet from the day before.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s harder then my body brush.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know, a lot of people said in the reviews that they use it wet...</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, was i not supposed to let it get wet or something?</li>
<li> It can&#x27;t be because i was too rough with it</li>
<li> I tried making it wet and use it in the shower with facial cleanser but its too harsh that way also (wet application).</li>
<li> In fact it usually takes well over 24 hours for my synthetic bristle complexion brush to dry after use in the shower which means by the time I try to use it the next day</li>
<li> I checked the brush, there&#x27;s a crack on the other side too</li>
<li> Comes with long handle that helps get to the hard to reach places.</li>
<li> I washed the brush thinking that the bristles might turn a little softer, but they did not.</li>
<li> I got this brush with the intention of dry brushing my face, but the bristles are too hard and rough for delicate face skin.</li>
<li> I found that it was too hard for a wet skin and would scratch my skin during washings, which meant I couldn&#x27;t use it for cleansing purposes on the face or neck</li>
<li> I was concerned that this trapped bacteria in the brush</li>
<li> I use this everyday.  </li>
<li> Seems a little too stiff for a complexion brush.  </li>
<li> No more plugs in the pores at all.  </li>
<li> If I need a small area cleaned, I just use part of it.  </li>
<li> I control the amount of abrasion by how hard I rub.  </li>
<li> The bristles are relatively thin, but they are densely packed.  </li>
<li> (remember to use caution &amp; brush around broken skin)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this brush! It did a better job at getting rid of impurities than any of the facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past. This brush left my skin feeling so soft after using it on my face. So impressed!!</li>
    <li> Below is my first review.  I bought my first brush a year ago, and have now bought a second, as I travel frequently, and I like to have two sets of toiletries, so I can pick up the travel toiletries bag and go.  My skin has very thick oil in the pores, even now at an age where I could easily be a grandmother, and if I don&#x27;t clean it out, it stays in the pores and is a problem.  The brush I bought a year ago softened considerably over time, lost the odor, and was very good to my face.  No more plugs in the pores at all.  When I went on vacation for 4 weeks, using a good, but different, complexion brush, German, I again got plugs in my pores.  This is not a brush for fragile skin, and it needs a while to soften a bit, but the bristles are very fine, which means that there is no gouging, yet the density of the bristles means that your oily skin will be properly cleaned. As the old brush softened, I could apply more pressure.  Press very lightly with a new brush, let it soften with use, and if your skin is as mine, you will be well satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a face brush for years and years.  This one is different from any other I have had.  The bristles are relatively thin, but they are densely packed.  I have used it for a week, and the bristles haven&#x27;t softened.  It cleans my face well.  I control the amount of abrasion by how hard I rub.  It does a very, very good job.  It fits nicely in my hand, and is larger than most, probably twice as large as the usual round brush, so it can clean more.  If I need a small area cleaned, I just use part of it.  The only drawback is that it has an aroma of boar bristle, probably from the very large number of bristles in it, and the fact that it is new.  It is noticeable, but not unpleasant.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not 5 stars.  I assume the aroma will go away in time, and it&#x27;s not bothersome now, but it is there.</li>
    <li> This is a great face brush. Didn&#x27;t feel to rough. Gives your skin a nice glow. Really works well for me.</li>
    <li> I got this brush with the intention of dry brushing my face, but the bristles are too hard and rough for delicate face skin. I do not have sensitive, delicate facial skin. I use gentle movements, still i cannot manage to bear the touch of this harsh brush. I washed the brush thinking that the bristles might turn a little softer, but they did not. I tried making it wet and use it in the shower with facial cleanser but its too harsh that way also (wet application). Its been sitting ever since i got it, as i cannot make it work.</li>
    <li> great purchase. Highly recommended. Love it</li>
    <li> I used this brush for the first time about 20 minutes ago in the shower. I started rubbing it on my face and i&#x27;m thinking &#x27;&#x27;this brush is great, it&#x27;s not too rough at all&#x27;&#x27;, then i heard a crack. I wasn&#x27;t sure what it was, but i checked the brush and saw a small crack on the side of it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if that happened just then or if the noise i heard came from something else and the brush was cracked all along. I went back to rubbing it on my face and then another crack... I checked the brush, there&#x27;s a crack on the other side too and i was sure that that wasn&#x27;t there a second ago. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, was i not supposed to let it get wet or something? I don&#x27;t know, a lot of people said in the reviews that they use it wet... It can&#x27;t be because i was too rough with it, that would break my face before it broke the brush, i was just gently rubbing it on my skin. I left the shower and left the brush on the counter, wrapped my head in a towel and... yes, heard another crack. Checked. Another crack on the brush. This product is a joke. There&#x27;s good chance that it is just popping open right now in the bathroom as i write this. Too bad, cause i actually really liked the feel and the affect of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great facial skin brush!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using a complexion brush with synthetic bristles in the shower and synthetic bristles take forever to dry.  In fact it usually takes well over 24 hours for my synthetic bristle complexion brush to dry after use in the shower which means by the time I try to use it the next day it&#x27;s still wet from the day before.  I was concerned that this trapped bacteria in the brush so I went searching for a natural bristle brush and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand &amp; easy to travel with because it doesn&#x27;t have a handle.  Measures about 3.5 inches x 2 inches so it fits nicely in your hand. Natural bristles means it dries very quickly after use compared to synthetic.  If like me you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin you can use this on your face as a DRY-SKIN brush only.  It&#x27;s a great travel body brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not soft enough for facial use. I found that it was too hard for a wet skin and would scratch my skin during washings, which meant I couldn&#x27;t use it for cleansing purposes on the face or neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  It&#x27;s nice to have a compact, easy to dry, body brush to travel with.  However I&#x27;ll be looking for something softer in natural bristles for my face (if that exists.)</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. I bought this brush to use as a body brush and not a complexion brush. The bristles are soft but effective and I had no skin issues following use. It was very effective, especially on my legs and I am  happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The Bernard Jensen complexion brush met my expectation.  Appears to be a good quality product.  I have used it twice since receiving it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body brush to use in my skin brushing routine . I can&#x27;t say enough about skin brushing and getting the proper brush to do it !!!</li>
    <li> The complexion brush is much softer than Dr. Jenson&#x27;s body brush and is useful for brushing sensitive areas of the skin. I like a good scratch with my body brush but I can imagine that some people with skin issues would prefer to just use the complexion brush as a full-body brush, as long as you can stand taking your time with the smaller size. (remember to use caution &amp; brush around broken skin)</li>
    <li> This is my second one. Love the natural bristles. Works perfectly. Comes with long handle that helps get to the hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. Would like softer bristles.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of times to get used to brushing my face, but the results are fast and I now do it several times a day.  My cheeks are becoming less &#x27;round&#x27; and someone told me my face looks slimmer.  Got to get to work on the rest of my body!</li>
    <li> Great face brush. Every time I use it (dry brush before showering, or in the morning after I wake up) it reinvigorates my face, and I feel more awake after using it. My complexion has improved so much that my roommate now wants to buy one as well.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I had one since I was 14 but after many years, it got a little out of shape!  This is great and will last forever!</li>
    <li> Seems a little too stiff for a complexion brush.  It&#x27;s harder then my body brush.</li>
    <li> Just started dry brushing and this is the perfect brush for my face-gentle enough but still gets results</li>
