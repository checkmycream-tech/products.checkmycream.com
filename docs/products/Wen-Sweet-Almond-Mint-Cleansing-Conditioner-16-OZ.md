<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I saw this infomercial on TV and I didn&#x27;t want to get sucked into being charged automatically for a new shipment every 3 months. So I ordered it from here so I could try it. My hair was color-treated and very damaged. My hair is also very thick and curly. I tried this the first day I got it and was amazed. Now only two uses later, I am having trouble finding my split ends that used to overpower my hair!!! It is a great product. My hair is sooo soft now and manageable, it also smells wonderful. You need to be careful not to use it as a leave-in if you are prone to greasy hair, but the product itself, when rinsed out did not leave a greasy feeling in my hair. I will definitely continue to buy this product. Unlike claims that you should not always shampoo your hair and just condition it that leave it feeling unclean, this product left my hair feeling very clean and feeling amazing.</li>
    <li> I really love Wen products, my favorite is the Sweet Almond Mint, it&#x27;s a great product to tame my curly gray hair, however, because of the price of Wen, I can&#x27;t always purchase it therefore, I started looking for a comparable product.  I found HAIR ONE at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, it is a cleansing conditioner that for me, works better than Wen and it&#x27;s only $11.99!  Give it a try, for $11.99 what have you got to lose.</li>
    <li> Okay, let me start off by saying that my hair extremely dry, brittle and weak. From years of relaxing and over-processing it with color treatments and relaxers, my hair had grown rough and unmanageable. Even when I would wash it with \\&quot;good\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner my hair would feel very rough after rinse out. Especially considering I had colored my hair black about a week earlier. After my first time using Wen, I noticed a BIG difference, it was great! My hair was straighter, less frizzy, a little more volume and it actually moved *shock*! It also had this radiant shine that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve EVER seen before which is a huge plus.     With each wash, I&#x27;m noticing that my hair is getting better with time.I did exactly what the instructions said, except I use a shower/plastic cap after application (30+ pumps) and leave it on for at least 10 minutes or more. After I rinse it out completely, I&#x27;ll add a few more pumps to my hair then massage and re-rinse (kind of like a rinse out conditioner). From there, I blow dry then curl with a Conair instant heat curling iron and apply oil sheen. I then brush and wrap my hair (and if it&#x27;s night time I&#x27;ll apply a silk scarf).     I don&#x27;t use Wen as a leave in conditioner anymore because it might be a little much for my hair. If your hair gets easily \\&quot;over-moist\\&quot; or oily, you may want to switch shampoos between using Wen every now and then. After my third wash, my hair is AMAZING. It&#x27;s so shiny, vibrant and silky that I&#x27;m thinking of getting a years supply. Considering what the conditioner has done, I can&#x27;t wait to see how the Wen Hydrating Mask does. If you are thinking about using it, try it! Even if you get the smallest size available see what this great conditioner can do for you and you hair.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the results - extremely soft and shiny hair, but she says it is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and it has truly improved the condition of my hair.  I not only get compliments on my hair all the time from total strangers about the cut but the cut would not look as good without the condition of my hair being what it is.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I thought it would be.  But, smells great and is a good leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and does what is advertised.  But- trust me- order individually- don&#x27;t get sucked into Guthy-Renker&#x27;s  automatic delivery.  I did that with another product and it took MONTHS and a lot of angry moments to get it canceled. I know it is more expensive that way- but, in the long run, you&#x27;ll thank me!!  I&#x27;ve only tried the Almond/Mint- but will probably order the set of smaller bottles just to try them- love the product- but, I have to say that I do shampoo every so often (about once a week works for me).  Even if you use it as a conditioner, you&#x27;ll love it.  I like to use about a dime size amount after rinsing it out as a leave in conditioner.  My hair holds the curl all day now- so soft- love it!</li>
    <li> My hair, which is shoulder length, prone to oil and fine, felt \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; from this shampoo.  That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it, it felt like it had been weighed down and was also dull and lackluster.  I was dissapointed, I was hoping I would like it!  I would not recommend for hair that&#x27;s prone to oil or fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the WEN system for a few weeks now and I was not impressed.  It does get your hair clean without shampoo but it is NOT worth the $30 for each month.  The first time you use it, it feel different, much like using any new shampoo/conditioner for the first time.  But after the second, third, etc it goes back to feeling like normal conditioner.  Don&#x27;t waste your $30, stick to your old stuff.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product and I used it for 2 weeks to make sure I see the result - but it did nothing for my hair. My hair is a little on the coarser side, it did not feel greasy or oily as other reviewers had, but it really made no difference whatsoever. And I did go through the bottle in 2 weeks, not sure how it is supposed to last you for a month? Then I tried my regular Pantene and actually it felt softer then Wen. Overall, it was not worth it for this price.</li>
    <li> I have a six year old with amazing curly red hair.  This Wen brings out the deep bronze accents and other subtle highlights like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen. Not only is her hair soft and tangle free, but it even looks better with Wen.  I have used Humectress, which is also good, but Wen is even better.  I love Amazon because I was able to buy it without the silly monthly contract that Wen tries to push on you.  Only thing is that there are so many variations on the Wen product, it took me awhile to find what I was looking for.  But this sweet almond mint conditioner is it.</li>
    <li> As many have said, if you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;re going to love the product, then definitely DON&#x27;T buy it from the Wen web site  As with most Guthy Renker products (like Proactiv), buying from the site means being locked into a kind of subscription. They claim you can get out of it easily, but I know it&#x27;s not that easy from my dealings with Proactiv (luckily, I love Proactiv so I do not mind being a subscriber). Anyway, I ordered the Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner from Amazon, after seeing the impressive infomercial for Wen on tv. The product works pretty much as well as any salon quality shampoo/conditioner. However, it takes a very long time to use it and you must use it in a very specific way to get it&#x27;s benefits. This entails wetting your hair, applying TONS and TONS of the product to your hair (if you only use a little, your hair will feel dirty and sticky), then wetting your hair again and combing the product through, THEN you have to rinse your hair for a very long time to make sure all the product is out. For these reasons, I would not buy the product again. Not so much because of the time it takes to use, but more because of the amount of product you must use. It&#x27;s just not cost effective. You can buy a high quality shampoo/conditioner for more money....and it will actually be more cost effective because you will use alot less of the product. I got my Wen about a week and a half ago and I am almost out.    Summary:     CONS &#x3D; takes a lot of time to use. You must use a TON of the product. Website locks you into a long term contract.  PROS&#x3D; Does not \\&quot;strip\\&quot; your hair like a regular shampoo. Works as well as a high quality salon shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after watching their info-mercial. She likes the product a lot and asked me to order more.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing conditioner! My hair is clean, shiny, managable, healthy. I used to receive it thru WEN but I only have to use so little of the product for such great results that it was being sent faster than I could use it. I was delighted to see that I could purchase it just 1 bottle at a time from Amazon at the same price! So I will be getting it thru Amazon.com from now on! Highly recommend you try it. The other products from WEN are great also!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find the Wen shampoo/conditioner to be effective at all. It was overly priced and under performs. Save your money!</li>
    <li> The first time I used product, my hair was noticably softer and I thought it was worth the wait and the money I spent. I used it the next day and could not rinse my hair enough to get the product out. My hair looked greasy. I cut back and still same problem. It turned out every time I used it, my hair looks awful. It looks flat and not very clean. I don&#x27;t like this product and I wish I never bought it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the almond mint cleansing shampoo for about 3 weeks now and I love it.  I switched back to my old shampoo once and noticed a big difference.  This stuff is amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t lather up, so I was a bit skeptical, but it cleans well, and I think my scalp is improving too.  I know my hair loves it.</li>
    <li> Wen smells fantastic and works, but the pump dispenser is AWFUL!  The last third of the bottle won&#x27;t come out using the pump.  It also explodes in my suitcase EVERY time I travel (with the pump mechanism locked).      I received this product as a Christmas gift and first tried it while at my parents&#x27; home in Ohio where the water is \\&quot;hard.\\&quot;  In that context Wen made my usually dry, curly hair look and feel greasy.  When I arrived home in Maryland, where the water is \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; my hair looked great.  I use a sulfate-free shampoo first to ensure that my hair feels clean, but Wen is a fabulous conditioner.</li>
    <li> I used the WEN hair cleanser approximately three times.  My hair felt great, smelled great, was bouncy (I have curly long hair).  HOWEVER... all of a sudden my entire face broke out, I was bright red and my entire face was itchy.  I didn&#x27;t know what it was, couldn&#x27;t pinpoint something I ate that was unusual or different.  After the third day of use, I stopped using WEN, used my regular shampoo (Dove), put a layer of Cortisone 10 all over my face, took 2 benadryl and went to bed.  I was itch-free the next morning and it hasn&#x27;t happened since.    SOOOO, the point is, the product itself was satisfactory to me (as a hair product) however, I believe I was allergic to something and cannot use it.   I gave it to a friend, she wasn&#x27;t too happy, she has oily hair (I don&#x27;t) and she said it left her hair very oily.</li>
    <li> I was most disappointed with this product.  I&#x27;ve heard about for a couple of years and decided to finally bite the bullet and make a purchase.  I chose the product for fine hair, cucumber mint.  The smell was fine but the sensation was amazing!  The mint really worked into my scalp and I found it invigorating.  My first try with the product was great.  As I said above, I have very fine hair, however I have a lot of it.  Unfortunately, after a week of using the conditioner, my fine hair was limp and oily.  I have never had oily hair in my life, so I was very disappointed.  Once the glee of the invigorating mint wore off, I was upset that I had spent so much money on one bottle of conditioner that was not even going to last me a month.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have naturally wavey hair that tends to become dry and frizzy. WEN Sweet Almond Mint has worked wonders for my hair. I would recommend it for anyone who has my type of hair.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing! my hair has never been more soft or shiny or has ever had so much bounce and volume to it  i love it and would recommend it to any of my friends!</li>
    <li> I have to agree; I fell for the infomercial, and at first, thought it was fantastic. My hair felt greasy at first, so I thought I needed to use more product. I kept adding more and more, and though I only wash my hair every other day, my 90-day supply would run out in less than 2 months. $30 a month is a lot of money; when it bumps up to $45, that&#x27;s ridiculous. Plus, I kept switching my formulas and the amount, hoping that I could find balance. I used Wen for over a year, and finally had to call to cancel. When I talked to the customer service rep and I told her how much I was using and how long my hair was, I swear she about passed out! She told me I needed to use LESS product than recommended because of my hair type (fine, and a LOT of it!). Tell me something... have any of you been told to use less, or is it all \\&quot;more more more\\&quot;?    Needless to say, after trying for over a year, and talking to a few customer service reps, I was done. The product really does make your hair soft, shiny, eliminates tangles, reduces hair loss in the shower, and I really wanted it to work for me, but I can&#x27;t afford to wash everyday and go through a 3-month supply in 1.5 months.     Expensive in it&#x27;s own right, Fekkai products can be found at Target and are awesome. I bought the travel package containing shampoo, conditioner and glossing creme for $25, and that lasted me over 3 months. $8/month vs. $45/month? The choice is simple.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie. I have very coarse,curly,long,gray but colored hair. I tried many thngs and this has been the best. I found when I used something else my hair was not the same. No you do not have to use the massive amount of pumps, i use about 10. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s time comsuming at all. I wet my hair, put on the cleanser and finish therest of my shower. By the time I wash and shave, i rinse out and apply a small amount to leave in and I&#x27;m done. I have found though that the way to purchase is through their website. I just placed my order this morning after checking on Amazon. I got 3 bottles for $63 when on amazon one bottle is $41. You can customize your shipment so you recieve what you want when you want it. It doesn&#x27;thave to be automatic but it does cost less. Give this product a try I even use a little on my 4 year olds hair and it is somuch more manageable. Happy cleansing!!</li>
    <li> to do the regimine as directed is pretty time consuming for those of us on the go. the product smelled awesome but honestly the results were no different than if I used a cheap conditioner on my hair without regular shampooing first.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 30 day trial from their site, not knowing Amazon had it.  On the invoice, it says they are sending my auto-refill (WHICH I DIDN\\&quot;T SIGN UP FOR) in under 3 weeks!  I wrote them and said I would stop payment and refuse package.  Ticks me off that I&#x27;m angry (and I genuinely have a a heart problem)about  a product that seems really good.  I hate being tricked! If they do not send auto-refills, I&#x27;ll re-order.  If they do, I&#x27;ll never use it again and they won&#x27;t get another cent from me!   Lesson learned:  check Amazon first.</li>
    <li> When my 30 day supply ran out after 2 weeks with only using 4-5 pumps for each wash (instead of the recommended 15 pumps per section of hair) I did some research on the internet and found out that Wen is equal to plain old Conditioner.  In fact some of the consumers on the net reported that the cheaper the Conditioner, the better it was for your hair.  So, for 2 weeks I used Suave conditioner and had the same exact results as the Wen.  Save yourself a huge amount of money and use Suave conditioner for under $2 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the sweet almond mint or the tea tree conditioning rinse for about three months now and in general I am happy with both products and would buy again. Here is why these products did/did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me-&lt;br /&gt;long blond hair (mid back)&lt;br /&gt;have been highlighting every 2-3 months for 10+ years&lt;br /&gt;oily scalp (wash my hair every other day)&lt;br /&gt;drier &amp; damaged hair from my chin on down&lt;br /&gt;use curling iron 3x week&lt;br /&gt;rarely use blow drier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioning rinse pro&#x27;s-&lt;br /&gt;Left my hair visibly softer looking, less fly-aways and smooth to the touch&lt;br /&gt;Hair felt hydrated and easy to manage&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant fragrance (not over powering)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s-&lt;br /&gt;After using several washes in a row, noticed that my hair seemed weighed down (limp) no matter how much I rinsed it out&lt;br /&gt;Even though scalp wasn&#x27;t visibly oily, felt oily and unclean after multiple washes without a separate shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Too heavy to use as a leave in treatment, hair lost its fullness and bounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So although I think this is a great product in general, it won&#x27;t completely replace occasional (every other wash) shampoo use for me. It also doesn&#x27;t replace a deep conditioning treatment which is a must for bleached hair especially in the summer. I would recommend this product to people who have dry hair/dry scalp.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I tried the cleansing conditioner for a week.  It was an absolute failure. It left the hair looking dull  (not shiny and soft as the adds state) and it got very greasy in less than 24 hours. Repeated washing with the product did not improve the results. The styling cream left white small residue.  It sounds like a good idea but the the products don&#x27;t delivered what the adds promised. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This product is a scam; it is not for \\&quot;all hair types\\&quot; as they advertise....! Unless you have extrememly frizzy, dry, brittle, and/or chemically-treated hair, you should NOT buy this! I have normal healthy hair and the product just made it limp and greasy; after getting out of the shower I felt like I had not even washed it in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product and eliminate the huge amounts of bottles of different shampoos and conditioners.  I faithfully attempted to use the product for 4 days in a row.  By the morning on the 5th day, looking like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week. I decided to wash my hair with regular shampoo and use the Wen as conditioner.  Still resulted in greasy feeling hair.  I am now back to using old faithful Pantene and it seems like the Wen will never wash out completely.  I called and canceled before the 90 day order ships, which, is on the commercial, so be careful!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift.  Person said he might as well be using conditioner to wash his hair with, that it seems to be nothing more than sweet-smelling glycerine.  [[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim, but after reading through the reviews, I started regretting my \\&quot;whim\\&quot;. I really thought it was probably a gimmick. Even after I received it in the mail, I thought I might return it. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to get my hair to feel and look healthy. I&#x27;ve tried Kerastase which is expensive and supposed to be great. It didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. My hair has always been dry, slightly frizzy with breakage. I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint and Pomegranate duo. I&#x27;ve tried both of them now and my hair has never felt better!! I followed the directions and right away I could tell a drastic difference. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. The difference is amazing. It feels healthy, looks healthy. It&#x27;s soft and shiny, but not oily or greasy. In fact it feels really clean. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Wen is very good for my hair.  At first I think I was not using the product right, but now I comb it through my hair, and take my time and then thoroughly rinsing the product out of my hair, and my hair is finally managable-- after a perm that was very hard on my hair.</li>
    <li> When I first started using it, I thought it was OK although my hair felt heavy after washing with it and didn&#x27;t particularly look good. After a month of using it I realized it actually had DRIED my hair out! My hairdresser asked me what I was using and said it was ruining my hair. Now I just use Kiehl&#x27;s and my hair is back to normal, soft and shining.</li>
    <li> First off, I have extremely fine, thin hair....in fact, so fine and thin that I pay big bucks for great lengths hair extensions which gives me the full look that I want.  I also dye my hair a bright blonde from a mousy brown/blonde.  I struggled with finding a shampoo/conditioner that would suit both my extensions and naturally fine hair. After about 3 years of experimenting, I found one I particularly like which is Aveda for dry/damaged hair...it also has all natural ingredients and is devoid of any sulfates.  I decided recently to try Wen just to find out whether Aveda could actually be trumped and after a few washes, I&#x27;m pretty impressed!!!!  My hair, which needs to be washed daily (or it really has a horrible greasy look) is beautiful, lush, SHINY, and the color seems less brassy.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and do another review but SO FAR SO GOOD!!!  I would review this product as great!  It is pretty expensive and I have been using 40 pumps per wash so who knows, I may have to alternate with Aveda but I really love the bounce, lightness, color, shine, and softness of my oh so difficult hair!!</li>
    <li> I have very soft and fine hair. Recently, reaching midle age, my hair starts to get thinning and lost so much hair in the shower, and start going bald. I decide to search for the perfect shamppoo and hair condition. I had tried many such as Fekkai, Joico, Pureology, Chi. Chi is the best however, my hair don&#x27;t feel clean with Chi. So I decided to give Wen a tried. I had only use this 2 times and it is amazing. My hair feels clean. No hair falls out at the shower. The next day, my hair still feel clean, not oily. It makes my hair feel soft look like those commercial model :}. From now on, only Wen will be for my hair. The search is over!!!</li>
    <li> This product changes the way I clean my hair. It is expensive. But, I rarely get split ends any more and my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> After seeing the infomercials, and reading reviews I was very interested in trying this! After using it for a few weeks, sadly, I did not see the results I was looking for. I diligently followed the instructions, and even went online for other tips. In the end, it just made my hair dull and greasy looking.   It is certainly worth a try though, I guess it all depends on the type of hair you have.</li>
    <li> Since I began using Wen my hair has improved immensly.  I am so happy I decided to try it.  It is expensive, but I have short hair and use 4-5 pumps.  It does last a long time.  I prefer the Sweet Almond Mint although I have tried others.  And using one product instead of 2 (shampoo and conditioner) is great!  I prefer purchasing this item on Amazon.com rather than other websites because the price is better and I get my order quickly!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST! I get mine from Amazon (no clubs to join) I get SO many compliments on my hair! Come on folks! I&#x27;m 58 with waist length hair! Yes, I even touch up the roots with color to cover the \\&quot;shimmers\\&quot; and guess what? I STILL get told I have hair \\&quot;...as soft and shiny as a child&#x27;s!\\&quot; Can&#x27;t beat that with a stick! I have never had to deal with any \\&quot;build - up\\&quot;. (But then I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day - it would never dry!) Just use the Shampoo/Conditioner (with a pump for a leave-in) and I&#x27;m off. Sometimes I use a little Texture Balm on my bangs, but that&#x27;s it. My hair combs out so nice and pretty and SO easy! Used to be an ordeal! Now it is a piece of cake! I could go on and on, but let&#x27;s say - my Dearly Beloved isn&#x27;t after me to cut my hair anymore, because he doesn&#x27;t have to fight the tangles anymore - no tangles to fight - in fact - I can comb it out myself! He just gives it the final smoothing comb before I braid it before bed. It&#x27;s great! I Love it!</li>
    <li> I, like many others, bought this item with high hopes.  I did like that it made my hair manageable to comb through when I got out of the shower, however my hairdresser said this same solutions could be achieved with wax.  Which, essentially is what this product did to my hair. It coated it with a waxy buildup like stuff that was on every strand.  My hairdresser was literally scrapping the stuff off my hair when she was cutting it.  I went to the hair salon thinking my ends were really damaged and needed trimming, when in fact it was this Horrid shampoo that I had used to 3 weeks. It dried out my hair and made my scalp greasy and the rest of my hair like frizzy-dry-horse hair.  Terrible.  The product smelled very nice, however,I am now back to using my previous product (Matrix Sleek and Shine) which I am Very happy with.</li>
    <li> The first several weeks I used this it worked great but then I noticed that my hair was starting to look greasy. I have dry hair and so only wash it 1-2 times per week and use dry shampoo in between as needed so I thought this would be great for my hair. I tried using the amount they recommended the first time but quickly realized I only needed 1/2 or less of that. And because I had so much of it (the website deal) and the second batch came before I could cancel, I started using it every other or every 3rd shampoo. It works okay that way, still gets greasy eventually and the point was not to have to buy other products. I finally gave up after several months. Customer service for the Wen website is a pain to maneuver and even though I cancelled I got stuck with quite a bit of the stuff. I took the opportunity when we moved to dump it. [[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]</li>
    <li> I was so hoping that I had found the product I needed.  I have alot of health issues and making shower duty easier would have been beneficial.  I read all the directions and lots of reviews on this product.  The manufacturer says to use quite a bit of the product - 24 pumps (not economical) for my hair(which is fine, but fairly thick, goes just below my shoulders.  It is also mildly oily on top but dry every where else.) And if you have problems especially with it looking oily it says to use more of the product not less, \\&quot;the more the better.\\&quot; Some reviewers, however, said they needed to use less.  I&#x27;ve followed the directions to a T and also did it other ways.  And rinsed thoroughly.  Each time my hair came out extremely dry and itchy on top and from about the middle of the back of my head all the way down to the ends, it came out extremely oily(looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair back there in weeks).  The only good thing I can say is that it did give me some body and made my hair somewhat curly but I&#x27;d rather have hair that looks clean than hair that looks like dirty curls.  My mom&#x27;s suppose to try it too.  She has really thin hair that goes to her shoulders and is oily.  We&#x27;ll see what happens and I&#x27;ll try to update about that.  I&#x27;ve heard others say they love it but for me it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT for ethnic hair. I bought this for my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. It was the worst EVER!!!! While I am shampooing her hair, it feels silky, but after I rinsed it out...felt like solid wood...harsh, brass, and very stiff! I was so disappointed. I had to wash it several times after that experience, before it came back to life.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Amazon to try it out...Success! Now I&#x27;ll join the mail order club. I have thin, straight long, hair that has fly aways. Trying many shampoos, and having moderate luck with Aveda and Paul Mitchele, this is better. Most conditioners weigh down my thin hair and make it oily overnight. I followed the directions to the letter with Wen and it left my hair felling great and shiny! After the first try it is soft like children&#x27;s hair. can&#x27;t wait to try WEN&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> After using this product for over a year, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this product makes a great conditioner, but you still need traditional shampoo. Using just WEN all the time will leave build up in your hair that can&#x27;t be cleaned unless you wash with shampoo. Use a shampoo without the harsh chemical and use WEN as your conditioner.</li>
    <li> You can achieve the same results of using this product just by using more traditional conditioner.  Secondly, if you order this product off tv you are signing up for a \\&quot;club\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll keep receiving the product after your initial order and the money will be charged to your credit card monthly, this is not made clear.  The total cost was also not made clear.</li>
    <li> I have bad hair days everyday and was hoping that this product would transform my hair into a thing of beauty.  I was disappointed.      I have thick, dried out, curly, hair that is totally unmanagable.  I bought this after having wanted to try it for a while (the price is what scared me), but after reading many reviews both good and bad, I decided to give it a try.  I waited a month for it to change my hair into these soft, gorgeous curls - it never happened.     It works fine as a shampoo - it cleans, but if you are hoping for a transformation (like they say in the infomercials), don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> This product was such a let down. I was hooked after getting sucked into the infomercial. It sounded like a great concept so I caved in and paid the outrageous price only to find that it left me with greasy, oily hair. Stay away!</li>
    <li> I tried this, didn&#x27;t think so much of it, but gave it two weeks and noticed then the difference.  I am totally gray, which I color, very thick, coarse, curly/clumpy wavy type hair texture.  years of coloring of course needs lots of help to look healthy and shiny.  Even though the price and how much you have to use is not good, too high priced, and use so much of it with each washing, lasts about a month or less for me as I do not have to wash my hair more than 2x wk, as older and oils gone, very dry scalp. The longer between washings, the better my hair looks, believe it or not.   I still use other very good non- silicone, non sulfate type products for leave in conditioner, and anti frizz product/which I buy from a Canada hair stylist.    But now, I use Wen for all my shampooing and conditioning, as it really has helped the dryness of my hair type and does look shiny.  Most average persons will not buy or continue to buy because of the price, but as long as I can, will continue, as I do not have to buy regular conditioner anymore as wen eliminates that step.  I have found sweet almond the best for my hair type even though it says good for fine to medium hair.  Mine is the thickest and frizziest, and coarsest hair/sweet almond is great on my hair.  I buy it here on Amazon.com whenever I need it.  Dont have to buy into the wen program that way, and better price than ebay/which you do not know what you are getting...look out...  love this wen. I have a great hairdresser but even she doesnt know or has never heard of this product...too bad...</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen Conditioning Cleanser for over a year now and love it!  My hairdresser noticed a difference in how much more hair I had and I no longer need intensive moisturizing treatments when I get my hair highlighted.  I find that I don&#x27;t lose as much hair when I brush it as well.  I have recommended this product to all my friends and they all love it too!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have dry coarse thick blonde hair.  I have been using this product since October of 2009 and I have yet to have a bad hair day.  If I had one complaint it would be that they don&#x27;t send you enough product to last the 90 days and ordering/shipping times are awful.  But that aside, it is worth the wait.  If the product weighs your hair down you need to call them and have the kind switched to one that works for your hair.    I for SURE give this a 5 star!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo with some hesitation.  I am so pleased!  I have thin, oily hair that is very damaged.  This shampoo has been a huge help and now this is my shampoo of choice!  I am so glad I took a chance on it!</li>
    <li> Hey everyone!  So I bought Wen sweet Almond mint cleansing conditioner here on amazon.  Anyway, I was really excited and couldn&#x27;t wait until I receive it...I opened the package and I was like \\&quot;wooohoo!! I get to try the conditioner tonight\\&quot;.  But yeah, anyway, as I said I was really excited about it...so I washed my hair with it, I actually did apply 16-24 pumps of it to my hair because i hava long, thick hair...I was happy with the results!! My hair was super shiny!!! Like never, and it was soft and everything, much easier to manage.  I usually straighten or curl my hair, but we all know that the heat would mess our hair up...and thats what happen to me because I keep using that stuff...because my hair doesn&#x27;t look good if I don&#x27;t do anything extra with it.  It got frizzy and extra wavy due to the heat from the straightener and curling iron...but now I&#x27;m good..I washed my hair with it for the second time and it looks just fine.  When I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I will get another one for sure.  And most people say that wen cleansing conditioners make ur hair all greasy and stuff...that didn&#x27;t happen to me.  Make sure u rinse it well and you will be just fine.  The stuff is amazing, I think.  I just don&#x27;t like the price. It&#x27;s quite expensive!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick and long.  Shampoo would only make it frizzy.  WEN is a perfect solution; she loves it.</li>
    <li> A 16 oz bottle lasted me one month (I have thick hair that falls just below my chest). Did I think this was a the holy grail product for hair? No. However it did make my hair look my healthy. Usually if I wash my hair and let it air dry with regular shampoo and conditioner my hair looks super big and frizzy. With the WEN Cleansing Conditioner I was able to let my hair air dry and it looked shiny and wavy. It felt soft too. The only things I didn&#x27;t like about the product is that it made my hair more oily (which can be fixed by spraying on dry shampoo), so I had to wash it more often. It was also a bit pricey to only last one month.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of products for my hair. I even spent $62 for a bottle of hydrating shampoo that didnt do anything for my hair.Wen did wonders for my dry hair. Its better to order through amazon than from Wen website because they will charge you and send you refills every month.</li>
    <li> I just started my 4th bottle of WEN and noticed right away that it&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s not as thick and it looks and smells different. Ingredients listed are the same. I like the original stuff - will have to see what this formulation does for my hair. This just seems sneaky to me.</li>
    <li> Gave this more than a fair shot to make a difference in my dry, processed hair.  After 4 months of use, there&#x27;s really no difference than with using other hydrating products.  It worked fine but at the price, I was expecting a difference.  So for me, just not worth paying so much more.</li>
    <li> I always like to try new things and have watched the info commercials for a long time. Decided to order. I thought I would never spend this much money on a hair product but I was not disappointed. I have very fine hair that is always limp no matter what I have tried. I loved the way it made my hair feel and bounce. I reordered after being without for about 2 months and believe me I have missed it. Can not wait until it arrives again!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not knowing what to expect. I highlight and blow dry my hair so it has begun to dry out, much more so than when I was younger. My hair has always been very healthy but again, processing and age have taken a toll on its shine and luster. After the first use of Wen Sweet Almond Cleansing Conditioner my hair not only was softer, but much more manageable.  It had more bounce and shine as well. I have found that even with substancial rinsing, it can leave the crown of my hair a bit oily looking.  Every other day or so I use a small amount of regular shampoo just at the scalp, rinse and then apply the Wen product and rinse again.  Overall I am very happy with this product and believe it does exactly what the creater states. I have chin length thick hair and only require about 10 pumps of the product as opposed to the 16 or more it recommends.  I would only order it from Amazon so I could control when and how much I order.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;ve seen all the before and after pictures and yes, I&#x27;m always skeptical of these things but being fed up with most everything else I&#x27;ve tried, I decided to give this product a try.  I must admit all the models appear to have styled hair and I am older and graying and I don&#x27;t fuss with my hair.  I wash and go.  When this cleanser/conditioner arrived, I tied putting some in my thin, wavy, somewhat dry, frizzy hair and immediately my hair seemed softer and more tamed.  No I didn&#x27;t have the same look as the styled models with perfectly smooth hair but I liked what the product did for my hair and also that it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I was surprised because my hair soaked it in and it felt like I hadn&#x27;t put anything in it.  Because my hair is fine, I have bad luck with products and some shampoos--as most everything I&#x27;ve ever tried is too heavy.  Another thing I dislike is hair products which leave a lingering fragrance.  Wen does not leave any aura of fragrance and my hair is more smooth, soft and much more shiny. The next two days I shampooed with it and the difference was visible to me.  Through my 50+ years, I&#x27;ve never tried anything which resulted in my hair looking and feeling as it does now.  It will be interesting to see the results in the winter as my hair reacts strongly to the weather, fuller, frizzy in the summer and lifeless in the winter. Also, I tried Aveda smoothing shampoo and hated it.  My hair came out smoother but dull and dry.</li>
    <li> My hair felt healthier in just one application and gets better with each use.  Make sure you use enough product and use a comb in the shower for better distribution thru-out your hair.  I can&#x27;t wait to try another scent!</li>
    <li> Oh well, so much for the excitement. I was so happy to get my hands on this product (which is not easy in Europe). Fist wash - OK, slightly limp hair, but clean and nice smelling (I followed instructions to the letter). Second and third washes - even limper hair and irritated scalp, brrr (took two weeks to calm it down, had to use ayurvedic oils). I guess it was too much to hope for an \\&quot;all-natural product\\&quot; - WEN does contain alcohol, perfume, heavy salts, etc... I think I may use it occasionally in-between regular washes, or as conditioner only (not leave-in).[[ASIN:B001D4FF66 WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16 oz]]</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I saw this on an infommercial with soap stars...That said, I have a long-standing belief that there is no such thing as shampoo/conditioner.  I bought it anyway.  WOW.  Use A LOT less than they suggest.  Also, I prefer to use one pump with my conditioner or as leave in conditioner and find that it REALLY tames frizz and flyawsys better than anything I could imagine.  I also used on my cats when one got skunked because the cat/baby shampoos didn&#x27;t smell good and the cats have never looked or smelled better.  This stuff is AWESOME.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of the reviews.  I did not see the infomercial.  I tried it and thought okay my hair is softer.  I can pretty much get the same appearance with shampoo, conditioner (leave in), and freeze eez (sp?).  Then I saw the infomercial and thought that is impossible.  I can&#x27;t imagine having that outcome.  I have past shoulder length hair and it is naturally wavy.  If I straigten it I get little fly aways.  The girls on the commercial look like they have had there hair straigtened for an hour but the pamphlet that comes with the product says do not use straiteners or blow dryers without the plastic protector.  I agree with the other comments it smelled nice and made my hair softer but it certainly wasn&#x27;t life changing.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product would be a miracle solution for my hair which is thin, textured and naturally curly. However, after receiving my product along with a booklet from Wen detailing which cleansers are best for which hair types, I learned that I should have purchased the fig tree oil cleanser instead of the sweet almond mint. The sweet almond is intended for thin, fine hair whereas the fig is for curly textured hair like mine. I wish I had not wasted my money on something not intended for my hair. The upside is that with the combo of things i use to keep my naturally curly, people are asking me what i use in my hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe this product is wrong for my type of hair.  My hair is fine, colored and highlighted. It leaves my hair feeling a bit gunky, even though I rinse it [[ASIN:B001D4FF66 WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16 oz]]well.  I like to use this product only after I have washed and conditioned my hair with other products, just a little more than a pea size in my palm to massage and leave in.  I was very hopeful after seeing an infomercial on TV.</li>
    <li> Shampooing and coloring for years left my hair wiry and dull.  I found that I had to shampoo and condition at least every other day to get any type of hair performance that I wanted AND it still looked kind of dull.  I&#x27;ve tried everybody&#x27;s products (recommended by my stylist, recommended by friends, promises-promises).  I find that I can use the Wen product, as directed - remember to RINSE, RINSE, RINSE - and only have to wash my medium length hair every 4 or 5 days.  Takes and keeps a style, shines, is soft, hasn&#x27;t been wiry except for the last time I had my hair done and the stylist washed my hair with well know \\&quot;spa-quality\\&quot; shampoo that they use.  The difference was noticeable after the first wash.  I&#x27;m hooked.  And I&#x27;m saving money because I don&#x27;t have to use it often.  Definitely buy through Amazon, even if the infomercial auto-delivery wasn&#x27;t a scam, they would send it out far too often and you&#x27;d get a back log.  Amazon delivers within a day or two, you won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Sceptical because of the cost factor, but curious as to whether it would make much of a difference over shampoo, I took the plunge.     Not thrilled with the cool water washing, but I am a firm believer in treating my hair/body with loving kindness; so I do what is suggested.    Definitely am pleased the way my hair feels after cleansing versus shampooing, and leaving the cleanser/conditioner in after the cleansing process is a plus.    I am a black woman with very short (1/16th\\&quot;) hair; so any evidence of split ends is noticeable immediately. In fact, it looks as if I stuck my finger in an electrical outlet when I use shampoo.    With Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, I no longer have that \\&quot;electric shock\\&quot; look and can wash and air dry my hair without using a doo-rag to hold any strays flat. No split ends and the volume it gives my hair allows me to cut more making my haircuts last longer.    I really do like this product as well as the body oil and styling lotion. Scent is nice as well.     Next order I shall try one of the cleansers for ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> My brother and i bolth used it his hair looks great and feels clean. my hair on the other hand turns out oily like i havent washed it in a few days. I tried using less product and then more even rinsing my hair longer it still turned out oily. It works really well for my brother though. It just depends on the person. I wouldent recomend it for people with oily hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry curly hair that doesn&#x27;t hold color very long so when I saw the infomercial I was soooo excited!! I ordered it right away and couldn&#x27;t wait. It actually made my hair dryer than it was....who knew that was possible and took all the shine right out of it. I felt like there was a wax in my hair that I couldn&#x27;t get out. Even my co-workers asked if I was OK as it looked like I had stopped washing my hair. Needless to say I called to cancel my other orders as I had done the special introduction rate where they keep sending you sample until YOU CALL to cancel. What a huge hassel. I canceled and they went ahead and sent it anyway. Then I had to deal with sending it back and getting my money back...by the way they don&#x27;t give you shipping back. Even if it&#x27;s their fault! Please be very very warry.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of discrepancy about this product, which means it obviously works differently for everyone. I rated it 5 stars because it works for me, but don&#x27;t go off of my or ANYone&#x27;s review for a promise as to what it will do for your hair. Try it yourself.I used this product for the first time last night and had mixed feelings at first:    First off, it was hard to coax the product out of the pump. It&#x27;s a lot thicker than it seems, so just be diligent and eventually it will come out.     Next, the smell. Not the greatest. The \\&quot;sweet almond mint\\&quot; is basically no sweet almond and all mint. It reminds me of a hospital for some reason. Yet, not altogether gross.     Next there&#x27;s the amount. A lot of people are complaining about having to use so many \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; of product. Keep in mind that this product doesn&#x27;t lather, so it takes more to coat your hair than a small bit of regualar shampoo that turns into bubbles. I have very fine, shoulder length hair. I started with ten pumps, worked it through, and felt that my hair wasn&#x27;t quite saturated yet. I ended up at around 20 pumps when I felt that my hair was completely (but not too) saturated. Keep in mind, too, that a \\&quot;pump\\&quot; isn&#x27;t as much as you might be thinking (remember, the product is reluctant to come out).    Rinsing. This part had me worried. When I usually rinse my hair after conditioning, it&#x27;s easy to run my fingers through and feels nice and silky. This time, it felt like I just dumped wax all over my head. I could not comb through it at all, and it felt rubbery and gross...    ...BUT...    ...when I combed through with a brush after drying my hair, it was soft, tangle free, and felt light and clean! When it was fully dry, it was gorgeous! It was shiny, soft, held style well, and felt healthy. I&#x27;ve been worried that my thin hair was too thin and too damaged... it wouldn&#x27;t behave like it used to. Now, my hair is healthy and behaves the way it should!</li>
    <li> I saw the infomercial and read the reviews about Wen Cleansing Conditioner.  Since I have medium length, medium thickness wavy hair that always seems to make me look like a witch, I bought this.  My hope was to smooth out my hair and give it a bit more control.  Instead my hair ended up heavy and greasy, like it was coated with something.  I only used about 10-12 pumps (less than 30-40 recommended), so maybe I didn&#x27;t clean my hair thoroughly.  I&#x27;ll try it again this weekend (I can&#x27;t go to work with greasy hair like that).    Based on my experience, I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes ur hair feel soft and smooth and healthy, i wish it would lather.</li>
    <li> I must say that even though I read both the negative and positive reviews of Wen on Amazon, I still purchased the product from the infomercial. Well, I didn&#x27;t really like the results. My hair is thin and curly naturally. My hair did feel a lot softer in the shower within minutes, but while it dried afterwards, I noticed it become limp and almost oily. I continued to use it for a few weeks to give it a chance and no change. I&#x27;m sure for some hair types it&#x27;s a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product, but it did nothing for me. I ended up canceling my future orders and sending my unused portions to a friend.</li>
    <li> This product does everything that it claims.  I was stunned at the results. My hair was fine &amp; limp,kinda oily but dry on the ends but NOT ANYMORE MORE! My hair has movement, it looks very young now (I&#x27;m 40)   I use to wear extentions because I really want beautiful long bouncy hair but since I&#x27;ve used Wen I don&#x27;t want to put my extentions in because my hair has so much movement &amp; looks so fresh. My hair is about to my bra strap in the back so thats kinda long but it was so thin &amp; lifeless but it is so nice now and its even thicker! I had a baby one year ago &amp; after I had her my hair fell out, I&#x27;m so thankful for this product and I know as I keep using Wen that my hair will continue to get better &amp; better as it grows. I will have gorgeous hair by Christmas (that&#x27;s the plan)    I have a page on Amazon and anyone can contact me at anytime. I am a stay home mom and not affiliated with Wen in anyway. I&#x27;m just a customer that finally found a hair product that makes a difference. It has truly changed my hair and I hope you love it as much as I do.  Thanks for listening:-)</li>
    <li> I should have read reviews instead of just looking at the stars prior to my purchase. What a complete waste of money.      I tried it for a week and my hair looked and felt super dirty/greasy.    I bought some stuff at the store to take all the old products out of my hair &amp; tried Wen again.  Thought maybe I had too much product build up on my hair and wanted to give it a fair chance.     I used Wen for another week.  My hair was just as dirty &amp; greasy as the 1st week I used it.    Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I liked my previous haircare routine, but I had to change due to work and my new location.  I&#x27;m in dentistry and my long hair (even though its up) is subjected to a lot of saliva spray.  I need to wash it everyday, but my hair was getting dry (in addition to more exposure to sun since we also moved). So I gave wen a try.  At first I did not like it because my hair was so soft I couldn&#x27;t even get it in a ponytail.  In addition my naturally wavy hair seemed a bit flat.  However, as I continued to use wen and tweaked the amount I used and how I used the styling cream, now I really like it. It works great if you blowdry everyday, but I only blowdry maybe once a week. I like that I can now wash my hair everyday and it won&#x27;t look like straw.  If it starts to look oily at the scalp, I use extra pumps there.  But I have hair past my shoulders and I use 4 pumps per section, plus a couple extra at the scalp if needed.  I think everyone has to figure out what number of pumps works for them.  Now, the 16oz bottle is not gone yet, but I&#x27;m thinking it will last 6 weeks.  I also use the styling cream which helps give my hair some of the waves back.  I am now going to try the pomade next.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;m 58 years old and in the midst of menopause and hair loss is part of it.  Wen has actually slowed down the hair loss - I don&#x27;t know how, but it has.  It smells wonderful and my hair is soft and manageable.  I use quite a bit less than they recommend because my hair is fine - 10 pumps to their recommended 16.        Thanks for creating such a great and healthy-for-my-hair product!</li>
    <li> I was curious about this product, but didn&#x27;t want to by from sellers website until I knew it did what it claimed. The product smells really good, but I didn&#x27;t feel a huge difference.  I have curly hair so I don&#x27;t know if works as well on my type of hair.  I&#x27;m glad I followed the advice from someone who wrote in and bought the single portion instead of bying continuous package from his website.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and the amount of product they recommend (8 pumps on 4 parts of your hair) is ridiculous.  I went through the bottle (with an every other day cleansing) in 2 weeks!  Not only that but I didn&#x27;t see the amazing results that they advertise.  In fact, my hair became a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the idea.  I even fell for the hype surrounding the product.  However, it did not live up to my expectations.  It&#x27;s a nice refreshing hair product, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the $$$.  There are so many more things out there that do the same job for a lot less.  If you don&#x27;t mind paying the $$$, you might like it.  I didn&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> A family member of mine is the ultimate infomerical junkie...some times it&#x27;s a miss, but Wen Cleansing Conditioner is a HIT!!! I have never really had a problem with my hair, so I thought. I have fine hair, but a ton of it. I live in the south and if you can&#x27;t get volume naturally you just roll, spray and set...haha! This custom will work, but you will also have dry hair from all the hairspray, heat and start looking like pageant hair fast!! Great for the late 80&#x27;s, but not for 2010. After using Wen the first time I was SOLD. Then my sister used it and was sold. Then our friends tried our supply and were sold. My hair is bouncy, shinny, full of volume with NO products applied to it. Now I have natural volume! And I hardly have to use hairspray now. I no longer have knots straight out of the shower and I can go 3 days without washing my hair. The biggest winner was with my 3 1/2 year old and her long curly hair that always has BIG KNOTS...I hated washing her hair because she would scream when trying to comb out her knots even with a ton of conditioner on it. Wen has been my savior with her. We call it her special \\&quot;Candy Shampoo\\&quot; due to the great smell. All her knots just fall out, her hair isn&#x27;t dry anymore, it&#x27;s bouncy, beautiful and I can go 2 days without knots coming back. THANK YOU!!! I have only tried the Sweet Almond Mint, but I just purchased the Lavender. I hope my two cents helped and you like Wen as much as I do...</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for anything, but I purchased the Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner for my 5-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair (she has long blonde hair that gets very dry from daily shampooing/blow drying). The order here on Amazon came to $38 and change, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn&#x27;t need to use as many pumps as the product lists. Although her hair is to the middle of her back I didn&#x27;t have to use too much of the product: I get her hair wet, put several pumps on her scalp and massage that around and down toward the nape of her neck, take a few more pumps and run that through her hair to the ends and clip her hair up to give her the rest of her bath. Then I unclip her hair and rinse it 2-3 times and that&#x27;s it - no need for conditioner. I towel dry her hair and blow-dry it lightly. Her hair is just beautiful, looks very healthy, and smells FABULOUS - very clean and fresh. I was skeptical when I saw the infomercials, but after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon I decided to try it for her hair. It&#x27;s very gentle because it has no sodium laurel sulfate (the sudsing detergent in most shampoos) and it looks like hand cream when it comes out of the bottle. I now wash her hair every other day and all I use on her hair is Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.    If you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that won&#x27;t dry out your hair, or even better, if you&#x27;re looking for a one-step haircare product, Wen Sweet Almond Cleansing Conditioner is for you (because you can also add a small amount to wet hair as a leave-in conditioner). It&#x27;s well worth the money.    Signed, Very Happy Former Skeptic</li>
    <li> This product promised to help keep your color longer. It turned my highlights and all-over color brassy on day one. When my colorist read the ingredients, she said the first five were all known color lifters.</li>
    <li> I have waited a few months to write this review because I really wanted to see how this cleanser would stand up over continued use.  I can say my hair feels and looks good, but any better than my usual shampoo, it probably is just slightly better.  My hair seems less frizzy on some days but that&#x27;s about it.  I didn&#x27;t get the phenomenal jaw dropping transformation as in the infomercial--but I didn&#x27;t expect that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband does use a bit of my Wen shampoo for his hair and it has eliminated his dandruff (he has a very short shave).  Wen does not dry out the scalp like other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this cleanser is the killer--you  must use so much to even get your hair somewhat saturated (I would say I use 13 pumps to conserve and I have shoulder length hair)--so I don&#x27;t even use the recommended amount.  Not sure you have to, I am sure it is for Wen to just make more money.  After my bottle is out I am going to splurge on some Aveda shampoo/conditioner which I previously thought was too expensive, but now realize it is a steal compared to Wen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is if you have a lot of extra money and want a subtle improved difference in your hair compared to salon brands, then go for it.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of going natural, with about 2 inches of new-growth of kinky/coarse (I guess 4a/b hair). I have tried several different products and this one has worked the best.  I was a little skeptical at first, but I figured I would give it a try.  I noticed a difference even after the first use, my hair was more manageable after each wash.  I am also very choosy about the smells that I put in my hair, and the Sweet Almond mint smells good, I haven&#x27;t tried the other scents yet. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I just got the product and used it for the first time yesterday. I&#x27;m Asian and my hair come down about 4 inches from my shoulder. Before I used it I thought it would make my hair greasy but it didn&#x27;t. Your hair is truly softer after the first wash. I think it gave it more volume too even though I just let it air dry. The only complaint I have with this product is it does take up more time in the shower. I had to wet my hair thoroughly, and then apply the product (I would pump a couple ounces at a time and go as needed). After you massage it in then you have to comb it in and then I clipped it up and finished my shower. Then you finally get to rinse it out. While I was rinsing it out I was combing also. You do have to rinse longer than when you are using regular conditioner. But the results are great so I believe it is worth the extra 5 minutes! Happy Washings!!</li>
    <li> I love Wen.  I have been using it for over a year now.  However, I have found that after a month of using it straight, without any other shampoos, just Wen.. that my hair does get a bit oily.  I have curly, short hair, that has lots of natural body, and no weight what-so-ever of it&#x27;s own and my hair tends to be frizzy.  So, when I started doing is using a store bought shampoo like Panteen and then using Wen for a leave in conditioner.  Then once a week or ever other week, I wash my hair with just Wen and after I die my hair I use Wen.  That seems to work well.  So, you as desired.  Don&#x27;t follow just the instructions, experiment and see what works for your hair type. It is ridiculous to say this product will work for everyone, when used as directed. When not everyone&#x27;s hair is the same.  Not even close. I love the product, just not to use it as directed.  I have recommended this to my friends and family and they love it as well.</li>
    <li> A couple weeks ago I received a bottle of Chaz Dean&#x27;s WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner to sample and review. If you have never heard of Wen Haircare follow the link to learn more. This product is both a cleanser and conditioner in one easy step. It doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoos, it&#x27;s all natural and has no sodium laurel sulfate or other detergents usually found in shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen this product advertised on QVC for quite some time and had been waiting on purchasing it to see if I could find someone I knew who had tried it out. So, imagine my excitement when I got the chance to sample and review this, I literally jumped. When I received the bottle I opened it up to take a look and a whiff. The consistency is that of a deep conditioner, nothing like the shampoos that I normally use. But I guess that is because it&#x27;s not a shampoo, it is a conditioner that cleanses. The fragrance is pleasant and not over powering. The mint is mild, this is the scent I was most concerned about since I don&#x27;t like mint scented bath and body products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes anywhere from 10 -16 pumps, depending on hair length. You apply to wet hair and massage into the scalp and down the shaft of the hair. After you have massaged it in, it&#x27;s best to wait until you have finished in the shower to experience the deep conditioning effects. As I have gotten older my hair has really begun to get dry, and having used this for almost two weeks it really has helped the dryness and my hair looks shiny. My hair is thinning and long with a wavy texture. It is advertised as adding moisture, body and shine and works for straight, wavy curly and ethnic hair. The product is advertised to repair damage, renew elasticity and reduce chemical stress of dry and extremely damaged hair. I have to say that it does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I will continue to use this product as my regular \\&quot;shampoo.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have said they find this product line to be a bit expensive, but you can find it on Amazon, [...] and QVC. I know QVC has some good deals every once in a while and sometimes they even have easy payment plans available. I would highly recommend this product and love what it has done for my hair. If you get the chance to try products from this line I would say go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.it on Amazon, [...] and QVC. I know QVC has some good deals every once in a while and sometimes they even have easy payment plans available. I would highly recommend this product and love what it has done for my hair.

    <li> I have been using an expensive salon brand shampoo &amp; conditioner for years and I noticed a difference in my hair after the first wash!     I have a lot of fine, shoulder length hair. I was skeptical about washing my hair with conditioner and it was weird to get the routine down with just one product (replacing shampoo &amp; conditioner). Your hair feels squeaky clean when you follow the instructions. I use 16 pumps (from trial size bottle) and my hair is coated completely.     The trick is figuring out how much of the product to leave in your hair as a leave-in conditioner. Once I figured out that my hair needed a little less than the recommended dime size as a leave in conditioner my hair had bounce and body.    I have used the product about 5 times now and my coworkers have already noticed. The first time I washed my hair with this product I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair, it is so soft!</li>
    <li> this product everyone has been raving about, isn&#x27;t all that great. I ordered Wen sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner about 2 weeks ago, and was super excited to use it. When I showered, I took however many pumps for my hair( I have shoulder length, brown very thin hair)then a pump of the conditioner to leave in. after, i blow dried my hair, and nothing. Nothing really changed, it actually felt gross in a way of it being super greasy.I do not recommend this product, and being the bargain shopper that i am, because its not all what it seems to be, so be careful of what it says. I also think its very odd. when you get the package, inside is a whole booklet on the wen products and a page for each and how to use it CORRECTLY.This isn&#x27;t an ordinary hair cleaning product, it tells you where to individually put the pumps in, in your hair and that you have to let it sit in your scalp.in all, i just dont have time for that.i hope this review helped your decision!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after the first use, but on the 2nd day I saw a big difference.  I have long hair, just past my bra.  I have never been one of those people that could wash their hair and let it dry naturally, because my hair would just frizz.  I&#x27;m Italian and have naturally curly/wavy hair and I use to have to blow it strait (which took at least 45 min to an hour) so that it wouldn&#x27;t frizz or I would use a straightening iron after blow drying.  Since using Wen I have no need for my straightener and I don&#x27;t even blow dry my hair, I let it dry naturally and it actually dries in long ringlets.  I am so amazed.  I am hooked for ever.    I use about 3 pumps on the front of my head, 2-3 on the crown area and 2-3 at the nape of the neck area,  then I divide my hair into two sections and use  3 pumps for each section of my hair, come it through and clip it up while I shower.  Also I used to have to wash my hair everyday because it would get oily around my face and now I wash every other day. My hair feels and looks so healthy now. No more greasy hair, no more frizz.  Yeah!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have lots of very fine hair, and this gave me volume without frizz. Even better - my hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a child. After using Wen, I find that I don&#x27;t need any styling products. \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; looks good - who knew? Very pleased. My only complaint is the cost. The price tag is high, but when you figure in how much product you need (20 pumps per wash!), it&#x27;s exhorbitant. When I ran out, I tried Hair One, which is more affordable, but didn&#x27;t get the near same results. So sad.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to purchase this item because of the mixed reviews on it.  I am certainly happy that I did.  This product lived up to its promises.  I noticed results immediately (the first time I used it).  My husband even commented on how great my hair looked without me having to ask him.  Thanks Wen!  I am now addicted and have made several other purchases including the oil and the styling creme - (don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re any good though because I haven&#x27;t received them yet).  I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> The product works GREAT on my dry, curly, (often frizzy) hair.  (I should probably mention that we have very hard water.)  I find that I do not need 8 pumps on every section.  I can use about half of what the directions call for and still get great results.  The only drawback to this product is the price and lack of availability.  I will start ordering from Amazon now that I know Amazon is carrying it.</li>
    <li> So I was EXTREMELY hesitant to buy this because of the reviews people have given it who have oily hair, but the infomercial convinced me otherwise but I am very VERY pleased with the results. I used to have extremely frizzy hair and I don&#x27;t need to straighten it all the time to get it to settle down and not be super poofy.     I did notice when I first used it that it left my hair oily BUT that was my own error. I was only applying it to the surface and not doing a good job of rubbing it in. Once I spent more time adding water and rubbing it around it worked fabulously. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which a lot of products usually do and it got rid of my frizz.     I say I have oily hair and I definitely mean OILY hair. I do have to wash it everyday because by the end of the day my hair does get oily but that&#x27;s just what my hair is always going to do, but I definitely like the improvements of my hair during the day.     It&#x27;s worth a shot, but I agree with not buying it directly on their website. I am going to continue buying it but don&#x27;t like the idea of them just charging me and sending it. I would rather be the one to stay on top of it and order it each time I am ready.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product.  The price for just the 16 oz. WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner was #36.00 plus tax and shipping.  I have followed the instructions, as well as tried other ways to make this product work for me.  My hair always ends up feeling like a frizzy haystack!  I have very fine, soft hair (except when using this product).  My $2.49 a bottle Suave works 100 times better than this, and certainly is not $36 bucks!  While some may rave about this product, I found that it does not live up to the hype.  Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> i got my Wen clleasing conditioner very quickly and it was just what i needed.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleasing,and I must say I was very skeptical of how good they said the product worked, I am an african american woman and I wondered could this stuff really help my hair type.  I read so many reviews about the product both good and bad so I said the only way I&#x27;ll know for sure is to try it my self. Once I recieved the product I washed my hair with it, I&#x27;m still thinking how will a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t lather up cleanse your hair, well after using the product I am totally impressed, it left my hair so light. I normally use other products to get it to shine after I flat iron my hair but it left my hair shiny with lots of body and movement and I also like the almond, minty smell. I recommend you try this product, yes it is a bit pricey but worth it once you see the results.  I can not tell you how many pumps I used I was more interested in getting my hair saturated with the cleanser, once it was all on I massage it in really good, then I wore a plastic cap for about 5 min before washing it out. Give it a try for your self.</li>
    <li> Several days ago, I ordered the Sweet Mint Cleansing Conditioner (realizing the sweet mint almond is not recommended for my hair type [3b/c relaxed]), I ordered it anyway.  The product arrived in great condition the next day.  Yesterday, I decided to cleanse my hair.  After following the instructions, I noticed that my hair felt soft instantly.  The styling creme (which I ordered along with the conditioner) did not give my hair the same results as the conditioner had done...so I removed the styling creme and cleansed again.  After cleansing, I roller set my hair and got under the dryer.  My rollers were falling off, that is how soft my hair was once it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild atopic dermitis on my skin, at times even my scalp tends to dry out and mimic dandruff.  Most probably, I would need to use another product to address this issue whenever dermititis occurs.  Nevertheless, I am very happy with Wen and so is my scalp.  BTW, the Wen products tend to make the hair oily, so IF you already have oily hair, this product might make your hair oilier -- since my hair lacks hydration and sheen this product is righteously for me. Thank you Wen!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now. It took a while to get the amount needed right, and honestly I wasn&#x27;t convinced at first that there was a big difference in the way it made my hair feel.  I am now totally sold and just ordered more.  No, I don&#x27;t have hair like the stars in the commercial, but I can truly feel the difference and am amazed at how much longer the color that I apply stays.  It&#x27;s pricey compared to regular store bought shampoo, but if you can afford it it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I really was excited to try this product. I discuss products with my salon stylist all of the time. I have to say this really changed my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 months now. I can&#x27;t imagine using a product other than this to cleanse my hair. I have very long hair and always had a tangled mess near the nape of my neck. Something I suffered from since I was a small girl. Since using WEN, I no longer have any issues with my hair tangling during the day. Honestly, the second day my hair still has curl and more body than it the first day. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen now for 4 months straight and just after one use it left my hair feeling like I just left the salon.  I get a ton of comments on my hair, saying how healthy and shiny it is.  I also have curly/wavy hair and everytime I would blow dry my hair it would be frizzy and require heat to calm it down.  But now I can blow dry it and leave the house without frizz and it looks like I actually used a curling iron/straigthner on it.  I can&#x27;t think of anything that is better for your hair.  It is worth the money and I will be a life time user.</li>
    <li> Have been using Wen over a year and half now.  Love it!!!  It makes my hair grow faster than it ever has and it is in such good condition.  Also did away with the itchy scalp that I had every time I shampooed my hair.  Really love it!</li>
    <li> Tried Wen at the suggestion of a friend and have found that I really like it.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the whole Wen hair-washing process but after a few weeks it already seems less involved.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible hair loss the first time I used this cleanser.  I did apply the product as per the instructions given. Mine is fine medium length hair. Even though I had had a bad hair loss the first time, I thought I would try once more by reducing the number of pumps. Again the same result. I did not dare touch the product again.  My hair continued to fall badly and now, after a week, I can see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I received my sweet almond mint cleanser today. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it after reading everyone&#x27;s review here on amazon. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair first and it was a huge difference. So I tried it on my hair after washing it I blow dried it and curled it. I did not use any other product on my hair and my hair was full of bounce, very lightweight and very manageable. I would recommend this product. When I get more money I will try the other products like the styling cream and the re-moist mask. I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement as time goes by! p.s. if you don&#x27;t follow the directions or they aren&#x27;t clear then go on youtube, someone posted chaze&#x27;s video that shows girls demonstrating on how to use it so you can get a better understanding of it I sure did!</li>
    <li> Who would of thought that not using a conventional shampoo , and I have tried them all, would work so well. After years of trying all the new shampoos and conditioners I have finally found a product ,WEN, that works better than anything I have ever tried.  I have color treated hair that frizzes if you look at it wrong. It tends to be dry and looses color easily. I have used WEN for about a month now and really notice a beautiful change in my hair. It&#x60;s soft not as dry and the color is not fading. I really think that continued use will keep my hair in top shape. My only question is why didn&#x60;t I try it sooner? Actually the price scared me away but after a month I really feel it&#x60;s a wonderful bargain. You don&#x60;t use all that much and the smell is fabulous.I also use it as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my daughter and I saw the infomercial.  My daughter has thick, wiry, curly hair, while I have thick curly hair.  When I say thick, I mean thick!  We were so excited about this product that I even splurged for two day shipping....    Sadly, this is the worst, and I mean the worst product I have ever used. To give you an idea of what that means, I use products like Alterna, Enjoy, and Joico on a daily basis and have tried just about everything at the salon, but this product is the worst thing I have ever put in my hair.  Both my daughter and I tried it, and the product did not come close to the claims. Our hair looked the same, if not a little more frizzy. It left our hair feeling like it was not quite clean, and like it had some odd build-up on it.  That got me wondering so I read the ingredients, and there is all natural WAX in it!  My normal hair products do not have wax in them and I am almost willing to bet that most salon products do not either. For all of those who say their hair is silky, trust me, it&#x27;s the wax, and it will weigh your hair down eventually.    I am almost happy that it did not work, because with the amount you have to use, I could not have continued to pay the high price for this product.</li>
    <li> Hi, Firstly, I must state that I have not purchased this particular product, but I have purchased another product from the same company that markets this product in Australia and conducts the same business practices. As much as I liked their product, I would NEVER purchase, EVER AGAIN, from them.    DO BEWARE! They will send you further products even when you opt out! There was an area for special instructions when I purchased my product, to which I added: As per your \\&quot;cancel at anytime option\\&quot;, I wish to cancel my club membership as of [date inserted] ie do not join me automatically, nor bill/send any further products\\&quot; or words to that effect. Well, it was Christmas time (holidays, extra expenses) when my bank account was deducted to the tune of 3 x the original purchase price ie $150 not the $49 I paid, supposedly 3 months supply as distinct from the original (I guess) 1 months supply. Fortunately, I kept a printout of my original purchase order, so there was no arguement, yet it still took them 4 weeks to reimburse my account, as a consequence I had to defalt payment on my regular bills until my next pay ... I should have sued them for the damage to my financial reputation.    So beware, they are unsavoury, despite the fact that some of their products are actually very good (if suited to you), on principle I would never purchase from them again. This goes for the Wen website as well, which is really just an extension of the parent marketing company. It&#x27;s the same for all the products they market, just copy&amp;paste a few product websites into \\&quot;who is\\&quot; and see for yourself.    I hope this is of help to someone.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic--I ordered it and after reading the many reviews tried it.  I started with 8 pumps, I have shoulder length thick hair, and realized that my hair was \\&quot;squeeky\\&quot; clean without lather.  I have now used it for 1 month and love it.  My hair is shiny and healthy and I think is growing faster (no breakage?).  I can even skip a day and just wet my hair down and style and it still looks and feels clean.    The only down side is the amount required to use--I travel on business frequently and could never \\&quot;carry on\\&quot; my bags with all my toiletry items 3 oz or less.  It is okay because I always check my bag due to size but it would not be possible to take it in a carry on.  I just re-ordered from Amazon</li>
    <li> I bought this product after watching the infomercial.  It smells great, and definitely conditions hair, but it made my hair very heavy and greasy looking.  I have highlighted blond hair and it often looks dry on the ends.  I really thought this would help with that problem, but it ended up just making my hair look flat and greasy.  I found a product from WalMart called \\&quot;silk drops\\&quot; that works much better and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy and weighed down!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length natural ethnic hair. The cleanser is great but it took so much time, energy and product to work it through my entire head it just wasn&#x27;t worth it to me. After two uses the bottle was almost empty!! I used Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Cream Conditioner instead and got acceptable results.    It&#x27;s more the process of drenching your hair with cool water for about 5-10 minutes before applying the conditioner and then working the conditioner into your hair shaft and scalp that makes the biggest difference to me.    But now that I&#x27;ve cut my hair, I love the product.  My hair is less than two inches long so it takes less time and less product. My hair shines more and it defines the curls so nicely. It still takes a decent amount of product so I started mixing it with a little bit of the Garnier and water and I still get the same results.    Overall - I would say it&#x27;s worth it if you have the time to use it AND you stretch the product out by mixing it with other conditioners and water.</li>
    <li> It all seems so simple.  Use this product, instead of shampoo, and it will cleanse and condition in one easy step.  Not so easy, really, once you read the directions.  First, you need to separate your hair into 4 sections.  Then, depending upon the length of your hair, you need to use anywhere from 4-12 pumps of product per section.  I have hair almost to my mid-back, which means I&#x27;m supposed to use 48 pumps per use.  48!  That&#x27;s almost 1/4 of the bottle, and at $28/bottle, I&#x27;m paying $7 per \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot;.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay that, even if it really worked, which it doesn&#x27;t - as far as the \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; is concerned, and it&#x27;s just okay as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair is 100% natural, never even dyed it. It&#x27;s not dry and it&#x27;s already pretty healthy. My mother purchased this product, and claimed it worked wonders on her hair and said I should try it. I had just washed my hair the previous day, but since I was over at her house I decided to wash my hair again. I didn&#x27;t even look at the bottle to see the recommended dosing. I just pumped a few times until I had a good size blob in my hand, washed my hair with that and conditioned it as well.     The results were amazing. My hair never felt softer and I didn&#x27;t have the normal puffy look that I have when I let my hair air dry. I wish I wasn&#x27;t a poor college student or else I would buy some of it for myself.     These results were only after one wash, so maybe continuous washings make your hair greasy like some reviewers have said. I just know it worked wonders on my hair and I don&#x27;t have dry hair in the slightest. I never even blow dry or straighten my hair.     Don&#x27;t necessarily listen to what the bottle has to say. All hair is different, so just work with it until you find what&#x27;s good for your particular type of hair. :D</li>
    <li> I have curly, dry hair. Wish that this product was around since I was a child, because I have struggled with it getting dried out from shampoo for years. I used a minimal amount and rub all over my scalp, then rinse out. Occasionally, I dilute some shampoo with water, and rub over my scalp and rinse. You don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much WEN as they state in the directions. After washing, I usually rub about a teaspoon through my towel-dried hair for conditioning. Is wonderful.  I noticed that the almond mint has that fake \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; or \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot; However, the fig formulation does not. Will try the fig next. The last container of the almond mint has lasted me about 10 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for about 3 years now. I will never buy any other hair products because I have finally found something that is good for my hair and in the long run...is very economical. I only have to shampoo my hair once or twice a week to keep my hair looking and feeling its best. I love the way Wen cleansing conditioner feels on my hair and scalp while I am taking a shower and how my hair feels after I rinse it out.  I have several different kinds of Wen cleansing conditioners and I like to mix about 3 different kinds at a time. I love the Sweet Almond Mint, Lavendar, and Fig. These three are my favorites, but I do have and use all the different kinds that Wen has.   I use more of the Fig when my hair and scalp is a little more on the dry side. I use more of the Lavendar when I feel I want more body to my hair, and I also add Wen Tea Tree cleansing conditioner when my scalp is dry/flaky etc.  If you have never tried Wen products, I would recommend trying Wen Sweet Almond Mint first as it is the most universal for all hair types and then you can always add another type of Wen cleansing conditioner as you want to.   I would also recommend keep a watch out on QVC for demonstrations by the developer of Wen products. He is excellent in demonstrating and teaching exactly how to use and get the most out of this product.  I want to say one more thing regarding how much this product saves me money. Before using only Wen products on my hair, I was having to have my hair colored about every two to three months and now that I use only Wen products with the exception of occasional hairspray in the front, I just went 7 months between coloring. I only had the grey hair showing thru in the front and top of my hair where I use the hairspray.   Yes, I will say it again, Wen products, in the long run, are very economical and certainly better for your hair.</li>
    <li> If i was ever pleased with this product, it would only be for a day or two.    I can understand that it might be helpful for dry, overprocessed hair, but for normal, untreated hair, it is just too much    after using it for one day, I felt that it left my hair very greasy, even though i used only a little bit.  Granted It got better with time, after i started to use less product and rinsed my hair for several minutes longer.  In the end, though, i dont want to be paranoid about my shampoo -- \\&quot;will my hair look greasy today?\\&quot; was a usual worry when using this product.    I ordered this product from tv (mistake #1) and received the accessories with it -- well i never used them because my hair was already so weighed down!  Its normal, not too thick hair that has decent volume.  I get frizziness, so i thought that this product would help.  nope.    and the smell got to me, too. It reminds me f menthol cigarettes, to be honest.      Plus, my second shipment of shamoo, that i specifically told the woman on the phone i didn&#x27;t want, was $90 and would have lasted me a year!  I guess that you get a new shipment every 60-90 days...It was so annoying that i had to return this, but everything is cancelled, so now i am free to try out other shampoos, with no commitment!!  very strange product.</li>
    <li> After I spent $30 on Wen, I began to wonder: would any Conditioner work the same way?  After all, I did look at the ingredients of Wen and they looked familiar.  Guess what, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have virgin hair, long and fine.  I have always taken good care of my hair, but as a woman, I&#x27;m always seeing if it can be improved.  After all, it&#x27;s our &#x27;crowning glory&#x27;, right?  Well, after looking at the infomercial time and again, I decided to try Wen.  It&#x27;s okay, but I didn&#x27;t really see any major difference in my hair.  This is a lot of money for no big change.  Then I kept thinking about my original question, that would ANY conditioner work the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out and bought Dove Therapy conditioner.  Today I used it just like the instructions for Wen call.  Guess what, my hair looks just like it did when I cleansed with Wen.  The difference is, I got 40 ounces for just under $7 instead of 12 ounces for just under $30.  Doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist, does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not taking anything away from Chaz or Wen, it&#x27;s a great &#x27;gimmick&#x27;, and a good marketing ploy.  You order the 12 oz (the way you&#x27;re told to apply it, this lasts less than 14 days)and then you&#x27;re put on an auto-order account.  You get an $80 supply every 3 months or so, 3 monthly payments so it&#x27;s not such a bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you decide.  I hope that some of you at least try this and see for yourself.  There&#x27;s no real reason to spend this sort of money when you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> I will start out by saying that I LOVE the product. Wen is so rich and creamy and leaves my hair soft and healthier than it did before using it. However, by the time you pay for shipping and handling it costs nearly $40 for a 16 oz bottle and one bottle lasted me one month. In an economy that made me give up Cable TV to reduce monthly expenses, spending $40 a month for a hair cleaning product doesn&#x27;t make much sense.     I have found a compromise though. When the bottle got down to the bottom where the pump no longer worked, and I had to change back to my normal shampoo, I took the plunger out and shook out enough of the Wen product to use as a conditioner after shampooing my hair. My hair is still soft and healthy using Wen as a conditioner instead of the main cleaning product. Using it that way, one bottle will last a very long time, so I can now use Wen in a more economical way.    I used 16 pumps per washing, but after reading one reviewer say she uses 2-3 pumps I may try it again and see if my hair gets clean using that little of the product. And I agree with the reviewer who says not to buy the product from the Wen website. Buying it from Amazon.com you get what you want when you want it.</li>
    <li> What attracted me to WEN was the 3 in 1 step deal (shampoo, conditioner, leave in...etc.).  I am an African (American), all natural female with type 4a/4b(kinky coiled afro)hair.  My hair normally blow dry str8 and flat irons like a perm(some say better..hehehee)   ANYWAY, my hair is thick and long (reaches mid-back). Usually dry, reeeeaaaalllyyyy kinky and hard to manage after washing without a good detangler. I LOVED the minty tingle of the conditioning cleansers, that&#x27;s my fave part.  HOWEVER, the process is a little awkward with having to section and drench your hair in COLD water 1st...especially in the shower.  I would say it&#x27;s less time consuming compared to washing twice, conditioning, detangling.  I&#x27;m just not used to this different process.  I was scared the tingle was going to break me out because I have super sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t!  After the ONE wash my scalp and hair looked and felt refreshed and clean and was easy to detangle.  Soft too.  I think I would have had even better results if I used the other products but didn&#x27;t feel like it.  EXCEPT after I blow dried it and put it in 6 huge twists, wore the twists for 1 day and took them out...the texture balm is awesome.  I&#x27;m glad none of the 2 products I used so far didn&#x27;t brake me out!  I usually worry about that when tryin new products.  Probably will stay in the shipment club to keep the $35 price and just customize the order for the cleanser and balm.  Well good luck, hope this helps.     OOOoooohhh almost 4got.  I used half the bottle this 1st wash sooooo it def won&#x27;t last 3 months.  Hopefully they can customize my order with a larger bottle and ship sooner.</li>
    <li> My mom ordered it, so I decided to give it a try. I wasn&#x27;t pleased.    First, even with medium-length thick hair, the recommended usage seemed like way too much.     On top of that, I didn&#x27;t like what it did to my hair at all. I have natural curly hair that, under my regular shampoo and conditioner regimen, dries with little frizz and has very defined spiral curls--all without any product. With Wen, my hair lost volume, bounce, life and even curl! My hair was limp and the curls lost a lot of their shape. What I did gain was frizz. I was reminded of my awkward hair-hating middle school days and not the curly hair I&#x27;ve come to love and friends have envied.    And then I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt at all. No matter how much I rinsed, my hair had an uncomfortable greasy feel to it, almost like it would if I hadn&#x27;t even rinsed it. My hair has a softer, healthier feel to it with my usual shampoo and conditioner when I was expecting the opposite.    The one advantage was that it did brighten my color. All in all, though, not worth the time and money--it only made my hair look and feel worse, not better.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair blonde for over a decade, so I have a lot of damaged hair! i&#x27;ve been using this product since May and my hairdresser said she&#x27;s never seen my hair so healthy. I used to use deep conditioner every day and my hair would still be dry. The WEN kit has brought out the NATURAL oils of my hair so that it is softer and more touchable. I did order from Amazon so I didn&#x27;t get caught up in the auto shipments and have been very happy. I don&#x27;t use the recommended amount of pumps. My chin length hair really only needs about 6-8 pumps per shower. When I didn&#x27;t re-order before my bottle ran out, I switched to regular shampoo and conditioner for about a week and my hair was noticeably drier and frizzier. Can&#x27;t wait to get back on my WEN!</li>
    <li> Some of my girlfriends raved about this so I decided to try.  However, I have very fine, thin hair and it seemed too heavy for me.  Those other girls have thick hair.  So:  good for thick, not so good for fine.  This is my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about Wen so I decided to try it.  I have very thick chemically treated long hair.  My hair never gets greasy.  I can usually go about 3 days until I have to wash it.  I read articles saying that it left some peoples hair greasy.  I tried it for 3 weeks and by the end of 3 weeks it looked like I jumped right off of Jersey Shore..... not impressed.    signed,  Grease Ball</li>
    <li> I liked this stuff decently enough. I admit, I was lured in by Jenny Garth&#x27;s fabulously shimmering hair on the infomercial. (I love her!) So lo and behold, I was about to call the number and order it on the phone but the bargain hunter/product investigator in me was screaming \\&quot;Wait!!...look online!!\\&quot; So I did and found enough good reviews here on Amazon to entice me into ordering it. I was so excited when it got here I immediately used it. I liked the fact that it was so rich and creamy and smelled delicious. However, I am a quick shower taker because I am usually in a hurry to get somewhere and found that it took a bit longer to pump out 40+ squirts of product, apply it to different sections of my hair, comb it thoroughly, wait 5-10 minutes for it to take effect, then rinse it ALL out with cold water.... I felt like I was in the shower FOREVER! And I left the shower freezing! It definitely woke me up but it&#x27;s the middle of winter!! But I have to admit, my hair felt good and I even got a complement on how \\&quot;Hollywood\\&quot; my hair looked -- all healthy and shiny looking on that very first day! No joke! I was super happy and excited so I kept using the Wen for another few weeks despite the time it sucked away from me, reveling in that ONE compliment I got. After a few weeks though, I started to notice a lot of dandruffy flakes on my scalp. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the Wen or just plain old winter dandruff but I had to stop using it because I wear a dark uniform at work and the flakes were getting unmanageable! As soon as I switched back to my old shampoo and conditioner, flakes were gone and I HONESTLY couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between my Wen hair and my plain old shampoo hair *shrug*. Overall, it did what it said it would do for the most part, but my hair didn&#x27;t seem any more fabulous in hindsight. I can&#x27;t afford to spend an extra $20 a month on my hair, which would come out to $240 a year! No thanks.</li>
    <li> I have medium to fine hair, shoulder length. My hair is NOT oily nor is it super dry. After ONE use of using Wen cleansing conditioner sweet almond, my hair became shinier and healthier! I especially noticed with the ends of my hair. I DID use shampoo before i use the cleansing conditioner and continue to shampoo before each use. The cleansing conditioner is way too thick to be used as a 2 in 1. I feel that if used as such it would make just about anyone&#x27;s hair greasy. So if you use this product as a conditioner only it works great! I also do not use the recommended amount of pumps, it seemed wayyy to excessive to me. I also tread lightly at how much I put on the roots of my hair. I also find that sectioning your hair into four sections and applying it to one section at a time works best. After I rinse the conditioner out I like to add a little extra to the ends of my hair as a leave in:) My hair now looks and feels extra shiny and soft. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This product is like no other I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I am a self-proclaimed product junkie. It makes my hair feel light and bouncy, and it is much shinier and healthier-looking than before.   Yes, the product does end up being somewhat expensive--I have medium thick hair that goes to mid-back and I use about 24 pumps per use--at that rate the bottle goes rather quickly. Yet I will have to continue paying the price, as the twenty or more other shampoos and conditioners I own are just languishing in the shower unused.   The scent is refreshingly minty, and the product causes a fairly strong tingling sensation on the scalp and other skin it touches, which can be invigorating.   All in all, highly recommended--Wen enhances my shower experience and makes my hair look worlds healthier!</li>
    <li> After seeing this product advertised on an infomercial many times, I decided to try it.  I am disappointed with the results. I followed the directions , but found this product to do no better job that regular shampoo and conditioner.  I think it is highly overpriced for what is does ( or doesn&#x27;t do) and would not recommend it. Sorry, Chaz Dean.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I saw the infomercial and was hooked.  I started out purchasing the Sweet Almond Mint at the beginning of December.  Like the infomercial, I expected wonderful results and model quality hair.  After all, that&#x27;s pretty much what was promised on all the commercials for it.  I have dry, thin, dyed, over styled and damaged hair.  First use and it was ok, but not the results I expected.  I kept using it, thinking it would need time to kick in.  I followed the directions exactly as stated, tried using more pumps, tried using less pumps.  Rinsed for the stated time, rinsed for a lot long and for shorter periods.  No combination gave me the results I was looking for.  I even tried buying each of the different types thinking it was the wrong version for my hair type.  After 3 months, I&#x27;m giving up.  My hair was definetly clean and definetly soft, but still frizzy and after an hour after fixing my hair, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t even brushed it that day.  And I also didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the amount of time I had to color my hair.  In fact the first time I conditioned my hair after dying, the cream had a brown tint to it, which was from the hair dye from 2 days before.      I agree with others that it smells great and leaves your hair soft.  But I found that it was no softer than other salon shampoos/conditioners.      The cost of Wen doesn&#x27;t justify it for me.  I have spent so much money on this product over the last three months, it&#x27;s ridiculious.  And I&#x27;ve also gone through one 32 ounce bottle, five 6 ounce bottles, small bottle of styling creme and intensive conditioner.  That&#x27;s a heck of a lot more than what they tell you you&#x27;ll need for 3 months.  And I have fine hair, I can&#x27;t imagine if I had thick longer hair!    Also, Wen added about 30 min to my morning routine.  Between the sections, the massaging, the rinsing, the clipping up and leaving, I would end up running out of hot water in my shower each morning!  Give me a cheaper, longer lastingnice shampoo and the extra 30 min of sleep!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, similar to Halle Berry texture.  My hair often gets dry especially after wearing curly.  I usually use an organic, sulfate and cloride free shampoo.  Wen give the same results for me as that when not used with remoist.  I use the cleansing conditioner with remoist as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I just ordered Wen. Despite reviews I want to try this product.  I ordered with a prepaid visa card (which is what I prefer to use whenever ordering online or over the phone). I figured if they send extra shipments, good luck to them when charging a card with limited usage! I&#x27;m willing to try this product because I&#x27;ve tried almost every product I can think of for my hair. I style hair myself and although the products work for my clients, my hair has serious issues. I suffer from the permanent itchy scalp and dry, brittle curls. I&#x27;m Black/White/Italian and due to health issues, I&#x27;ve had to go back natural. Right now, I&#x27;m spending monthly $9 for shampoo, $9 for conditioner, $8 for curl definition,$4 for moisture, $4 for gel lock, and $12 for color. That&#x27;s a everyday routine for me since the gel has to be washed out. I&#x27;m hoping Wen will save the extra work as well as a few bucks in my pocket. I&#x27;ll report back after trying the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been dyeing my hair since I was ten, so my hair is very damaged. I started using this product about one month ago and it has improved my hair quality vastly. I have frizzy curly hair, so I straighten my hair almost daily. I could never just wear my hair curly without A LOT of product to keep it from frizzing. Now, I just have to use a bit of hairspray if I want to wear it curly. Also, my hair looks so much shinier and healthier when I straighten it. It used to look very dry and damaged. I have a shorter haircut so I do not need to use the \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; amount of pumps per use. I got the 30 day supply and it isn&#x27;t quite half way gone yet. I don&#x27;t think that even with long hair that you would need to use such an excessive amount as 32 pumps. Also, I have shopped on other sites to find a better value or price, and have found that on QVC&#x27;s site, they have 32oz bottles for about $45-$50.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly suprised with this stuff! I have used it for about 3 weeks now, but noticed the change after the first use. I did not buy any other product except the shampoo, and probably never will since this seems to do the trick. My hair is fine/thin and long (down to my bra strap). I have a bit of natural friz/wave and I have always hated it. It is usually flat at my scalp and fly away friz at the ends. I am a \\&quot;wash and go\\&quot; type of person. I don&#x27;t use styling products or irons and blow dryers. I used this shampoo and the fizzy waves turned to pretty loose curls. I no longer have the flat limp look toward my scalp. It is full of body, and it lasts all day long. No more putting it in a pony tail part way through the day. It also has this really great, healthy shine to it. Seriously, I am amazed, and I will probably never use another product on my hair. I do not use as much as it says to use though. Possibly because my hair is so thin, I don&#x27;t need that much. About 8 pumps is enough to totally saturate it. I do massage my scalp a whole lot more than I used to, and I do use a cold water rinse right before getting out of the shower. Other than that, I comb through it while its wet, and it drys naturally while I am in the car on my way to work. Beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I had seen this on an infomercial but did not want to purchase here due to the monthly charge. I then spoke with a friend that uses Wen products.  After her raving reviews I decided to try it through Amazon and love it.  I tried the Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleaning Conditioner. It&#x27;s worth the extra money as my hair was dry and over processed.  It now looks healthier and feels silky soft.  Thanks for a great product that is worth the money!</li>
    <li> This product takes the place of shampoo, conditioner, and detangler. Makes hair shiny and healthy looking. Would recommend using the styling creme as well, as it works really well to tame hair.</li>
    <li> I was one of the skeptics that said, \\&quot;there is no way that is going to work\\&quot;.  I got my products off of another sight, but NOT from the infomercial.  Before I ordered, I did some investigating.  I went to Chaz Dean&#x27;s website and watched the tutorial on HOW to use the product.  I&#x27;m beginning to believe that some are thinking you will use this system like you did with traditional shampoo.  This is not shampoo, and to be honest and fair, if you are a wash and go type of girl, WEN may not work for you.  You have to use the correct recommended pumps for your length of hair, massage it in as directed, and leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes.  You also have to cool off your shower.  It&#x27;s better for your skin too, to use warm water for your shower, not hot.  I have very fine, color-treated, and highlighted hair that is about 3 inches past my shoulders.  I use a total of 40 pumps..that&#x27;s right, 40.  I massage it in as directed, use the comb, as directed, and leave it in while I shave and take the rest of my shower.  While it&#x27;s on, I can feel a cool tingling sensation.  Might I add, I use only the sweet almond mint, cucumber aloe, and tea tree types (recommended for my type of hair, fig was not recommended).  Please, please, please...if you are willing to take the extra few minutes and do the system correctly, you will LOVE this product and never go back.  Watch the tutorial to use correctly and you will love this product!  I&#x27;ve used it for only a week and my hair is clean, soft, and looks so much more healthy.  Oh, and another thing...put away the curling irons, flat irons, etc. and use a nozzel on your blow dryer as recommended.  It DOES make a difference.  A few squirts of the volumizing spray at roots, round brush, and warm setting on blow dryer (with nozzel).  I am officially a WEN girl!</li>
    <li> Waste of money and it doesn&#x27;t work for all hair. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 2 star is because it at least made my hair smell nice.</li>
    <li> First of all I would like to say that this is NOT a new concept. I have friends who have been using conditioner(s) as a cleanser for years. And haircare manufacturers have put their own products on the market over the years with poor results (FERMODYL® Fermo-Caresse(tm) REVLON® Milk Plus 6(tm)) And CLAIROL® had recommended condition(tm) beauty pack treatment as a &#x27;Creme Cleanser&#x27; for dry, damaged, delicate hair in the 1950&#x27;s thru the 1980&#x27;s when it was discontinued. Any good NON-SILICONE conditioner will make a good &#x27;Conditioning Cleanser&#x27; the ones for FINE, THIN and THINNING Hair seem to clean the best and some even make a creamy foam when enough is used and hair is very wet. Having tried WEN® on my thick, dry, color-treated, curly hair I found that it did not clean or condition very well.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!  First time any product has made such a big difference in my hair! Run don&#x27;t walk!  Highly reccommend. I have fine wavy/curly hair that tends to be on the dry frizzy side. I typically blow it out straight.  Hair feels much healthier and shinier with lots of bounce.  Friends have commented as well.  Make sure it is rinsed out well.  PS  Been in the salon industry for many years so I have tried EVERY product out there.</li>
    <li> Tried WEN for a few times in a row and thought my hair just wasn&#x27;t clean.  Will try again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product in that my hair is soft and smells nice. My hair is no softer though than when I use my regular shampoo/conditioner. The other thing that bothers me is how much of it that needs to be used. There is no way one bottle last an entire month and I have relatively short hair. I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase it again just because I don&#x27;t think it is worth the cost not because it is not good product--- just not THAT amazing.</li>
    <li> I really love the stuff, it works really good &amp; i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m able to get it from amazon just the product i need &amp; not have to order the whole step by step stuff which i don&#x27;t even use the other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new user to Wen. I&#x27;m of European decent with fair skin and fine- blonde- over-processed hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was for me or not. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it the past 30 days (until the bottle was empty) and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a positive change in my hair. It&#x27;s much softer and very shiny. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cost of this product.  I read other reviews and people suggested wen users should try \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; sold at Sally Beauty Supply. I purchased a bottle, but it isn&#x27;t the same as Wen. It is a thinner product and I didn&#x27;t  like how my hair felt afterward. So while Wen costs more than I care to really spend for shampoo, I can&#x27;t deny that my hair really does look and feel wonderful.  I am going to continue using Wen.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it washes your hair, yet leaves it soft and smooth.  Other shampoos are usually so drying, but this made my hair feel soft and luxurious.  This even works on natural hair and has many other uses.  It also smells wonderful!!!!!.</li>
    <li> My friend came to visit me and I instantly noticed how healthy her hair looked. She told me she started using Wen for the past 2 weeks. Later that night, the informercial came on, and I ordered it on the spot. I was so excited to receive it, and I followed the directions precisely.  It left my hair shiny, soft and not dry at all. The rehydrating conditioner didn&#x27;t do anything the cleansing conditioner couldn&#x27;t do, and the styling cream was no help at all. The texture balm was mildly helpful. It absolutly was an improvement to my hair. I bought a 16 oz. cleansing conditioner, and used 12 pumps of product with every shampoo. It was supposed to last 30 days, but after 5 days, half the bottle is gone. I was supposed to receive a 90 day supply in three weeks, but I just cancelled my membership. At $90 a shipment, I cannot justify using this product. I love that it&#x27;s vegan. It does work. But you know what? So does \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; and \\&quot;Frizz-ease\\&quot; and Loreal sulfate free products too. Almost as good, and I don&#x27;t have to feel guilty for breaking the bank. Another thing, you have to massage it into your hair for at least 3 minutes, then rinse it out for 3 minutes too. Who&#x27;s got time for that? If it were even half the price I&#x27;d still use it, but the price is just way too high.</li>
    <li> My hair is usually dry, thick, dead at the ends, it is color treated, so needless to say it was ruined. Then I used this (it does work REALLY well on thick hair, so it is not just for fine hair) and Oh my god. I will never use anything else on my hair ever again. I used to pay alot of money on leave in conditioners, special hair treatments at the salon and very expensive conditioners. None of them did half the work of wen. I seriously love this shampoo! they smell amazing, feel amazing, and your hair WILL NOT tangle and it actually helps alot with split ends and dryness. It used to be hard for me to grow out my hair but with this it actually grows faster and easier because my ends are not constantly ripping out with brushing. It also makes my hair so nice and shiny, and really brings out the color so now I am going to dye my hair to its natural color and keep it that way because it makes it look SO nice! not dull at all.  I highly recommend this, if you don&#x27;t have enough money for it then SAVE up because it will save you money in the long run on treatments, color, and leave in sprays and gels. Best purchase I have ever made I seriously cannot say enough about it to do it justice  Also remember all the cleansing conditioners are different, I bought 4 of them and they all work differently. sweet almond mint worked the best for me, fig smells amazing but just didn&#x27;t work with my hair type, lavender didn&#x27;t either. it really goes according to your hair so try a value pack! that is the best advice I can give :) once you find the right one for your hair you will be very, very happy.</li>
    <li> I can see how this product would be good if your hair is dry or damaged;  however, mine is not.  I have curly hair, not too thick, not coarse/wiry, a little on the oily side. I do not color and only use a curling iron on the bangs.    I used Wen for three days (day 1 -sweet almond mint, day 2 - lavender, day 3- fig) and my hair no longer shines.  It&#x27;s dull and looks as though I haven&#x27;t washed it. No bounce or shine and hard to style. I will stick with my Frederick Fekkai products which are absolutely amazing, albeit expensive.  Glad I tried Wen though.  I&#x27;ll be giving it to my mom who has extremely over processed and dry hair.    UPDATE:  So I came home today to find yet ANOTHER box of WEN on my doorstep!  I didn&#x27;t order a second box!   So, I take back what I said before about \\&quot;glad I tried Wen\\&quot;.  I wonder how many more random boxes of product will appear at my door?  I may just change my credit card number now... very disappointed to know that this is how Chaz Dean gets ahead.  No more tv infomercial products for me!</li>
    <li> Gave the Wen conditioning shampoo a whirl.  It worked in that it made my hair look very healthy and shiny, but it left an icky residue on my scalp, and started to create dandruff in my hair as well.  E[...]  My scalp never really ever felt \\&quot;clean,\\&quot; which left me feeling a little uneasy.  I followed the directions very closely, and rinsed for DAYS to make sure it didn&#x27;t leave a residue, but I still had to use a clarifying shampoo, and leave in conditioner to get the residue out.  I even used less product hoping it would help, but still had the same results.      I think there are better products out there that will give you a much better bang for your buck.    I had originally ordered through the Wen website, and was able to call in (late at night, I might add) and cancel with no issue.  Here&#x27;s hoping they don&#x27;t send another shipment.  If you do cancel, be sure to ask for a confirmation number, so you have more leverage in the chance you have to dispute the charge with your bank :)</li>
    <li> I bought this kit from the company&#x27;s infomercial, getting sucked into their trial period. My husband has baby fine hair and I have very thick full hair. It was great for about 3 days, by week&#x27;s end, our hair was left greasy, and smelling like scalp sweat and wen mixed! ew. The hair balm they give you is useless, but I do like the smoothing cream and conditioning cream just as a leave in conditioner - to smooth flyaways, but dont use this strictly as a hair care regime. I was able to return as they had promised I could, but I get junk mail from them wanting me back. I have found the best thing for our family are sulfate free soaps and shampoos. Try Bain de Terre Keratin shampoo/conditioner (scored mine at tj maxx) - its the best Ive ever used. My hair has never been softer!</li>
    <li> AS ANY NEW BUYER, I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL TO PURCHASE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SHAMPOO TO CLEAN MY HAIR, BUT I MUST SAY I WAS VERY IMPRESS WITH THE RESULTS. I CAN&#x27;T REALLY STATE THAT MY HAIR LOOKS AND FEEL EXACTLY AS THEY ATTRIBUTE WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT, BUT I CAN SURELY SAY MY HAIR DOES FEELS SOFTER AND THAT ALMOND MINT ON WEN DOES GIVE A FRESHNESS FEEL TO MY SCALP.I WOULD DEFINATELY PURCHASE WEN AGAIN, NO CHEMICALS AND IT DOES WORK; I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I talked to my hairsylist about Wen, how he felt about it, if he had tried it, etc., and he brought up some fantastic points....  1) Yes, he had tried it on a few of his clients (they brought in their own bottles and requested that he use it on them) and he said it felt like he wasnt doing anything except just conditioning their hair. How \\&quot;clean\\&quot; it actually is, is definitely up to each individual user since, just like anything else in this world, what works for some folks may not work for others. We all have different bodies and react to different products, food, etc. in different ways. So be careful when you see something that claims to work for EVERYTHING.   2) Also, he mentioned that aside from product quality or not, it had genius marketing. Think about it... Wen doesnt really tell you what it DOES do, it tells you what it DOESNT do (lather). So... that is an immediate attention-getter for any consumer. People rush to gobble this stuff up, almost as a marketing brainwash. All of our lives we have heard advertisments describe the benefits of things.... how great it will be, all the wonders the product will do, etc. So we tune things out because it turns into a redundant schpeal (sp?). BUT.... now we have something that tells us what it WONT do, and that any product that DOES do this is harmful. Now you have our attention again. And do your research without buying into new information.... is it really TRUE that lathering is bad? Or are we buying it because in no way, shape, or form could this infomercial be misguiding us...?  3) And using 8 pumps of Wen PER SECTION??? And every day?? Another huge genius marketing campaign... In other words... use your product up as fast as you can so you can run back and buy more. Careful people....  That being said, I have been using Wen off and on for a while now and this is my advice....  1) Wen claims its safe for every day use. I believe in moderation. Dont use ANY kind of product EVERY single day. Your hair will eventuallyget used to it, get bored with it, and start drying out, and once again youll be back on the market looking for the next miracle product. Plus, like I mentioned above, its part of their marketing campaign. So, what I recommend doing is if youre going to use Wen, combine it with other products... shampoo if you still want to use it, other cleansing conditioners, whatever. Keep everything in moderation.   2  And just use however many pumps feels good to you. I do not divide my hair and use 8 pumps per section. Heck no! Thats just ASKING for greasy hair as well! Waaaay too much product exposure. I have shoulder-length moderately thick hair, and even I just use three pumps for my whole head. I comb it in, leave it in, and go about my shower, then rinse it out at the very end.   3) I also use shampoo in addition to using Wen. This is just personal preference and I prefer the feeling of the clean hair from shampoo before applying the conditioner.   4) Something I dont like about Wen is that my hair seems to be going limp on day 2. I dont wash my hair everyday (more like every 2-3). My hair doesnt get oily easy at all, but on day 2 it seems to be losing its life, its bounce. Its flat to my head, unlike previous years where \\&quot;Day 2 hair\\&quot; was always my favorite. I like how right after using Wen and blow-drying it, I barely have to straighten my hair with a hot iron anymore. Wen has taken out a lot of that frizz and thats whats kept me coming back. However, it seems to have taken its course, because now, its fine and limp all the time... and doesnt Wen say its the BEST for limp hair??  Now this is what is bothering me.... I went in to my hairstylist yesterday for a cut, and he mentioned he has noticed lots of changes in my hair over the past 6 months (since starting Wen). And I didnt mention a thing about Wen either, that was left out of the conversation. He mentioned my hair is not as bouncy anymore, that it appeared a lot more limp... So even HE was noticing it! :( Without knowing about Wen, he said my hair seemed to be *way over conditioned.* My antenna immediately went up. Over-conditioned... hmmmm... sounds familiar.... And what product has been tattooed to our brains that we need to use everyday.....? Wen Cleansing Conditioner... He said conditioning after shampoo (depending on how often you wash your hair) should never be an every-time ordeal. This will dry out your hair and lead to limp, lifeless hair eventually. Funny he would mention....  Am I saying dont use Wen? No. Am I gonna continue to use it? Probably. But Im definitly going to use it even less moderately now, and make sure I incorporate other products for the overall health of my hair. Il probably eventually phase it out completely. I want my bounce back!   My advice to you is to just do what works for you. Find out what your Wen-routine turns into, should you decide to keep using it. And dont be afraid to start out with the beginners kit and cancel from there, its really not that tedious. But let them know you dont want anything in the mail or via email asking you to come back either, cause they get you that way too. :) Watch out for marketing red flags, and know that even if something sounds miraculous, everything works differently on different people.  Blessings everyone!</li>
    <li> WEN  really works for me. i have a very very curly hair and after i had it highlighted - it dried completely out and broke.  all those attempts of making it look pretty just didn&#x27;t work.   I have been using Wen for 3 weeks now and can tell u my hair looks amazing.  it is soft, easy to handle and it shines.   not oily kind of shine but just a natural beautiful shine.   i tried the using the styling cream too but it just does not give my curls any definition- i use another product for that.  but overall-the nourishing mask and the cleansing conditioner- had made wonders with my hair.   so happy i ordered it.   i&#x27;m never going back to regular shampoo!</li>
    <li> I saw the infomercial and I was hooked!  I purchased the product by calling the 800 number - it took at least 30 minutes to get through the call.  The reps are trained to upsell, even when I kept saying \\&quot;No, I just want to order the intro package\\&quot;, the were relentless in trying to have me purchase more product than the $29 offer.  (why would I spend upwards of $100 for a product I&#x27;ve never tried?).  In any case, I really wanted this product to work.  I have long, straight hair.  It&#x27;s not thin, but I do need body.  I tried the product for the entire 30 days.  Followed the directions to the letter (cold water, comb thru, 5-8 pumps, etc.) and each and every time my hair NEVER came clean enough to style properly.  My color is a little washed out right now because I normally just wash my hair every two days, but because I was using Wen, I switched to everyday for a while (thinking the product didn&#x27;t work because of too much build-up).  Then I switched to every other day and still just terrible results.  The results were always greasy hair that looked like I forgot to rinse out the conditioner.  (yes, I tried using less and more product, still bad looking hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is a great product for those with curly or frizzy hair, but certainly not straight hair.</li>
    <li> The upside is it&#x27;s all natural. The downside: the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use vo5 conditioners for conditioner only washing. At less than $1 a bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong. They make clarifying conditioners in yummy scents for oily haired folks, or you can use one of their heavier conditioners (I like the new repair &amp; protect).&lt;br /&gt;But basically, any conditioner without silicones will do. So you could certainly use something salon quality or all natural if you know what to look for on the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also you want to use styling lotions/creams/serums that do not contain any silicone. I think most people who fail at CO washing(which is what the wen system is) complaining of dull, limp hair are using something with silicone(which needs sulphates in shampoos to wash out). although not everything works for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer in the shower to massage but my hair feels better than ever.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have much of an expectation for this product. I bought the set of 3 for fine/medium hair and so far I&#x27;ve only tried the sweet almond mint. 1 time and I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;m in LOVE LOVE LOVE with this product. I took 1 star away because of the amount you need to use and the cost.</li>
    <li> I had dispaired of every ridding myself of the halo of wiry frizz... my hair is very thick &amp; coarse (think horse mane!)as well as color treated &amp; flat ironed daily; I could never get results until this product. I actually can&#x27;t wait to redo it after returning from the hairdressers, where they use conventional shampoo. Another plus is that it definitely helps keep my color more vibrant (vs. shampoo). I do have to use quite a bit to get it saturated (due to the volume of my hair), but it really really works. I am down to using just this product and am so happy with it I can&#x27;t see myself changing any time in the future, I&#x27;ve read some reviews that people felt their hair was too greasy after using. It&#x27;s crucial that you suds it up (it doesn&#x27;t really lather, but pretend that it does, and go through the same motions to get the effect of which I speak) before you rinse it out to leave no residue. I also never use it as a leave in conditioner. Love it!!</li>
    <li> It is a good product but a little bit expensive. It does not produce foam. After use it, the hair is very soft.</li>
    <li> So I started using wen about a year and change ago when I started transitioning back to natural - curly hair. The product was great. It prevented breakage, it protected my curls, it made my hair soft and manageable I love it. However I can&#x27;t imagine it working well on straight hair that doesn&#x27;t need any added oils. Otherwise its great. I don&#x27;t use WEN alone, I use another organic shampoo first (like organix) and then use wen as a second shampoo / deep conditioner. I find this works best for me. I&#x27;ve tried just using the WEN alone...my hair was relatively clean but not as clean as I would like it.  I highly suggest making sure you shampoo once, with another organic shampoo before putting wen in.</li>
    <li> I stayed with it for a month like the directions say even though my hair was flat and GREASY!!!! My hair felt nasty!!! I do NOT like this product. I am using the left over for leave in conditioner. It works great for that. For the price there are better products out there! Don&#x27;t wast your money!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered wen once back in Feb.  Received it, hated it - it made my hair flat and my hair started falling out.  I immediately called up and canceled it.  They told me since I paid with a check there was no autorefill.  This was at least five months ago, if not more.  I have been receiving letters from them to come back at least a few times a month, but this is only mildly irritating.  Today I come home to find a package with a refill from them and a bill for almost $100.  Who the hell do they think they are, deciding my cancellation didn&#x27;t really want to be cancelled and just having the gall to send it to me with a bill.  And if I send it back I have to pay for shipping.  How freaking dare they!  Just spoke with a supervisor - claims they have no record of me trying to cancel the product, can&#x27;t explain why they&#x27;re suddenly sending it to me and say if I don&#x27;t pay to send it back to them they&#x27;ll send it to collections.  DO NOT EVEN GET YOUR INFO STARTED WITH THE COMPANY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had any particular hair problems.  My hair is naturally straight and is not especially oily or dry.  I bought this product simply because the idea of no longer using detergents on my hair was very appealing and I was interested in trying such a natural product.  And I&#x27;m in love with the results!  I thought my hair was healthy in the past, but now I see how far I was from it!  My hair stays full all day when it used to go flat by early afternoon.  It responds to heat, humidity, and rain better and is ridiculously shiny.  I know it&#x27;s pricey, but for me it was extremely worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was advertised as being great for &#x27;ethnic hair&#x27; ... true, it does soften the hair, but after a couple of weeks of use I noticed lots of breakage.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure I was going to see results from this product so I ordered a small size. I had stripped black hair dye out of my hair and was still struggling with crunchy, dry, frizzy hair.  All of this I knew to expect because of what I had put it through, but I wanted to keep it as healthy as possible. I am always doubtful of infomercial products, but I was desperate for anything. After the first wash, I could feel a difference. It wasn&#x27;t miraculously beautiful again, but it was better. Every wash it got smoother and softer. I then ordered the 16 oz. and a week later my hair almost feels like it did when it was healthy.  I went through a few days when my hair felt heavy, but now it&#x27;s full, shiny and soft. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does in another week and I really can&#x27;t wait to see my stylist to show her how good it looks! I may be a WEN girl for life!</li>
    <li> I saw the informercial and couldn&#x27;t really believe the claims.  But I bought a bottle anyway.  Me hair is exremely unmanageable, thick, wavy, coarse, dry, you name an issue, my hair has it. For years I kept my head shaved, just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with it. I have to say after 2 weeks of using this, I am impressed.  My hair is much more manageable, soft, and shiny.  Not quite the miracle I expected, but it was a huge improvement.  Makes a great leave in conditioner as well.  My spouse is jealous because my wild unruly \\&quot;crabman-like\\&quot; hair is now curly and soft.  I have also been accused of getting a perm by some.  So get, try it, be happy.</li>
    <li> The products are just whatever. Nothing special. You have to wash your hair everyday. By the 24th hour you&#x27;ll be super greasy. But the kicker? They send you a crap \\&quot;90 day\\&quot; supply and insist on charging you a non refundable $100. Even though I tried to cancel it and send it back unused. Nope. Waste of time and money. Go to you salon and find better products and buy them at your leisure, not because you&#x27;re being forced to.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I am very glad amazon offers Wen, like many other customers, since I HATE to be stuck in automatic reorders.     About 15 years ago I used to go to a natural hairdresser, who promoted not washing your hair everyday - and if really necessary, only wash it with actual shampoo every once in a while, other than that, there was a natural \\&quot;wash gel\\&quot; that was less harsh to your hair - and brush your hair every day with a natural bristle brush. This philosophy really worked well for my hair but unfortunately, we had to move and I had no more access to the fabulous products. I have to say that there is a transformation phase, when you are used to washing your hair every day, since your scalp is used to produce oil to protect your hair from drying out, every time you wash it, which means that you might end up with oily hair for while until your body realizes that it doesn&#x27;t have to keep up the production anymore.     This really promoted healthy hair growth for me and I actually had new hair growing in that I didn&#x27;t realize I lost before.    Now I finally found a product in Wen, that I can use just like the \\&quot;wash gel\\&quot; and only sometimes, when my hair gets \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; I wash with Aubrey&#x27;s organics shampoo. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday (my hair is curly but not to extreme - more like a very light perm-, medium thick, down to my bra line), I wash it 2 - 3 times a week with Wen and maybe 2 - 3 times a month with the shampoo. I brush my hair every day with the brush I mentioned and I have to say, it works for me. The shine is beautiful and the frizz at the ends is almost gone. I even think it grows faster. I only was at the hairdresser 3 times this year so far and it still looks very beautiful without too much damage. People notice the change in my hair - especially women.    I use about 5 - 6 pumps for each area (top, nape, both sides) and rub it into my scalp and hair really well until it feels \\&quot;slippery\\&quot;. Then I leave it in until I am done showering and rinse it REALLY WELL. Likesomebody else said: \\&quot;When you feel you are done keep rinsing for another minute.\\&quot;     I started using the 16 oz bottle at the end of August and still have half the bottle left.</li>
    <li> This product is not at all worth all the hype it is getting.  I have ethnic hair and it did absolutely nothing for my hair. It did not feel any better than when I used regular shampoo. I am very surprised that so many hollywood stars are endorsing this products.  Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but occasionally I need to take a break from this product.  It us also a bit pricy</li>
    <li> My husband is actually the one who first told me about Wen Haircare products.  He saw an infomercial and told me that I really should try it.  I&#x27;m always complaining about my hair being dull and lifeless.  I have thin hair that has a mind of its own and I&#x27;m always trying to find ways to give it more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some in my hair while in the shower and massaged my scalp and I felt all tingly and clean. You know that minty feeling you get in your mouth after you finish brushing your teeth? That&#x27;s what my head felt like. It was an amazing sensation that had a calming effect on me. I got out of the shower and used my hair dryer and my hair was full of life after just one use. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t heard more mentioned about the body your hair gets after using the Cleansing Conditioner. Ask my friend and fellow blogger Krista how much I talk about this stuff. I&#x27;m amazed at how it transformed my hair. I really need to try the other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Although this product is a good product, it isn&#x27;t really what I expected.  The best thing I think of is that when you sleep on your hair or wear a hat, your hair easily goes back into its place.  As far as the rest, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in my hair.  I already had soft water. Maybe people with hard water would notice more of a change. I am not sure if I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this item. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try since an overwhelming number of shoppers agreed that this item was nothing short of a miracle. While it doesn&#x27;t cure split ends, it does make the hair shiny and healthier looking. It also makes my hair supersoft - after I added a little biosilk silk therapy. My hair, with a tiny help from biosilk&#x27;s silk therapy, looks just like a Pantene commercial. I love it and will never go back to regular conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds but my hair was always frizzy. I did follow the instructions but only used half. After two weeks, I noticed the dramatic results.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on the $29.99 \\&quot;special\\&quot; offer.  Of course I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t read the fine print that they planned to charge me $98 dollars per month for the rest of eternity and send more of their horrible product. When I called to complain, the customer service person was very rude, stating, \\&quot;Well, some people just don&#x27;t read now, do they?\\&quot;  OK, admittedly, I did not read the fine print but that does not mean I have to like their sneaky business practices.  On top of that the product is horrible. I have fine hair and it leaves it a greasy, limp mess - almost like it looks wet. I am very unhappy with both the products and the business practices of this company. I highly discourage anyone from using it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 5 weeks. Fifty percent of my hair fell out.  I didn&#x27;t realize it until it was too late.  The hair that is left is soft and dry.  It is starting to look a little brighter since going back to Redkin&#x27;s AllSoft shampoo and conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t seem that this is a common occurance but it has happened for some.  QVC reimbursed me but the WEN company was not interested in knowing anything about my experience.   My hair is long and now half of it is gone.  It is made with urea which is sterilized urine.  My scalp sometimes smelled like enzymes.  I would notice it when I turned my head quickly.    I know many people like it but beware.  I&#x27;m so sad.</li>
    <li> Worst ever. Left my hair looking and feeling coated with oil. Smelt like cod liver oil. I have used Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner in the past. This is obviously not the same. The excuse that it uses Wen approved substitute ingredients is rather ridiculous. It&#x27;s like calling a polyester silk. They are not the same!</li>
    <li> My hair is actually pretty healthy because I don&#x27;t dye it, I don&#x27;t blowdry it, and I only wash it every other day. I love trying new hair products, so I decided to try Wen. I used the sweet almond cleansing conditioner, the styling cream, the remoist intensive hair treatment, and the texture balm. I hated all of the products except for the texture balm. The other products, especially the cleansing conditioner, left my hair greasy and unmanageable. I had a hard time combing through my hair because it caused tangles.</li>
    <li> I cannot say that I saw any difference in my hair after using this product.  Didn&#x27;t see the results promised.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> great product! it&#x27;s made my curly hair healthy looking and soft! a complete turn around from dry brittle frizzy hair! i also had an awful case of pregnancy dandruff and feel that this product has helped me get rid most of it! i must admit that i do not follow the suggested amount of pumps at each wash and still had great results! the suggested amount of pumps written on the bottle is too much and would probably cause my hair to be limp and greasy as many have complained! for the top half of my head, i use about 4-5 pumps and 6-8 pumps for the the bottom half/tips. i then use a wide tooth comb to detangle and spread the product on my head and then proceed to massage my scalp for a few minutes. i then leave the product on for 5-10 minutes! NOTE: i washed my hair 2x a day with the product in the first 2 weeks then every other day following that!</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and I have never used a product that has helped my thin fine hair like WEN.  Other conditioning products weigh my fine hair down. This product actually gives it body.   It was hard to get used to at first because our mindset is that lather cleans.( Lather also dries)    This product cleans and conditions very well.My hair shines and I am getting compliments.  It may not be for everyone but I love it and encourage people to try it.  .</li>
    <li> I adore this product! After ONE shampoo it left my hair wonderful smelling and soft and manageable. Touchable and behaved without ANY additional work. Just a natural air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could add a minimal amount of styling creme or gel and it has another look to it. Even between shampoos my hair is more manageable and soft to the touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick natural curls and most shampoos left my hair just horrible-like straw.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is all I need. I am shocked I dont even need an additional conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I save time and money on styling. PLUS my hair has never looked or felt or smelled better. I get compliments on my hair wherever I go from all kinds of people. I even get stopped in the store for advice LOL. There is no price for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful and I will NEVER EVER use regular shampoo again. My husband compliments my hair all the time now too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are skeptical just buy one 8oz bottle and follow the directions. If you have straight hair or fine add some water to the pumps so its not as thick and you can comb it out to the ends easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret trying this.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use it and see the results that so many customers experienced.  I tried it on 2 occasions and each time it made my entire scalp itch.  The second time I used it my ear lobes got red, swollen and itchy, lasting a week. So far, all sulfate-free shampoos make my skin itch.  What a disappointment.  I gave the bottle to my neighbor and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product especially for treated/dyed hair.  The 2nd day after using my hair still looks great, this is one of the differences from regular shampoo.  But it gets heavy by the 3rd day so I use every other day which is fine.  My family, friends and coworkers are now using it as well!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder-length, fine, wavy hair with long layers for body (of which it has none naturally). I color it, blow dry it straight every day because it gets greasy &amp; flat if I don&#x27;t wash it every day. It also gets super frizzy and flat in humidity. I decided to try it, in spite of the price! I like the smell of the almond mint, like the tingle in the scalp, like how soft it made my hair, BUT, like another reviewer, I also noticed that I got lots of scalp zits (Gross!), which I&#x27;ve never had before, and after a couple of days of using it (I followed directions to the letter), I thought my hair looked a little heavy &amp; greasy, not light and shiny. Now, I like using it about two to three times a week to give my hair a break from the daily shampooing, and I often use it as a conditioner after shampooing. Bottom line, it smells great, makes my hair soft, but works best if you rotate it with other products.</li>
    <li> This product was sort of cool because you don&#x27;t have to use shampoo and conditioner and your hair will still be clean but it didn&#x27;t make my hair look any better or feel healthier than shampoo and condioner. It smells nice and has a fresh tingly feeling while it is in your hair. For how much it costs, it isn&#x27;t worth the money. I won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
    <li> I first tried WEN about a year ago, ordering through a TV offer, which automatic delivery plan I immediately cancelled. I thought the product was very difficult to distribute effectively through my hair and I didn&#x27;t see the shine and bounce I was expecting.  I used up the cleanser and gave away two of the other four items in the kit, keeping the intensive conditioner and styling creme.  My shoulder length, naturally gray, colored hair is very fine and hairdressers have told me it&#x27;s very porous and dry.  I began using very small amounts of the WEN intensive conditioner to the ends of my dry hair and it helped, so I figured I&#x27;d try the cleanser again.  A tip from another reviewer recommended adding some water to the cleanser before spreading it onto you hair, and that&#x27;s what I do most of the time. My hair looks much healthier with the WEN, even after torturing it with hot rollers every day, so I&#x27;m going to continue with it.  But next time I&#x27;ll buy the formula for fine hair.  The one complaint I have is the pump bottle...I wish it would come in a tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping this on my wish-list for over a year. Finally bought it. The context; I&#x27;m over 40, and have very dry wavy hair. I use mild shampoo, and rich conditioner. Some light product afterwards.    The instructions on the number of pumps needed is ridiculous. I wound up settling on 6 pumps only and it cleaned just fine for my medium/short hair. I used it as the only product for 2 weeks to give it a fair shake. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, unless the price comes WAY down. Just isn&#x27;t so wonderful that I want to spend that much money. But my hair did feel nice, just not much different from the shampoo/conditioner I was using before.    [UPDATED FEB 2011]  So the bottle finally got super low, and I realized that I had defaulted to using Wen more than my other shampoo(s). I would try to switch back to shampoo for a week, but would wind up returning to Wen after just 3 days or so. It really is a good product - I bought it again ($28 for 16 oz is still rather steep, but it does last a while if you don&#x27;t need to use the amounts they recommend). I upped the star to one more, would give it 5 if the price would come down a bit. I have colored my hair a few times, some highlighting and one overall coloring, and it is silky smooth despite that, thanks to Wen. I&#x27;ve quit using product, and just do a pea-sized bit of Wen on my palm and add water, then scrunch through my hair to keep it wavy all day. The same on days when I don&#x27;t have time to get my hair wet - the damp hands with a pea of Wen revives my waves/curls.</li>
    <li> It smells good but made my hair way too greasy. My hair always looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it and forget about styling it. My hair had no volume and would just look very flat like a cow lick... not a good look. I expected that bouncy hair you see on the infomercial but it didn&#x27;t happen for me.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients on the bottle. This stuff leaves hair sticky and heavy. Weighs down your hair if it is fine or thin and leaves it without any body. Might be alright for thick, dry, frizzy hair but even at that still leaves it feeling gummy. You can get the same results for just a dollar or two from the grocery store. It&#x27;s called baking soda. Dissolve a teaspoonful in a glass of water and , leave it in a few seconds then rinse and go. If you want to you can leave it in. Try both ways and see what works best for you. Read the ingredient labels everything you need to know is there.</li>
    <li> Wow - after 3 days my fine, shoulder length hair which was in excellent condition became dry &amp; brittle.  Plus there&#x27;s no way this bottle would last the time it says it should.  Not worth prices.  Total scam in terms of product claims</li>
    <li> I have just tried Wen after trying every other product on the super market shelves. WOW! I think I have just solved a major case of the fuzzies.... I did swallow hard when I saw the price, but have quickly realised that they are not joking when they say that it relpaces all other products! I have a jaw length bob type style, and I used a lot less than it states on the bottle - about 4 pumps - and then 1/2 pump as a leave in conditioner. I have curly hair that has been unruley for years, and as I work on a farm I tend to need to wash my hair every day. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference after just one wash! It has heaps of body and bounce, and is easy to stlye with just a blow drier (no starghteners needed) or I can leave it to air dry for bouncy curls. This is one very happy customer!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would.  I thought it might just be my hair (I have thick, wavy hair) so my daughter tried it too.  No improvement for either of us.  Very disappointing...the commercials made it look so impressive like our hair would be shiny and soft...</li>
    <li> I love WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.  You have to give it a chance and get used to the fact that it does not soap up like a regular shampoo which takes a little getting used to.  Once you do, you can feel the difference if you have to use a regular shampoo and then a conditioner. I have very thin hair with a lot of body, but it frizzies if it gets too dryed out or on a humid day.  WEN keeps it soft and silky, and the frizzies to a minimum.  You actually save time and money by using this one product instead of 2 -3 other products.  I alway make sure I do not run out and have a small travel bottle that I keep in my overnite bag.  Give it a try, and try it more than once to get used to it.  You won\\&quot;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does not strip your hair of vital nutrients which contribute to soft, shiny, manageable hair.  Will continue to use this product.  Without it, my hair is coarse and sticks out all over the place and is not manageable.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product is HORRIBLE if you have fine hair. I attempted to use WEN for 2 weeks and my hair was disgusting. It was SO OILY! I went to my hairdresser after 2 weeks who told me that my scalp was actually dirty and she did not feel that it had been cleansed. It is way too heavy for women who have fine hair. Do NOT WASTE your money on this product!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.  I have found WEN to be the best thing that ever happened to my over-processed hair.  I am not about to stop coloring , but my hair was thinning and so matted after shampooing.  I have been using WEN for less than a year and from the first use the difference was amazing.  I have experimented with different kinds of WEN and my hair like some more than others.  I have never had bad results.  My hair is shiny, thicker, and bouncy.  I think is worth a try if you have problem dry hair.  DO NOT order it from the infomercial- that company has terrible service and they will put you on auto delivery. Start with the Sweet Almond Mint for any hair type.  If you have problem scalp use Tea Tree, thin hair Lavender,  dry hair- the Pomegrante or Fig is best.  But I have had good results with all of them. You must rinse for at least two minutes to avoid greasy or oily feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN as my regular shampoo for 3 months now.  I find it makes my hair full and manageable. I will continue to use WEN as long as I am able to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Keeps my over processed hair soft,shiny, and manageable. Very pleased. Will continue to use. Goodbye to shampoo forever!!</li>
    <li> ok..I didn&#x27;t order from the website but I did order from Amazon.I tried this for the first time today.  AMAZING!  I have waist long dark, thick, heavy, curly hair in which I usually only wash 2-3 times a week.  I straighten it about 1-2x a week.  My hair is in good shape to begin with, but today it looks fabulous!  I used 40 pumps on my hair and followed the directions to a T.  I rinsed with a lot of water before, 40+ pumps and really worked it in with a little splash of water.  Used a comb to run it through my hair and rised for 2-3 minutes after leaving it on for 5+ minutes.  I used 2 pumps as a leave in.  My hair is smooth, I curled the ends and they are holding wonderfully!  My hair is shiny and soft and no flyaways and split ends.  Im buying more right now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle of Wen cleansing conditioner. My hair is short and fine. After using Wen the first time I noticed my hair was very soft but flat. I was not able to do much with my hair. To give this product the benefit of doubt, I am going to continue to use this bottle until it is gone to see if the texture of my hair changes to something more manageable. Another thing, the instructions say to use 16-24 pumps of cleansing conditioner. There is no way I need to use that much on my hair. If I did, the bottle would be gone in a few days.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN products and find that when I have my hair colored the color does not last.  I don[t beleive the color is being stripped, but rather is harder to absorb due the hair shaft being smoothed with WEN products.   Is there a better choice in WEN Cleansing Conditioners that I should use?</li>
    <li> As a male, I think I may offer a different perspective on this product.  I&#x27;ve always had very curly, dry, frizzy hair and have struggled with finding the right products to keep my hair moisturized, clean, and non frizzy.  Regular shampoo with Sulfates dries my hair to the point that it brakes off, so I began using conditioner but my hair was still pretty dry.  So, I decided to give Wen a try.    After using Wen for 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my hair.  My curls are more relaxed, less frizzy, and my hair feels more moisturized, and never breaks off as before.  I even think my hair may be getting thicker too.  Wen cleans my hair very effectively, never leaves buildup or residue, and is definitely a drastically better alternative to shampoo.  Immediately after the first use, my hair gained a lot of color and life that it lost due to the harsh effects of shampoo; it brings out your natural highlights.  However, I&#x27;m not totally convinced that Wen is the &#x27;total package.&#x27;  My hair is somewhat coarse once it dries and not as moisturized as I would like.  I&#x27;ve considered using a separate conditioner after cleansing with Wen, and perhaps that would leave my hair more moisturized.   Overall, Wen is definitely a product worth trying.  Yes it&#x27;s quite expensive, but it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually relaxed my wild curls, so for that I was very surprised.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants healthier hair.  Don&#x27;t continue to damage your hair with harsh shampoos.</li>
    <li> I, like many others got sucked into the infomercial and just had to have this product.  I was so impressed to see all the shiny, bouncy, clean hair and all with one product.  It seemed revolutionary and I figured this was worth the money.  My first stop was the official Wen website but I got scared away by being automatically signed up for auto-delivery.  i learned from my experience with another infomercial product that I better not do this as it&#x27;s nearly impossible to cancel.  My next stop was Amazon and I didn&#x27;t mind spending a lot of money since it was such a huge bottle.  To my surprise, when I received the product you have to use a rediculous amount of Wen to get your hair clean.  My large bottle was half gone after 2 weeks!!!  As for how well it cleans, I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone I know.  My hair feels heavy, weighed down and dirty.  I have read the lengthy instructions on the back of the bottle, been to their website, watched demonstrations and still don&#x27;t have any luck with getting my hair shiny and clean like they claim.  If a shampoo is that complicated to use then I don&#x27;t have any need for it. I also spent more money on the styling product only to have that make my hair a million times more greasy feeling. After a couple of weeks of putting my hair in a pony tail because it felt so god awful I decided to go back to my two dollar a bottle Suave and my hair once again felt clean, bouncy, was shiny and more manageable.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I saw this on an infomercial and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. I used it for about 2 weeks and couldn&#x27;t stand it. My hair felt gross and unwashed and when I blew it dry, it would kind of smoke. (i think from the wax in it) It might make a fine conditioner, but it did not make my hair clean AT ALL.</li>
    <li> First I have to say this. For those of you who didn&#x27;t purchase the item why would you post a review?? Why not just post your concerns under a review closer to your own personal \\&quot;feelings\\&quot; about this product. Why insult the people who did purchase this and enjoyed it. That&#x27;s just rude. Anyway, I never saw the infomercial that has been mentioned; I purchased mines through QVC. I love it. I&#x27;ve been using mine for over two years now. I didn&#x27;t know that it was available through Amazon, until I came across it by accident. I love how this makes my hair look and feel. I had to get use to this very different method of \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; my hair, but it was worth it. My scalp tends to become dry, and itchy especially during the winters here in Michigan. The Wen Cucumber works great to keep the itching and dryness away. My hair is very thick and very long. I had to experiment to find the number of pumps needed to get the results I wanted. I have recommended this product to numerous people and now I&#x27;ll let them know that Amazon carries it. If you need cleansing tips then go to this site [...] Look under Chaz&#x27;s Tips.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after watching the t.v. ads for it.  I have always had dry hair.  This product made my hair feel flat, coated and greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..my hair is so soft, shinny, easy to manage, my color isn&#x27;t fading. My hair feels healthy. I will always use this. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this, like most people, after seeing the informercial on TV.  I have thick, coarse hair, a dry scalp but with oily roots.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from sulfate free shampoos to head and shoulders, to pricy salon shampoos, and nothing seemed to do the trick.  My hair either got dried out or greasy, and nothing helped my dry scalp.  So I decided to spend the money and buy this product.  The first two times I did this, I did it the way it tells you to in the pamphlet that came with the product.  BIG MISTAKE.  Don&#x27;t do it how the pamphlet says to do it (rinsing with cool water first, then sectioning your hair into four parts).  It didn&#x27;t cleanse my roots so it made my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days.  Then I went on the website and saw how Chaz Dean did it, though I&#x27;m not really sure why there&#x27;s two different ways you should do this product.  Follow the instructions on the website or the informercial.  My hair feels great and my scalp is no longer dry.  My hair still kind of looks the same, but the frizz isn&#x27;t as bad and my hair is shinier and softer.  The only downside is, since I have really long thick hair, I have to use a lot, and like others have said, there&#x27;s not enough product to last you even three weeks with thick long hair.  But, if I have to shell out twice as much money to have healthier hair, than I&#x27;d rather do that than have to keep experienting with shampoos.</li>
    <li> We saw this infomercial last week while in New Orleans. As a fan of Melissa Gilbert, I saw that she used it and she really does have pretty red hair. So I decided to try it. We received it a few days ago. I tried it the first time, per the directions. I also used a tiny gloop as a leave in conditioner afterwards. I did notice my hair was soft, but no softer than with my regular products (Nexxus, Paul Mitchell, Biolage). That first time of usage,  my hair became very oily. It felt heavy, and took a horribly long time to blow dry. The next time I used it, which was last night. I didn&#x27;t use the leave in conditioner. It was slightly less oily, but still I had to wash it soon thereafter. I really wanted to like this product. But I feel that it is for people with dry or frizzy hair. My hair is long, fine/thick combo, and did not benefit from extra oil. My mom has dry, colored hair and its going to stay in her shower for her usage.</li>
    <li> I am like most of the other people writing about this product. I bought it from the infomercial. I have zillions of products in my linen closet, under my sink, in my shower - ALL with the hopes that something would help my very curly hair. I have tried virtually everything!!! I&#x27;m over 50 and have all the hair problems associated with age, menopause, etc. This product is exactly what they advertise. In one week, my hair was restored to the beautiful soft curls of my youth. BUY IT! But ... don&#x27;t buy from the website. Buy it here. But definitely BUY IT! By the way, I trashed every single product in my house except WEN! This is a true story!!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to deliver, but it fell very short of my expectations.  Especially considering the nerve of the company to charge so much money, plus so much for shipping, I&#x27;d think they would make a product that did what they claimed.  This particular fragrace (which was really the only good thing about it) promised to cater to those with fine hair, so being that I have fine hair, I tried it.  Much to my chagrin, it did not cleanse my hair at all, but made it look greasy.  Frankly, it was like using a plain conditioner with no shampoo.  Don&#x27;t buy it unless you have VERY dry hair, and even then, I&#x27;d invest in something much cheaper!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after reading the reviews on Amazon and seeing the commercial on TV. I have short, color-treated, very straight hair which was looking very dry and brittle. Even though everyone in the testimonials seems to have long hair, I gave it a try. It works great! My hair was soft and shiny immediately after the first use. It took a while to figure out how much to use - I only use it 2 or 3 times a week, and just rinse my hair on the other days. I only need 12-15 pumps. They recommend putting in one pump to leave on, I only do this occasionally overnight and rinse it out in the morning. The leave-in tends to weigh down my straight hair too much and it doesn&#x27;t style as well if I leave it in. I&#x27;m glad i bought it from Amazon instead of getting on a regular schedule of shipments as I don&#x27;t need to use it everyday, and will just reorder when I&#x27;m ready for more. I love the smell. My hair feels clean and healthy. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I was using wen sweet almond mint and decided to stop and go back to regular shampoo etc.  I had no idea you could get it here on amazon.  I loved the product, but I too was dissappointed that it did not last long enough what with all that pumping.  I didn&#x27;t like the auto shipments either.  I love the product and am going to purchase it through Amazon.  I must admit I do use it as a conditioner only, I use a shampoo too. I started doing this because it didn&#x27;t last long enough.  In the beginning I followed the directions and used it as a cleanser/conditioner.  Now that I can get it without all the fuss I will go back to using it only.  I have colored treated and highlighted hair, down to about the middle of my back.  I do hope this review will help anyone looking into this product.</li>
    <li> Overall I really like the WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.  The idea of using something that is more natural than harsh shampoos was really appealing. The product leaves my hair VERY soft and makes my fine hair feel thicker.  My hair is so soft after using the product that I have to use more styling product on it to get my hair to curl.  Since I haven&#x27;t purchased the WEN Styling Creme yet, I&#x27;m not sure if this would resolve my styling issue.  Please note - You DON&#x27;T need to use the full recommended amount of product.  I have hair just above my shoulders and only need 4-6 pumps total to clean my hair.  Also, I use only 1/2 to 1 pump for the leave in conditioner. This product does what it promises - it has now replaced my shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, detangler and leave-in conditioner.  I have also noticed that my \\&quot;color\\&quot; is lasting much longer.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the styling creme next, followed by the balm.  Give it a try, I think you will be surprised at how well this product works.  Be prepared - shipping and handling charges were expensive at over $8.00 which ups you overall total cost by 30%.  These charges are set by WEN and not Amazon, but still very disappointing.  If you can get over the markup of the shipping, you will really enjoy this product!</li>
    <li> My hair looked fantastic with this product but it is expensive. I find my hair still looks good if I use WEN 3-4 times a week, then my regular shampoo on the other few days a week. I generally don&#x27;t use conditioner daily because it weighs my hair down so much, same for styling products. This product seems to find a suitable balance for my particular hair (fine, thinning) The product also feels good to use: very creamy. Nice smell, too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for one month.  I have naturally curly hair that is color treated and very dry. My hair was badly damaged when I begn using Wen.  My hair is in much better condition since using this product.  I use Wen every day, and I followed the instructions on the bottle.  I would recommend this product. I did not lose any curl; however, I did not gain manageability.  My hair has also developed shine, whish is wonderful!!  My only only concern about this product is that it is expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sweet Almond Cleansing Conditioner for over a year.  One of my coworkers was passing by me one day and I noticed a significant difference in the appearance of her hair.  When I asked her what she was doing she told me about Wen.  It is AWESOME.  First of all, if you don&#x27;t use enough IT WON&#x27;T WORK.  You must be willing to commit to using the appropriate amount of product or you will be disappointed.  I have asthma and don&#x27;t have a reaction to the smell as well - love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Sweet Almond Mint but it didn&#x27;t work that well with my hair. After a couple of days of using it my hair was really greasy and lacked volume. When I tried to use other products it made my hair even worse. I&#x27;ve ended up using shampoo again and finally my hair is back to normal. Way too expensive for what it is!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I was extremely skeptical about this product becuz most infomercial products are cr*p, but I was totally desperate and after researching it on QVC, Amazon, and reading numerous reviews on it, I decided to take a chance and slap down the $. I received this exact cleansing conditioner by itself in the mail over a week ago and I&#x27;ve used it for 8 straight days now.....OMG!!! It works EXACTLY as promised (huge surpise to me!!) I seriously cannot believe how soft my hair is. I am 37yrs old and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single morning, by noon it is a total greaseball! However, when I DID wash it every morning with normal shampoo, it was dry and brittle. I could never get a happy medium. Before buying this stuff, I also tried using just conditioner (no shampoo) on my hair, thinking it would probably get the same results as this stuff. Nope, it was totally greasy by noon. Using Wen Almond cleansing conditioner makes my hair perfectly soft and hydrated thruout the entire day (like it was when I was 22!) without ANY greasiness! Just follow the instructions EXACTLY as they read on the bottle: I personally...1) Run water completely thru hair first 2) I use 12 pumps of Wen on my hair cuz my hair is very thin and just past my shoulders 3) I massage it in really good 4) I thoroughly comb thru my hair so the Wen is completely distributed 5) I pile it all on top of my head and put a shower cap over it 6) then I shower for 5 minutes with it soaking in 7) then I rinse completely for at least 3 minutes and towel/air dry. I use a non-sulfate clarifying shampoo once every 10 days. That&#x27;s it!! This stuff rocks and I&#x27;ll probly use it the rest of my life!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching the Infocommercial. I was hesitant from all the promises so instead of buying it from the 800 number I bought it online to try it. A hair cleanser that costs so much should be so much better than all the other less expensive ones, right? Absolutely not!     My biggest problem with the product is the time it takes to use. It states that you should apply ~30 pumps, leave on, splash water on your hair, massage into scalp, comb through then finally wash out. You can apply more then as a leave in conditioner. If this was a once a month thing then fine but to do this everytime you wash your hair is ridiculous.     Second when I rinsed by hair after letting it sit about 10 minutes my hair felt coarse, not silky as promised. Only when I used some as a leave in conditioner did it feel silky and I could comb out my hair.     Interestingly as some other people have commented, I too, did not have oily hair with this product the following day, but the 2nd day I was definitely in need of another wash. I began to get tired of the whole routine so I would wash my hair with another shampoo then just use this as a conditioner. It&#x27;s really nothing special though.     I&#x27;ve used other products where my hair was much more shiny and smooth. I do believe Chaz&#x27;s point that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is bad for your hair. I went to Sally Beauty Supply store and found other great Sulfate-free Shampoo and conditioner: Colorgen \\&quot;professional care for color-treated hair, moisturing shampoo, Sulfate-fre, Antioxidant, Intensive Color Retention.\\&quot; Conditioner: UV filter, antioxidant, color stabilizer.\\&quot; This stuff is awesome! Normal price is $[...] for 12oz (Sally card: $[...]). I would DEFINITELY recommend these hair products over Wen. Spend your money and TIME more wisely.     To see another great review on Wen go to:  [...]</li>
    <li> I have used many products on my fine, straight, thin hair over the years.  I saw the infomercial and thought ... this is another gimmick.  But a friend used the product and loved it, saying it was the best thing she&#x27;s ever used on her hair, so I tried it.   It is by far the most amazing my hair has ever looked and felt.   It isn&#x27;t like any product you have ever used before -- it is so gentle and smells natural and pure, not synthetic, and your hair feels weightless when you apply, and afterward. It&#x27;s hard to describe how wonderful it feels, but if you use it, you are in for a treat! I also use it on my dog (suggested) and even she feels/looks/smells great.  I can&#x27;t imagine using any other product again.</li>
    <li> this product did NOT work for my fine, thin, straight hair.  It never felt clean, was greasy, flat and weighed down.  yuck.</li>
    <li> I am African American with 4b type hair, this product is not what I thought it would be. I have dry hair and after I washed it ,it was very dry and brittle. I will stick to using shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the Wen hair Almond Mint Shampoo.  It is hard in the beginning to get used to, but give it a good chance and you will like it more and more. I like it because I dont use alot of other products in my hair and feels perfect with the one step washing. It&#x27;s great on my color, and doesnt fade it.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s a thing, for those who are new to sulfate free shampoo, the whole idea is not use detergent to clean your hair like most regular shampoo so if you use a lot of styling products like gel, hairspray, moose, or those silicon base serum that result in lots of buildup, this WILL NOT effectively clean your hair.  I don&#x27;t use styling products so I love sulfate free products, gently clean without stripping hair of natural beneficial oil.  But even as a sulfate free shampoo, for those of you who are like me with oily scalps, this WILL NOT give you that clean feeling if you want to skip washing your hair everyday.  However though, aside from the dirty feeling it left on my scalp, I LOVE what it does for my hair.  I tried it as intended for about two weeks and I really can&#x27;t stand it, as much as I love my hair after I shower, I always feel gross and dirty at the end of the day.  So I went back to my other brand of sulfate free shampoo and use the WEN as a leave in conditioner instead.  After you do what you do in the shower, take one pump of this stuff, maybe even less depend on your hair length and type, and massage it throughout your hair, avoid the roots, then I usually seal it in with a touch of hair oil and let it air dry.  It leaves my hair feeling and looking amazing.  Because I use it in this fashion, a bottle lasted me forever so the price doesn&#x27;t seem that bad.  Once a week, I use this as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair blonde hair, I really wanted this to work as explained in the info-mercials, it does not. It does nothing that any conditioner run through your hair can do. Before I purchased this product I was using 3 minute miracle in the same way. I was suprised to see a product made exclusively for this purpose so I purchased WEN. I was also suprised by the cost as wall as shipping expense. Invest in a $4.00 bottle of 3 minute miracle from the grocery store and you&#x27;ll get the same results! Unless you have more money than you know what to do with.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this product!  It is gentle, smells good and does what it says.  My hair is color treated. I have been doing it myself for over 40 years with NO problems.  Recently I decided to try one of those drugstore kits.  OMG! It \\&quot;fried\\&quot; my hair.  Then I saw this product on an \\&quot;infomercial\\&quot; and decided to try it, to fix my hair.  It worked and I love it.  My hair is soft, silky, shiny with lots of body.  Thank you Chaz Dean and WEN!</li>
    <li> I would have given a 5-star rating but I still keep a bottle of shampoo in the house for backup.  The directions tell you to use 16 pumps of Wen, which for me was too much and by the end of the first week I had to shampoo.  What I do like about the product is that it is great on my color treated hair.  It is soft and manageable yet never fades my dark brown hair color.  I plan to re-order today!</li>
    <li> The Wen Cleansing conditioner is wonderful. When I first used it I wasn&#x27;t sure because it seemed so strange to not have lather. My hair is so shiney and I love it.I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have healthy shiney hair.</li>
    <li> I really never write reviews for anything I buy online (and I shop online quite a bit), but I felt like I should in this case. I absolutely love Wen. My hair, when I am not using Wen Cleansing Conditioner, is very dry, frizzy, and a little bit wavy. It also tangles very easily and I can feel that I&#x27;m losing hair and causing damage every time I brush it. I ordered this bottle of the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner after I saw a commercial for it on tv and figured I would at least give it a shot since I was so frustrated with my hair. When I first started using it I was a little grossed out because my hair seemed more oily than normal, but I stuck with it and was careful to rinse my hair very well. The longer I used it, the better my hair felt, and my hair also did not get greasy at the roots as fast like it had before. It made my hair super soft, super shiny, tangle free, and actually defined the waves in my hair. After I used up the whole bottle, I decided it was too expensive and that maybe regular conditioner would do the same thing. This worked for a little while, but the condition of my hair gradually deteriorated to the way it was before I used Wen. Now I am scraping together the leftovers from my Mom&#x27;s bottle of Lavender Wen until my new bottle arrives in the mail, because I don&#x27;t want to use anything else anymore! The only complaint I have is that the pump does not work very well once you get down to the last inch or so of Cleansing Conditioner in the bottle, but I have just been taking the pump out and shaking out the right amount that I know works best for my hair. Also, I never have used as much as they say to use on the bottle and it has worked out just fine for me. I ordered the Cucumber Aloe to try this time and I can&#x27;t wait for it to get here. This is like nothing I have ever used before, and has made such a difference in my hair. As soon as I find which scent I like the best, I will be ordering the gallon sized jug!</li>
    <li> First off, if you want to try it, DON&#x27;T BUY IT FROM THEIR WEBSITE!  Buying it from someplace else like Amazon is a smarter idea than what I did.  I bought from the wenhaircare website and they sent me another 90-day package, which I didn&#x27;t order, when I was about to return my 30-day package bottles.  I already opened the second box not knowing what it was, so I hope when I send these bottles back they&#x27;ll at least not charge me for the next two months.    The hair care process is a bit more time-consuming than I hoped for.  You wet hair THOROUGHLY (1-2 minutes), lather 16-32+ pumps into hair (3-4 minutes), comb through (1 minute), leave it in for duration of shower (however long that means for you -- keep lathering throughout shower), rinse (1-2 minutes -- it&#x27;s a lot of product to rinse out), apply leave-in conditioner and styling creme.  You have to really focus on what you&#x27;re doing with the Wen in you hair, so not only does that take more effort than regular shampooing and conditioner, but more time in the shower (which, for water conservers may be a big downside).  The product is also thick enough to clog a weak drain, so be careful.    My last downside is that the 30-day or 90-day packages do not last that long.  Following Chaz&#x27;s instructions of using about 40 pumps every time I shower, my regimen lasted no more than 16 days.  My advice is to use as LITTLE of it at a time as possible.  He recommends the more the merrier; I say, use a moderate amount (at most 12 pumps for REALLY THICK hair in the shower) and cleanse more frequently than before.    Now for the results: it&#x27;s pretty good.  I&#x27;m a Polynesian woman living in tropical Hawaii with thick, curly hair.  My only damage has come from one at-home relaxer years ago, pregnancy, and genetic hair loss.  Curly hair like mine needs a lot of products to get it to listen to you.  This one was no exception.  For cleansing and making my hair feel soft and healthy, it did its job well; for making it LOOK soft and healthyand bouncy and curly, it needed some help.  But I&#x27;m having a hard time going back to mousse and gel since using this, so now I have to find other styling solutions.  Living in humid weather always adds to the frizz factor, but I thought this would at least ameloriate the situation a bit.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this 2 different times. I started with the cucumber mint and loved it. When I went to reorder it they were out so I decided to try the Sweet Almond Mint. I love that even more!! I have a lot of hair but it is fine. My main concern when ordering this was that it would weigh my hair down and it would look flat and oily. This did not happen at all! I think when people say it did make their hair feel dirty the problem may be not rinsing it out completely. All of the steps do take a lot of time from saturating your hair to massaging the conditioner in to leaving it it to finally rinsing it out. I probably take the most time out of the process to make sure I rinse everything completely. I read somewhere that when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed your hair enough rinse it for 2 minutes longer. I have followed that and have had no issues with my hair not feeling clean. I wash my hair every other day and even on the 3rd day with Wen it looks far cleaner than with any of the other shampoos/conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;m picky!)and my hair looks SO much better (and I thought it looked pretty good before). It is kind of expensive but it is SO worth it. Just remember RINSE, RINSE, RINSE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I fell victim to an infomercial.  I had high hopes for this shampoo.  My hair tends to be frizzy, and it&#x27;s thick and semi-wavy.  I had hoped this shampoo would make it more managable.  I had been told by a friend that sulfate-free shampoos will give you cave woman hair.  I just laughed at her.  But she was right!  After the first 2 washes with Wen, I was impressed.  My hair did seem more managable and easier to style.  But after a week I could do nothing with my hair!  My styling time increased from 15 minutes to an hour!  My hair was frizzy and wavier than ever!  It really did look like cave woman hair.  Additionally, my scalp started to itch.  I spent an entire day at work scratching my head.  By the time I got home, my scalp was very red and still itching!  I switched back to my normal shampoo (Pantene), and the itching was gone within 2 days.  My dermatologist suggested that I might have been allergic to the \\&quot;natural ingredients.\\&quot;  If you have allergies to pollen, you might want to avoid this product.  I am allergic to tree and grass pollens, and this is why my doctor thinks I had a reaction to it.  I did use Wen on my son&#x27;s naturally curly hair, and it worked great for him.  If you have naturally straight or naturally curly hair, you will probably be pleased.  But if you have semi-wavy or frizzy hair, you may want to stick with a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Always Been Really Protective Of My Hair, I Don&#x27;t Blow It Dry Or Color It Or Put All Kinds Of Gunk In It.  I Usually Keep It Long &amp; All One Length, It&#x27;s Quite Fine.  It&#x27;s Always Been Very Nice And Soft Until Recently.  I Made The Decision To Get It Cut &amp; Put Some Long Layers In It That Surround My Face, About Two Weeks After Doing That All Of A Sudden My Head Was Very Oily &amp; It Would Look Like I Hadn&#x27;t Washed My Hair In A Week, Now I Have Always Used Pantene &amp; Loved It, But It Just Wasn&#x27;t Working.  My Hair Wasn&#x27;t Soft Anymore Either.  I Was Starting To Really Freak Out - I Saw This On The Paid Program Ad And Wanted To Try It.  I Was Dumb &amp; Ordered It From Their Web Site Before Checking Here, Which I Usually Don&#x27;t Do(Got A Little Over Excited I Guess)It Took Me Forever To Get It(It Was A Month) &amp; I Called Them &amp; Told Them That I Wanted To Cancell The Automatic Shipments That They Sign You Up For Before They Sent Them Out, So We&#x27;ll See How That Goes.  I Was Skeptical, But I&#x27;ve Been Using It For A Week Now &amp; It&#x27;s A Miracle!  My Hair Is Soft Again &amp; I Can Wear It Down &amp; It Doesn&#x27;t Look Oily.  I Was Afraid It Would Be To Heavy For My Fine Hair, But It Doesn&#x27;t Seem To Be.  I Curled My Hair Yesterday &amp; It Looked Very Nice It Still Held The Curl All Day Without Any Styling Products Or Hair Spray So I&#x27;m Very Impressed!  It Really Does Work-I think The Main Thing You Have To Be Careful Of Is Making Sure It&#x27;s Rinsed Out Really Well.  I Only Use 8 Pumps(Not The Oh My God Amount They Say)&amp; I Rinse &amp; Rinse &amp; Rinse Till My Hair Squeaks.  The Only Downfall Is The Price.  I Still Have To Figure Out How I&#x27;m Going To Keep Paying For It Because Like Most Of Us I&#x27;m Not An Heiress.  But I Have To Say It Is Great Stuff.  I Would Recommend It To Anyone, It Saved Me From A Nevous Breakdown.</li>
    <li> For starters, please note I am not Mark, I am a gal with very curly, fine, thickish hair, layered and about shoulder length.  I have always wanted straight hair (not in the cards) so I blow dry it.  It tends to frizz (I just got an ionic blower and am hoping that will help).    I&#x27;d characterize my hair as a bit dry.  And I use semipermanent color in it now that I&#x27;m getting gray.  I do not wash it every day, maybe twice a week (it would be interesting to know if some of the people who like Wen are using it daily?)    Long story short, it does not clean you scalp the way a \\&quot;foaming\\&quot; shampoo does, and I like a really clean scalp/hair.   It gets COLD having it sit up on your head while you shower, probably because of the rosemary oil in it.    Finally, it made my hair shiny, but oily.  Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have added in that little bit for \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot;?  At any rate my hair went too flat, which is not the look I wanted.  I went back in the shower and washed the Wen OUT.  Now my hair looks better.    Maybe Wen can be used but without the extra they say to put in or not as a shampoo at all but afterwards before you style?    I dunno, but it did not work when I followed directions to the letter (only not as much pumped on as they say).    For me, definitely not as good as Herbal Essences shampoo w/ Organix conditioner, or Fructis conditioner or L&#x27;Oreal conditioner.    Well, I tried!</li>
    <li> That is what Wen is so just go out and buy some Suave and save the other 25.00 for something that is actually good. As for the seller I must say shipping and communication were excellant!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for over a year now and I love it!  I am African-American with long hair that is chemically relaxed.  I noticed a change in my hair as soon as I used Wen and my hair has only gotten better.  It&#x27;s softer, easier to comb out when wet and it doesn&#x27;t shed as much as it did when I used regular shampoo.  I do exactly as the instructions say and the results are great.  I love Wen!  Thanks Chaz Dean for making such a great product!  I plan to use Wen for the rest of my life!!</li>
    <li> I oredered this product from the company and really liked the way it made my hair feel but the price was outrageous.  I looked it up here and found it at the lowest price ever.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I do love this product, as conditioner. I don&#x27;t think my scalp feels clean enough, even when/if it really cleans. I have been using this for over a year, I have long thick hair and I only need 3-4 pumps out each wash. I still wash my hair with any shampoo before and use Wen as conditioner afterwards. My hair still feel healthier even when I don&#x27;t get the whole benefits if I were only using Wen. Most of my hairdressers recommend not to wash my hair (with shampoo) too often and some of them actually recommend to never use shampoo at all, just warm water and conditioner, like what Wen meant for. I guess that&#x27;s best but I still can&#x27;t do it without shampoo. Overall I&#x27;m happy with Wen, this is the 2nd time I bought from Amazon within 12 months, it lasts quite long.</li>
    <li> I have long, straight hair that I have to wash daily if I don&#x27;t want greasy roots.  My ends are dry and get tangled easily.  I got this for Christmas and used it exactly as directed.  Honestly, my hair was exactly the same after using it.  I noticed no difference and neither did anyone else who saw me (I asked).  I won&#x27;t buy this again even though it&#x27;s supposed to be better for your hair because it&#x27;s way too much money!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff. It makes my hair very soft and healthy looking and it smells great. But it&#x27;s very expensive and you have to use so much of it that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;m not sure yet if I&#x27;m willing to spend the money on another bottle.</li>
    <li> This is great, I only use it occasionally to keep my hair feeling healthy and it works! Great Product!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The scent is wonderful and my hair has never been so shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I bought this product -  the pump did not work -  Used 4 times and my hair looks worse then ever.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the Wen poduct. Seems like over-priced  all-in-one-conditioner.  I never felt my hair was as full and bouncy as the ads suggested it would be.  I used it for a few weeks, now it sits in the guest bathroom awaiting overnight company.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003PXZI2O WEN BY CHAZ DEAN SWEET ALMOND CONDITIONER,STYLING CREME, RE-MOIST MASK INTENSIVE HAIR TREATMENT,TEXTURE BALM,WIDE TOOTH SHOWER COMB,5 PIECE SET]]  As a fellow insomniac, I thought I would try the starter pack as shown on the infomercial (NOTE: If you buy the starter kit from the TV, you get another product, the volumizer). My hair is baby-fine, but damaged from coloring. Here&#x27;s my experience with the Wen products: As stated by others, you DON&#x27;T need to use all the pumps as recommended--you&#x27;ll find how many pumps you need to coat your hair (let the pumping mechanism come all the way to the top between pumps--Wen shampoo/conditioner is thick). The comb that you get as a free gift is EXTREMELY useful for getting the product all over your hair; I was surprised at how much of a difference it made (the same goes for rinsing it out, as well). Leave it in until you are ready to get out of the shower. It takes a while to rinse out, so make sure you have enough hot/warm water available. The first time I used the Wen shampoo, I did it according to the directions, and I had the greasiest, limpest, most scraggly hair a person could have--I looked as though I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a year. The second time I used it, I only used enough to coat my thin hair (about 3 pumps, total) and only left it in for about four minutes. I was extremely pleased with the results when I used it as it seemed to make sense to ME. Like every product on the market, the seller wants you to buy more, so they give you directions to put a whole lot in your hair. Use common sense, and the bottle will last a lot longer. When my current bottle runs out, I may try the type for oily/baby fine hair (I think it&#x27;s the cucumber extract shampoo). I work at home and don&#x27;t do much to get dirty, so I only need to wash my hair about once a week; everything I got in the $29.99 kit should last me quite a long time.  When it comes to the other four products in the starter kit, I gave the deep conditioner away, since I use warm EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) as a deep hair conditioner. The Wen literature even suggests that people with fine hair should take it easy with the deep conditioner, so at least they are honest about it. My next door neighbor has beautiful thick hair, and she LOVED the deep conditioner!   I REALLY like the Styling Creme. When I first looked at it, I thought it would make my hair goopy and droopy, but it didn&#x27;t--it&#x27;s an excellent styling product that keeps split ends and flyaway hairs under control, and it does NOT make your hair greasy. I&#x27;m now confident enough to use a gracious plenty when I put it on my hair. It&#x27;s like a creme mousse, and it does the job. You can put it anywhere in your hair where you need some help keeping your hair in one shape--it&#x27;s not just for the bottom half of your total hair length, which is what the directions tell you to do.  I have a portion of my hair that is a cowlick and grows in a funky shape, no matter how long the shaft of the hair is. The Texture Balm works wonders to straighten my damaged/genetically bad clump of hair when I put it on the bottom half of the shaft. Any more than that, and it makes my hair look greasy. Use this product with restraint. However, once you figure out what amount and the placement of it that works for YOUR head, it&#x27;s a godsend.  The Volumizer is basically hair spray, but you only need a little. I really like it, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t make your hair too stiff and because it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy, perfume-y smell that most hair sprays have.  These four products are all I need (along with a hair dryer and a good brush) to keep my hair looking nice. I seem to get better results if I rinse the cleanser/conditioner with cool water instead of the hot water I enjoy on my skin. Also, I use the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting on my hair dryer (and just use forced air at the end of my styling--my hair dryer has a button that takes away all the heat, and just blows room temperature air), and I make sureI don&#x27;t use metal and heat together as I dry my hair--I pick one, depending on where I am in the process of drying/styling my hair.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes, and was quite wary of ordering ANY product that isn&#x27;t unscented, but I found that I didn&#x27;t have any asthma attacks, or even notice the smell after I rinsed it out or used the hairdryer. Now, when I use my old shampoo, my hair seems frizzy and dry. I truly like the results I get with Wen, it&#x27;s nice to have some hairspray and a styling creme that doesn&#x27;t bombard my lungs (I&#x27;ve had to go without either one for over 15 years because of asthma and perfumes).    It&#x27;s quite nice that the whole line has the same scent.  I often wonder why women waste money on perfume when their shampoo, conditioner, mousse, hair spray, laundry detergent, fabric softener and skin lotions are all scented, and each one has a different scent to boot!  At least several of the above-mentioned products will smell the same, although there will still be a mixture of other perfumes from other products UNLESS you buy scent-free everything (it&#x27;s not that hard to do--stores are carrying unscented versions of their laundry products and a store called NEEDS--go to [...] an unscented version of everything you can think of that you would put on your body, in your laundry, or use to clean your home.  Give your nose a rest, and check out their VAST array of unscented products.     The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the line is the price, but if you look hard enough, bargains can be had.  Wen will never be as inexpensive as Suave, but you get what you pay for.  Incidentally, you don&#x27;t have to have a monthly delivery of all of the products.  Wen will customize a delivery system for you, even if it&#x27;s only one product every six months.  If you want some time to try it out, get the starter kit, unsubscribe yourself from the monthly delivery, and see how much and how quickly you use of certain products.  I think this is the only thing I have ever boughtfrom an infomercial that I truly think was worth the money (wait--Bare Escentuals mineral cosmetics  is fantastic, too--I bought it when it was first advertised, and I absolutely love it.).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for weeks now.  I have to tell you, I was hoping for better results.  My hair is actually a little nicer (softer, manageable and shinier) when I use my Dove Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have been changing my life to a more organic, healthy lifestyle and thought changing my hair products to chemical-free, natural products would be best...    Unfortunately, my hair actually got greasier faster.  I was careful to be sure to get all of the product out of my hair, especially my roots, but nothing helped.  When I get it all out, I got tangles.  When I got it all out, and then reapplied a small amount to my ends, it was greasier.    My hair is straight, fine, dirty blond hair.  I usually have to wash my hair ever couple of days (never longer) but it really needed to be washed more frequently when I tried the Wen product.  I&#x27;m attempting to grow my hair out again and wanted to do the right thing and get away from chemicals and cheap shampoo...however, after this experiment, I will be going back to Dove and likely sticking with it (works slightly better and is far cheaper).    Hope this review has helped you.  I read many reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try before committing to anything serious with their company.  Glad I did.  If you try it, I hope it works for you better than it did for me.  Best of luck!  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully.  It leaves my hair silky, shiny, and manageable without weighing it down.  I have fine hair - but a lot of it - and it is a few inches below my shoulders.  Even the ends, which typically get dry, are so soft.  I was surprised that I don&#x27;t even need to use any styling product at all.  Just a round brush and a blowdryer.  This is probably the best shampooo I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.    I would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the price.  To me, it&#x27;s very pricey, especially given the amount that they tell you to use per wash.  I have a 12 oz bottle, and I predict it&#x27;ll last me about 2 weeks if I continue to use the amount recommended.  :-(  I need to weigh whether it&#x27;s worth it to continue to use the product.  I also may try to cut back on the amount used or try a similar, less expensive product - Hair One.    I cannot use this as a leave in conditioner.  It was a little too heavy for my hair and left it somewhat flat.  It&#x27;d probably be fine for someone with course or curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product delivered pretty well. I am African-American and I heard the \\&quot;fig\\&quot; works better on course hair although I loved the sweet almond mint scent. I noted that if hair is really dirty and has a lot of build up you may need to use a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo first then wash and condition with Wen. I found this out with my hair and all four of my kids&#x27; hair, who are biracial. But, the silky feel and manageability was totally awesome.</li>
    <li> I rarely buy anything because of infomercials, but then I also saw Wen featured on QVC, read a lot of good reviews at Amazon, and figured I&#x27;d give the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner a try.      I&#x27;ve used any number of products that were supposed to give my hair body and shine and didn&#x27;t, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  But wow, this stuff not only makes my rather dry, fly-away hair glowy and full; it encourages curls and waves that last for days. I thought at first that I might be imagining it, but then people started to ask me what I was doing to my hair to make it look so good, and I was hooked.      I can vouch for what other reviewers are saying -- you don&#x27;t need to use anywhere near as much of the product as the instructions recommend.  Even ten pumps is more than enough for my relatively long hair, and it doesn&#x27;t take any more time to comb it through in the shower than it did with my old conditioner, which I&#x27;ve now discarded as unnecessary. I also put a very tiny drop of the Cleansing Conditioner in my hair just before I blow it dry.     It&#x27;s possible, I guess, that if your hair is already full and healthy, you&#x27;ll find that using Wen leaves it a little greasy. I don&#x27;t know that for a fact, but I suspect that could happen.  However, my middle-aged hair is loving it.</li>
    <li> I bought the introductory offer of the sweet almond milk cleanser and it was not for me at all.  It made my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in three days.  I let the first full price shipment come for my daughter to try.  She has curly hair and it did seem to work better for her but I wasn&#x27;t going to keep spending $100 on the system myself so I called to cancel.  When I called I was asked the reason for the return and I explained how it made my hair look greasy so the sales rep offered to send me out an alternate version for free (cucumber).  I decided to give it a try.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this either so I called again to cancel and get a refund like they advertise. What they told me was that now it was too late to cancel the last shipment I paid for because it was over the 60 days.  It wasn&#x27;t when I called the first time but now it was.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after seeing it on QVC.  I used less than they recommended but it seemed to weigh my hair down.  I have med. length, curly, gray hair.  I would imagine that it works very well for some but I would not try it again.</li>
    <li> I like the way this shampoo makes your hair feel and i love its an all in one shampoo and rinse together.  You will be amazed on how your hair feels.</li>
    <li> This product is really awesome! I was a little ify about it at first because I was asking myself \\&quot;How does your hair get clean if your not &#x27;cleaning it&#x27;? Well.. you rinse it long enough at first and then use wen as the directions suggest for your hair. I have medium length thick curly hair that I usually straighten, so it took me about 20 pumps. The results on the first day were surprising, my hair was softer and SHINIER! I have never seen my hair with sooo much shine! Anyways, Looks great, feels great. LOVE WEN! I will never use shampoo ever again! PS: NO MORE FRIZZ!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product three weeks ago with great skepticism. But today, I can say that I LOVE it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my hair. Let me start by describing my hair. I have fine, shoulder-length hair but A LOT of it. It&#x27;s dark brown and I get it colored with light brown and blonde highlights. I live in a very arid climate, and the combination of chemicals and weather made my hair dry, frizzy, and tangled. The first time I used Wen, my hair felt soft. In a week I started to notice a real difference - I didn&#x27;t need styling products, all I needed to do was blow dry my hair with a round brush and it looked awesome. Last visit to my stylist, another stylist came up to me, touched my hair and asked me what I did to it. She couldn&#x27;t believe how healthy and soft it was. Now let&#x27;s address the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; to this product. 1) It&#x27;s expensive. If you were purchasing JUST a shampoo, yes, you could consider it expensive, BUT, this basically replaced my shampoo, conditioner, and mousse. I should note I am used to buying expensive shampoos (Pureology, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Phyto) so it doesn&#x27;t seem that expensive to me. If you only purchase drug-store products, yeah, it might seem expensive, but it is WORTH IT! 2) The directions say you need to use a TON of it. Not necessarily - as I said, I have shoulder-length hair and I used 5 - 7 pumps. (I have to wonder if the instructions were written with a \\&quot;smaller\\&quot; pump in mind. The packaging has a pump that can dispense a good amount of product with one push.) 3) It doesn&#x27;t lather. We Americans love that squeaky-clean feeling, but if you use the product according to the directions (rinse your hair for a bit, massage it in, comb your hair, let it sit), it cleanses your hair well. Anyway, this seems like a typical \\&quot;too-good-to-be-true\\&quot; product, but I love it. I recommend it to my friends and I use it on my four-year-old. Kudos, Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> If you are coming out with hair that feels \\&quot;weighed down\\&quot; or \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, then you aren&#x27;t following the directions explicitly.  This isn&#x27;t like regular conditioner, so less is not better.  Using hot water is not better (cool).      Follow the directions; if you still wind up with hair that feels or looks bad, then it&#x27;s truly (somehow) not for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser/conditioner through the infomercial quite sometime ago (~2+ years) when I was having a bad hair day and fell sucker for the ad. I was not particularly impressed at the time and tucked it away in a bathroom cabinet. Then, this past weekend while cleaning, I came upon it and before tossing in the trash, thought I&#x27;d give it another try. So glad I did. My hair has become dry with age and coloring (lowlights to keep a 1 part grey to 2 parts dark brown ratio). Wow, what a difference in softness and shine. I can&#x27;t tell you the money I have wasted on assorted products, especially the high priced ones my colorist peddles. This stuff really is good and I plan to continue using it. One thing to note is that it does not lather (an adjustment from what most of us are accustomed to), but cleans very well and conditions, too! I am also glad Amazon offers it because the infomercial practically compells you get auto-delivery which I hate and which was a hassle to cancel after my original order.     So, if you&#x27;re already throwing dollars down the drain trying the variety of things on the market (most of which don&#x27;t come in trial sizes or prices), give this a try. Even if you don&#x27;t like it for your hair, it makes a nice hand &#x27;soap&#x27;!</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but if you look at the ingredients, it&#x27;s just an over priced conditioner. There are plenty of good quality products available in stores for a fraction of the cost. Personally, I think it&#x27;s a scam.  Glad I bought it at a discount--I used it as a conditioner after shampooing. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I tried Wen for at least a month but have not noticed any huge difference or improvement. Just stick with your ordinary shampoos. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING THRU THEIR WEBSITE. They send you a 90-day package after your initial package AUTOMATICALLY. YOU DON&#x27;T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. They claim that it&#x27;s written in the initial invoice but I read and reread their invoice several times and could not find that fine print where it states that they will ship you 90-day supply packages automatically unless you call them beforehand and cancel it. Even if you did not authorize the subsequent shipment, they still charge you with the shipping and when you return the items to them, you have to pay for that shipping as well. Customer service was not very helpful. It also takes a while before you get your refund.</li>
    <li> I took WEN to my hairstylist so it can be used professionally...the results were thick, well conditioned hair that lasted for 3 days! On the 4th day my hair became dry &amp; brittle...so breakage was abundant...my hair still hasn&#x27;t recovered!</li>
    <li> I bought this in hope, but it&#x27;s not for me. I have thick and coarse hair. Also, my hair is long, wavy, and voluminous. I have a lot of hair!!! I watched on youtube the instructional video on how to do the whole process, and I did everything (I used the cream and oil too), but it only left my hair as the same thing as it was. Maybe it didn&#x27;t work well because I bought the sweet almond min , and it&#x27;s writen \\&quot;a universal cleasing conditioner beneficial for all hair types. Works exceptionally well on fine to medium hair\\&quot;!!!!!!!Also, I saw the wen instructional dvd cleansing video on youtube, but Chaz Dean said that Wen conditioner adds \\&quot;body\\&quot; to your hair. Well, that&#x27;s not my case!I do NOT need more \\&quot;body\\&quot;. There are more types of conditioners that work differently acording to your hair type, so BE CAREFUL!(sweet almond mint, tea tree, cucumber aloe, lavander, fig - the last one it says \\&quot;wonderful for medium to coarse, wavy to curly, and ethic hair. works exceptionally on dry,dehydrated,color-treated, damaged hair\\&quot;. Maybe, the FIG would have been better for me...    The conditioner is OK, but it didn&#x27;t show any amazing results to spend so much money. My previous shampoo does the same thing  and it&#x27;s cheaper. Maybe, one day I can buy the FIG and see.</li>
    <li> Remember the old \\&quot;book-of-the-month type scams? This one is more clever, but just as insidious. Company advertises product at 37.00. You are never told that you get monthly shipments which is billed three times (for the same shipment) I had to cancel my credit crd to stop them. The product isn&#x27;t awful, but you&#x27;ll get better results from shampoo you pick up at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t have allergies to anything, but I am apparently allergic to the Wen products.  I used it two days in a row and my scalp and neck were inflamed, pink, and very itchy.  This didn&#x27;t go away for about a week.  I am not sure what it is that is causing it, but I had to discontinue using their products.  Unfortunately, I waited too long to get my money back.    Just an FYI...</li>
    <li> I received my package (ordered on their website) about 10 days ago, and decided to use it for awhile before I reviewed it.  I like it!  My hair is long, thick &amp; naturally curly.  It has made my hair soft with a ton of bounce.  I do not blow dry my hair.  I let it air dry and then I set it with hot curlers.  I dont like the fact that I have to stand under cool water for 3 minutes before &amp; then again to rinse for 3 minutes.  I have a shower with 2 shower heads, one across from the other, and I turn on one hot to stand under &amp; use the other to rinse my hair with cold. I use about one third what they recommend and use it about every three days.  It has not felt greasy at all so far.  I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I decide to reorder.  I contacted their website BEFORE I received my package &amp; asked them to NOT send any product without me ordering it, after I read all the reviews about auto-ship. I will order from Amazon if I decide to.  If it lasts a reasonable amount of time, I would like to reorder a larger one &amp; continue to use it.  It smells great!</li>
    <li> I have fine LONG hair and this is the only product that keeps my hair from looking like a rats nest after styling it. I do combine it with Phyto Phanere hair pills (also sold here) and my hair grew an inch per month. I love it and just washed my Bichon Frise with it and he looks great! I will keep on ordering! Thanks Chaz for this amazing stuff! WOOHOO!![[ASIN:B0041LVKDU Phyto Phytophanere Dietary Supplement - Hair &amp; Nails 60 Caplets]]  [[ASIN:B0046MNICU Kettlebell Bombshell with Lisa Balash]]</li>
    <li> I looked up WEN after watching an info-mercial and noticing that the outcome was strangely similar to effects of a popular baking soda and vinegar \\&quot;Poo Free\\&quot; Shampoo.  I wondered if the ingredients might be similar.  I gotta say almost every good thing mentioned in the review is similar to responses to the Poo Less option.  I was thinking maybe some people reading these reviews might benefit from this info. The following is off a web site from someone who actually uses it.  I would do a little google research on it before starting because there are many comments on how the recipe can be adjusted and what to expect.  \\&quot;It works on the principle that the more oil is stripped from your hair the more oil your body will produce to replace it. It is a cycle. It works something like nursing a baby. The more you nurse the more milk you produce and when you stop all your milk goes away.  Some people say their hair needed a 2-6 week adjustment period but I didn&#x27;t need one, even with my oily hair. The first time I didn&#x27;t use shampoo my hair looked even better than before. It combed out more easily with almost no tangles at all and it looked unbelievable. As I said, an added side bonus I hadn&#x27;t expected is that it keeps the curl and style better than it did before, so I don&#x27;t have to mess with it as much.    Mix 1 Tbsp. baking soda with 8 oz. hot water and stir or shake until well dissolved. You can use a funnel and put this in a container like a squirt bottle.    Mix 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar in 8 oz. water. Again mix and store in a squirt bottle.  Essentially, you just replace the baking soda mix for shampoo and vinegar for conditioner. Wet hair well, rub in some of the baking soda and mix into your scalp well. Rinse. Then squirt it with the vinegar mix, rub it in and rinse.\\&quot;  A lot of women swear by this recipe and I plan on using it myself.  I think the results are enough similar to the Wen product and almost free by comparison to Wen.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I reccommend this to all my friends because is natural and free of chemicals.</li>
    <li> This product smelt great and felt great on my hair.  But did I notice any extra shine ease of manageability.  No.     Have I gotten used to spending money on hair products that don&#x27;t work.  Yes.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical at first because I saw one poor review from an asian user on this posting, but decided to take a chance anyway.  I have asian hair but I also color my hair quite regularly and find that after the first week or so, my hair tends to get very dry and fly away.  I saw improvement in the texture and volume of my hair after the first wash which got me very excited and pleased, and it continues to get better and better over time.  My advice for asian hair is that if you have virgin asian hair, wen may be too heavy for you, but if you do color your hair, it is perfect!  Also, instructions should be use only as guidelines - you use as much or as little as you need - only you can figure out the right balance for your hair and you have to play with the product a little bit to know what is right for you.  I love it some much I just placed an order for the one gallon jug.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for six months now and I still love it.  I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for 22 years a light auburn red and anyone who colors their hair red knows that the color fades pretty quickly.  Well, since using the Wen Almond Mint conditioning cleaner and putting just a dab of the leave on conditioner in my hair...the color stays rich and RED for the full 7 weeks until I have to redo the roots.  My hair looks very healthy and thicker than it has ever looked.  Even my hairdresser is full of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have long stright fine hair. I saw this product and decided to give it a try.  My hair has always been soft and I&#x27;ve been able to go an entire day without combing it and you couldn&#x27;t tell.  I only wash my hair every other day and just rinse with water the days inbetween.  I started out using a minimal ammount - 2 pumps per section, but my hair felt dry all day and tangled so quickly.  I had to comb it several times.  I have increased the ammount used every day, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  After a week of daily use, (not able to skip a day with this product!) my hair is dry and not so soft anymore. My boyfriend commented that my hair wasn&#x27;t as \\&quot;silky\\&quot; anymore.  Also, my comb is very dirty after one week, which tells me the product is leaving residue of some sort.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  It&#x27;s overpriced and did not deliver.  I&#x27;m going back to my $3 drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> After following the directions to a T for three weeks, not only am I out of product, but my hair looks like hay and this product gave me dandruff!!  I have long hair with a bit of wave to it and it&#x27;s colored - it&#x27;s also pretty normal, not too dry, not too oily.  I do not normally have issues with my scalp at all.      Right now it looks like I licked a light socket, it&#x27;s so coarse and frizzy.  Awful.  I&#x27;m off to treat my newly acquired dandruff then back to my regular color care shampoo.  What a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after watching the infomercial late one night. (Insomnia sometimes has it&#x27;s benefits) As someone who used to do hair for a living, I have tried nearly everything on the market. My shower rack was always overflowing with numerous shampoos and conditioners, but no more. This delicious smelling, one-step cleanser/conditioner is the only product I use now. I have somewhat fine hair that&#x27;s a bit dry from color treatments and I needed a product that would restore a healthy shine and manageability without over-conditioning. WEN cleansing conditioner does the job all in one step. I apply about two to three pumps to wet hair when I first get in the shower then rinse out as the last thing. You can add a tiny drop after as a leave-in conditioner. You&#x27;ll be amazed at the results regardless of your hair type. One last tip, unless you have extremely thick long hair that&#x27;s as dry as the Sahara desert, you do not need to use the recommended amount of 16-24 pumps. You&#x27;ll figure out  the right amount for your hair. Also, buy it here on Amazon and don&#x27;t get caught up in the auto shipments required on the infomercial. Happy conditioning!</li>
    <li> STOP! if you are ordering this make sure it is the real product found on the [...] website! If you are ordering something from wenhaircare.com its a fake! Compare the ingredients, the fake has a ton, including alcohol! Try the real thing before you complain.</li>
    <li> I started using WEN about 5 weeks ago. I have extremely curly hair that tends to frizz and a really dry, flakey scalp. So in order to keep the flakes down I have to wash every day but if I wash every day my hair becomes really dry and frizzy. I have used just about every product out there and thought I would give it WEN a try. At first I used it ever day and my hair really did start to look better. After about a week and a half I noticed that I started to get acne on my scalp. And not just a bump or two, a lot of them. I cut back on the use of the product to two or three times a week. But still the acne stayed. So I started using my regular dandruff shampoo just on my scalp and then WEN on the rest of my hair. This seems to be working. However, for the price of WEN, I should not have to use 2 different cleaning products. If you are acne prone you might want to stear clear of this or just use it on your middle and ends and not the scalp area. I would also stay away from the actual WEN site. They are more expensive and you will get stuck on the auto ship.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that gets frizzy or super curly in humid weather. I got Wen hoping that it would do what it said on the TV commercials, but I don&#x27;t feel that it lived up to any of the claims. I used this for a week and at the end of the week I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to use regular shampoo because my scalp felt so dirty even though I spent tons of time trying to rinse the product out of my hair. I used as directed and tried blow drying my hair after with the round brush like they do on those commercials where the girl&#x27;s hair is so pretty at the end, my hair was just as frizzy everytime, so I&#x27;m not going to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Maybe this product would have given my hair a different result if I had not already been using sulfate free products and only shampooing my hair every third wash. Most of the time I use a conditioner to clean my hair. I used the product as directed. I have shoulder length , fine curly hair that tends to  be weighted down with to much product. I used 20 pumps and left it on for 5 minutes. I did not use their styling products. I am glad that I ordered the 6 oz sample instead of wasting my money on their website or buying more. If you have course hair or your hair is very dry or damaged this product may give you the results you are after. If you have curly hair I would check out the web sites that are specifically for curly hair. By following their advice i was able to get control over my head. For me Wen was not the miracle cure that It was hyped to be. Note that you can not give a review of their product on the official site unless your are a member of their home delivery program.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has made such a difference with my hair, it&#x27;s all I will use now.  I have used Wen for several years now, and I have tried all of the different variations... My favorite is still the Sweet Almond Mint, but I also use the Tea Tree now and again... My hair is healtier and feels stronger.  Just love it!</li>
    <li> i use the cleansing conditioner as a leave in conditioner .i put one squirt in my palm , and work it into my hair .after a while i brush my hair . it really leaves my hair nice and soft and styled .i will never go without this product .</li>
    <li> I ordered the product through the wen site and sigend up for automatic shipments. The product is ok, but just as good as my normal hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to cancel today, the first call took me through a loop which took, me 10 minutes to navigate.  The purpose to cause frustration and possible stop me from cancelling. When I finally got to a customer service rep she hung up on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second call again the loop, then a sales person trying to talk me out of cancelling.  Then advising me I had a unpaid balance, which I do not believe is true.  Now I must research with my credit card compnay to be sure I am not over charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for the WEN by Chaz Dean product line, and was so excited to get my introductory shipment. I just could not resist the claims made by the infomercials, and given the product ingredients, it seemed that the products would absolutely deliver great results. I already use sulfate free products, and try to go for natural and green products in most things I use when the choice is available, so that was an important factor that influenced my decision to try the WEN as well.  Too bad, the products just did not work for me at all! My hair normally looks great after conditioning, but with WEN I had frizz, fly-aways, dryness, dullness, and breakage! I kept using the Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner and also tried the Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment. With each use, my hair became more dry and dull looking, and is breaking off even when dry combed with the wide tooth comb included in the package.  I canceled any further shipments and am crossing my fingers hoping I do not have any surprise bills or shipments show up, as other reviewers have. I don&#x27;t think I will bother returning the shipment due to the cost and hassle. The refund will be \\&quot;less shipping and handling\\&quot; and it will cost about $10 priority to send it back, so I MAY end up netting a $10 return of my costs. NOT worth the time.  Oh well, writing this one off as a learning experience. Ignoring infomercials from now on, no matter how tempting the claims may be.</li>
    <li> This is the frist review I have ever written. I am doing it because I believe in this product! I honestly didn&#x27;t want to try it after reading some of the reviews but I am so happy that I did. Within a week I was able to wear my hard down because it controled the friz so much. I was able to stop using it&#x27;s a 10 and kenra oil (still great products but I just dont need them any more). I was also amazed by how ***clean*** my hair feels!!!! This is one thing that made me not want to try the product but to be 100% honest my hair feels cleaner with this then any other product I have ever used. I am So So happy that I tried this. I will keep using Wen and look forward to trying their other products!!!</li>
    <li> I love that I was able to find and purchase this product without getting roped into high prices and a the hassle that goes with it. This is a wonderful product.  I plan on purchasing more at a later date.</li>
    <li> I got sucked into the infomercial one Sunday morning and I just HAD to have this product!  I have medium/fine long frizzy hair and I was tired of having to add oil back to my hair to make it soft and shiny.  Anyone wanting to do that I totally recommend Ojon oil!  Anyway, the infomercial and the bottle recommend washing every 2-3 days- not possible.  Hello greasy roots!  I wish I had read the product description more closely as I would have started with the \\&quot;cucumber aloe\\&quot; scent since that one is made for oily root/dry hair girls like me.    Otherwise I love this product!  My hair is soft, shiny and much easier to manage.  I get tons of compliments on it too.  It is a little flat on top, but I think I&#x27;m trying the \\&quot;cucumber\\&quot; next.  For those wondering about the scent on this, I would have just called it \\&quot;mint\\&quot; as there is no almond scent to this at all.  Bonus is the mint feels great on my scalp, not so bonus, it kinda smells like toothpaste.  The scent fades FAST so you don&#x27;t smell like Crest all day.    *As an update, after using this product for a couple weeks, my scalp adjusted and I found myself being able to wash every other day without looking disgusting!  Also after finishing my bottle of Wen, I switched back to my old shampoo to finish it off- BIG mistake!  I am ready to throw it out and get more Wen.  It makes a huge difference in the texture, frizz and volume of my hair and I can&#x27;t wait to receive my next order!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My hair had become very dry (due to grey hair and hair coloring).  After the very first use, it was shiny and alive again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I only use it for a light conditioner after I have washed my hair with Bumble and Bumble seaweed shampoo.  I have thick, fine,straight hair and it works better as just a light conditioner.  I use around three pumps and put it only in the ponytail part of my hair.  I have used it as the directions state and my hair is super heavy and over conditioned.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am a licensed cosmetologist and have tried tons of products and this one is the best yet.  I have long hair that I get highlighted and colored, so it tangles very easy and is hard to comb through wet or dry, until I tried this product.  I no longer have tangles and my hair looks better and is more managable everyday.  I think anyone that has hair that is frizzy or tangles easy should try it.  The most important thing to do is use it just like the directions say.  It is expensive but I was using Shampoo, Conditioner, leave in conditioner, and two different styling products to keep my hair looking like I wanted it.  Now I use the Conditioning Cleanser and the Styling Cream that&#x27;s it.  Love it, Love it, Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m among the fans of WEN.  I have very thin and fine hair, which I color once a month.  WEN makes my hair so soft.  Before using WEN, I hated how straw-like my hair had become from coloring.  It felt and looked like straw, and it had no body.  Now, my hair is incredibly soft, and it actually bounces.  The body doesn&#x27;t last all day, but as long as my hair looks good during the day when I&#x27;m out and about, I&#x27;m happy.  I&#x27;ve been using WEN products for six months now.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> If you are considering buying any of the Wen cleansers because of the benefits they claim, just to to a good salon and get a Keratin Blowout.  $100 later you will have soft and frizzless hair for six months or more....and you don&#x27;t have to spend tons of money experimenting with products like this.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Makes your hair feel so soft. It smells good. I have been looking for a good shampoo everywhere until my mother in law suggest that to me. Then i knew i had to order it and try it out. I have wasted so much money over the years for shampoo. Hair saloon shampoo, very expensive shampoo. This one is a little pricey but worth every penny and will last you too.</li>
    <li> I have used the sweet almond mint and the lavender - I felt the lavender actually left my hair cleaner and silkier.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product.  It helps keep the frizzies down, but after a couple of washes, my hair always feels dirty, and I feel the need to wash with a regular shampoo.  I use the wen as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if not using shampoo would get my hair clean but Wen works great and it smells really good. I use about 10 pumps at a time, Wen lasts,because I still have over half a bottle left.  I will be ordering Wen again</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. I use it everyday. I have naturally curly hair that is cut in an inverted bobb. I like to wear it curly but I do straighten it on occassion. I also have grayed prematurely and color my hair just about every 3-4 weeks. That&#x27;s a lot of damage for the past 20 years. My hairdresser noticed a difference as soon as she saw me last week. I told her I bought a new shampoo (cleansing conditioner)called Wen. She was amazed at the texture of my hair and how great my scalp looked. 3 weeks previously I had a dry flaky scalp with some scabby sores from me scratching it all the time. My hair is shiny and soft. It&#x27;s not flat looking when I wear it straight either. Like others I had to adjust the amount of pumps I used. I usually use 10-12 pumps for one washing because my hair is fairly short. I love it and I am about to purchase another bottle, so it will have lasted me about 6 weeks. Thanks Chaz and Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I&#x27;m a black woman with moderately thick hair.  My hair has been chemically straightened for so many years that it&#x27;s relatively straight.  I also suffer from dry scalp, especially after washing my hair because shampoos strip my hair of the oils it needs to keep my scalp moistrurized.  I watched then WEN infomercial a couple of times before ordering.  Just the thought of cleansing my hair without stripping it and replacing 4 products with 1 and I was sold.  I usually use shampoo, conditioner, leave-in cream cond, leave-in spray cond, and heat protecting serum. All in an effort to cleanse my scalp while getting my hair back to smooth texture it was before the wash.  WEN does a wonderful job of cleansing my hair and keeping in the moisture. Chaz recommends air drying and not using hot tools, so I do that during the week. My hair doesn&#x27;t dry straight, but after using WEN the texture of it after air drying is soooo smooth. I can&#x27;t ever remember my hair feeling so supple. After blow drying and flat ironing my hair was AMAZING. Smooth, straight, so so soft, and not weighed down at all. Out of all the products I&#x27;ve used that are specially-formulated for ethnic hair, I have NEVER gotten the results that I got with WEN. Here are a couple of tips for anyone thinking of using:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Read the instructions and even if you think you&#x27;ve got them down review right before using - I made the mistake leaving too much of the conditioner in my hair the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Try doing one more quick cleanse with the conditioner after you let it sit in - I don&#x27;t know why but I did this on accident once and it really made a difference.  After rinsing out the first time around, add the same amount of cleansing conditioner that you&#x27;re instructed to use for cleansing, but just lather and rinse like regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you have thin/fine hair, I think this is still a good product. Just leave it on for less time and use a bit less than recommended. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so you can&#x27;t always go by the book!ferent, so you can&#x27;t always go by the book!</li>
    <li> So I tried Wen and was not impressed at all.  Other then the smell it did not do anything it promised.  My hair was not shinier, or more manageable, or impressive in anyway.  On the other hand Bumble &amp; Bumbple Creme de Coco shampoo did everything that Wen promised. You MUST try it.  Crazy shiny, manageability, smell - it seriously is the best shampoo I ever bought.  I promise I don&#x27;t work for them, I just wanted to pay it forward.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice.... both times it made my hair feel very weighed down and oily feeling.  I rinsed it very well each time as well.  I have thin hair, so i read the instructions prior to use and did exactly what the instructions said.  Hated that you have to rinse with cool water twice throughout the shower.  It is a long process, applying product, combing through hair, pinning up your hair and leaving on throughout the remainder of your shower, combing hair again and finally rinsing very well.  My hair just didn&#x27;t feel clean like with shampoos.  I just couldn&#x27;t use it more than 2 times due to the way my hair felt and looked.  I was really hoping that my hair would look as good as the women on the infomercial, and i liked that there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in it.  I don&#x27;t know if another kind of Wen would have worked better... i don&#x27;t think i will spend the money to find out though.  I was very dissapointed!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair oily and greasy; I would not recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical about this product but it is wonderful (a bit expensive though)!!  my hair is so soft now and it doesnt feel as \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; as with regular shampoos.  my hair isnt greasy either.  LOVE IT!  i dont think i will go back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually wary of product hype, and even warier of automatic shipment sellers.  I&#x27;m glad I found the product on Amazon - because no matter how good this cleanser is, the auto-ship option on the Wen website is a racket!  That said, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 days now, and can find nothing that I don&#x27;t like about it. My hair is colored and permed, and I can truly say it&#x27;s never been in better shape.  Perms don&#x27;t generally last very long on my hair (it&#x27;s stick-straight naturally) and color seems to fade easily.  Since using the Sweet Almond cleanser, I&#x27;ve noticed big differences in the curl retention and silkiness and that alone would make it worth the $28.  Many have commented on the price being too high, but many salon products are right up there in the same price range, and I haven&#x27;t found any that deliver on their claims like this product.    I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to use four pumps per section as recommended, my hair is chin-length and I find that 3 is plenty.   I do leave it on for the duration of the shower, and I rinse it for at least a minute, which I think is key.  I even use a pump to cleanse my face - my skin feels great afterward!  There may be other choices that compare with Wen, but I haven&#x27;t found them.  It&#x27;s nice to find a product that actually does what it says.....</li>
    <li> I shampoo every time I shower (twice daily) and as a result, my hair has gone very dry over the years. The only way to keep them in place after shampooing used to be gelling them or applying a lotion like American Crew. I have tried all sorts of shampoos and shampoos+conditioners over the years - Head &amp; Shoulders (ok), Pantene, Axe (crap), American Crew (very good), even Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo (very gentle).    I was apprehensive of ordering something I found out about from a late-night infomercial, but after some research and reading reviews I had some faith that this product might actually work. Well?    Yes, it&#x27;s very expensive, but so far I am happy with how soft it&#x27;s made my hair. For the first time in many years I have stopped gelling my hair and am able to just brush them and stay great - not dry, not frizzy, not oily - just great!    The sweet almond mint fragrance is mild, which being a guy, is what I was concerned about the most, perhaps. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best product for my hair that I have ever used.  I live in a dry climate &amp; it shows on my hair.  Sometimes if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a few days, I will use a mild shampoo 1st &amp; then use this product.  It doubles as a shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I use the styling creme after towel drying &amp; have found that nothing I have ever used keeps my hair as healthy &amp; as manageable as these 2 products.  Just be sure to rinse the cleanser out very well as it is thick &amp; may take a little more time than a regular shampoo.  I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> Best hair care product on the market. Toss your old shampoo &amp; conditioner. This is all you&#x27;ll ever need. Leaves hair soft, shiney,managable, no breakage,keeps color longer. enough said.</li>
    <li> i BOUGHT THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I SAW IT ON TV. THE ALMOND MINT SMELLS GREAT BUT YOU HAVE TO USE TOO MANY PUMPS AND IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST! IT DOES CONDITION WELL, BUT YOUR MONEY GOES DOWN THE DRAIN FAST. A FEW GOOD THINGS: THE SHIPMENT WAS FAST ! AND IT DID CONDITION AND SOFTEN MY HAIR, JUST THE BOTTLE REQUIRES SO MUCH FOR YOU TO PUT INTO YOUR HAIR AND YOU RUN OUT QUICK!!!</li>
    <li> Of course I had high hopes! My hair is fine and dry. I figured using a conditioner for shampoo would be incredible. It is strange that it doesn&#x27;t really work. I even made the solution they suggest for leave-in purposes. It&#x27;s okay. On the positive side, I do NOT have the greasy response others are writing about. I would welcome that at this point. Maybe my hair is too far gone for even this product? OR just maybe this product does not do what it promises. It does seem to work for some people.   UPDATE: I have used this since my first review and discovered completely different result after more uses.  I did get a more greasy response, but it also conditioned well.  If you are working with wavy hair, you can use a little as a leave-in conditioner to tame the ends. Be sparing.  Now when I use it on my scalp, it comes out as though I didn&#x27;t wash my hair at all.  I just have to concentrate on the ends.  I would recommend this product to people with dryer, thick hair for sure.  Tiny amounts for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Deceptive advertising. Chaz Dean actually put his name on this?  After spending 32 dollars on shampoo, and I gladly paid it, and it is not like this was 3.99, they would not stop sending me product and bills.  PS, you can get the same thing at Trader Joes for under 5 dollars.</li>
    <li> This is a great Shampoo ! for once it will not dommage your hair and scalp.  Scalp of your Hair is really impotante if you no want loosing your hair .And because i wash my hair every day and sometime 2 times a day  I decided to protecte my hair and my scalp to leave grown  my hair nicely and propely with this Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought the Wen product from the website.I have enjoyed the cleansing conditioner,but not the styling creme so much,it is not better than my hair gel.I&#x27;ve tried the intense therapy once,I like it.I was charged the first payment of three the following month,&amp; received the &#x27;kit&#x27;.I called the company &amp; the person on the other end quickly assisted me. She was very helpful.I will now be billed not charged in case I do not want it.I will receive only the cleansing conditioner every 4 months. Next shipment,I am trying the pomegranate cleansing conditioner. My account with them was credited for the items I did receive this shipment I do not like. I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> This product was an absolute failure with my long, color treated hair.  When I called the first time,the representative pretty much told me that I didn&#x27;t know how to wash my own hair and that I hadn&#x27;t rinsed it well enough.  Really???  Funny but I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other product.  I tried the products again and had the same result, called and spoke to a lovely woman who said it may just be the wrong type of product for my hair and stated to go ahead and return what I had for a refund and she would send me out (at no cost!) a trial of another product in the line (have not received it to date).  I packed up my stuff the first week of January, mailed it back, and of today&#x27;s date they are saying they do not have my return.  One person told me to expect it to take up to two weeks and just now I was told 6 weeks.  Who takes 6 weeks to handle a return???  Its amazing you can ship to me and charge my account in a snap but to refund my money takes you from 2-6 weeks depending on who you&#x27;re talking to and you can&#x27;t even get the information into the system that an item has been returned for quote \\&quot;up to two weeks after we receive it back in the mail\\&quot;.  This product along with several others are handled under the \\&quot;Guthy Renker\\&quot; marketing company and I am less than pleased with how they do business at this point.  They are also claiming that a membership for Sheer Cover that was already cancelled in December has been shipped to me again and they have charged my account for this product again as well!  How can you be sending me emails asking me to come back as a customer because I&#x27;ve cancelled and you&#x27;re still sending me stuff!  Just totally disgusted with the product and the terrible customer service.</li>
    <li> I did not feel like my hair was getting cleaned at all. Overall, I thought this was a waste of money. I ended up giving it away to someone who wanted to try it.</li>
    <li> I received this product for my birthday in March and I am hooked! I love the way it makes my hair look!</li>
    <li> I rarely write a review, Im a busy stay at home working mama to 4 little ones. But, I just had to make the time to stop &amp; share this. I have thick, coarse, weird hair, lol. :) Just after ONE single use (I didnt use 60 pumps for my long thick hair either,lol, I used about maybe 15 with a little water form the shower and that was plenty), I left it on a full 5 minutes, etc. Got out of the shower, wrapped a towel around hair loosely. For the first time I can ever remember in my life-my comb went right thru my hair-not one single tangle!! That shocked me in a very good way. Im used to always having a ton of tangles all the time. That alone makes this worth every single penny, to me. After drying my hair (I normally air dry it) it was so soft, shiny and flexible. :) This is the only product I splurge on, everything else is the cheapo store brand. One of my daughters has crazy hair like me so Im going to try wen on her hair next.:) I got my wen on ebay for a great price.</li>
    <li> My best friend bought this from the infomercial.  She has been raving about it.  I tried it while visiting her, and I sounded like an infomercial.  After one use my hair felt softer and looked shinier than it had in years.  I use Kerestasse so I am a shampoo/conditioner snob.  My hair is finicky as is my scalp.  I combed through my hair no tangles, great smell.  I blew it dry and it was gorgeous.  The next day I saw my aunt who inquired if I had got a hair cut because my hair looked so healthy.  She even touched it.  Then I told her about Wen, and she said \\&quot;you sound like an infomercial!\\&quot;  I rushed home and bought some.  It got here fast!  I have used it once more and I am amazed.  I can&#x27;t wait until I have been using it a few weeks.  I can only imagine how soft and beautiful my hair will be.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair.  Like every other woman out there, I have listened to the ads for other products, and spent hundreds of dollars on \\&quot;salon\\&quot; quality products, they all did absolutely nothing to improve the condition or shine or softness of my hair.  They are ALL the same.  This product is different and it is FANTASTIC.  I have color treated, very fine, no body, no shine hair.  It looks good for one day--the day I go to the hair salon which is about every two months.  I have been using this product for about two weeks and the change in my hair from the first day was unbelievable.  It has bounce and shine and softness.  My husband can&#x27;t stop touching it or commenting on how great it looks.  (Men do not do not do that. The fact that he is noticing my hair is worth the price).  Give it a try, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will give me frizz control without weighing my hair down or making it crunchy.  This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don&#x27;t have oily hair).  It also left it twice as frizzy, regardless of which products I used after washing.  My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.    The styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!       I think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz.  I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> After seeing the infomercial several times and watching live demonstrations on a home shopping network, I finally broke down and ordered this product directly from the product site.  I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.  For one thing, when ordering the 30-day supply, it automatically selects Sweet Almond Mint which they claim is for all hair types.  It is not.  According to the product description, it is for fine to medium hair.  I do not have fine to medium hair.  I am Asian/Hispanic so I have thick, course hair.  All this product did was make my hair frizzy.  It did not supply the amount of conditioning that my hair type requires.  However, that being said, it also left my hair looking and feeling very greasy the following day.  The styling cream that comes with the kit yielded no visible results, as was the case with the texture balm. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 1 star is because I&#x27;m not sure if I tried one of the other types (like the Fig which is for thicker hair), if I wouldn&#x27;t have had better results.  But even so, I cannot justify the price of @ $30/bottle.  Bottom line:  if you&#x27;re currently using a product that you like, stick with it.</li>
    <li> This product is not all it is supposed to be. My hair may feel a smidge softer, but my hair is very limp, a little bit frizzier than normal, feels dirty, and my scalp itches even though I rinsed for a very long time. Secondly, the pump that came with it was broken...and after reading reviews on here that seems to be a common problem. So now I&#x27;m left with an over-priced product that definitely didn&#x27;t live it to the hype, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Pros: smells awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: time consuming (wet hair, pump a crap ton of the product into your hair, massage it in, comb it through, leave it in 3-5 minutes, rinse rinse rinse)&lt;br /&gt;I have to wash my hair every day when using this product because it makes my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product will make your hair want to lunge off of your scalp, screaming in agony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have dry hair. I thought based on the reviews (that I realize were now bought), this product would improve the frizziness of my already wavy hair. This item made my wavy hair into EXTREMELY CURLY and FRIZZY HAIR on my head. The volumizing happens at a cost--your head hair will look like pubic hair. Unlike the ad claims, this product does not take out frizz, but conversely adds volume by adding exponential frizz. I had to treat my hair and soak it with vitamin-rich conditioners after damaging it with this product. I tried it three times, because I felt bad about wasting my money. However, just like contaminated food should not be eaten, even if premium price was paid, this product should not be used.  When they said \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; it actually means stripping your hair of vital nutrients and leaving it feeling like you soaked it in chlorine water for a year. PLEASE, if you like your hair, dont subject it to this extremely awful product. It will make your hair like crackle bread. If you have extremely oily hair where the grease just drips out of it, one wash with this and you may also look like a broomstick.&lt;br /&gt;Face it everyone, the more you have to advertise a product to sell the stockpile of rotting inventory, the more you should beware.</li>
    <li> I just received my Wen products on Friday.  I have used this twice and am somewhat disappointed.  According to the infomercial, the product is supposed to leave your hair looking beautiful without the need of styling products.  I have not experienced this at all.  My hair looks about the same as it does after blowdrying with regular shampoo.  I still need to use my flat iron and still have to follow it up with my smoothing serum to smooth it.  I will be sending mine back as there is no need to spend $30 per month for the same results.  I do however love the way it feels once you&#x27;ve rinsed your hair.  If it prevented me from having to use the other products then maybe I would consider keeping it. Would not wash my hair, blow it dry and leave the house EVER based on the results I have experienced.  As for my hair type, I have long hair that I get highlights in every 3-4 months.  Used to get perms once a year, but have not permed my hair in 4 years.  My hair meduim in texture.  Thought this might help.</li>
    <li> Every now and then I give in to an infomercial, and I am usually not thrilled. This is one time I am soooo glad I did! Wen is  the best product ever! I cannot say enough great things. I have purchased every brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner through the years. I have found some I like better then others, but never a product I could say I loved. Wen really is a miracle product. If you are on the fence, try this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical that a non shampoo would clean my hair just as well. It actually cleanses better. I have dry ends and an oily scalp. I was worried my hair &amp; scalp would feel greasy and unwashed and that my ends would be dry without using conditioner. My scalp is not oily at all, my hair is NOT greasy but well moisturized and my ends are not dry at all. This is the perfect product for all hair types. My hair has never been so soft and manageable. I have never been able to air dry my hair without it looking like I played with electricity, and now I can. And did I say my hair is soft??!! My hair is color treated, so I was worried about fading. I was actually able to color my hair less while using WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can massage as much cleanser into my scalp and it feels clean as a whistle, not greasy. This is 1 product, the more you use, the better. While the product doesnt lather, once applied to my scalp I add a small amount of water with my hands to message my scalp and this creates a very slight foaming feel. The 1st time I used WEN it felt strange to not have a lather, but as I rinsed, my hair felt so clean that I instantly loved it. I was sold by the 1st wash. My hair was clean and extremelysoft from root to tip. And what I love best is that I can take a dime size - or less - amount of WEN and rub it into the ends of my hair after I towel dry. This acts as a leave in conditioner. This took me a while to try, because I was afraid it would leave my hair greasy or with less volume. That was not the case. My ends stayed soft, styled and smooth all day. I do it all the time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrances: Almond Mint &amp; Lavender are my favorites. My hair smells great and it feels like your at a spa. I also used the cucumber aloe which is also great and very moisturizing. There is a slight menthol base so you will feel a brief cooling sensation after you rinse. It is very slight, and actually kind of nice especially in the summer, but I dont use it on a regular basis. I intend to try some of the other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Styling Balm is great! A little goes a long way. I use a penny size amount all over my hair, working from tip to root. This product is doesnt weigh hair down or make it greasy. This product helps maintain smooth, styled hair. I use it before blowdrying for a salon finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volumizing Spray: I love this in the lavendar because it is like aromatherapy. This product is one of the best I ever used. I learned it is a 2 in one product. The purpose is to spray roots as you blow dry damp hair for added volume and lift. I have used dozens of mouses, gels &amp; spritzes and have never seen lift like this. You can get as much or as little volume as you want, and it lasts! It doesnt feel like you have any product in your hair. There is nothing worse than having that stiff, heavy feel at the roots. Now, I also discovered a 2nd use for this product!! It makes a great setting spray to use with rollers and curling irons. It sets hair without it being sticky. Best of all, if you need a change, it brushes out leaving hair as soft as when you washed it. I used it to set my hair for a curly updo and then decided to brush it out and set it in rollers for a hair down wavy look. If I had used hairspray my hair would have been dry, sticky, and oil at the scalp. I burshed my hair out and it felt \\&quot;just washed\\&quot; and soft. I was able to respray and reset my hair and the wavy curls lasted all night (my hair used to be straight by nights end, but now the curls stay in all night without looking over curly). This spray is amazing and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture Balm: I have never been able to use texture balm before. It always made my hair look and feel greasy. I love the textured look, but I alsways ended up looking terrible. This is the 1st balm I can use. I rub a bit on my palm and smooth it on my ends. I section my hair by layers to add textured layers. I even tried rubbing my palms over the ends of my hair when it is still damp and after blowdrying I ended up with a straigh style with straigh textured layers. It kept the ends smooth and swingy. I have been doing this more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auto Purchase: I was afraid to do the autobuy. I have heard so many nightmare stories. Here is the truth about the autobuy. You can try a 1 month supply of WEN cleanser and additional extras for a great price like 19.99 or 29.99. These offers usually sign you up for autodelivery automatically. If you dont want auto delivery, you will need to call as soon as you receive the product and cancel. However, I loved the product so much I kept it. Then in 3 weeks they ship you a 3 month supply of WEN &amp; extras + a free product. This is usally about $90. Since it is technically a 3 month supply, they divide the billing by 3 months so you will pay about $30/month. You can manage your account online and change the ship dates. So if my 90 day supply is lasting me more like 120 days, I can push back my next shipment from 3 months to 4 months. You can even change it to 6 months or more, so you will never be inundated. In my experience, if you research the deal there wont be any surprises. If you receive a kit you dont want, or cancel after it has been shipped, you can send it back for a full refund. Also, there will be a letter with a breakdonw of charges and the date each charge will hit in a letter on your box. Make sure to read it so you there are no surprises. If there are, you have the option to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont work for WEN, Ijust love there products! I used shampoo 1 time after using WEN for a month and my hair felt like straw compared to what I was used to. At that very moment I realized I couldnt live without WEN ever again. I never want to go back to the way my hair was. I make sure I always have 1 extra bottle so I never have to use shampoo again. I have now been using WEN for about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have nomally dry, course hair...the first few washs I loved it seems softer and had a shine..as time went on my scalp itched and I saw flakes. My hair wasn&#x27;t different or more conditioned and  it felt dirty, I found I had to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; it more often (normally I wash my hair every 5 days, with wen it was every other. I tried to not wash as much but it felt DIRTY. I have never had itchy scalp or any flake issues. I went back to my old shamoo and wouldn&#x27;t you know, the flakes and dryness are GONE. I gave it a shot...didn&#x27;t help with dryness anymore them a good conditioning balm...&lt;br /&gt;thanks but no thanks.</li>
    <li> If I could give wen no stars I would. It made my roots extremely greasy and my hair dry and brittle. My hair feels unhealthy and is very frizzy. Save your money. I used wen for two weeks and my hair is just awful.</li>
    <li> One day I was thinking to myself that if only I could just condition my hair but somehow still get my scalp clean, my problems would be over. I&#x27;ve always had a very oily, itchy, flaky scalp, and the driest hay-looking split ends you&#x27;ve ever seen. I also would always break out in large, painful, pussing pimples on my scalp. I tried dandruff shampoo, gentle shampoo, super-conditioners for the ends, etc. No combination ever affected the oily, itchy, flaky scalp, dry ends combo I had. I even got regular trims! So I saw this product a week after thinking of the \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; theory and of course I bought the 6 pack with all 6 flavors to try. It was like a miracle. I knew it would work; even the bad reviews didn&#x27;t deter me. No more oily scalp. No more itch. No more flakes. No more dry ends. And the best thing, I have not had one scalp pimple since using this product. After trying all 6, I greatly prefer the Sweet Almond Mint. It is the smoothest one, therefore easiest to apply. The thicker ones, (Lavender and Fig,) are hard to work with. Also, the smell of it has been the biggest hit with the boyfriend. He did not care for the Tea Tree or Cucumber smell. Also the Almond Mint seems to have the exact right balance of moisture for me. Fig was too moisturizing and Lavender actually dried out my hair a little as did the Tea Tree. The Cucumber was also a great moisture balance but the smell is not as good and sweet as the Almond Mint. In closing, I&#x27;ll just say that if they ever stop making this product it will be a dark, dark day in my life. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> The product is fine and leaves my hear clean and shiney.  I would buy it again if the cost was less or shipping was FREE.</li>
    <li> The commercials for this product promise that it&#x27;s perfect for any type of hair, and that for those with colored hair, it would prevent fading of the color. That&#x27;s why I ordered it, I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair back to it&#x27;s natural color (and leave it there) for a year and a half now. Each time I dye it, it looks good for a couple of months, but then the color fades, and I&#x27;m left with blondish and roots(my natural color is light brown.)    The promise about fading may be right. In the two weeks I tried it, my latest dye job didn&#x27;t fade appreciably (and this time I had used a non-permanent, wash-out-in-28-washes color.) However, the claim that it&#x27;s good for any hair type is wrong. My hair (and skin) are quite oily. I have to wash my hair every day. If I don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s greasy looking by the end of the second day. Well, using Wen, it NEVER felt clean. It looked OK right out of the shower, but by the end of the day, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in two.    I&#x27;ve read the responses to other reviews complaining about greasy feeling hair, and I tried rinsing it and rinsing it and rinsing it until all the hot water was gone. My hair just NEVER felt clean with this stuff.    All you folks with dry to normal hair, I think this stuff would be wonderful for you. Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t rinse clean enough for someone with the oil problem I have.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have VERY curly, thick, dry and hard to control hair.  I have always looked for that miracle product that could work wonders on my hair.  I have tried many products, including Quidad for years, and nothing seems to help my hair.  Now I think I have found the best product out there!  I have heard before that shampoo can be very damaging to your hair.  I even tried just cutting out the shampoo and just using normal conditioner, but my hair felt so unclean and gross.  I figured like one reviewer said, this was a happy medium.      You probably won&#x27;t notice much of a difference after a just couple uses, but just as they say in their infomercial, over a few weeks there will be a huge difference.  WOW!  This stuff is wonderful.  My hair has never felt so soft and healthy in my life.  And it smells great!  I have been using it for a few months now and I can&#x27;t ever return to regular salon hair products again.  Even my boyfriend loves that he can run his hands through my hair now without it getting all snagged.  I have also been straightening my hair since getting Wen, and I have never been able to get it so straight before AND make the it last without running the flatiron through it every morning.  My hair stays straight until I need to wash it again.  Even my sister (who I never told about Wen) said she has never seen my hair look so nice and straight!  If it looks so nice straight, I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like when I leave my hair curly next time!    Overall, it is worth every penny.  I know it seems like a lot, but I guess I am just used to buying expensive products for my hair.  Also, I have seen so many reviews saying that people should not buy directly from their website.  Have any of these people actually added up the costs of buying from Amazon compared to wenhaircare.com?  Probably not.  I enrolled in their automatic shipment because I love the convenience of it delivering automatically, but you also save a ton of money by doing it that way.  They advertise that you do lock in at a low price, but I didn&#x27;t really buy into the hype of their marketing plan.  However, I just added up what I got in my 3-month supply kit on Amazon, and I would have paid over TWICE the amount on Amazon!!  So, I might recommend that you buy just the conditioner for the first time on Amazon just to see if you like it.  If you do, I highly recommend you sign up for their automatic delivery program, you will save a lot of money.  Additionally, I also love the other items in the kit (deep treatment - definitely gives you added moisture if you need it, styling creme and texture balm - really helps with flyaways).    Sorry this review is so lengthy, but I feel I need to spread the word on Wen if you do need intense moisture in your hair.  I can&#x27;t speak for other hair types, but I can see how it could make your hair feel rather greasy if you have normal hair.  I would just make sure you following the directions exactly as other people have written.  Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> So, I skeptically tried this cleansing conditioner. Ive been using it for about 2 weeks now and ive read through the reviews here and compared them with my own experiences. First of all the price, as with most quality products..ouch it does hurt your wallet. Im not sure i&#x27;ll even be able to continue buying this as a permanant replacement for regular shampoo/conditioner. However, I can say that it really does dramatically redefine the way Ive always looked at washing my hair. Its a one step process but it doesnt necessarily cut shower time...Heres why....(and this goes out to all of the reviews about trying this product and experiencing \\&quot;greasy flat hair\\&quot;)....You need to MASSAGE this product into your scalp like a lotion and use enough to cover as much of your hair as possible. I typically dont apply on my ends to conserve but then work what I do use through to the tips if I can. Also, after/during massaging this into your scalp you need to let it soak into your hair for I would say at the very least five minutes. But the longer the better. Take it from me, I have naturally very oily/thin hair, I made the mistake of trying to be quicker and not massaging it into my roots and as the day progressed I noticed, wow, my hair is oily and flat...yuck...So the next day I was more careful and massaged it in better and what a difference...my hair has more volume than normal, its soft to the touch, shiny (but not oily at all) and healthy looking.  When you use this product you really have to change your previous ideas of dumping shampoo on your head and getting that folicle stripping lather instantly cleaning...and destroying...your hair.  This shampoo WILL NOT LATHER it is more of a cleansing hydrating lotion. You need to massage it into your scalp...enjoy the refreshing feeling it gives you on your scalp, I was amazed by this the first time I used it.  It felt like my scalp could actually breathe for the first time.  If you give it a try, like I said, just remember to followthe instructions, they really arent that complex. And trust me you wont regret it. I am just now looking at my hair today and thinking wow... so this is what real, healthy, hair looks like.  Another note, I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought it at qvc.com which is currently sellling it on sale if you read this review in time maybe check that site out before you buy it and compare prices because this stuff is definitly not cheap.</li>
    <li> I have tried all of the Wen \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; and I love Sweet Almond Mint best by far!  This product leaves my hair so soft and tangle-free!  I have really fine hair, and my hair just lays so nice and has more volume than with other shampoos. Usually after I blow dry my hair, I have to use a hot iron to smooth my hair out and fix the ends.  But when I use this product, I just blow it dry and it lays perfectly.  I really feel I don&#x27;t lose as much hair with each shower when using this product as well.  I do notice a little bit of buildup after a couple of weeks, so I use a clarifying shampoo a couple of times a month.  I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, dyed, long (just shy of my waist) with lots of body. However, it is wavey but not enough were I can wash and go.  Under normal shampoo and conditioner my hair does fine.  Normally I wash my hair every other day since most of the time it is pinned up. After the second day without washing my hair, the hair close to the scalp gets oily and dry.  I chose to use this because I just didn&#x27;t like how my ends were looking after I blow dried or after I took it out of my bun. I like to wear my hair down when I can and I am in a job that requires me to wear it in a bun 5 days a week. So like many others I saw the infomercial but opted to buy from Amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t get caught into the automatic renewal.       For two weeks I used only the Wen to shampoo/condition and followed the recommended dose of 30 pumps.  I noticed that my hair close to my scalp was being weighed down and looked oily. So I only used the product from my hair at the nape of the neck down to the ends and half the amount of pumps. I was still having that oily problem on my scalp.  I decided to go ahead and shampoo my hair with an over the counter product and use this as a conditioner.  I am very pleased with the results.  My hair is so much softer; the ends don&#x27;t look out of control (Frizzy); my hair has a more natural waves so I don&#x27;t have to straiten it.  I also reduced the amount I use to about 12 pumps.  I will continue to use this product in conjunction with my shampoo because I really like the results.  I did get complimented on how shiny my hair is.  Did I mention the smell is more minty vs almond.  It has a very nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> So I have long and very healthy hair. I&#x27;ve tried a million products and I&#x27;m very, VERY careful about what I put in my hair. That being said, WEN seemed like a fantastic product! All natural, no sulfates, etc., blah blah. Well, not so much. First of all, if not washing your hair provided such wonderful results, don&#x27;t you think other professionals, aside from Chaz Dean, would support this and market products accordingly?! I used this for almost 2 weeks, and by the end I literally felt like a scarecrow. My hair was comparable to straw. After I stopped using this, and used a clarifying shampoo to remove both the buildup of WEN and the products that WEN never effectively cleaned out of my hair, it was like night and day! Beautiful, soft, silky hair once again. What a waste WEN, what a total WASTE!</li>
    <li> The bottle says to use 8 pumps.  That is not needed if you have short or thin hair.  If you use it sparingly, you still get great results and the bottle lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;m not talking about Hair One. Which I have tried, BTW. But, if you just take a second and compare the ingredients in Wen with the ingredients of a $2 bottle of conditioner from the grocery store, I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how similar they are.    That&#x27;s because Wen uses cetyl alcohol to clean your hair. But cheap Suave conditioner has cetyl alcohol too! I tried washing my hair with Suave Rosemary Mint conditioner one day after I ran out of my Hair One. Now, Hair One is much cheaper than Wen, but when you only have $5, a $10 bottle of Hair One is still too much. But my hair was greasy, and I had vowed never to go back to shampoo.     Then I saw Suave conditioner on sale for $1.67 at Kroger. Looking at the ingredient label, I noticed how similar it was to Hair One, and decided to give it a shot (it even smells like Wen or Hair One, only better). I was amazed! My hair was just as clean, shiny, and bouncy as with Hair One, but for a tenth of the price (and a thirtieth of the price of Wen)! I&#x27;m never going back! Suave Rosemary Mint conditioner all the way.</li>
    <li> I bought sweet almond mint with palmagranete because it got so many wonderful reviews. I got them as a duo together. This conditioner shampoo I used the first bottle and then started the second. This isn&#x27;t like other shampoos. You have to leave it I&#x27;m for three to five minutes before rinsing out. Then you have to rinse it out for more than a minute in order to get it out. It has a minty smell and makes your scalp feel like you&#x27;ve put something like menthol on it. I got this because my hair is very oily and I&#x27;ve tried everything in the drugstores but my hair us still oily. After the first few washes it was shiny and my hair looked nice. After using the first bottle my hair starting falling. I have fine hair, it was down to my waist but because if this conditioner shampoo I had to get it cut. It&#x27;s now a bit below the shoulders. I would not recommend this to anyone. I took a chance and I regret it. I could not tell anyone to take a chance with this. It&#x27;s expensive and not what it&#x27;s said to be.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but if I use it exclusively, it weighs my straight, fine hair down too much. Sometimes I just use it on the ends and use a light-weight conditioner on the roots.  But overall I like the product. I especially like that I can buy the product here without having to sign up for a renewal program like at Wen.  Plus I can buy just the product I want, not in a bundle.</li>
    <li> I have never use such a horrible hair product. It did not clean my hair &amp; left my hair with huge knots in the end of it. It was as though I have never washed my hair. I was really disappointed in this product &amp; all their products!!!  It dried my ends out so badly I now need a trim.  Every since I stopped using this product I have gotten nothing but complements on my hair.    I order this from the Wen website &amp; it put my on a subscription, It charged my card $50.00 for it. Now I have to ship the second round of this horrible hair product back.  I would not recommend any products by Wen.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001D4FF66 WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16 oz]]  My favorite so far.  Just be sure to follow directions. Some say it leaves their hair oily?? If you follow the directions as the video says, you will be satisfied with soft and ungreasy hair. It is FABULOUS and saves so much time in the mornings when I shower and have to be at work at 6 am!!!    I just LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I bought this cleansing shampoo based on the infomercial (I know, I&#x27;m a sucker!).  I tried it for two weeks and I was just miserable the entire time.  I have shoulder-length *very* thick hair and it felt heavy and greasy the entire time I used it.  My scalp felt as though I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair.    Overall a very unpleasant experience.  I actually use Hello Hydration by Herbal Essences and it works great.  It&#x27;s very inexpensive and even though my hair is color-treated, it keeps my hair soft and shiny and people always comment on how nice my hair smells.  I don&#x27;t know why I ever switched.</li>
    <li> OK, I saw this product on QVC and was very excited to purchase it. My hair is shoulder length, fine and wavy, prone to frizzies. The first time I tried it, like many others, it left my hair greasy and weighed down. I put it away for a few months, then decided to try again. I ended up with the same results. I thought I was using the product correctly after watching the models use it on QVC. I haven&#x27;t seen the infomercial. I usually wash my hair every day and decided to try it yet again on day two of not washing my hair and post workout. This time I ran my hair under water for about a minute to make sure it was good and wet. I used about 20 pumps of Wen, then I scrubbed it into my scalp like I would a normal shampoo and added a little more water as I scrubbed. I left it in my hair for about 3 or 4 minutes then rinsed like crazy. I&#x27;m talking scrubbing your scalp like you are shampooing and letting it run under the water for a good two minutes. Then I put in one pump of Wen as a leave in conditioner starting on super wet hair and beginning at the ends and back of my hair. Now I am loving Wen. I have been using it for a week now and it just keeps getting better. My hair is soft, shiny, and a lot less frizzy. Looking forward to coloring my hair and seeing if it helps with color retention. I believe a lot of negative reviews are coming from people like me who were not using the product properly. I blame this on the demonstrations given on TV. They show the girls gently sliding it through their hair and then combing it through. This will not work! For those of you that gave up, try again. It might not work for everyone, but at least make sure before you toss it.</li>
    <li> I swim in a pool one a week, and my shoulder-length brown hair was paying for it. It was dry, frizzy, and always smelled of chlorine, no matter how much I rinsed or conditioned. I had tried the special products that were supposed to help swimmer hair, but they just seemed to strip it and make it worse. And even though I had a good haircut, you&#x27;d never know it on any given day. So when I saw the WEN infomercial, I decided to try it. After all it was guaranteed, and nothing else was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I get the WEN and slather it on, and OMG amazing! Not only did it restore my dull, dry, lifeless mop to vitality and shine, it totally eliminated the chlorine smell, and it did all this on the very first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked, but pleasantly so. Just how it works, and especially how it eliminates the chlorine odor, I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t care! I just know that I can now swim every week without my hair paying for it. Before WEN, I almost never had a good hair day, and now I have them about 80 percent of the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a baby boomer, so I wash my hair only twice a week these days. I bought the Almond Mint starter pack first, then the WEN variety pack and tried all five cleansing conditioners over a few months, and now I&#x27;m reordering the Almond Mint and the Lavender, which seem to work the best on my slightly wavy hair. I order direct from chazdean.com, where you can pick and choose exactly what you want without any re-order hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people think this is an expensive product, but I think it&#x27;s totally reasonable for what you get -- great-looking healthy hair! After all, I pay $40 for a decent haircut every three months, which the WEN brings to life! And it just simplifies my life. Wash, blow dry with round brush,  and go, looking good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;m not a fan of mint, and both the Almond and Lavender have a &#x27;cool&#x27; feel that my scalp could do without. I also think that even WEN is hit or miss sometimes. Like all hair products, it seems to work better on some days than others. But overall, it&#x27;s a keeper as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be for everyone, but if you know a swimmer who is totally frustrated with the state of their hair, encourage them to try WEN and see what happens. You just might really make their day!it seems to work better on some days than others. But overall, it&#x27;s a keeper as far as I&#x27;m concerned.     It may not be for everyone, but if you know a swimmer who is totally frustrated with the state of their hair, encourage them to try WEN and see what happens. You just might really make their day!</li>
    <li> I have very very fine limp blahh hair.  After trying every product known to man I thought I was stuck with this hair for life.  Well, I decided to give this a try.  I was skeptical to say the least.  I followed the instructions to the T.  The cool water and all the pumps.  And even leaving some in as a after conditioner.  I would say after the 3rd to 4th shampoo I started noticing a difference in my hair.  It started feeling thicker, I could actually pull my hair back like in a pony tail and feel \\&quot;hair\\&quot;.  A couple weeks later it had a little wave to it it I never had before.  I have now been using this for roughly 5-6 weeks.  Now I have noticed new hair growth.  Its really strange because I never heard anyone mention this before.  BUT it looks like someone gave me a really bad hair cut and I have all these new little hairs standing up especially around my part line.  I am now putting a little conditioner or oil to help flatten that out for now but it really amazing.  Another thing I noticed is I used to have a brush full of hair at the end of the day.  Now I only have a few hairs left in my brush.  I just wish I would have found this years ago.    All I can say is I am really surprised and impressed by this hair care product!</li>
    <li> Thankfully, I got my Wen from a friend who, like me, has fine hair, so I can&#x27;t say much about the price.  I don&#x27;t color my hair, and under normal circumstances, it&#x27;s not oily or dry.  I&#x27;m blonde, and while I have fine hair, it&#x27;s quite full.  The first time I used Wen,  my hair was exceptionally soft, but it was also hard to style.  In subsequent uses, I found that my hair looked like it needed washed right after I used it, and was slick and impossible to style.      I do have friends with thick, dry hair who love this product, but according to the research, they would do just as well by skipping shampoo and this product (rosemary and mint are astringents that dry both hair AND skin) and sticking to a good, inexpensive conditioner.  Also, according to \\&quot;cosmetics cop\\&quot; Paula Begoun, Chaz Dean&#x27;s claims of having invented both the concept and the product are false.  Wen was invented by Proctor and Gamble who launched the first two-in-one shampoo/conditioner (Pert Plus) in 1987.  Those of us who have watched infomercials long enough may remember Lori Davis, who used Ted Danson (bald) and Cher (routinely wears wigs) as her spokespersons.  Wen seems to be another dose of the same old snake oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. It made my frizzy over colored hair smooth and shiny from the first application. I dont use it as directed however. I use the cleanser conditioner as a conditioner and still use ordinary shampoo to clean my hair.  It is wondrous, and soft and shiny and lots of body. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My fiance thought he would surprise me with the WEN hair products where he seen it on TV. When I got the products I have to admit they all had a good smell. That is all they had. My hair is thick and I color it a couple times a month. I wanted something that would help with less color and less dryness.I will give these products to the Salvation Army. These as many other ... (too good to be true products) are just a rip off. A 2 dollar shampoo is way better than all that goo that makes the hair look and feel dirty even after it has been washed.I guess we women will always be looking for the perfect shampoo etc...ps...I can&#x60;t even stand the thought of the hair mask, i may never get it out if I try it.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to love this product (especially considering you have to pay nearly $1-2 per use!). I was so excited the day it came in the mail and I tried it right away. I followed the directions as indicated but quickly learned by my second wash that my medium length, fine hair doesn&#x27;t need as many pumps as they specify. After the first wash I loved it - my hair was silky and shiny. Second day basically the same result. By the third day I thought my hair looked a bit limp and lifeless but was still silky and shiny. By the fourth day and onward, my hair was heavy and greasy - it felt and looked disgusting. I went back to my old shampoo for a few days to get rid of the build-up then tried again. Same thing happened - by day four, my hair looked awful. Now my hair does tend to be a bit oily at the roots but I have never experienced this before. I considered trying the Cucumber Aloe formula instead but really, for something this expensive it better be freaking amazing for me to want to go through the trouble of trying different kinds. Just not worth it for me. I&#x27;ll be returning what&#x27;s left. I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with fine or oily hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. To not have to shampoo and conditioner...wow, that was an amazing thought. This product states that it replaced conditioner, deep conditioner, leave in conditioner...etc...it left my hair dry and frizzy at the ends and very oily at the roots. Yes, I followed the directions to a &#x27;T&#x27;. I have heard great things about this product from others but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> Wen is a solution to little frizzes in my hair and it does not strip the natural oil from my hair. Color also lasts longer when using Wen shampoo. Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product off of e-bay and was sorely disappointed.  Way to much Hype!  It made my hair greasy and unmanageable.  It didn&#x27;t feel like it was getting clean at all.  Thanks but I&#x27;ll stick with my regular shampoo and styling products.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product especially for how much I paid for it.  I used it for two weeks straight and those two weeks were the worst hair days of my life.  My hair was so flat and so greasy after using this product.  I had friends, who did not know I was using the product, ask me why I haven&#x27;t been washing my hair.  My hair also had no shine to it and was very lifeless.  I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to do anything.  Forget trying to curl your hair; it is hopeless.  So in a nutshell, this product made my hair look nasty.    After using this product for two weeks, I decided to go back to using my old shampoo and conditioner (which is Pantene Pro-V&#x27;s Ice Shine) and I swear it was like night and day.  My hair is now clean, it is smooth and shines and looks healthy again.  I would have never thought I would get better results from a product that cost a lot less and easy to find. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am not an employee or family member of an employeeof this company.  I was extremely skeptical of this product while watching the infomercial.  I was sucked in by the first 5 minutes.  I watched the infomercial twice more and decided to give it a shot. It worked fantastic on my thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair.  It left my hair clean, shiny, and manageable.  I didn&#x27;t even have to use styling products.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to add my comments for this product.  I have been using it now for almost a month.  It does leave your hair very soft and very manageable.  It does take some getting used to as you do not use this product as you would other shampoos or conditioners.  And I have found that at least in my case I do not have to use as much as is suggested.    My one request is that the scent be changed.  I do not care for this particular scent.  Otherwise it is a good product to use on any type hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have used many natural and organic hair products for a long time but none of them have given my hair the body and shine that this product has. My hair is grey, wavy and short and I am now going to let it grow a bit because of the wonderful improvement! It&#x27;s hard to get shine on grey hair and this does it!</li>
    <li> When my sister told me about this product, I was hesitant to try it.  I like my hair to be really clean and I have never found a shampoo with a built in conditioner that worked for me.  The first time I tried it, I felt that I was making a mistake while \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair.  Without the lather normal shampoos produce, I felt that I wasn&#x27;t really cleaning my hair.  However, after rinsing it out for 3 or 4 minutes, I realized how wonderful this product is.  My hair really felt clean, despite the fact that there was no lather!  Even better, my hair felt soft and conditioned.  KEEP rinsing until you feel a slight squeaky clean feel to your hair.      Having said that, I don&#x27;t think that this product is for everyone.  I leave Wen in my hair for about 30 minutes before rinsing.  It&#x27;s really no big deal to me.  I find that it is easier than using a shampoo and conditioner.   I live in Atlanta and our water is not hard or soft.  It is in between.  That seems to be the perfect type of water to use with Wen.  Hard water would probably work well too.  Soft water might not work so well, since the product would probably build up on the hair.    After thoroughly rinsing your hair, rub a very small dallop of Wen through your hair.  I recommend drying your hair naturally.  Heat probably bakes this product into the hair creating a drying effect.  This probably produces the opposite effect of the intended results of the product, which are to create soft and manageable hair.  I use steam rollers and that seems to work perfectly with the Wen products.    There is a science to this product.  If it isn&#x27;t used as intended, it might actually damage the hair.  However, if it is used as intended, it should make hair beautiful and healthy.  I understand why some people cannot use this product.  I doubt that people with long hair, who wash and blow dry their hair daily, would benefit from this product.  I wash my long hair every three or four days.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it!  I read so many great things about this product and absolutely couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.  I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks now and my hair is weighed down and tangled.  I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle just to make sure its not just me...I doubt it!  Can&#x27;t wait to get back to my Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and have tried all kinds of products to make my hair soft and silky!  Thought the idea behind not washing your hair so it doesn&#x27;t dry out and cause frizz is awesome but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My scalp was itchy by the end of the day!  Hair wasn&#x27;t as manageable as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product, but I was going to order it, and now that I have seen the reviews, NO WAY.  Forty pumps of shampoo????  Give me a break!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the five star ratings seem like they are written by employees or friends and family of the company.  All of the five star comments are very contrived.  Not to mention, when someone posts something negative, someone immediately is defensive.  Not a good sign.  It looks like Wen&#x27;s employees are totally trolling this site.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the honest feedback from most people here, I saved myself from another credit card scam.</li>
    <li> I was skeptic, but I had seen Chaz Dean use his products on a How Do I Look show and I was curious. Plus, I had read a book that suggested not using regular shampoo in curly hair and istead using conditioner to clean your hair. I didn&#x27;t like the idea of not using a cleansing product on my hair so trying the Wen system seemed to be a happy medium. Plus, I have tried everything available, so why not try one more product? I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. It is the first time in my life in which I can wear my dry, curly hair as it is without having to use heavy styling products or none at all and looking like the Sphynx! It&#x27;s worth giving it a try. You will feel liberated! And the products smell wonderfully too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product off of the infomercial.  My hair is naturally coarse/wavy/curly and I have noticed since I&#x27;ve hit my 40&#x27;s it has become very dry, even more coarse and FRIZZY.  I used to use OTC shampoos (Suave, Aussie, L&#x27;Oreal), then my stylist turned me on to Pureology, which is expensive but did make my hair softer/more manageable.  When I first got this product and used it, my hair was very soft but still frizzy.  I only wash my hair every other day, so I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to 2 months now.  I have to say, this stuff is PHENOMENAL!  The longer I&#x27;ve used it, the softer and less-frizzy my hair has become.  I live in the south with very high humidity so I don&#x27;t know if the frizzies will ever go away completely, but what a difference this has made.  I washed my hair the other day w/Pureology to see if I could tell a difference.  Heavens above, when I rinsed the shampoo out, my hair felt like straw!  Even after applying and rinsing the condition, I could see and feel a big difference.  I will continue to use the WEN for the forseeable future.  I&#x27;m still on the Sweet Almond but am ordering and trying the Fig next since it is supposed to be great for coarse/wavy hair.  For those of you who find this leaves your hair greasy and weighed down:  May I suggest you try only washing your hair every other day, and don&#x27;t apply any as a leave-in conditioner after you rinse initially.  Also, I haven&#x27;t used any of the balm/intense conditioner that came with my kit, so can&#x27;t comment on how well those work.  BTW I have past-the-shoulder length hair so I use about 15-20 pumps of product (5 top/scalp, 5 rest of length, 5 w/hair upside-down to make sure I get the underside well).</li>
    <li> I ordered from the Guthy Renker website and am very unimpressed. I DID NOT press the \\&quot;yes I want the 90 day supply\\&quot; button and didn&#x27;t realize that I would still be sent a second order. My bad. I called them right away when I realized my account had been debited and their customer service said DO NOT ACCEPT OR OPEN THE PACKAGE. If you send the package back without accepting it you will not be charged shipping, your credit card will be credited when they receive the returned package and you wont receive any more.   *update...I wasn&#x27;t credited right away so I called their customer service and was told that my account had gone to collections. What?! they put me thru to billing and I got it straightened out. The girl I talked to sounded like she had to deal with this type of thing a lot. Anyway, my card was credited the following day but then a few days later I received a letter stating that they&#x27;re unable to get authorization from my credit card for an amount of $59.90. How annoying! Luckily I&#x27;d cancelled that card to keep them from stealing anymore of my money and wasting anymore of my time. I was also being ripped off by my gym which had closed and gone bankrupt... but that&#x27;s another story.    sigh.       When I 1st used this product I thought it was ok...but the 2nd time I used it I found my hair very dull and not easy to manage. It looked dirty.    I have fine but thick hair (to clarify for those who don&#x27;t understand...this means that it&#x27;s fine as opposed to coarse... but I have a lot of it) with a lot of wave. I blow dry it straight and have bangs which need a lot of attention because I have cowlicks. I think this product might work ok with coarser hair but it weighed my hair down.    I used it exactly as the instructions said, I rinsed for ages, and I gave it 4 good tries but I just don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I bought Wen sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner for my daughter and I. She broke out around her hairline from it and it made my scalp itch really bad.</li>
    <li> generally, I am satisfied with this product.  I do have to use more than usual the amount.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Never before have I had anything like this product.  My Hair which are shoulderlength, extremely thin, fine and limp - are now with only ONE product and nothing else - the most full, thick and volumous that they have EVER been.  And I have used the most expensive Hair products before this (Kerastase, etc.)</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair and have tried everything to control the frizz and wave/curl in my hair.  My biggest problem is that my ends seem \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; no matter what I use.  I have bought a Paul Mitchell flat iron that was $90, a Chi flat iron that set me  back $120.  I used an ionic blow dryer to blow out my hair straight and then had to still use one of my expensive flat irons.  Plus, I was using salon products before styling and then after still had frizz so I would have to put some more product on the ends to tame the frizzies.      Then one Sunday morning I was flipping channels and the Wen infomercial was on.  I love watching anything that is about hair/skin products so I watched it.  Actually, I think I watched the infomercial about 4 times before I finally decided to order it.  I went to the website and did the autodelivery (unbeknownst to me -  I do agree that was kinda shifty).  I received the Sweet Almond Mint and I LOVE this stuff.  My hair has never felt like hair - more like straw usually - but now it is so soft I just want to touch it all the time!!  This stuff is great!!    One con that I have noticed is that with thick, coarse hair, the autodelivery program doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well because the product doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near long enough to get me through to the next shipment.  In fact, I am almost out of the 2nd bottle from this shipment and it&#x27;s not even halfway through the 90 days.  I use a little more than others might because of the texture of my hair so it may not be an issue for other users.  The product is a little more than some others (Suave) but the cost is completely worth it.  I have spent so much on products that I would think sounded good from the back of the bottle and then would use them for a week and hate them.  I wish I had the money back that I have spent on drugstore and salon products and ended up throwing them away!  Even on a humid or rainy day my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz now.  My ends are in great shape and never get that \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; look to them.</li>
    <li> I read a rave review of this product in a magazine a couple of years ago and decided to try it.  I ordered it from QVC, who still sells it.  I am a total convert.  First off, don&#x27;t be put off or alarmed by the amount they recommend you use.  As another reviewer said, you can tailor the amount to your own needs, but anything more than 10 pumps is ridiculous, and probably just a sleazy sales tactic on the part of the manufacturer.  I have fairly short hair, but I get great results with only 6 or 7 pumps.  I love to use it when I&#x27;m just washing my hair before work; it saves me the extra step of having to condition after washing.  It leaves my fine, straight hair really clean-feeling, soft and smelling great, with just enough body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the Tea Tree.  Although it&#x27;s recommended by Wen for use on thick or coarse hair, I find that it works just as well as the Almond Mint on my hair.  I&#x27;m just not too crazy about the medicinal smell.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this product from the WEN site and got accidentally signed up for the recurring shipments. She ended up with two sets before getting it canceled, and ended up hating it, so I got it :) I give it two stars because, as mentioned, it just takes so long to do! To wet hair, thoroughly distribute the 15 pumps I use, leave it in, add a splash of water to lather, rinse out, then use the conditioner (I&#x27;ve found that the cleansing conditioner alone leaves my hair frizzy and somewhat dry) takes FOREVER! And, I&#x27;m not getting results any different from that of generic Pantene type products. If I follow with the little tub of conditioner that came with the set, it takes much longer but I&#x27;m able to comb through. All in all, I&#x27;d say the product is expensive, gives mediocre results, and takes a lot of time to distribute.</li>
    <li> Please dont waste your money on this....... I have long, naturally wavy hair that is also coloured and I suffer from frizz. I thought using this product would especially help my frizz. On normal shampoo i washed my hair twice per week and would find it feeling exceedingly dry. I bought the Wen products and began washing. First off you have to use soooo much of this product based on the instructions. Second when i was done my hair didnt feel clean and my scalp didnt feel clean. I dried it out and it still didnt feel clean. But i didnt both too much. However within a day with styling and just moving around it felt really dirty like i hadnt washed it days. So i was now washing my hair every 2 days, which was causing it to be dry and having to put in a lot of moisturizer. Then i guess because the scalp wasnt getting cleaned properly my dandruff became acting up. I stopped the product after that.    A hairstylist then advised me of Aveda - Smoothing formula, shampoo and conditioner which i have been usinig for about 2.5 months and this is working great.</li>
    <li> The product is ok- but not really great. The best I have found is Redkin Butter Treat- that stuff is amazing - the conditioner in a tube is the bomb!!!  I was underwhelmed w/ this  wen product. It&#x27;s okay for camping-when you only want one product,shampoo,conditioner, leave in , body soap and shaving creme- but it certainly isn&#x27;t a preferance on a daily basis. It dulled my hair- which is normally very shiney.</li>
    <li> I love the way Wen makes my hair feel. My hair was hard to control and never soft before Wen. I have tried several of the different Wen types, but I love this one the most. My hair is silky, soft, and manageable. Wen is expensive but so worth it. I know longer have to use any other products to manage my hair so that is a factor in the cost. Thank you Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> this makes my hair way more manageable then it ever has been and you don&#x27;t have to use every day</li>
    <li> I did not use it as directed but rather every other couple days. My hair was definately softer; but too expensive to keep up with this product. in my opnion, anyway.</li>
    <li> I too saw the infomercial on the Wen hair care products.  I have very fine hair, color treated, and wanted to make my hair as healthy as possible.  I have used Wen for about 3 weeks now.  In the past, I would have to wash my hair daily or it looked awful - even with use of good product and conditioners.  Since Wen, I find that washing my hair daily is not necessary.  Even though you need to use quite a lot of product (and no, you do not need the amount they suggest), I&#x27;m finding it is lasting quite a long time.  That is one benefit to be sure!  My hair is extremely soft, with less fly aways than before.  The other difference I notice is the shine!  Has anyone asked me what I&#x27;m doing for my hair because it looks fabulous?  No... that certainly has not happened.  So, I&#x27;m liking this product - but it is not the magic bullet... at least not yet!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have completely different hair types. Mine is fine and very curly. Hers is very thick, coarse and wavy. The Wen made both of our hair very frizzy. We were disappointed it did not do what it claimed it would do, but also relieved we didn&#x27;t commit to needing to spend so much on a hair product. The shipping fee is ridiculous. We are getting better results by using our regular hair shampoo and conditioner and combing the conditioner through our hair in the shower before we rinse it.</li>
    <li> Marketing is everything! Your cozy couch, a woman who could have used a better hair cut has frizzy hair in front of you and voila! using WEN she has voluminous, smooth, come hither hair - of course, this came with a camera crew, a stylist, a make up artist and well, the creator vetting every take.     Flash forward to your shower, or bathroom sink where you wash your own hair. You follow the rules, pump the pump however many times depending on how literally you follow directions, and then voila! Your hair is transformed in to a magical and seductive fortress where all who never desired you before, now hover at your feet and whistle when you walk by, or just say \\&quot;hey, your hair looks awesome, can you watch my kid for a few hours?.\\&quot; And you put your WEN bottle on a pedestal for people to stare at in awe. Or, at least that is how the infomercial makes it all sound.     Not so much really.     A few things: 1) hair relies on pH balance to well, balance itself out and that includes oily hair. If you were trapped in the jungle for a year, eventually your hair would adjust to what it needs to be and guess what, you would look great! 2) Hair does not need to be shampooed, really ever, unless you roll around in mud - if you really like bubbles, try just using Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo from time to time, they sell it for 99 cents in trial sizes. 3) It is ALWAYS about the conditioner. If you use Suave shampoo and buy Aveda or Keratase Conditioner, guess what, your hair is going to look good because the last thing you did to it was tame the beast through conditioner. Hence, cleansing conditioners.     If you want to save at least $204 per year on a 12 months supply of WEN (rudimentary math using only the $28 price tag of $28 x 12 months &#x3D; $336) buy the other version that Amazon sells called Hair One, or even Nature&#x27;s Gate Cleansing Conditioner - both perform the same function as WEN, but don&#x27;t have an infomercial to pay air time to promote and sell it (and subsequently pay those standing by - although I am all for employing people), so you can save about $200 per year buying an alternate brand (Hair One is $11 x 12 &#x3D; $132 per year).     The American Way.</li>
    <li> This product was great for the first couple of times. But after two weeks it leaves my hair heavy, oily, stringy and appearing to need to be washed. I have super straight hair that is on the oily side. I think this would work better for curly hair and those that are dry, my hair doesn&#x27;t like it one bit! I&#x27;ll be using it once a month for conditioning purposes.</li>
    <li> Hi.  First, I&#x27;ll tell you that I have naturally thin, tangly, dirty-blond hair with almost no body.  Because of this, I have it permed so that there is body to it, and regularly have high-lighting done so that it&#x27;s brighter.  My hair looks very natural after having processes done every 3 - 6 months.  However, my hair was beginning to look like straw, felt very dry, and had almost no shine. I tried several products at all price ranges and none of them did the trick and they became a waste of money, and so I ordered WEN Sweet Almond Month Cleansing Conditioner after seeing the infomercial several times.  It worked great! and within a month I was receiving compliments on my hair again and my husband even commented on my hair looking nice!  OK, so while WEN is expensive, I buy the larger sizes to save both on pricing and shipping is only a couple dollars more, vs doing a smaller size and then paying a high price for shipping a month later.  OK, so hear is where my review really gets helpful, I think.  In reading reviews for a re-order of WEN, I decided to try the Cucumber Mint Cleansing Conditioner which was described as a light product.  It worked great too UNTIL I had my most recent perm and then it wasn&#x27;t enough conditioning, so I switched back to my travel-size of the Sweet Almond Mint and am again very pleased.  SO, in conclusion, it seems that for me, when I have recent treatment to my hair, then I need to use the Sweet Almond which is more moisturizing.  Then, when my hair settles down a bit and isn&#x27;t soaking up all that moisture, then I need to switch to the lighter Cucumber Aloe.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with either product as they are different and work great depending on what my hair needs.  I highly recommend both of them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1 week.  I have removed all of my other shampoo and conditioning products from the shower.  I was still using my other products (leave in conditions) until today.  Today I just used Wen as a leave conditioner.  While in the shower I wet my hair and used a few pumps of Wen as a leave in condition.  My hair looks awesome.  So I will stop using my leave in condition products too.  Wen is completely worth the price.  It really does work.  My hair is no longer dry looking.  My natural curls do not look frizzy.  I no longer have to put a bunch of product in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly dry hair, and a lot of it. I was pretty excited about this  product when I saw the infomercial. I ordered it and when it came, I couldn&#x27;t get the pump to work (there was a broken spring; probably broke on its journey to my house). I had to squeeze it from the container which is no big deal however the directions tell you how many pumps to use. It smelled really great and felt so good in my hair. After my shower my hair felt really soft and nice.     After a couple of weeks of using Wen, my hair just felt dirty and smelled dirty. If I showered and used Wen, later that day, my hair was just dirty. It was really gross. It felt greasy, and my hair is NEVER greasy. So I went back to shampoo and my problem was solved. I&#x27;m rather disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work. It just left  my hair dirty, dirty-smelling, and greasy.</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered the WEN sweet almond shampoo through Amazon because I did not want to be signed up for auto-delivery...but I was somehow automatically signed up for it anyway!   I did not like this product at all. My hair was super greasy within a couple of days. It just doesn&#x27;t clean your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive and have a number of allergies.  My hair is just beyond shoulder length, course and curly.  I keep it layered so it doesn&#x27;t look bushy.  Been using the product for one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely like the smell of the product.  Nice and refreshing in the morning.  Did notice that my hair wasn&#x27;t quite as frizzy, especially when using it as a leave-in conditioner.  My hair doesn&#x27;t knot when using the product; I didn&#x27;t think that was possible.  I love the fact that when using this I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day, and that it actually looks better on day 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather takes some getting used to.  4 pumps worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I have to give it up:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to not get at least some diluted dripping into at least the corner of your eyes while letting the product sit in your hair while washing the rest of yourself.  Yes, it tells you to rinse your eyes if you get anything in it, but the damage is already done.  I&#x27;m aware of a slight burning discomfort all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When also using it as a leave in conditioner, day 2 is even more difficult for my eyes after laying with my hair pressed against my face while I sleep.  It feels like you&#x27;d taken something like Ben Gay and dabbed it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m making the assumption that menthol was the problem ingredient.  I&#x27;ve looked at the descriptions for 2 other scents.  The ingredients for Fig aren&#x27;t listed.  The ingredients for Lavender includes menthol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that I was breaking out along the hairline on the side of my head I normally sleep on, even though I made sure to give my scalp a lot of attention when using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sorry to give this product up, but the discomfort outweighs the benefits.</li>
    <li> I dont really have a lot of options with my hair. I have very thin hair that is always limp no matter what I have used to change that.. I loved the way it made my hair feel and flow. I reordered after being without for about 3 weeks and believe me I have missed it. Can not wait until it arrives again!! I always like to try new things and have watched the advertisements for a long time. I finally decided to order and am glad that I did. I thought I would never spend this much money on a hair product but I didnt regret it.</li>
    <li> Product does not live up to all the hipe ~ period.  I have normal hair, not curly, not straight, not fine, not coarse and I just kept wanting to wash my hair afterwards.  Product just does not clean.  Hair feels dirty and flat.  I&#x27;m willing to try anything for beautiful hair, but please do not waste the money on this product.</li>
    <li> I had watched the Wen infomercial many times, and researched the product and ingredients before buying. As the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding. I have fine, long hair, but a lot of it. The sweet almond mint has been WONDERFUL for my hair! When I need something a little  more clarifying, I turn to the cucumber aloe. I can not say enough good things about Wen.  I can see where many of the people who&#x27;ve used this and given it a poor rating would have problems and poor results. Not all of the fragrance types are good for all hair types. The booklet that comes with the product gives very clear instruction for use, as well as a complete ingredient list. In reading the ingredients for each fragrance, it explains why each particular one is good for a certain hair type. It stands to reason that if you use one that is highly emollient on fine hair, it will weigh it down and look greasy or dirty. The inverse can be said for using the clarifying herbal formulas on coarse, dry hair.  All I can say to anyone who is interested in trying it is \\&quot;Start with the small bottle and test-drive it first.\\&quot; Read the directions carefully, and research every product you buy if you&#x27;re finicky about your hair.  As for me, I&#x27;ve ditched all of my conventional hair products and feel very content in investing the money and time in my Wen!</li>
    <li> Just as I expected. I hate doing auto-ship through Wen directly, so ordering here works better for me. The trick to loving this product is to use a lot more than you think you should and to keep your hair REALLY wet. Check out their website for tips on how to use. You  probably won&#x27;t need as much, but you do need a lot. I have not truly &amp;#34;shampooed&amp;#34; my hair in over a year and love it. I can go 4-5 days before needing to wash, so this keeps costs down too.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Wen cleansing conditioner after I saw it on TV. I have known about them for years ,my mom saw the advertisement a few years back. I ordered mine from the wen web site. That&#x27;s OK if you want to try the whole kit to start with. Which is what I wanted to do . But now I need to cancel my auto ship before they send me an other 90 days. I like the way it cleans my hair . BUT YOU DONOT HAVE TO USE AS MUCH AS THE SAY. I only use 8 pumps from my 16oz bottle. My hair is thick ,but not super thick ,about shoulder length . Make sure you rinse really well. I have had no problems with the cleansing conditioner. When I was using regular shampoo my hair was super frizzy. I have some waves in my hair naturally and I could find nothing to calm it down with out weighing it down.That is until I started using this . I put the styling gel on it while my hair is still wet . If I can I let it air dry I do. My hair is not frizzy and does not tangle any more and It is softer now . Before I would pen my hair up because of the frizziness ,now I only pen it up when it is in my face. I do recommend buying it from amazon because you can buy what you want and not worry about auto ship. I love this product and am giving my mom some for her birthday. I wish I had  tried it years ago.I am looking forward to trying the tea tree cleansing conditioner ,i have a itchy scalp and I hear that one is good for that.</li>
    <li> I originally bought off the infomercial.  I thought it would be good for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s biracial hair.  It is fine, dry with tight spiral curls.  I have struggled with her hair over the years.  Generally it is too dry. The Wen worked great for her and looks shiny, bouncy and healthy.  Shampoo was just too harsh for her.  I also use it on my long, wavy hair that I straighten.  I find it cleans well, gives me more volume and overall makes my hair easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I used to be so frustrated with my hair and how dull, dry, and damaged it was...I tried every new shampoo, conditioner, leave-in, treatments, and hair masks. Wen is the only thing I have found that has been able to correct my over processed hair. It&#x27;s true that if you color your hair, (as I do) the color won&#x27;t fade as fast...which is a big deal to me. It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it...plus, I don&#x27;t have to buy shampoo and conditioner anymore. I have been using Wen for about 8 months now, but it only took about three uses to see results. My hair is super soft and shiny now and I&#x27;m just so thrilled...and my boyfriend loves touching and stroking my hair now and that feels great! It&#x27;s easy to use and I love the smell! If you have dry, damaged, or processed hair, and are tired of split ends and no luster, then I highly recommend Wen Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
    <li> No a huge fan. The first wash my hair felt soft and bouncy, but after that it ended up just feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Pros:   I have fine, thick shoulder length hair and it took me almost a whole bottle to figure out how much product to use - anywhere from 9 to 12 pumps for all my hair.    I like the fact that my hair is softer, that for the first time I don&#x27;t need to use any other product in my hair (mousse, styling spray, etc).  I can now either dry my hair completely with a blow dryer or just dry the crown and let the rest dry naturally.   Then once dry brush it out with a boars hair brush. My ends don&#x27;t have the dry frizzy look to them when I use Wen and I don&#x27;t have itchy scalp.     Cons:   Occasionally late in the day my hair can start to look a bit greasy around the temples and the nape of my neck. It is usually on warm days when I&#x27;ve perspired during the day.   The cost is a little steep for a &#x27;shampoo&#x27; but I think it is worth it.  However I may still research other, better priced products.    I do like this shampoo and am very happy with my hair, but I&#x27;m still not committed to this product... maybe after a couple more bottles I will be.</li>
    <li> I have tried hundreds of products for my hair. This is by far the best item I have ever used. They should sell this in the stores as it would sell like hotcakes! Once you try it your hooked. People comment on how silky my hair looks and it smells great. Easy to style. Wonderful product. You just have to try it!</li>
    <li> I bought this after I watched their late night infomercial, thinking I was in for a life changing experience. This product has it&#x27;s benefits, I will admit. It is the only shampoo product I have used where I can comb my hair wet with ease, and it is a great conditioner and the fact that it is a shampoo and conditioner in one is very handy. The first time I used it, my hair looked and felt fabulous. However over time, it made my hair look greasy after my hair dried.   It just looked liked I hadn&#x27;t shampooed my hair for days, and I was very careful about the amount I used on my scalp- thinking that might be why my hair was looking that greasy...but it looked greasy no matter what I did!    It didn&#x27;t tame frizz like I had hope it would, even with the styling creme it came with. I was so disappointed...I really did want to fall in love with this product but I didn&#x27;t...and I feel like it is severely over priced. I use Dove&#x27;s Intense Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner now and am much, much happier with that! If you have the money to throw around, buy this product. If not, I would stick with a good brand you can find at your grocery store.</li>
    <li> There are very few times when I order something off of an Infomercial.  But the Wen ad caught my eye, mainly because I do color my hair red and red is a vey difficult color to keep from fading.  But Wen really does work.  My hair feels good, looks good, AND the red stays red longer.  I was so impressed, I reordered!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews for this product I decided this cleansing conditioner would be a good investment. This product made my hair very oily and flat. I have long straight hair and this is normaly not an issue for my hair. I would save your money and use dove instead. Dove has made my hair very soft and gives more body to my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased WEN Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner approxiamately 2 weeks ago.  From the first wash I noticed a huge difference in my hair.  Two weeks later, my co-workers have noticed how soft, shiny, and just back from the salon my hair looks.  I have over processed my hair for years.  In fact I don&#x27;t even know what my natural color is anymore.  This  last salon session I had my hair dyed 3 different colors, red,brown, with blond highlights.  As you can imagine, my hair was fried, literally. It looked dry and straw like. I knew I was in trouble. I saw the Wen commericial and figured what the heck, I can&#x27;t make my hair any worse, right. It was expensive, but I was willing to do what I had to, to get my hair back in shape and manageable.  All I can say is Wen is a hair care miracle in a bottle. I don&#x27;t have to use any shine gloss on my hair, or other products, not even hair spray. My hair looks and feels like I just walked out of a salon, and this is a daily occurance. This morning while blow drying my hair I used a fine tooth comb to comb thru it. I have NEVER been able to do that, ever. With a brush I was working thru tangles on a daily basis, today I used a comb!! It is truly unbelievable.  I&#x27;m sold 100% on this product and will never go back to regular shampoo again!!</li>
    <li> I was desperate to find a product to help my dry, color damaged hair come back to life. After much hot iron abuse along with regular coloring, I was afraid my locks would never recover.   Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner delivered big time! There are no suds,which may feel a bit strange at first, but my hair felt totally clean after using it.  Using a wide tooth comb and clipping your hair up until you&#x27;re done showering really does the trick!.  Just follow the directions (you will soon determine the right number of pumps for your hair), and by the time you are rinsing, you will feel the difference.  I loved this product immediately, though I had been VERY skeptical!  I fell in love even more after I tried the styling creme of the same scent!-(1 pump after hair has been towel-dried)  My hair is noticebly more healthy looking, and it feels incredible to the touch! I actually look forward to &#x27;hair washing night&#x27; now because of the results! (I used to dread it!)  The Sweet Almond Mint has an invigorating minty smell which quickly dissipates to a neutral clean once hair is dry. I have subsequently purchased the gallon size(!) - yes, I love it that much, and the texture balm (use just a touch, as it can make hair oily) which will probably last forever because so little is needed!    I am grateful for these beautiful products as they have restored my hair and my confidence!  Thank you  Chaz, thank you Wen!</li>
    <li> I know hair products tend to be a woman&#x27;s domain, but I&#x27;m a 29 year old man and ever since my mid-teens my hair would became wavy and frizzy after growing out more than an inch.  I would have to get haircuts at least every two or three weeks or else I would end up with a tangled, frizzy mess.  All I ever wanted was simple, \\&quot;normal\\&quot; soft and manageable hair.    I have tried all sorts of high end conditioners and treatments over the years just to experiment and see what worked.  In the end I found that the more shampoo and conditioner I used the worse my hair would get.  I was convinced that nothing would ever work to relax and normalize my hair.  That was until I tried this product.      While appliying this product in the shower you can feel a tingling sensation on your scalp.  Leaving the product in for at least a few minutes is a must. So is rinsing with cold or lukewarm water.  I also combed my hair straight over and over again while the product was in to maximize the straighten effectiveness.  One look in the mirror and I was shocked at the results.  My hair was straight and soft. But the real test was after my hair dried.  For the first time ever I could actually comb my hair and it would stay in the direction I combed it and not poof back up!  Truly Amazing. My hair actually looks healty and strong.    I highly recommend this product.  I have also tried the fig which seems to give more moisture - but the sweet almond is also very good for all hair types.    Thank you Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product like many people after watching the infomercial. I was so pumped to try it because I have fine, thin and dry hair. I used it several times and followed the directions exactly. My hair looked okay after a few hours after washing it with WEN, but then quickly became dry and felt as though it had a ton of build up in it. By the end of the day, I looked like a grease ball and my hair looked as though it hadn&#x27;t been washed at all. It was a complete waste of money. I have now been using Loreal Sulfate free shampoo and Dove daily treatment conditioner and my hair has never felt healthier, I highly recommend this combo of products. Also try the Body Shop&#x27;s Brazil Nut hair mask once a week, or every other week, it&#x27;s AMAZING! Save your money and continue to use your cheaper shampoos, you&#x27;ll be much happier!</li>
    <li> This product works just as advertised.  I am very happy with it and will continue to purchase it.  I did find, however, that you do not need to use as much as the directions instruct.  I have long, very thick hair but am still able to use half the amount recommended.  I can now go three days without washing or re-styling my hair.  It holds a style whether I curl it or straighten it much better than with traditional shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I tried Wen since my sister liked it so much for her hair. So, I really wanted to like it as much. Unfortunately, it left my hair kind of tacky and sticky and not clean feeling. I tried everything. I used the recommended number of pumps and then tried to alter that formula....I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed....followed instructions to the T.    I have found thru my hairdresser, a hair product line called It&#x27;s A Ten...great stuff! atleast for my hair. I have thin hair which I high light and low light and I use their moisturizing shampoo, leave in conditioner and shine serum and we have a winner!      Made in the USA too and much lower price than Wen.</li>
    <li> This product helped bring out the curl in my hair.  It smells great and gives a nice cool tingle to the scalp.  I was skeptical at first, but it really does cleanse your hair without suds.  It took a few washes to figure out that you need to use MORE rather than less for best results.  I have used two thirds of the bottle in less than 3 weeks.  (Its turning out to be even more expensive than I thought!)  I have since learned that this product isn&#x27;t as unique as I thought when I saw it advertised.  There are other similar products that are cheaper and some people say you can wash your hair with ordinary cheap conditioner like suave or V05.    In short, it works great, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the hefty price tag.</li>
    <li> I am a 52 year old woman with long hair.  I am caucasian with no real hair problems.  I do color my hair with a semi-permanant hair color about every 12 weeks.  I was skeptical when I received this product as a gift from my mother.  I had never heard of it.  I tried it and was not impressed at first.  I used it a couple of times and then read the instructions and went to YouTube and watched the videos on the use of product.  I started using the product correctly and must say that after one year, I cannot live without it.  It works on my hair and I never have bad hair days anymore.  My hair does not fade, or lose color.  I have recommended this product to my best friend and my sister in law.  They both use and love it.  I gave it 5 stars...the only negative is that it is a costly shampoo/conditioner.  If you are looking for a cheap fix, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I used this product exactly as per directions. Aside from the nauseating strong and strange mint smell that lingers on you into the next day so very conflicting with my Versace perfume fragrance, I found my hair did not even look or feel as good as when I use my usual salon products. I was very disappointed after I had heard all the hype about it and expected so much more.  I would not buy this product again and wish I had my money back.  I call it an expensive trial.</li>
    <li> I purchased Wen&#x27;s Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner since I had heard so much about it. I was expecting outstanding results; however, I just got okay results. I used it for about 1-2 weeks but it just seemed to weigh my hair down. I did like using it as a conditioner though! Works great in that respect. I&#x27;m sure the bottle will last me a long time since I only use it as a conditioner every other week. Who knows - maybe I didn&#x27;t cleanse my hair correctly or something but all I can say is I won&#x27;t be buying anymore of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and the bottle is not empty yet! The packaging and arrival of the product was excellent. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching the infomercial and was impressed with the natural ingredients. I tried it and have been using it 2-3 times/week (I wash my hair every other day) and haven&#x27;t really noticed my hair getting better. If anything, I feel like my hair is a little more greasy and heavy than normal. I have fairly short hair and have been using about 10 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s ok, but not great, but everyone reacts to products differently so it might be great for you.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and was anxious to try some thing new that would allow me have super soft curls without being dried out and frizzy.   This product really does help with the dried out feel, but the frizz is still somewhat there, but not as  bad as when I use store bought or even salon shampoos.  I have to use anti-frizz serum on damp hair after my shower with this product to get the frizz to go away completely so that there is just ringlet curls with no frizz.    What I like about this product is that it works by not drying out my hair and it feels clean, not weighed down and greasy.  I love the smell too.  What I hate is the price and how quickly it gets used up.  I have to use about 20-25 pumps of this stuff for it to get worked into my just past shoulder length hair to achieve the desired results and I think it may last me about a month (maybe).       I went out and bought some Hair One at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply to compare the two and I have to say Wen is a little better but not by much esp. with such a huge price difference.  The Hair One product does not smell nearly as good, the product does have Argan oil in it which makes may hair feel a little less light and clean.  It does not feel greasy really, just not as light and springy.. hard to explain really.  The difference is very subtle.   But I have to say it is not be that big of a difference for me to fork out $30+ a month for the Wen hair product.  When Hair One is only $10 and with a discount card I can get it for about $9. Bottom line...if I was made of money I would stick with Wen, but since I am not I will go with the Hair One.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few days, and so far, so good. I love the smell and the tingly feeling on my scalp when I use it. It does really make my hair much more manageable, shiny, and soft. My only complaint so far is that when I wake up the next morning (I am a morning shower person), my hair is so greasy it looks like I haven&#x27;t showered for months. I hope this eventually resolves because I don&#x27;t want to have to shower just to leave the house for a quick trip to the grocery store, pharmacy, etc.</li>
    <li> So far I think this product is pretty great!  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but it seemed   to tame my dry frizzy hair considerable without making it dull or oily.  It is expensive,  but may well be worth it.  I will know better after a couple months of use, but will more  than likely purchase it again.  It smells refreshing too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Discountbeauty on Amazon a couple of months ago.  The product that arrived at my house was a similarly packaged product labeled WEN Cleansing Conditioner, but the ingredients list was completely different.  The real product&#x27;s first 4 ingredients are Water, Aloe Vera Gel, Glycerin, &amp; Chamomile Extract. This formula was cheaply made with Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, and Cetearyl Alcohol.  When I contacted the seller originally, they claimed they purchased their ingredients \\&quot;directly from the seller\\&quot;.  When I provided evidence of a different ingredients list, they didn&#x27;t bother to respond!     I looked into this and found a website called wenhaircare.com.  This website sells a low quality fake version of the real Chaz Dean product, but they charge the same price.  If you want the actual WEN product you must purchase it from [...] or the QVC website.  Wen hair products are not being resold for sale to anyone else. In the future, I will by my Wen from people who are authorized to sell it.  And I will NEVER purchase anything from Discountbeauty ever again.  This was the worst customer service experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  This is basically stealing.</li>
    <li> I decided to try WEN to see what the fuss was about. The smell is lovely (I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint) and it did make my hair feel very soft; however, I&#x27;ve decided not to purchase it again simply due to the fact after owning it for 1 week I have used 3/4 of the bottle. I used the amount per the directions and only co-washed with it 2-3 times a week. I used 1-3 pumps as a leave in in the morning and at night after I rinsed out my hair for the night. Even if I used 1/2 the recommended amounts a bottle would have lasted me maybe 2 1/2 weeks. I really can not justify paying $40 for a product that doesn&#x27;t last that long. I also found the scent has diminished and it&#x27;s not as strong as it was when I first opened the bottle. Would I recommend this? Sure, it&#x27;s worth trying, you never know it may just be the product you&#x27;ve been searching for, but for me, my quest continues....</li>
    <li> This is a long review, so here&#x27;s the short version: Wen makes my hair soft, but that&#x27;s about it.  If only it cost 1/6 of the price, I&#x27;d re-buy it.    Here&#x27;s how I determined that:     I have long (past shoulders, not yet to mid-back) curly hair that loves humidity (not!), and have been struggling to find a decent product to moisturize my hair and leave it manageable in the summer time.  I heard about Wen and decided \\&quot;Well, it&#x27;ll cost more than I want, but if it works, I can splurge on it regularly\\&quot;.    I bought the 16 oz bottle thinking it would give me a good introduction to the product without committing myself financially.  I watched the \\&quot;How-to\\&quot; videos on the Wen company website - rinsing hair for a few minutes before pumping liberal amounts of the product and working (yes, I brought a comb into the shower, too) through the four sections of your head, adding a splash of water, then letting it sit for at least a few minutes before washing it out.    Thus, I was rather psyched up to give the product a try.    It has a pleasant smell, but it took me a few showers to get used to the foamy (rather than lather-y) texture of the product.  Because I wanted to know the effect the product had on my hair, I cleansed and let my hair air-dry (without any normal styling, blow-drying, etc.).  The first day my hair seemed a little frizzy in the morning after the shower, then as the day went on it got less frizzy and more greasy, until the evening when it looked like I needed another shower.  But I&#x27;ve heard this is typical, so I didn&#x27;t worry.    I continued to use the product in this manner every day for a week.  As the week wore on, my hair had less frizz-to-grease range and balanced out a little more.  In addition, I noticed that my hair felt softer than it had with my previous shampoo (Aveeno Active Naturals shampoo + conditioners).  I began to use the product every other day after the first week, and added in an anti-frizz serum after the shower, but no further improvementsto the quality (shine, softness, manageability) were noted.  With the addition of the anti-frizz product after the shower, my hair behaved as normally as it had using other shampoo/conditioners, though it was softer than using some brands of shampoo/conditioner.    Towards the end of the first week and after, I was using about 5 pumps of the product per 1/4 section of my head (meaning 20 pumps to cover my head per shower) and letting it sit on my head for about 10 minutes before rinsing it out.  While this is less than recommended, I noticed that while \\&quot;working\\&quot; the product into my hair (and certainly with combing it through) that much of the product ended up on the bottom of my tub and not on my hair.  I thus used less product (attempting to extend the lifetime of the bottle) and worked it through more carefully.    After the 14-day mark (the equivalent of 10 showers), I was unable to pump more product out of the bottle.  Because it has the consistency of a thick conditioner (and because the pump design isn&#x27;t the best for thick conditioners), some of the product was resting on the inner walls of the bottle and away from the pump&#x27;s reach.  This occurred when there was about 1/4 of the product left (about 4 oz).  Since I was determined to get my money&#x27;s worth out of the bottle, I removed the pump and began trying to shake out approximately 20 pumps for my shower.  Not easy to do, but I was able to continue to use the product for another couple showers (picture me, sitting on the floor of my shower, frantically trying to squeeze out every last bit of the Wen product like a frantic drug addict trying to grab at the last scraps of her stash).  Not pretty, either.    In the end, yes, the product made my hair softer than some other shampoos (namely, Aveeno Active Naturals).  But as far as taming frizz or adding manageability or body to my hair, I saw no improvement.  So, for the price of a bottle of Wen cleansing conditioner every 2.5 weeks, I determined this product is NOT A WORTHY PRODUCT and NOT A REPEAT BUY.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for six months and found that it does work for me; but I had to adjust the amount I used. Occasionally I used a high end shampoo (and the same brand conditioner) to \\&quot;give my hair a break.\\&quot;  I use about half as much product as they recommended and one 16oz bottle lasted me over 5 months.  I found I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair as much with this product (only twice a week at most) and I think the people who find it greasy should use the least amount as possible.  By occasionally using a high end shampoo or a cleansing shampoo my hair felt great.  The WEN product seemed to work better for the next 3 to 4 weeks after.  When I calculated the price paid for WEN and the need for a high end shampoo &amp; conditioner combo, it was less than paying for the high end shampoo &amp; conditioner for the same time period. Sounds weird, but i had to wash my hair more often with only the high end shampoo &amp; conditioner, so over the long run using the WEN product saved me money.  I think those that have greasy hair should use less product and a cleansing shampoo; although this may not be as cost effective for them depending on how often they wash their hair.  WEN has a variety of cleansing conditioners so you might have to experiment with which formula works best.  By the way, I have long, wavy, medium thick hair.  My scalp can get oily and my ends can get really dry.  Wen is one the best products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the real Wen from chaz den, this is a fake. I will not be purchasing from them again.</li>
    <li> can use everyday or use it with your other shampoo. Some people find it makes their hair oily and only use it once a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for a year now. Yes, I got sucked into the auto pay and I&#x27;ve been wondering now what to do to not spend $30 per month for this product. I have really curly hair that will look horrible with nothing on it. This has been the first product that has softened my hair, literally without any styling gel, mousse, hairspray. I love the product because one: it has made my hair really, really soft when it&#x27;s dry, it smells really good, it&#x27;s one product so I don&#x27;t have to mess with a bunch of bottles, and I can use it for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the product because one: it&#x27;s too expensive: two, it does not last me a complete 90 days cause I use about 16 pumps in the shower and two when I&#x27;m done showering. The worse part about this product for me that really bothers me is that when I use it as the leave-in conditioner and then I apply the styling creme, the combination of the two clumps up and I am left with white little clumps all over my hair that makes it looks really dirty. If my hair dries, it will look like I have dandruff or my hair is really dirty. Because of that, I hardly ever use the styling creme cause that does NOTHING for me anyway, my hair ends up kinky, frizzy and without any curl with it. BUT if I use the conditioner as a styling product, then my hair ends up nice and soft, bouncy and with volume but that does NOT last all day and by the next day, my scalp is itchy and the residue makes my hair look dirty and I have white stuff on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So although I love how soft it has made my hair feel, I like it as a cleansing product, but as a styling product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. I am still trying to find a good styling product that keeps my hair under control, soft and without the use of a bunch of chemicals. I also use their hair mask but that does nothing either. My hair falls out like crazy too, before I used the product and after...so that has not improved in ONE year. I&#x27;m loosing A LOT of hair and if you think Wen&#x27;s going to improve that, I highly doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, I think it&#x27;s worth to try it though, what works for me, may not work for you and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UDPATE:&lt;br /&gt;I eventually cancelled the autopay. I was left with a bunch of product (unopened). After my experience with this product I would NOT recommend it. It&#x27;s too expensive and all it is, is conditioner. I ended up using the conditioner but after a long while, I realized I had residue of conditioner on my scalp. I now decided to make my own shampoo with baking soda, water, and essential oils and nothing cleans my scalp and hair better than that! Plus, I know exactly what&#x27;s in it without worrying about chemicals, additives, etc. This is just a rip off in my opinion.ly doubt it.  Good luck, I think it&#x27;s worth to try it though, what works for me, may not work for you and vice versa.  UDPATE:  I eventually cancelled the autopay.

    <li> If you have super fine hair stay far, far away from this product.  Shiny hair?  Try GREASY hair!  Even when I cut WAY back it made my hair look greasy and weighted it down.  I don&#x27;t usually review products but I had to put my two cents in if it will save someone else major bucks.  What a waste!  I had my neighbor (who has super thick hair) try it and she thought it was only so-so.  At least her hair wasn&#x27;t greasy though!  Save the money, people!  This is NOT a miracle cure!</li>
    <li> After following the label&#x27;s directions,it left my hair greasy and dark.  If your hair is oily, like mine is, I do not recommend it.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it.  My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair.  About a 3-4 weeks into using the product, I noticed clumps and clumps of hair clogging the drain.  The same happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me, she used a different scent.  I lost about 1/3 the thickness of my hair; I was devastated.  I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off.  I quit using it and though my hair stopped falling out, my hair is not the same.  It&#x27;s been about 8 months since I stopped using Wen and my hair has lost it&#x27;s vibrance, it&#x27;s strength, and I still have tons of short hair that don&#x27;t seem to want to grow.  I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke!  Now, it snaps at the lightest pull.  I miss my thick, beautiful hair.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have.  I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy.  Well, I am, but my hair isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that gets super frizzy with regular products.  Wen is now the only product I use.  I follow the directions and my hair has never looked or felt better!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> In general, I think your hair acts healthier and happier when first trying a new product so I waited before final judgement on this product. Long term, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to continue to use it based on it not being in stores and how quickly you go through one bottle. It took me 2 weeks to be happy with the product&#x27;s performance and I always left it in for 5-10 minutes each morning as it recommends. I don&#x27;t find the results so fascinating that I&#x27;m going to continue to pay for it.    Pros: The smell        After as a leave-in conditioner, hair is smooth        My hair seemed less prone to tangles          Cons: Smell doesn&#x27;t stay once dry - almost smelled dirty instead with no chemicals in it        As a leave in, hair feels very heavy and almost greasy</li>
    <li> I had been told to try Wen for my daughter by friends who were white and black. My daughter is mixed and I find it hard to find a product that works with her hair. I had not realized that my daughter truly had mixed hair. When using this product her hair looked even worse than before. Some parts of her hair went soft and straight and others became tight ringlets. Since her hair is not all one type it didn&#x27;t work for her. I tried it multiple times to just see if her hair had to become used to it. On a plus her hair was clean, smelled good, and the product didn&#x27;t dry out her hair or leave it oily like others we have tried. Also the first months supply didn&#x27;t even last four washes.</li>
    <li> Not only did this stupid product make my hair fall out and greasy, the customer service is horrible!! they kept sending me shipments that i never signed up for and charging me for all of them, i sent everything i got right back to them and now they say that they never recieved the shipments so now i can&#x27;t get my money back!!! DON\\&quot;T BUY THIS CRAP!!!!!!</li>
    <li> After watching the infomercial on Wen, I thought this was the answer to all my hair products.  It most certainly wasn&#x27;t.  Even though I did 16-20 pumps and massaged it through, combed it through, left it on for 15 minutes, I saw no change whatsoever.  Then I did it again the next day and put a shower cap on to really help the product soak into my hair and scalp.  Again, nothing like the infomercial transformations.  The best thing this product has to offer is your hair will smell wonderful.  Otherwise, it has to high on the list of rip-offs to come from the hair industry!  Do not waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this product and after the first time I was very upset.  My hair didnt look at all different.  But the worse thing was it actually made my hair FALL OUT.  It has been about 2 years since I used this product and my hair is still falling out. I only used it about 2 weeks and now my hair is thinner than ever.  Dont buy unless you want your hair to fall out!!!</li>
    <li> OMG what an idiot I was to fall for this! One star because I had to mark something. First of all the product made my hair greasy, icky! Yes, I am a pretty smart person - college educated - but I DID NOT read the fine print and did not realize I was going to keep receiving this stuff and getting billed for it. It never ends! I called to have it all STOPPEd, and spent a fortune sending it back, but here it is a month later and my card was charged again!!! I hate marketing like this. I realize it was my fault, but they make it almost impossible to get a refund. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY</li>
    <li> the only reason i&#x27;ll ever go back to regular shampoo/conditioner is because i don&#x27;t have the $$ to splurge on this product. However, it&#x27;s WORTH EVERY PENNY. i am of mixed race, and my curly/wavy hair is usually a hassle to manage. Wen has helped it grow, and it&#x27;s never been softer! i get so many compliments on my natural curls.</li>
    <li> I received the Wen cleansing conditioner as a gift and thought I would give it a try. I have ALWAYS used amazing hair care products that were only from a salon and were pretty pricey. I baby my hair since I color it, and use a flat iron, and curling iron, and live in a hot, dry climate. I always thought what I was using was top notch and left my hair feeling great. After about 2-3 washes with the Wen I felt like I had someone else&#x27;s hair. My color looked better, my curls were fuller and bouncy-er and I could not stop touching and feeling how silky smooth my hair felt. After about 2 months I ran out of my new best friend and literally almost cried in the shower when I had to use \\&quot;regular shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; I have been without Wen for about 2 weeks now and I can&#x27;t believe how dry and disgusting and flat my hair looks. I can&#x27;t believe I walked around like this for all those years before never knowing how much better my hair could have possibly looked. I honestly always thought my hair was \\&quot;great\\&quot; after my expensive products but with Wen my hair looks \\&quot;AMAZING\\&quot; I will NEVER EVER go without this product again. I love it!</li>
    <li> I saw the infomercial and was impressed with what I saw.  I decided to try it out.  I have very thick wavy hair and it doesn&#x27;t not work for me as a shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t cleanse my scalp.  So I wash my hair first and then use WEN as a conditioner.  I like it very much using it this way.  It softens my hair and leaves it very shiny.</li>
    <li> This product reminds me of Pantene.  When I used it, it was gunky, almost like glue.  Yuk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that always looks dry and frizzy, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Wen Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner.  The product sounded ideal, but turned out to be a big disappointment.  My hair feels marginally softer but still looks as dry and horrible as ever, even though I followed the instructions to the letter.  Considering more people will be seeing my hair than touching it, I rate this product as a failure - especially considering the price!  I&#x27;m just glad I bought a bottle to try from Amazon rather than being trapped by the conditions of their website.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I don&#x27;t use the amount -the # of pumps recommended-but I do like the smell and the \\&quot;processing\\&quot; while I shower. The little bit at the end for conditioner is great.I have thick/heavy hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner is by far the BEST hair product I have ever used.  I have tried every product on the market and have found nothing that even comes close to this shampoo conditioner.  Your hair looks and feels amazingly conditioned and healthy after the first time you use it.  PLEASE try this product.  It REALLY works well!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAIR PRODUCT THAT I HAVE EVER USED. FOR THOSE WHOM HAVE BEAT UP, OVER PROCESSED, DYED AND FRIZZY HAIR, THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.  I WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE AGAIN BECAUSE, TRUST ME WHEN I SAY, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL WITH NO IMPROVEMENT.   MY HAIR FEELS LIKE IT IS REAL HAIR AND NOT A HORSES TAIL, (IN THE PAST I&#x27;VE USED STUFF FOR HORSES TAILS, SEE HOW DESPERATE I WAS?)  I CAN NOT RAVE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ENOUGH.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a little skeptical about this product!! After a month of using it I loved it!!! My hair FINALLY stopped being so frizzy and unmanageable! I love it!!</li>
    <li> This conditioning shampoo product is nothing special.  And it&#x27;s expensive.  But beyond that:  Be very wary if you order from the website.  You will be automatically billed and sent future orders and it is very hard to cancel.  When I spoke to the sales representative about why I had to pay return shipping for a refund on a product I never ordered she referred me back to the website.  All I can say is when you check out they have a box indicating if you want automatic shipment of future orders but they will sign you up for that no matter what box you check or don&#x27;t check.  Buyer beware!  If you do want to try it order it from someplace other than [...]  And, my advice is to stay away altogether.  Why support a product that uses such shifty business practices?</li>
    <li> I ordered this after watching the infamous infomercial...I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve all seen it!  Anyway, I am an African-American woman who has done absolutely EVERYTHING to my hair and now have (thick, thick)relaxed hair.  I only mention my race here because I think it is important to stress what the creator of this product was saying about his line--it works for anyone! I have only used this product for two weeks and I have to say that never before has my hair looked and felt so touchable--I literally used to cringe (and divert the perpetrator) if it seemed as if someone wanted to put a hand on my hair!  I also used to be in a state of perpetual unrest--concerning my mop.  It just seemed like no matter what products I used, I was always looking for something to do BETTER.  The search is definitely over; I am truly satisfied.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs more good hair days!      October 14, 2009...One more child and one recession later, I still stand by my review, but if you are trying to save money in uncertain times, Dove Intense Damage Therapy Shampoo/Conditioner will also give you beautiful, healthy results.</li>
    <li> This is only the second product I have ever purchased after watching an infomercial - so I thought it may be a waste but I will try anyway...  I did not want to buy it off of the their commercial because I did not want my card charged and the automatic shipping - so I bought it off amazon.  I got it 10 days ago and just love it!  Weird but I have actually had 3 compliments on how nice my hair looks this week and the only change is the shampoo.      The only con I&#x27;ve found is the instructions on the bottle are \\&quot;off\\&quot; for me though my hair is just past my neck and the bottle says @14 pumps and that was way too many after the first time it looked greasy - so I do 3-4 pumps comb it through and leave it sit while I finish my shower then rinse.  My hair looks and feels so soft :)  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been  using this product for about 6 months now....some of the negative reviews I believe completely...but I don&#x27;t think they are using the product correctly...first of all you do not need as much as they tell you to use...Honestly half as much will do just fine....if you feel like your scalp is not clean, use regular shampoo just on your scalp and then just use the wen as a conditioner..if you do that, you use even less and stretch your dollar....the next really important thing for some reason is you have to blow dry your hair to get the amazing results wen has to offer  I don&#x27;t know why, but it makes a HUGE difference...if you just let your hair air dry, it will look like crap...and if you flat iron it, it will also look bad, I don&#x27;t know why, maybe it burns the product....but if you use it like I mentioned above, and blow dry your hair out with a round brush I swear your hair will look awesome!  and be really healthy...  I hope this helps you guys enjoy this product and not feel like you&#x27;ve been \\&quot;had\\&quot;...</li>
    <li> I am African and have the thick, Kinky Hair. I love my hair dont get me wrong-- but it&#x27;s been chronically dry and in the past when I moisturized it- it always seemed like the moisturizer just sat on top of the hair and did nothing to soften it. Gross!    I saw Chaz Dean&#x27;s Wen products on a commercial and thought- not possible. Ive tried so many products over the years that have promised miracles but not delivered an iota on that so I was skeptical. But after reading a review from an African American here, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! I got my order 4 days ago, used it for the first as soon as it came in and the change was INSTANT! My hair is now soft, silky and really- the kind of hair I think I had last in my childhood.  Im 30 yrs old now. I cant believe how soft, silky &amp; light my hair is!! My hair feels texturized and yet it is completely natural. Baby soft and elastic, not wiry!!!     You have to consider that-- after decades of using detergents- one use of WEN has had such a dramatic effect. What about 6 months down the road of continued use? For the Africans or African Americans skeptical about whether some products work for our hair-- Im here to tell you -- this stuff works! I got the booklet and they say the fig cleanser is good also. I&#x27;ll probably try it next but...the sweet almond mint works GREAT! I used to cringe when people tried to touch my hair...but for the past 48 hours, I&#x27;ve been touching it constantly to be sure this is for real. It is.  I&#x27;ll never go back to shampoo that&#x27;s for sure.I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> i LOVE this stuff! its awesome!&lt;br /&gt;i did learn the hard way that even if it leads to a cold shower towards the end (which it did) that you HAVE to rinse it very well! but that lesson was learned quickly and my hair has been looking amazing for the last 3 months. a week ago i did wash my hair with a regular shampoo to get some left over residue out but hey! once every three months of a bad hair day is better then almost every day! i love the balm stick that the set comes with too. that stuff is awesome! i know a lot of people dont like the smell but i think its refreshing! really wakes you up and smells clean. ive also heard some people complain that they though they product was making their hair fall out. nope. thats just what happens when you comb hair in the shower. my hair is still disturbingly thick even though it does seem like a lot comes out in the shower. just make sure it doesnt go down the drain!</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt so good. My hair is more managable. Less frizz and flyaway. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to dry my hair any more to get the curl I want either. The more you use and the longer you leave it on the better. Also makes my hair very shiny. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I loved the Wen, but it was more expensive than what it is worth. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old, with very fine brown hair (just above my shoulders cut in a layered bob) that I have colored blonde.  My hair has a natural wave to it.  As a result, it&#x27;s never as shiny as I would like for it to be.  I use L&#x27;anza hair products which I really love, and try to get it shiny with the InStyler which does a good job.  But, it never looks as good as when I leave the salon which is what I am always trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the infomercial with Allysa Milano and figured, why not?  I read all of the reviews here before purchasing but figured that it was worth a shot - I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint scent and used it for the first time today. I agree with many of the reviewer comments - the smell is very strong when you are applying it but it&#x27;s faint when your hair is dry.  It looks and feels like you are washing your hair with conditioner.  I used less than the recommended number of pumps for my hair length due to how fine my hair is (I typically use less styling product, as well, due to my fine hair) - total of 15 pumps which sufficiently covered my hair with no issues.  I massaged it in for 2 minutes, used a wide tooth comb to evenly distribute and left it on for 5 additional minutes.  I rinsed it off well and then used 1 pump as a leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super soft and shinier than usual.  It feels clean but not stripped.  But, in my case, it&#x27;s almost TOO SOFT.  I will need to use a ton of additional styling products in order to have any kind of control over my hair.  I can say that if my hair style was loose and wavy, it would be perfect.  But, my layered bob with bangs does not do as well with this product. I would never be able to make my hair straight after using this as it&#x27;s just too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s the first time that I used it, I can&#x27;t comment on how long it will last before/if it feels greasy and if this is the same as normal shampoo.  I will continue to use this product, but probably as a super conditioning treatment every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:  I stopped using this product after a couple of days.  My hair felt too greasy.  I gave the bottle to a coworker who uses Wen and really likes it.  Thus, reducing my rating from 3 stars to 2.itioning treatment every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:  I stopped using this product after a couple of days.

    <li> I was very hesitant to purchase Wen products due to the costs, I have been toying with the idea since the product came out and this month I took the plunge. I have NOT been disappointed. I have baby fine, shoulder length straight hair that is naturally oily at the roots.  I color my hair with a brown auburn color (which is quick to fade), and so my hair seemed to always be dry at the midshaft and ends. I had purchased several different Organix leave in products, and I was not very satisfied with the results. My problem was it would add oil and shine and look great in the am, but come 2 or 3pm my hair was a oily mess and it had to go up in a ponytail. It has been about 4 days since I have been using the product and I have seen a HUGE improvement in my hair. It is glossy, and oh-so soft to the touch.  I have been SO happy with the Wen products. My boyfriend has even commented on how improved my hair is. Oh and I&#x27;m no longer insecure come 3pm in the afternoon, my hair looks great and has lasting shine without the overly greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are hesitant due to the price, fear not and make an investment in your hair. I look at it this way, I don&#x27;t go to the hair salon on a regular basis, so the $100 for a cut and style I would normally get charged there at the salon more then pays for this product. You will NOT be sorry that you did. Remember ladies your hair is important accessory as you wear it each and every day. Let&#x27;s not forget... you are worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Wen for the win!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, I have been looking for a great product for a very long time. If you have naturally curly hair this is the best product for you. I only recommend that you get the cleansing conditioner, and then stick with your own gels and hairsprays. I used the other products that WEN sells  and I did not like the way it worked. This is a must buy hair care product, trust me it really does work!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I first tried the Lavender Wen, but it seemed to leave me hair kind of greasy after a few days of continuous use. The Sweet Almond Mint is great my hair is soft and clean after every use. Very pleased with the product and the quick service.</li>
    <li> I never believe anything I see on tv or an infomercial. I&#x27;m not sure what inspired me to even try it initially but I have never used another cleansing product since and it&#x27;s been several years now. I only wish it was a little less expensive but all in all worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair and I really wanted this to work for me. It didn&#x27;t...felt as if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for days. Smells good and probably works well for other hair??</li>
    <li> I have lots of thine hair. It did great for my flyaways, and gave me the body and bounce I was hoping for. Good smelling too!</li>
    <li> I used the Chas Dean products exclusively for 6 months.  My hair is fine &amp; I liked it, but finally not so much for the expense.  My new trial is Keratase &amp; I like it equally as well.  Kiel will be next...</li>
    <li> Like the smell and tingle of the mint.  Not my favorite though.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying I have odd hair--not quite curly, but definitely more than slightly wavy.  The underside of my hair is INCREDIBLY coarse, frizzy, and curly; whereas, the top half of my hair is normal in texture, wavy-curly, somewhat dry.  I do have trouble with oiliness at my scalp though where my bangs are, so I had a hard time with this product.  You really have to use A LOT with each wash if you have longer hair like mine, and it took a really long time to wash out.  If you don&#x27;t have crazy high pressure in your shower, you&#x27;ll be in there for a while.  I would end up having mornings where I was rushing more than usual and couldn&#x27;t wash all of the product out, leaving my hair greasy.  As opposed to just washing my hair every other day, I found my hair was too greasy by the 2nd day to get away without washing.  I only use this shampoo occasionally now when I want a boost of moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought WEN as a last resort. I am 40 something, and my hair is up and down. Dry, oily, frizzy. It is longer now, and I thought I would have to cut it off-Again! But I thought I would try WEN...and this stuff is Awesome! I don&#x27;t use as many pumps as it says...no sense wasting product. (If you have product dripping off your hair into the bottom of the shower-you are wasting it!) I make sure to wet it a little more, and massage it in, and leave it in until I am done with my shower. My hair is like it was WEN I was 18, and I am not kidding! Thank you Chaz...and thank you Amazon! I ordered a big bottle through Amazon rather than go through Chaz and get the little \\&quot;kit\\&quot;. I just wanted to just get my WEN and get to it! It is Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and it smells great!  It says to use 20-30+ pumps on your hair, which I believe is WAY too much.  I use 3-5 pumps, comb through it, and rinse it out thoughly.  When I wake up in the morning and it is dry, it looks like I havent shower in days! I have dry hair.  This product does work good as a conditioner, but I don&#x27;t suggest using it daily.  I started using it every other, or every few days only on my ends and it is fine, because I don&#x27;t belive it truly cleans your hair.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair really soft.  It smells really good and I don&#x27;t lose any hair when I use it.  It is expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> I watched the commercials and having very dry, course, curly/frizzy hair, I thought to give it a try.  I received the product and started using right away.  At first the results were quite good and my hair was softer and managable.  I noticed after two months that my scalp was just grungy, like there was a buildup on it.  Since you are not really \\&quot;washing\\&quot; your hair, but ultra conditioning, it was a little less to be desired and I could not continue using this product.</li>
    <li> maybe I just have naturally healthy hair already, so this was just icky in my hair.  Made my hair feel sticky/waxy and dull.  I gave it to a friend. I tried it 3 times thinking it was product residue already in my hair or the weather or something else.  People rave about it, I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for years now and I would not use anyhting else.  Great product for long straight hair, makes it soft &amp; shiny</li>
    <li> I purchased this item through the commercial on t.v. I love it. When I discovered that amazon sold the 5 16oz. bottles for the money I purchased two. My hair looks wonderful and the color has lasted for a month longer than usual. My husband first joked about me using it until this morning when I caught him \\&quot;pumping on the product\\&quot; I will never use regular shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the WEN haircare system for about 6 months and i totally love it! My hair has never been softer or healthier, and my scalm which used to always be itchy and flaky is the healthiest its EVER been. HOWEVER, I bought it after watching the infomercial and have been truly diasmayed by the sales tactics used by Gunthy-Renker. First it bas back ordered so they charged me and made me wait weeks to receive any product, then they auto ship the product and include way more than I could use. The billing is confusing and you have to pay return shipping on products that you don&#x27;t want. I will coninue to use the cleansing conditioner, but I have no use for the styling cream and have 3 tubs of the \\&quot;remoist hair treatment\\&quot; Try this product, it does work. But order off a sight like Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the WEN products because I heard how great the products are.  I liked the products but they didn&#x27;t work as great for me as the other reviews that I have read.</li>
    <li> You must prepare your hair by rinsing it in cold water before using.  This is not what I want to do while showering!  I gave it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I ordered my \\&quot;non shampoo\\&quot; about a month ago I think and at the time I thought it was probably going to be a waste of money but I liked the \\&quot;idea\\&quot; of not using harmful products on my hair.  It also sounded like it would be very expensive to use...when you read the directions it says 6 pumps (or 8 I can&#x27;t remember..I use 6)of the product in EACH area of the head...top, back,and each side so 6x4&#x3D;24 and then three more at the end as a leave in conditioner.  I figured this stuff is going to be gone in 3 days!    Well not so, I still have 1/3 of the bottle left and was thinking it is almost time to reorder.  I love this product.  At first I washed my hair each day and now it is every other day.  I bought the product because my hair was very damaged from a perm and very frizzy on the ends.  It has been less than a month and very little frizz left, actully it is just a bit of \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot; in one area right on the ends.    I love how it feels on my head, a bit tingly.  My hair feels much healthier.  I followed ALL the directions and now wash my hair in warm to cool water not HOT and I do not rub it with the towel to dry it...I also use the blow dryer on cool not hot setting...I think those were very good suggestions and have also helped prevent further damage.    So my recommendation is to try it, I am glad I did.[[ASIN:B001D4FF66 WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16 oz]]</li>
    <li> The condition is very nice in the summer as I am at the beach or at the pool often and this keeps my hair healthy.  The styling cream, however, is pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well.  Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I watched the infomercial and I thought I must try this to get that smooth silky hair. This product doesn&#x27;t lather and doesn&#x27;t remove oil from the hair enough. This would be a decent conditioner but not for a shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have short naturally wavy hair.  While this product did make my hair very soft, it also made it very flat.  For that reason, I stopped using it.</li>
</ol>
