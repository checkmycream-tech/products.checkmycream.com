### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I just prefer the mechanical ones, but this is also great for pedicures!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s you, then this is a very good value considering you get 4 brushes.</li>
      <li>Good quality brushes!</li>
      <li>I thought this was a good value to get a set of 4 for what others charged for one brush.</li>
      <li>Great quality and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Liked that 4 came in the package.</li>
      <li>I run it under warm water to soften it up and use it mostly in the shower.</li>
      <li>But since I have sensitive skin, it is actually perfect.</li>
      <li>Many of them are enjoying lovely skin now!</li>
      <li>Everything else I have used has always caused irritation, but not these. :)</li>
      <li>In my opinion it is better than shiseido&#x27;s 20 dollar something brush.</li>
      <li>I love this brush...</li>
      <li>This is a very nicely assembled, attractive brush but it is very soft (hence &#x27;soft touch&#x27; in the title) and doesn&#x27;t provide the exfoliating properties I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>It is great for people with sensitive skin, however.</li>
      <li>Not for defoliating but easy way to wash face.  </li>
      <li>Easy to handle in the shower.  </li>
      <li>this is a very soft bristle brush that works great on the skin; you don&#x27;t want something too stiff as it will tear up your complection;  very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic since you get 4 brushes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s attractive enough to have out on the counter.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t remove the dry/dead skin and give my face that smooth, shiny look like my Body Shop brush used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read a review that says that the brush gets stuff with long use; I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like it helped clean anymore than just using my hands.</li>
      <li>Not a big deal, but good to know.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick, I will purchase from this seller again.  </li>
      <li>Great small size and easy to wash face.</li>
      <li>I liked how soft this was on my skin yet effective enough to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a stiff brush, this will not make you happy.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>My skin is looking fantastic since I am now able to exfoliate the peeling caused by Retin A and other retinol products I use.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a facial brush, but it is much too soft to do any good.  </li>
      <li>Kind of like taking a wet satin sheet and rubbing it against your face.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This is exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>I have since introduced many people to them and they have appreciated the benefits that these facial brushes have provided.</li>
      <li>The bristles are ultra soft and clean very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are made quite well and the bristles are super soft.</li>
      <li>It can dry better that way.</li>
      <li>This one has much softer bristles.</li>
      <li>Bristles are very soft but not too soft to clean.</li>
      <li>It is far more gentle on your face, but I feel like it does lack a little bit of pore-clearing power.</li>
      <li>this seems to be way too soft to really do anything for my skin.</li>
      <li>I decided to keep mine in a toothbrush holder, in the place you would normally stick the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I clean the brush thoroughly after each use and allow it to air dry without the cover!  </li>
      <li>So I set out looking for a new one.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone who likes very soft brushes for their face.</li>
      <li>VERY soft bristles.</li>
      <li>I found this brush to be way to soft!  </li>
      <li>I had one of these brushes previously and it had really stiff bristles that felt like you were getting a really good scrub.</li>
      <li>The brush is a frosted clear color, not the seaglass aqua that is showing in the picture.</li>
      <li>I thought the bristles were too soft.</li>
      <li>Brush is really soft, which my 8 year old loves</li>
      <li>But after using it I can say it&#x27;s TOO soft.</li>
      <li>So then I saw this one advertised as soft.</li>
      <li>It is soft.  </li>
      <li>brush would be well-suited for babies or anyone with extremely soft and/or sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>this really works for daily face cleaning.</li>
      <li>Bristles are too soft.</li>
      <li>It was amazing, but it finally snapped in half after a crack in it kept getting bigger and bigger.</li>
      <li>I like it though because it is not rough on my skin.</li>
      <li>They are entirely too soft to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; you face.  </li>

    <li> I have used these facial brushes for a long time, and people have always complimented how my skin looks. I have since introduced many people to them and they have appreciated the benefits that these facial brushes have provided. Many of them are enjoying lovely skin now!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. Bristles are very soft but not too soft to clean. In my opinion it is better than shiseido&#x27;s 20 dollar something brush.</li>
    <li> VERY soft bristles. Great small size and easy to wash face. I bought a 4 pack and was enough for my entire family.</li>
    <li> I always get blackheads when I wash my face with my hands so I like to use these brushes instead. The bristles are ultra soft and clean very well. I only wish they lasted longer. They each usually last me about two to three weeks before the bristles start turning yellow and get stiff. No amount of rinsing or drying these brushes seem to fix that.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a facial brush, but it is much too soft to do any good.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it helped clean anymore than just using my hands.</li>
    <li> This is a very nicely assembled, attractive brush but it is very soft (hence &#x27;soft touch&#x27; in the title) and doesn&#x27;t provide the exfoliating properties I was hoping it would.</li>

    <li> Bristles are too soft.</li>
    <li> I like the face brush.  It is soft.  If you are looking for a stiff brush, this will not make you happy.  I like it though because it is not rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> Since purchasing, I have relegated these for boot polishing.  They are entirely too soft to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; you face.  I was searching for a brush that could be a bit abrasive; these are not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made quite well and the bristles are super soft.</li>
    <li> i bought cheek room facial brush for 4 times this cost!! And this was a four pack. I bought these for my son to wash with in the shower, i bought cheek room for me. I noticed that these are the same consistency as the cheek room facial brush!!! Good quality brushes!</li>
    <li> I had a brush from The Body Shop that lasted me years with at least 1 or 2 uses daily. A relative of mine worked there and gave it to me. It was amazing, but it finally snapped in half after a crack in it kept getting bigger and bigger. So I set out looking for a new one. I bought a different brush before this one that said it was &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; firmness. It ended up feeling like sand paper to my face. So then I saw this one advertised as soft. But after using it I can say it&#x27;s TOO soft. It does feel &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for. Kind of like taking a wet satin sheet and rubbing it against your face. It just doesn&#x27;t remove the dry/dead skin and give my face that smooth, shiny look like my Body Shop brush used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush would be well-suited for babies or anyone with extremely soft and/or sensitive skin. If that&#x27;s you, then this is a very good value considering you get 4 brushes. That&#x27;s why I only took off 2 stars even though I have no use for them. They&#x27;re just not for me.</li>
    <li> this really works for daily face cleaning. Easy to handle in the shower.  Liked that 4 came in the package.</li>
    <li> I love this brush...I&#x27;ve tried other with minimal results.  This brush cleans without drying out my skins.  I read a review that says that the brush gets stuff with long use; I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.  I clean the brush thoroughly after each use and allow it to air dry without the cover!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I found this brush to be way to soft!  When I used it, I could hardly feel the bristles.  I like to feel the bristles when I brush my face dry or with soap and water.  This is why I gave it a 2 star rating.</li>
    <li> this is a very soft bristle brush that works great on the skin; you don&#x27;t want something too stiff as it will tear up your complection;  very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> this seems to be way too soft to really do anything for my skin. i gave half of them away.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good value to get a set of 4 for what others charged for one brush. Brush is really soft, which my 8 year old loves but I find dissappointing. Still, I did notice it is helping to lift some dead skin. It&#x27;s just not getting into my pores.  Bristles are too long in my opinion. I had also hoped to hang this in the shower but there is no hole in the handle. Since the item is shown in a box it&#x27;s hard to see what you are getting. The brush is a frosted clear color, not the seaglass aqua that is showing in the picture. Not a big deal, but good to know. It&#x27;s attractive enough to have out on the counter. Comes with a plastic cap but it takes so long to dry I can&#x27;t see ever using it unless traveling. I decided to keep mine in a toothbrush holder, in the place you would normally stick the toothpaste. It can dry better that way.</li>
    <li> I had one of these brushes previously and it had really stiff bristles that felt like you were getting a really good scrub. This one has much softer bristles. It is far more gentle on your face, but I feel like it does lack a little bit of pore-clearing power. It is great for people with sensitive skin, however.</li>
    <li> Not for defoliating but easy way to wash face.  Four brushes for a very low price will accommodate a family.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> @ 1st I thought the bristles were too soft. I like for it to feel like its scrapping the &#x27;ugly&#x27; off. ;) But since I have sensitive skin, it is actually perfect. Everything else I have used has always caused irritation, but not these. :)</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick, I will purchase from this seller again.  I am a little disappointed at how soft the brushes are - -  but they are called &amp;#34;soft touch&amp;#34; I should have expected that</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Cheaper than anywhere local. Came fast as per usual with Amazon. Would recommend to anyone who likes very soft brushes for their face. Akin to a makeup brush. I prefer harder bristles such as a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what it says it is. It works well, I just don&#x27;t like putting a cap back on something when its wet or its been damp. Great quality and easy to use. I just prefer the mechanical ones, but this is also great for pedicures!</li>
