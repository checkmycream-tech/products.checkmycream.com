      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>This one has a nice color, but it&#x27;s just TOO waxy for me.</li>
      <li>This Revlon product is nice.  </li>
      <li>Kind of reminds me of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I am a redhead with very light brows, and this product is a very natural light taupe looking color, which is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I would rather get more product for the brow and forget the highlighter</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather have more brow pencil and not have the highlighter at all.</li>
      <li>so glad you carried it</li>
      <li>I love Revlon Colorstay brow enhancer.</li>
      <li>Not the &amp;#34;highlighter&amp;#34; part which has too many sparkles.</li>
      <li>Glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product, my eyebrows are severely light</li>
      <li>It fits me best and looks more natural than any of the black eyebrow pencils or brow color ehancers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to find this product on Amazon as it is no longer available at local stores such as CVS .</li>
      <li>Have used this product for years, so I will continue to look for it on Amazon when available at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I have strawberry blonde hair and my eyebrows are so fair you can barely see them, this pencil gives them the most natural look of any product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The pencil applies easily and is sort of soft and waxy, so it also helps shape your brows.</li>
      <li>The color works well with my coloring and the pencil is soft and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I have very light eye brows, I am blonde.</li>
      <li>This was the first Brow enhancer that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>and it really fills in my sparse brows better than a regular eye brow pencil.</li>
      <li>This pencil goes on light so if you want to make it heavier, you can, but it doesn&#x27;t initially come out that way.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the highlighter much and it just fell out</li>
      <li>The item I want to write a review about goes out of stock so fast.  </li>
      <li>The color is perfect and doesn&#x27;t look fake!</li>
      <li>If you have full eyebrows that only need a little fill in, this might be ok, but if you&#x27;re trying to create a fuller shape, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
      <li>Pencil is wax based and more than anything keeps eyebrows in place with a little bit of color.</li>
      <li>so you have to be careful with it and apply with light strokes, you dont have to apply a lot.</li>
      <li>Would recomend these to anyone who wants natural looking brows.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a true light blonde and like some color on my brows, but always had trouble finding a pencil that was light enough to still look natural.</li>
      <li>It fills in my eyebrows ok, but on areas where there are no hairs (my brows are incredibly light blonde naturally and very sparse from plucking them to thin lines in the 90s)</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I love this eyebrow pencil because it is the only one that I have found that is for someone with light blond hair every other liner that I have found is either to dark or orange.</li>
      <li>This pencil is very easy to apply and looks very natural, it blends well with my natural eyebrows and is subtle.</li>
      <li>I have light blonde hair and very light eyebrows, so it is difficult to match a shade that doesn&#x27;t look too dark.</li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde but always had darker eyebrows which to my dismay seem to be thinning as I age.</li>
      <li>This is the only brow pencil that looks natural, and doesn&#x27;t come off until I want to take it off.</li>

<li> and then it looks sloppy.  </li>

<li> Revlon has discontinued this items which sucks!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had been unable to get them in many stores and when I could they were a lot more expensive than the these.  Use them all the time and they work great</li>
    <li> This product is no longer sold in retail stores, and I think this is the best brow product on the market so I stocked up.</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow pencil because it is the only one that I have found that is for someone with light blond hair every other liner that I have found is either to dark or orange. Revlon has discontinued this items which sucks!!! But at least I can still find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> The item I want to write a review about goes out of stock so fast.  But over all this brand of brow enhancer is terrific. It fits me best and looks more natural than any of the black eyebrow pencils or brow color ehancers I&#x27;ve used.  They need to keep plenty of Blackened/ Brown color in stock because it&#x27;s hard to find!</li>
    <li> I am a redhead with very light brows, and this product is a very natural light taupe looking color, which is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis and it has been discontinued in stores. This was the only place I could find it and probably not for long.</li>
    <li> I have strawberry blonde hair and my eyebrows are so fair you can barely see them, this pencil gives them the most natural look of any product I&#x27;ve ever used. For daytime I use it alone, for night I have to use darker pencils with it. The enhancer part is awful, such a waste considering that&#x27;s what the majority of the product is.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great eyebrow  pencil &amp; also bright highlighter ..all in one  so compact&lt;br /&gt;was hard to find  so glad you carried it</li>
    <li> Purchased three of these pencils because I have used them for a long time and can no longer find them in store. Would recomend these to anyone who wants natural looking brows.</li>
    <li> I used to by this item at the local Walgreen&#x27;s, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  I have since checked other Walgreen and other discount stores and am not able to find it anywhere.  Have used this product for years, so I will continue to look for it on Amazon when available at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I feel like I&#x27;m coloring in my eyebrows with a crayon and then it looks sloppy.  I&#x27;m still on the quest to find a good brow pencil for an inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> I finally find a brow pencil that doesn&#x27;t look fake on my very blonde brows and they stop making it.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  The seller got it to me in record time.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Once I received this, I realized I had purchased it once before and wasn&#x27;t a big fan. After going back to blonde after a year of being red, I needed a blonde eyebrow pencil to replace my auburn one. This one has a nice color, but it&#x27;s just TOO waxy for me. It fills in my eyebrows ok, but on areas where there are no hairs (my brows are incredibly light blonde naturally and very sparse from plucking them to thin lines in the 90s) it doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin (and I&#x27;m the palest of pale!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a pencil that&#x27;s going to fill in AND shape, and this only does the former, if that makes sense. If you have full eyebrows that only need a little fill in, this might be ok, but if you&#x27;re trying to create a fuller shape, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Pencil is wax based and more than anything keeps eyebrows in place with a little bit of color. I could take or leave the highlighter end of the pencil but haven&#x27;t found another eyebrow pencil I like as well.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product on Amazon as it is no longer available at local stores such as CVS . I am a natural blonde but always had darker eyebrows which to my dismay seem to be thinning as I age. This is the only brow pencil that looks natural, and doesn&#x27;t come off until I want to take it off. I can even sleep with it on and have perfect brows in the morning. I only use the tinted wax end. I don&#x27;t like the highlighter end. It is too glittery, goes into the creases, does not stay on and is just not flattering on me but it doesn&#x27;t come any other way than with the 2 ends. I would rather get more product for the brow and forget the highlighter but oh well...&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush. It used to be packaged with a two-ended brush which I still use and it makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> This Revlon product is nice.  However, it is a bit overpriced.  I got this in the store, when they had them in stock, for $12.  Paid $18 when I ordered it online.  Guess, as this product is no longer stocked, they can charge whatever they want.  Would not order again.  Can learn to do without in the future.  Will find another similar brow enhancer.</li>
    <li> I have white hair. It&#x27;s difficult to find a brown pen that is light enough. This one is perfect. I can no longer find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> It was hard to use this pencil, a little too waxy and looked heavy on my very blond eyebrows. The highlighter end seems not needed as well.</li>
    <li> This was the first Brow enhancer that I have ever used. I have very light eye brows, I am blonde. This pencil is very easy to apply and looks very natural, it blends well with my natural eyebrows and is subtle. One thing that I dont like about it is the wax can pull eyebrow hairs out so you have to be careful with it and apply with light strokes, you dont have to apply a lot. I don&#x27;t use the highlighter much and it just fell out but it didnt blend well with my skin. I will be ordering another one and use this as my eyebrow pencil!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever used. I have light blonde hair and very light eyebrows, so it is difficult to match a shade that doesn&#x27;t look too dark. This pencil goes on light so if you want to make it heavier, you can, but it doesn&#x27;t initially come out that way. The color is perfect and doesn&#x27;t look fake!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product, my eyebrows are severely light but this takes care of it. Just be careful using it too roughly due to the wax is NOT made like exspensive products, Revlon is a Sephora rip off brand but is STILL GOOD. Just be careful is all.</li>
    <li> Revlon has discontinued this product. The color works well with my coloring and the pencil is soft and easy to apply. I purchased 3 to stock up.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really fills in my sparse brows better than a regular eye brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I never wore brow liner until this product, then, of course, they discontinued it! Why do companies do this????? Kind of reminds me of toothpaste. Toothpaste always came in tube form until companies decided we were going to pump the stuff, thus we got pumps. When we were all used to pumping it, they switched back to tubes. Go figure! Anyway, like this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I&#x27;m a true light blonde and like some color on my brows, but always had trouble finding a pencil that was light enough to still look natural. This one is perfect. No sharpener needed. They&#x27;re getting hard to find in my local drug store, so I&#x27;m wondering if Revlon might be discontinuing or changing the product? I hope not!! The pencil applies easily and is sort of soft and waxy, so it also helps shape your brows. The color stays in place very nicely and doesn&#x27;t smear at the end of the day. This pencil lasts me about 1 month. My only complaint is that there is a highlighter at the other end which I never use and end up just throwing it away, so I&#x27;m wasting half of the product. I&#x27;d rather have more brow pencil and not have the highlighter at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I found for my needs.</li>
    <li> I only use the brow color. Not the &amp;#34;highlighter&amp;#34; part which has too many sparkles. The brow color also tames the hairs because it&#x27;s sort of waxy. Not too red. Looks very natural.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet!!</li>
    <li> I love Revlon Colorstay brow enhancer. It&#x27;s the best eyebrow makeup that I have ever used. I was so sad when I discovered that it was being discontinued, so I am trying to stock up and buy all I can before I can&#x27;t find the at all anymore.</li>
