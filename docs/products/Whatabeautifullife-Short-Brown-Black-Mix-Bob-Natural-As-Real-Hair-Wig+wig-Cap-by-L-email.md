<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For a Velma costume.  The wig was much darker than it appeared on the website.  I would call it black more than brown black mix.  Great for a costume but I don&#x27;t think it looks natural if that is what you are seeking.</li>
    <li> When I received this wig,with a bad cut, I took it out, tried it on, &amp; it immediately started falling apart, &amp; shedding like no tomorrow.  I could have just saved my money for something else. Glad I bought one else where, while I waited for this raggedy one. Never again.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, but it has no brown in it at all it&#x27;s a solid shiny BLACK. It&#x27;s also very thin very very thin as in the basket or lining you can see on the areas right above bangs. Plus it sheds a lot. To wear with a hat on would work. Needs trimmed as it&#x27;s very uneven.</li>
    <li> It looks like real!&lt;br /&gt;I never bought a wig as good as that! :)</li>
    <li> This wig looks good, not as fake as I thought. The hair does comes off so you need you take care of it. Its not as dark as it seems its like a caramel color in the end. Besides that its good, I dont think is good for daily use though</li>
    <li> This is a nice wig if you don&#x27;t plan on wearing it a lot. It is really good for random occasions but it does shed a lot so i was a little disappointed. Good for Halloween costumes but not for an everyday thing.</li>
    <li> i just like it the way it fit @ it is easy 2 handle @ take care of @ love the color plus the shape</li>
    <li> Love it so many compliments. Great price, not heavy and looks real.</li>
    <li> This wig is so realistic!! I LOVE IT!! works great for what I need it for! Thanks Amazon for the On time delivery, I was nervous about getting my items on time but you guys ROCKED it thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly nice wig for the price! Bought this for a costume and the hair felt very silky and nice.</li>
    <li> returned  was jet black not brown black</li>
    <li> Guess my daughter and her friends can use this to play dress up. That&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s good for. The back is cut way too short and the sides too long. The hair is straight as a poker.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat he price..looks same color as in e picture which is dark auburn..not black/brown..but it&#x27;s very nice and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Liked the wig - loved the style - very cute but unfortunately, for me, it is way darker than I imagined.</li>
    <li> Was for someone else. They did like it.</li>
    <li> This wig is Ok - but not great. It doesn&#x27;t appear as the photo shows. There are waves from shipping.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but very attractive. Would probably not hold up well under daily or long term use, but excellent value if used occasionally and very gently.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this wig. For one, I ordered the brown/black and received the BLACK one, which seemed shorter than the picture. Also, the adjustable ribbon part where you put the hooks into were sown completely across the wig, so I can&#x27;t even adjust it because there isn&#x27;t any place to put the hooks because it&#x27;s sown all the way across.&lt;br /&gt;The hair itself is very nice hair. It so soft and shiny. I will be using it every once in a while, but would have been much happier with it if I could use the adjustment straps and if it would have been brown instead of BLACK.</li>
    <li> I love this wig very cute and fits my found face perfectly. I&#x27;m overly satisfied with this product :) I look forward to shopping for more wigs from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great value for the product. I bought this wig for a Snow White costume and for less than $7 I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality - especially for the price! It really looks natural.  It is by far my favorite wig I own!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a 1920&#x27;s themed Christmas party. The hair is a brown with a red undertone and very soft. I was worried that because of the afforadable price that I would be getting a wig with the &amp;#34;platic&amp;#34; hair feel. This is such a nice wig that people actually thought it was my real hair. It&#x27;s cute and sassy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this affordable purchase.</li>
    <li> This wig is not brown/black... it is just black... Returning the item.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my friend. The piece is really small and tight.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured, don&#x27;t  resemble real hair would not recommend this. Feels like plastic</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like real hair.... didn&#x27;t like it at all... tried to cut it into a style... didn&#x27;t work so couldn&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Short Brown Black Mix Bob Natural As Real Hair Wig + wig Cap from Goooooooood in February to wear to an upcoming event.  I received the product in a timely manner as scheduled, and I was extremely excited. When I opened the package, I was impressed with the packaging, quality, type of hair which was all excellent, it actually looked and felt as “natural -- real hair,” for a wig that is impressive, as described by the Seller- Goooooooood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worn many different types of wigs over the years, and I must state this is one of the best “wig hair,” I have seen in a while, it looks very natural, someone would not be able to tell that it was a wig.  The wig cap included in the package is also a plus.  As I took the wig out of the packaging, felt the hair, I was still very impressed.  I then realized that the wig was not Brown/Black Mix, it was actually a Black wig, the length and style of the wig was incorrect, it was not a short-styled wig as pictured.  It was long enough to pass my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews, I realized that numerous customers received the “correct wig,” I contacted Amazon Customer Service who was very helpful in resolving the situation. I realized that I had received the wrong wig, errors occur, and since I loved the wig, decided to place another order of this wig from the Seller-Goooooooood. This time I noticed it would take longer, I was informed it was coming from China.  I was concerned it may not arrive in time for my event, yet anxious, decided to order the wig as described in the advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second order arrived before my event, I again received the same Black wig, no Brown in the wig, hair was as real hair, quality was good, length was longer than pictured in the advertisement, and the wig was shedding frequently from the wig. I was amazed by all of the positive reviews, realizing that many Amazon customers did receive the correct wig, although on two attempts I did not receive the wig that was advertised and described in the advertisement. If you unfortunately receive the wrong wig, style, color, and quality then I could not recommend purchasing from this Seller as you would not receive the wig advertised and pictured above. An order that started in February to mid-April resulted in a waste of my time and online shopping experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually ordered the wig from another Seller-Royal-Style, received the correct wig, mixed color, great quality and style, although the length was a little longer than pictured. I would recommend if you receive the correct wig as advertised you would be extremly happy with this wig, the quality, style, color is great.he wig that was advertised and described in the advertisement.

    <li> Very nice wig, but the color is light brown.. Great for the price</li>
    <li> The Cosplayland short brown black mix BOB wig is a nice little wig. It makes a fun change when re-doing ones&#x27; hair style is not an option. The color is lovely and the fibers do feel almost like real hair. The wig tends to be on the small side so wearing a wig cap is essential so that the wig will fit better and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that the wig did not come with care instructions but for $9.95, it&#x27;s not bad. It does not shed thus far and is easy to maintain by using a wig comb and running your fingers down through it to reset the style and clear tangles. I recommend that customers buy a mild wig shampoo and wash the hair gently and rinse in cool water. Do not wring out the wig. Lay it on towels to dry. Do not use hot hair rollers on your wig as it will destroy the strands. Avoid chemicals and do not style with a hot blow drier or curling iron. ( these are the type of instructions that should have come with the wig but didn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;Marilyee Dowling</li>
    <li> She liked it though she feels it is too long. Sheds a lot when you brush it</li>
    <li> I ordered short a short brown bob and received a black one instead.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero star I would do it. I just trashed my money by buying this. Very ugly and not normal cut or size. Do not buy this item at all</li>
    <li> Wig that arrived was more of an auburn-blonde; quality was poor, workmanship shabby. Piece of the wig came off as soon as I took it from the wrapping. Really looked fake.</li>
    <li> Not exactly like pic but I knew when I bought it from other reviews it wouldn&#x27;t be still super cute but I&#x27;m not a fan of how it&#x27;s cut</li>
    <li> Was not the color I wanted</li>
    <li> Was perfect for the theater show I was in. I recommend it as I got many compliments on how real it looked.</li>
    <li> I threw it in the trash.  The qualitly was terrible.  Nothing compared to the picture. You get less than you pay for.</li>
    <li> So cute.  I will buy others.  Arrived very quick.  The bangs were perfect on me, but I have a high forehead.</li>
    <li> A little thick but please buy one it fits great and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I was so shocked when I received this wig.  I could not believe I got such a value for the price.  It is so comfortable and still looks like new.  I wear it daily.  I have gotten some awfully good compliements.  People want to know what do I do to it to keep it looking good - What kind of spray, etc.  I have done absolutely nothing to it but wore it.  The picture of this wig really did a good job.</li>
    <li> Solid black. Not mixed black and brown.</li>
    <li> It was really nice and the woof cap was to defently worth it</li>
    <li> I like the wigs good shiping A++++++&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> FITS PERFECT LOVE IT. LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS. EVERYONE WANTS ONE. REALLY NICE COLOR. HOPE TO FIND MORE LIKE THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> My hair is really long, and I never thought I would look good with this wig. It fits perfect and the look is natural.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite wigs.  I got it for my Velma costume and it is a great fit.  It is very soft and full.  The color is very nice and natural looking as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig that has a very natural look and it feels really comfortable to wear.  I have recieved many many compliments off of it.  I loved it so much that I ordered another on in a different color.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. That was a plus, and probably the only positive.  When the wig came I was very disappointed.  Hair was falling out all over the place. I would never be able to wear this in public. I won&#x27;t be buying again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I used this for a costume, with a fascinator hat and bead headdress!  It was a hit!  Many people thought I had colored my hair!  Great value and comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Wow...really impressed by the quality of this wig. The style is great, very full and looks identical to the picture displayed. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this wig in the mail really quick. looks cute and fun to play with but not sure it would pass as real.</li>
    <li> Absolutely atrocious. It is a lie. It looks gross. The order came late. The wigs hair is falling off. The hair is uneven and it is the wrong color. It is pitch black. Severely disappointed. Never buy from this place.  Disappointed on every level.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wig for my mother.  I tried it on...I will be ordering one for myself. Love it too.</li>
    <li> Arrived directly from China, no insert, instructions and nothing to indicate what this is made from.  I will not use it. Guess I must have missed it was made in China.</li>
    <li> Thick and nice,  it does need trimmed to fit your face/head, but a nice wig for the price, looks cute</li>
    <li> i like this wig it change my apperance it makes me look younger i wii reccomend it to anyone very stylish</li>
    <li> It fits perfect and looks great. It definitely is more black then brown though. If you are expecting a brown wig, you will be disappointed. I was very happy as I was looking for something darker.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a wig party. Was not disappointed. It was one of the nicer ones. But probably not suitable for anything other than a party.</li>
    <li> Pure Black and looks like a china doll wig.  Gave to my grand daughter to play with.  Very cheap but not what reviews stated.</li>
    <li> Both hair was the same so I don&#x27;t wear it all now from I buy them and I was trying to fix it to my liking but it did not work.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!!!!!! EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED...&lt;br /&gt;I read costumer reviews and there were a lot of complaints on receiving the wrong color and wig shedding and lateness. However, that was not the case at all! I&#x27;m happy to report I received order within 3 days! It was the right color, thick, and simply beautiful! And there was little to no shedding, only natural shedding.  ZERO COMPLAINTS HERE!!! GREAT DEAL!</li>
    <li> I enjoy wearing this wig fits perfect for me and love the color.</li>
    <li> It is amazingly shiny and looks just like real hair… It is the best wig I have ever owned! However, the wig is supposed to be a brown and black mixture, but the wig I received is all black. I don&#x27;t mind, as it is only for a costume, but that is why I only gave it a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> okay. too old for the color. looks nice on .managable hair. great for a young girl to wear,but not old people.</li>
    <li> This was one of the first wigs I purchased for my investigative job. I have LOTS of hair but still managed to get it up under the wig with no problem. Stays in place well and so far no one has figured out it is a wig...hair is very soft and looks natural.</li>
    <li> WRONG COLOR. AND ITS NOT LIKE WHAT I ORDER. I CAN GET INTOUCH WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE. THAT IS A NO, NO FOR ME.</li>
    <li> the hair felt real but it was&#x27;nt cut like the picture. It came from china took almost 1 &amp; 1/2 months for me to get it but I gave it 5 stars because the hair was nice and I bought another wig from a local store for myself. When I did finally get this one I gave it to a woman who had lost her hair from chemotherapy for breast cancer and she was very happy with it. It fit her well and she said it made her look and feel pretty again. Too see the smile on her face and her excitment about this wig made my heart feel good. Ladies no matter what any doctor say&#x27;s that you&#x27;re too young for breast cancer get the BRACA test if you have a family history of breast cancer, do a monthly breast exam and insist that you want a mammogram to catch it early and you can beat this. Blessing to you all.</li>
    <li> I got it yesterday , I did try and since like they had cutted in front and is uneven  very short in the front ... too bad the hair feel soft and nice but the haircut in the front messy !!</li>
    <li> sexy lil wig. wears nice, shake and go. it is easy to wear, and it is one of my faves</li>
    <li> The wig was fine itself,i even got it delivered the very next day i ordered it. but when it came it was a dark black instead of the brown i ordered. Also, the hair wasn&#x27;t a bob at all, it was longer than shoulder length and layered.</li>
    <li> It looks very pretty and looks like real hair</li>
    <li> I originally bought this wig for a Velma costume, but it looks so real, and it feels great, I now have added it to my professional every day wig collection. For it being as cheap as it is, the quality of it is amazing.</li>
    <li> whatabeautifullife-short brown black mix bob wig arrived on time and is a very good product it fits nicely and looks stylish thank you</li>
    <li> I really love it... It feels like real hair.. I was very satisfied with wig will defiantly recommended ..  Hosted a 1920 theme party an it was amazing</li>
    <li> The wig cap was too small for my head and the hair was too shiny for my taste but I watched some tutorials on YouTube and played with it.  I learned how to use powder to make it appear less shiny and I used hair spray to thicken the hair as well as hot curling it.  I snipped the wig cap to fit on my head. I also learned from one of the tutorials how to properly cut my wig in layers.  I received the wig on Friday after work and wore it to a wedding the following night. It&#x27;s not made as well as many wigs but as a wig-wearing novice, it was/is fun experimenting with the style. This wig cost less than my lunches and brought me a lot of pleasure.</li>
    <li> This wig is a nice wig. It&#x27;s very good quality, though it did take some time to get on. But this wig is not brown. It is BLACK. My friend ordered the same wig and it too is black. So if you need a brown wig, get a different one.</li>
    <li> Looks great on the mannequin head.</li>
    <li> I received it today and it does not fit as illustrated. Also it doesn&#x27;t look entirely like the picture. The hair is falling out. not a good deal even for $8 since I cannot wear it.</li>
    <li> I love the wig, do not love that it doesn&#x27;t come with promised wig cap. Make sure that you have a wig cap.......otherwise, I think the wig is terrific and no one even knew that I was wearing one. Isn&#x27;t that the best???? I learned my lesson on many items that I could have purchased directly from Companies for a little less than you pay with Amazon Prime, but it is well worth it to pay a few dollars more to get the fantastic service and quick delivery from Amazon</li>
    <li> First of all the color not exactly as described, for the fact that. The one I got, It looks more lighter brown. In addition, it is pretty big for my head .  I tried to secured the wig on my head, by using attached wig adjustable straps. It still way big and loose on my head.....very disappointed. Finally I just got fed up and throw it to garbageeeeeeee!!!!!! I will never order from this company again!!!!</li>
    <li> bought this wig becuase i was curious how i would look with this hair style. the quailty is great, but i didnt like the way i looked in it. I would buy from this seller again. Great wig, just didnt look good on me due to my facial shape.</li>
    <li> arrived early and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig - simply stunning!!  It&#x27;s one of the best on the market :) I&#x27;ve purchased at least 20+ wigs over the years, and this is in my top three!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the pic...Cut is not as cute, color is more of a dark brown, no red tone....It&#x27;s cheap and it served its 5 min purpose. Would not use to go out with.</li>
    <li> I cannot received this item as of yet, So I cannot comment on this item as of yet. But if the quality is as good as the one that I have received already. I can tell you now. I will Love it.</li>
    <li> The wig came promptly, the company kept in contact with me letting me know at all times what was goingnon. The wig was full and sooooooooooo beautiful. People at work don&#x27;t even know I have a wig covering my blue/ purple hair :p</li>
    <li> This wig is really nice, but I ordered BROWN.  The one I received was BLACK.  I want to order another one, but this time I want BROWN or MEDIUM BROWN.</li>
    <li> Hair falls of easily from wig. Length on wig is much smaller than what the picture shows. Totally not worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good quality like the other wigs i have bought before, but my wife says it isnt so, it looks and feels cheaper not high quality. oh well i know now not to buy these.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I loved,I loved,I loved...Natural As Real Hair And Very Shiny.This is my first wig ever, so I have nothing to compare it to but I really love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was told that I might not get it until the end of January...sorry , but I don&#x27;t understand why it should take so long when I ordered it before Christmas??!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A NICE WIG FOR THE PRICE AND I WILL PROBLY ORDER MORE IN DIFFERENT SYLES.  THANK YOU RENE</li>
    <li> The wig is 100% black.  Not a mix at all, looks nothing like the picture.  However I was given a full refund (or told I was going to get one anyways-have to wait a few days)</li>
    <li> It looked nothing like the picture.  I cannot wear this wig.  I may keep it to use at Halloween.  bad</li>
    <li> Looked great for the price.</li>
    <li> hair is falling out and it looks different than the picture</li>
    <li> Love this wig. As I unpacked it, I thought it would be a bit too thin (it IS thinner than pictured IMHO), but when put on and finger-combed, it&#x27;s adorable! I would definitely call it brownish black and more to the black side. If you are a Phyrne Fisher fan, you&#x27;d love it! Great costume wig and maybe even a good badhairday wig. We&#x27;ll see....</li>
    <li> i got it for my mother who has cancer, she love it, i she want me to get another one thank you</li>
    <li> I trimmed the bangs but truly, this rocks for the price. It&#x27;s fun and has a real Pulp Fiction look! Go Uma....</li>
    <li> The biggest scam! It does not look like this picture at all, should not allow to sell in your site.....</li>
    <li> This is  a nice change of appearance for me.  The color is about what my natural hair was before I aged.  And the styling is current</li>
    <li> looks and feels great and looks amazing it feels very secure</li>
    <li> My package arrived earlier than expected which I loved! This wig is very shiny but like a good shiny. No one knew it was a wig and I got a lot of compliments on it! it didn&#x27;t shed hardly when I took it out and brushed it. The cut is very nice and compliments my face well! It was perfect!</li>
    <li> It fits my wife well, but she wasn&#x27;t entirely happy with the actual appearance.  She knows how to style hair though and thinks she can cut it to appear like it does in the picture.  Overall for the price it wasn&#x27;t a bad buy, but they should update their photo to depict the true appearance of this wig.</li>
    <li> I would call this color caramel with a few black hairs mixed in, way lighter then the photos.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a wig nothing natural about it, very itchy &amp; the bangs are really long &amp; are not easy to cut.&lt;br /&gt;Good as a costume wig but not for anything else.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig! I bought it originally to be a replacement for my real hair for my Squirrel Girl costume. I used to have short hair, but have since grown it out and dyed it red. I was nervous that it would be poor quality (thin, shiny, wefts not sewn in properly) but that was not the case at all! This is one of the best wigs I have ever owned and I would 100% recommend this to anyone wanting to try a bob haircut. It also shipped incredibly quickly (I believe it was 3 or 4 days after I ordered it). It&#x27;s incredibly soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle at all. Buy this wig. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Looks a little darker than picture and for a bob cut its uneven ! Still very cute though! Best thing it came with in 10days ! (2 weeks earlier than estimated shipping time ) I&#x27;m in Long Island , NY&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to crossdress with it !</li>
    <li> As I stated above, I LOVE it, since I am a crossdresser, and I LOVE the feel of nylon and silk against my body, I LOVE to feel like a women, with makeup and all</li>
    <li> OMG, I put it on and the look was beautiful, the quality was more than I expected for the price, I will order a 2nd for special events.</li>
    <li> I got this since my hair is so short and trying to grow it out it looks strange. OR when I just don&#x27;t feel like styling my hair. I wear it to work and looks great. Was a bit confused on how to use the straps but I figured it out easily. Looks just like real hair, I have a wig product and comb to keep it looking fab.</li>
    <li> Hair falls out!!!!  Comes out in the hand fulls!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig just for fun. It is just so-so. It doesn&#x27;t quite fit right, so I&#x27;m a little disappointed. I would be very unhappy if I really needed a wig for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> This wig is super shiny, sheds badly. I will not wear this. It looks like barbie doll hair.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised with the random purchase, feels super soft and seriously looks like real hair. Go Hong Kong</li>
    <li> totally looks different what its shown and it doesn&#x27;t even fit on the manikin and the worst thing is I cant even return it basically I lost my money</li>
    <li> I knew this was too good to be true. They sent me the style I ordered but in a completely different color. Also the wig is so small it should be listed for small to medium sized heads only. Unusable for the costume I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture, though I wish the hair was a little longer in the back</li>
    <li> Not a top-quality wig, but great for the price. It&#x27;s shiny and fairly evenly cut.</li>
    <li> this wig is too long and the hair fibers continually fall on you shoulders. would send back if shipping were not so expensive.</li>
    <li> I wore this to a 1920&#x27;s themed party. It looked great, people were complementing me and they actually thought it was real.</li>
    <li> Uh... This looks horrible on. The hair sticks out everywhere and looks nothing like the picture for me. I&#x27;m going to try and comb it down and see if that helps at all.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig and it was a great price.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised. Nice wig very well made. Highly recommend using this vendor.</li>
    <li> got this wig to go with a 1920&#x27;s  flapper  feather head piece. It completed my look with a wow.con (if you want to call it that)  ,it was not as brown as the picture shows, more black than brown, other than that, the length was about the same, if you want that straight bangs you will need to cut it.Not a lot of shedding. I would wear this out in public as a every day wig.I am going to buy one more wig for the Halloween season and I will looking for this company piece</li>
    <li> estimated delivery time was very long, but when it was overdue by another month this seller gave the wig for free.  it looks to be very nice, but I was buying as a surprise gift for my sister and so now will have to wait until her next visit in three months.</li>
    <li> This wig looks really cute!  But unfortunately, the one I received had some defects.  The weft (the netting that the bands of hair are sewn to) had a rumple in it that caused the weft to be \\&quot;too much\\&quot; in one spot so that it stuck up right through the hair like a spur.  Also, there is way too much room in this wig and has many folds in it in the back and sides.  I suppose if you had tons of hair and needed to stuff it all up inside the crown weft, it would accommodate it and more.  Maybe you could use the extra space to stuff in your lipstick and cell phone if needed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair fibers are nice, sleek, and the color is rich.  I only wish it fit better and had better wefting or at least better quality control.  I would have kept it if it did not have the rumple in it and stick out like a sore thumb on one side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning it unfortunately. And the rating shows it as a \\&quot;toy\\&quot; (...how would you rate this toy?...).  I am rating it two stars instead of five because: 1) flawed and defective wefting job, 2) extremely loose and lots of folds that can be felt with your hand through the hair as there is waaay too much room, 3) poor quality control.  These errors are so unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad it worked out for some of you!  It is still a cute wig!</li>
    <li> Though it took awhile for me to receive the wig (1/4/2014) I am very impressed and it looks great. Plus thanks for the wig cap that works well too. Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought for my Halloween costume, I was Velma from Scooby-Doo. It&#x27;s actually a great little wig for what it is. It looks really nice on, and is easy to manage. It looks quite natural too, some people thought it was my actual hair at first. Great buy! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A little small but looks good</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at the quality of this wig. I bought it to go with a Halloween costume but it&#x27;s so pretty and natural i could wear it anytime. Also, the color is true to the picture.</li>
    <li> I love it, it feels soft and looks real..  And a really good price. I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> Horrible, horrible wig. Not like the picture. I bought the wig for every day wear, but the wig is what you would want to wear to a Halloween party and then dispose of it. I ordered a brown black mix. I received a very shiny, ugly reddish/brownish wig. The wig was shredding every where, etc. Very poor quality and totally useless only fit for the trash. The seller is in China and wig was shipped from China, which I did not know at the time of purchase, or I would not have made the purchase. I thought that seller was U.S. based, hence returning would not be  problem. Seller was difficult and unpleasant to deal with. I emailed seller multiple times explaining the many problems with the wig and requested a full refund. Seller refused and demanded that I insure the wig and mail it back to him. He also warned me that shipping back to him would be expensive. I think the seller knows the buyer would get stuck with a junky product, because returning the product would cost more than the cost of the wig. Totally waste of money and time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lite it combs out quick and fits well. I also like the color</li>
    <li> This wig was much longer than pictured.  It was below my shoulders.  I just started wearing wigs (tired of doing my hair) and thought this would be good for weekends/ballgames/etc.</li>
    <li> Its simply amazing!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> this one is similar to the picture. im am satisfied with the way it looks</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. The wig does not look as full and rich as the photo. The back of the wig has a poor jaggeder look. It looks cheap.</li>
    <li> I used this wig for a few months to cover up some wild-colored hair at work and it held up really well. I&#x27;d brush it out about once a week, and I did trim the bangs, and it still looks great. It does shed, as wigs do, but I was wearing it every night for a few months and it still looked new after brushing.</li>
    <li> I like it it looks kinda fake in person but&lt;br /&gt;just for fun is just okay&lt;br /&gt;and for the price you cant complain.&lt;br /&gt;I like it tho...</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been hesitant to purchase wigs online (as you never know the quality until you see it in person), but let me just say: wow! this wig is lovely and as natural looking as an inexpensive wig can be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first of all: the color. so much more beautiful than the photo. it is a glossy, rich brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second: the quality. the cap itself is very sturdy and comfortable. and the &#x27;hair&#x27; feels nearly real. the wig is advertised as being heat-resistant, and i believe this to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cut of the wig i received was not as precise as the one in the photo, however i still like it. if you were to look at it from the side, it would be jagged and not a straight line from back to front. i don&#x27;t know if this is an anomaly or if all the wigs are like this, but be warned if you are looking for exactly what you see in the photo. for me, either way, i love it! it&#x27;s my favorite of all the wigs in this line i have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in all, this is an excellent wig for the price, as well as an excellent wig overall. i have now purchased several wigs of this brand and love them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** *** ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a side note, this arrived FAR faster than the estimated delivery date. i believe it took about nine days to reach me on the west coast from its point of origin.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig! I wore it with my Halloween costume and it looked great! I did have to cut the bangs a bit, but I guess it depends on how your face is shaped.</li>
    <li> This was not a bob.  The color was neither brown nor black it was more of a bronzy blond color not usally found in nature.  The ends curled up and the cut was more of a mullet or some kind of street walker shag.  One word, horrendous!  It did not work for its intended purpose as part of a 1920&#x27;s flapper costume.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot of wigs and I am generally forgiving about what I buy online especially when prices are cheap, so I would have been okay if it had at least matched something in the description - other than the word &amp;#34;wig&amp;#34;.  The photo should definitely not be associated with this product.  It&#x27;s not even remotely close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was desperate, I tried to hack it into shape with scissors and even applied black spray paint (temp hair color) to no avail.  Look away dear Amazon patrons, look away.  This is not the wig you are looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same as in the picture but it&#x27;s a good wig for the price.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> The color of the wig wasn&#x27;t the same as in the picture.  The one I received was lighter but I wasn&#x27;t totally disappointed in it.  I had to cut one side of it to even out the sides. I wore the wig to a party and the other guest had no idea I was wearing one.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  The texture is very nice but the cap is a joke.  There&#x27;s a crease down the inside crown when on the head  and the adjusters inside don&#x27;t accomplish what they should - i.e. like other more expensive wigs.  This might be suitable for a kid&#x27;s costume or for use in theater but as something to wear out in public, forget it.  The grandkids have a new play toy for &#x27;dress up&#x27;.</li>
    <li> For the price you&#x27;ll get a really nice wig with a beautiful reddish brown color. The length is a bit longer than shown in the picture but that depends on your head size I guess. Very  nice, lush and good quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  My mistake thought it was human hair.  Would not purchase again.  Rushed as understood it was natural hair,</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected color wise, more of a reddish brown. It sheds also. Doesn&#x27;t look realistic, more fake.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig and it was not what I expected. The wig in the picture looks nice, but when I received it, you can tell it looked so fake. The wig itself was very scarce as far as the hair on it- shows the mesh all throughout the wig.</li>
    <li> Black,far from brown!Very short!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite short, but the hair as said in other reviews is really nice and realistic. The color was okay but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s easy to style.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought the Short Brown Black Mix Bob Natural wig. She said it was too small and the color was lighter than the image here. She will probably try to salvage it if she can wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It really does look real. I have long brown curly hair that goes down to my waste and this is far from my own look. So I wanted a hair cut, and didn&#x27;t want to have to grow it out if I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s a different look and I even wear it with a winter beanie for fun. It feels and looks real. It&#x27;s worth the cost. Looking at this wig, you would think I paid way more for it.</li>
    <li> Shiny and lays a little  too flat but a nice easy to wear Cosplay wig. I&#x27;d  consider it any/everyday wear hair just for the fun if it</li>
    <li> This is a great wig. The bangs were perfect, just as pictured.  I put it on when my inlaws were over and they could not tell that I had it on.</li>
    <li> It arrived in only 10 days - international standard shipping - and was much better than I hoped after reading others reviews. The wig i received was closer in colour and style to the models picture than to the other customers pic, perfect for the Gatsby party. Sooo good for such a small price. I&#x27;d say this kind of quality would be about $40 or $50 if I got it in a store.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Velma cosplay and it worked out great. The only real issue I had with it was that the bangs are kind of long so they didn&#x27;t sit like they do in the picture and I had to brush them to the side. Also the wig gets messed up very easily so I had to take a brush with me wherever I went so I could fix it. But for the price it was very good. The hair is very soft and easy to brush, even with getting messed up easily it never tangled. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Love this wig! My favorite so far that I&#x27;ve purchased online. Definitely will buy again fron this store. Also glad wig cap was included I&#x27;ve lost my old one so I&#x27;ve been in need of a new one. I love how soft and silky the wig is and how feel flowing it is like real hair.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this purchase.  Wig was not as pictured, and the hair was falling out as soon as I opened the package.  I am trying to return them.</li>
    <li> It took a month for the wig to get to me and when it arrived it was red, ratty looking and nothing like this picture.  I ordered a brown/black bob and got a red scraggly rat. I will never order from this seller again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered two more wigs for co-workers, because they loved mine so much!  THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED!!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Looks great, fits great, and quality is great! Would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Looks good on. Reasonable shipping&lt;br /&gt;Speed. Not to be worn daily only on special occasions.</li>
    <li> I loved it great color and looks natural</li>
    <li> This should just be called &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; because there was absolutely no brown. Used it on a mannequin. It was a better wig than she (the mannequin) had before, but this one still wasn&#x27;t very good quality.  Hair would fall out occasionally. It was a nice cut though.</li>
    <li> this wig looks very pretty. color is nice. feels good. takes some adjusting. the wig is large. and adjusting it in the bag..only makes it look bulky. it looks like there is a lump in bag of my head because of it. the biggest problem aside from that...is that its too flippy. I got this because I like how it shows the gradual bob. with the way its so flippy...you cant really see that. it just looks like a straight bob. it gets to bulky. I wanted a sleek and sharp edged cut like in the pic.</li>
    <li> Looks very nice on a mannequin. Would not use it for daily personal use, but it could work theatrically or as a costume option.</li>
    <li> This is the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever bought.  It is so shiny and fake and thin.  One side is much longer than the other and the bangs are all different lengths.  I would not even wear it for Halloween.</li>
    <li> first off i will say that this is the very first wig i have ever bought that fits me perfectly. I have a small head and all wigs look horrible on me!&lt;br /&gt;i would have given it 5 stars if not for the fact that even though the description says brown/black mix. the one i received is all one dark shade, not a lick of brown in it. it still looks good but i sure would have preferred it to be the color pictured on the ad.</li>
    <li> It was very different from what you see in the picture. Its color is black, and it is much shorter,&lt;br /&gt;But its quality is not bad</li>
    <li> The color was not anywhere close to being a brown black mix.  It is more red which is not a good match at all.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;&#x27;m not a wig expert or anything but i for da price i was amazed!! i got two other wigs for my daughter from other sellers for dress up and they tangled and looked matted very quickly..but this one looks like it&#x27;s good quality and doesn&#x27;t tangle much..i asked sumone who wore wigs about it and they said it was nice..i don&#x27;t wear wigs but i did ponder on maybe wearin it..lol</li>
    <li> I cut the bangs because they were too long.  I find this wig just a little large for me and the straps that resize it come loose.  But the hair is silky and natural looking.</li>
    <li> the hair line on it is very strange gives you a cone head hc&lt;br /&gt;but all in all it look real &amp; if its only for temporary it works</li>
    <li> This is the first wig I have purchased and it is definitely worth it, it came right on time. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. The color is one or two shades lighter than shown and very minimal shedding. Will definitely be buying more! I love it!</li>
    <li> This wig is fabulous.  Awesome style and the natural feel of human hair.  Loved the blending of warm colors.  At the salon the cut and colors to my own hair would cost a fortune.  Thanks so much, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Looks much better here than in real. Wasn&#x27;t worth to buy it even though I needed it for party and not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Wig is just as advertised it looks good ,feels great moves like real hair ,&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this wig to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product because of its color and because it adapts easily, has a very original design q can be adjusted if required</li>
    <li> I really like this wig and the price is right my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little longer than expected but I trimmed it and it looks great</li>
    <li> I originally gave this wig a 2. It was a mess out if the package and didn&#x27;t look much like the picture. After setting it up on a stand, brushing it out using a big round brush and &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; the style, it turned out just fine. I wore it for a &#x27;20&#x27;s themed party and pulled off the flapper look and then some. For under $15 I totally transformed my appearance. Well worth the effort it took to get the wig in presentable condition.</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastic. It&#x27;s looks like a much expensive one and it looks fantastic</li>
    <li> i order for a short brown black but was given pure black.i liked the wig though but was not given the color i wanted. thanks for the wig cap i love it</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Halloween costume however it took several weeks to arrive (too late for my party).  It is nice looking (close to real hair) and a good price.  It looks exactly as shown.  Order about a month before you need it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as that above. I will have to cut the wig which is not good because it&#x27;s not human hair so it will fall apart. Pieces don&#x27;t fall right and the color isn&#x27;t true to the image, it&#x27;s a lot lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits my head fine though, and will still wear it with my halloween costume after I cut it.</li>
    <li> THe delivery took so long that I thought someone must have stolen it, it took over 6 weeks. But that would have been ok if it was real looking. It look so fake and sheds. THis is not at all quality hair. its sitting upstairs on a hook. I wasted my money buying it. I dont even wear it on bad hair days because its worse than my bad hair day hair.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price</li>
    <li> First time ever no complaint registered but too item directly to trash and threw it.</li>
    <li> The item arrived sooner than the expected. The quality is good and cheap since most wig cost around 13-20 USD.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for a costume. It does not look that natural though... so do not think in using it for every day use.</li>
    <li> This wig looks more natural than I expected, very nice for the price. I received it in just a couple of days (standard shipping). The only reason I&#x27;m rating it 4 instead of 5 is because of the color. It looks much darker on the picture; instead of saying it is brown/black I&#x27;d say it is light brown.</li>
    <li> The quality of this wig is very nice. Full of hair (no baldy spots) and hairs did not come out.. Hairs are very shiny. Color is a bit lighter then feature in the pic but still very very becoming. Holds shape very well. Comes with a nice (black) wig cap too (bonus when it is you very first one and you don&#x27;t know what you will need). My friends did not even recognized me! ( One asked: Where did all your hair go?!!! ). I have long hair almost on my waist. It fit all under the wig with no problem. I did not feel too hot in my head with the wig, which for me is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I have not styled the wig yet but it is so pretty as is that I did not see the necessity.  I added a decorated pin and hairs held it well and did not get destroyed by the pin.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this is a lot of wig for a costume. Good to be used as Sheitel for observant ladies out there on the budget or looking for an everyday care free cover.  I am keeping mine safely for the future :)</li>
    <li> the BOB natural wig was anything but natural looking. looked really fake. hair didnt lay properly. wig didnt fit well.</li>
    <li> the wig was all black, there was no brown at all.  otherwise it&#x27;s great looking.  just wanted the brown highlights</li>
    <li> It is okay if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap one-time wear. It&#x27;s itchy and doesn&#x27;t stay put. Didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> This is my first wig, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it really is true to the picture, except the bangs need trimming (which my hair dresser can do for me). Also, if you brush with a standard brush, the hair pulls out. A pick is what I use, and that seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I tried it and I feel its real this  is a good stuff need to wear it in a regular day</li>
    <li> The texture of the wig is not what I was really expecting.  My grand-daughters want to play with it so I guess it is okay for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest to anyone to buy this wig. I pulled it out of the package amd instantly it started shedding on me. After a few shakes the loose hair came off it doesn&#x27;t look too bad. If you have long hair like mine I&#x27;d suggest another wig though.</li>
    <li> I used this for one look during a photo shoot, and my hair stylist was laughing at the overall lack of coverage of the hair, and the bald spots this thing had. Copious amounts of hair fell out immediately upon just taking it out of its package, so I felt the need to be extremely careful with it, and just re-bagged it carefully until the shoot. We ended up putting a hat over it to hide any issues.</li>
    <li> This wig was just like the photo it&#x27;s Awsome and the price of it even better no one thought it was a wig when I wore it lol</li>
    <li> i am so sorry to report this but this was the worst hair piece i have tried on , the cut of the hair was not like it showed in the picture.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the money, but was too small for me.</li>
    <li> This was my first wig purchased on line and was surprised how silky like human hair it felt. It&#x27;s Very comfortable and comes with plenty of bangs that I needed to trim a bit to keep out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> When I received the wig I noticed that it was completely black instead of the Brown Black that I had ordered. My original review mentioned this and the company reached out to see if something could be done to rectify the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After emails and photos sent back and forth I was told that the mix up was done in the warehouse and to choose something from their amazon store as a replacement and to keep the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After weeks of corresponding, searching the store, finding a replacement item, I was told by the company that since the order was fulfilled through amazon I would have to go through them for a refund. Something I never requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a company who was concerned about a less than stellar review that they contacted me to make things right, they have left me with a more bitter taste in my mouth than I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself was cute and very natural looking, even if it was in a different color than ordered. But the seller is frustrating to deal with.</li>
    <li> When I put this on i was taken over by the power of the bob. I instantly became a daytime TV host from the 90&#x27;s. The only bad thing? someone snatched it off my head and left depressed and defeated by the fact that I am not a TV host, I wish this came in 100 colors.</li>
    <li> This is a cute wig and is made really well however, it is not as described.  It is, at best, light to medium golden brown.  It may have to go back.</li>
    <li> Out of the few wigs I have recently purchased this one has to be the worst, the cut is aweful and no wear near what the picture shows</li>
    <li> I did not like it, fist it was the wrong color and and What I wanted but even did not come on time and not fine hissss</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the quality of this wig for the price. It actually looks pretty good. The color is a nice dark brown like the picture. I did not have an issue with the bangs being too long like another reviewer did. I received the product within 2 delivery days.</li>
    <li> My wife is crazy about the quality of this wig.&lt;br /&gt;She has long hair and was amazed at How fit and looked</li>
    <li> This is a very cute wig at a GREAT PRICE!  I had to return it thought because it was too dark for me.  It is ALMOST BLACK.</li>
    <li> This was nothing like the picture. The color was more of a lighter color and the cut was nothing like a bob. The only reason that I kept it was because it was a decent price and I figured I&#x27;d have fun with it. I&#x27;ll probably try to do my own cut to it to make it more like me or at least to give it some type of shape. If this is the look you are going for DO NOT buy this wig.</li>
    <li> The wig that arrived was a much lighter ash color than what is pictured. Also, the cut was not the same. It looks butchered all around the front and some of the bangs only came halfway down the forehead. The wig looked much closer to a wild Tina Turner hairstyle, not the sleek bob in the picture. There were also large gaps about 1 inch wide in the hair lines that showed the inside netting all around the back.</li>
    <li> it is Black, not brown black as picture, but it is okay for the costume I needed it for.</li>
    <li> It is a cheap wig that lets you feel slutty if that is what you want.  Its a option if you need to get ready real quick.</li>
    <li> The hair is completely black . i really need to return this hair and get my money back . i wish i didn&#x27;t order for it .</li>
    <li> Okay so the quality of this, considering the price is so cheap, is what you would expect. The bangs are horrible and choppy and nothing like the photo in the product ad, and the color is too dark (I ordered brown and got black). Really not happy. Guess it would work for Halloween.</li>
    <li> im starting a new job and it required \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair (iv got super brite red that is very hard 2 bleach out). when i got the wig it was in good shape, it had very little shedding. i had 2 trim the bangs but it was a very simple fix. it feels great! its comfy and u dont feel like ur head is over heating. over all, i love it!</li>
    <li> bad fit, long wait to get</li>
    <li> Was too dark. Didn&#x27;t look real. Couldn&#x27;t get it to fit properly. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no black in this piece and I had to cut the bangs because they came down to my mouth, otherwise, it&#x27;s nice and I plan on wearing it tomorrow to work.</li>
    <li> It really is cute, much better than I thought it would be, It just seems to be shedding a little.  But still fun and attractive.</li>
    <li> The actual wig was blond. The quality seemed ok, just the color was wrong. My granson got this item for Halloween as it was unsatisfactory for actual use.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the color of the wig..it was not Brown Black as described but a Light Brown, I overlooked that because I loved the look of it....natural as real hair. bonus Point!&lt;br /&gt;I wore it yesterday and I had to constantly adjust it on my head as it kept shuffling around as I moved my head.&lt;br /&gt;Finally at one point as I turned my head the wig actually shifted so far back on my head  that I had to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;Was an embarrassing situation.</li>
    <li> This wig is so pretty!  I put a little dry shampoo on it, and now it looks real.  The hair is very soft and it feels great.  I wore it out to dinner tonight, and my friends all thought it looked great.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The wig I got has more light brown in it than black.  It is much lighter than the picture and it is also longer, the cut is below the chin by 1 or 2 inches.  I am dissappointed by it.</li>
    <li> Wore several times for evenings out and received quite a few compliments on how attractive it looked on.  The quality of this wig is vry high for the more than reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> This product is a great purchase. It is both a good value and good quality. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying this for a kid to use playing dress up or for a halloween costume it&#x27;s perfect but it&#x27;s not suitable for anything more.</li>
    <li> This is my first wig ever, so I have nothing to compare it to but I really love it! I bought it for a Murder Mystery Party that is set in the 1920&#x27;s and it&#x27;s a great bob cut. The bangs are much longer than pictured so you will need to trim them to fit, no big deal. Also, I feel like the color is lighter than pictured, again it doesn&#x27;t bother. For the price and quality this is a great choice, I&#x27;m very happy with it! I think I&#x27;d use the wig to change up my day to day naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. It&#x27;s really shiny, soft and looks real. I ended up giving it away to my friend though because I have a chubby face and the style of this wig makes my face look more fatter. Just my opinion though. Everyone&#x27;s different.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig!! I think it is one of my favorites wigs. The only thing, the wig is not brown. My hair is black and the wig is the same color. The color does not look like the picture at all. It is black.</li>
    <li> Turned out to be black instead of brown black mix.</li>
    <li> wig was too small to stay on my adult head lol i tried all tyes of things to try to get it to stay on but nothing</li>
    <li> Looked great. We used two of these wigs for mannequins wearing 1920s flapper dresses at a show put on by the local historical society. The wigs were longer than I expected so our hairdresser cut them to short bobs. Outstanding!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work but it didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t fit and hair kept falling out so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing this out anywhere important if you decide to go ahead and buy it. The cut is cute but the quality just isn&#x27;t there. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Not a good product, too small</li>
    <li> The cap is  very small for my head . But with bobby pins it can work. The color is nice and dark and look great in the sun</li>
    <li> A great addition to my costume and looked just as pictured.  Be sure to allow for extra shipping time as this ships internationally!</li>
    <li> The wig came in the color black, black as the night, the darkest of them all, not brown as in the picture and description. Also the style is a little different from the picture, not as short in the back. However, it is perfect for a costume or to change your appearance for a night if desired. If worn during the day, better wear a headband or a hat as it will show it is a wig.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. The style of the wig I received was a bit different than the one in the photo, but I really l Iike the one I received just as much. Also the color in the photo looks like dark brown, mine is black and again I like it the same. This wig stays on very well which is nice. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This was AMAZING quality for such a cheap wig. Gave it my own little hair cut because it was a little longer than pictured, but it was outstanding. DEFINITELY worth the buy. Got here sooner than the expected delivery date as well!</li>
    <li> It is so cute!! The color is black but it is well worth more money than I paid. easy to style in different ways and I am loving it. of course it sheds a little but no more than the average wig, I&#x27;m glad I did not just go by the previous reviews on this purchase, this was a great buy!!</li>
    <li> looks like real hair. dont mess with it too much though because the hair comes out easily in some spots. but it was a really cool wig!</li>
    <li> Its an ok wig, the recipient has since left me and I have no idea how she feels about it. so alli can say, when i saw it once, it was good</li>
    <li> Came within 4 days so I was pleased but I give 4 stars becasue it sheds and the color is black</li>
    <li> Used in a photo shoot and it looked great.  I was surprised at the quality and how well it arrived for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Good quality wig but it&#x27;s definitely black not brown.</li>
    <li> I was ashamed that I even ordered this.  The hair is very shiny and looks like a kids costume wig. Nothing natural at all.</li>
    <li> awesome wig and company buy this buy this its a comfortable way to go to the beach and hang washes great holds its shape just amazing one of my favorite wigs I own and I have 60 yep 60 lol thank you guys at the company I know wharehouse work is hard I used to do that so kudos peeps at ya ;)&lt;br /&gt;dawn</li>
