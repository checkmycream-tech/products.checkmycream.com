      <li>really love it!</li>
      <li>Love the fact that I never run out anymore!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My method is to combine two scents to make one amazing one.</li>
      <li>These were nicely priced when I bought them.</li>
      <li>Fast ship good price great</li>
      <li>smells really good and not so strong that everyone knows that you ve been here.....</li>

      <li>Great scent and keeps me feeling ready to go no matter</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>I am glad that it was on sale.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent of the axe spray&#x27;s</li>
      <li>how many days I haven&#x27;t showered.</li>
      <li>Give it a try, I am sure you will like it.</li>
      <li>is are favorite</li>
      <li>:) so many compliments.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>IT IS HIS FAVORITE.  </li>
      <li>I KNOW HE WILL LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>The answer is that Axe does the job the best with no burning, or stickiness, or staining, or long drying time.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and most important</li>
      <li>Also, Shipping and cost was the very best of ANY OTHER site that I could find...  </li>
      <li>Originally, I found these in the Netherlands and I am glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>but when I tried it I was happy with my purchase and will gladly buy again in the future.</li>
      <li>What is really surprising is when a woman much younger than I am told me she really liked the scent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this product but buy it for my husband who loves the &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; of the cool spray on his chest after a shower.  </li>
      <li>Buying it in bulk is convenient as this scent is not always available in stores.</li>
      <li>The Axe twist Fresh is one of the better deodorants for me IMHO.</li>
      <li>Very crisp, not too strong, my colleague females  give me lots of compliments.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light fresh and does not cling to the humidity in the air or your clothes.</li>
      <li>Not a waxy anti-perspirant, the body spray is effective at masking mild odor only.</li>
      <li>It worth buying for.</li>
      <li>Amazon offers better price than Target or Wamart.  </li>
      <li>exact product and quick shipping</li>
      <li>I like using axe, price was right.</li>
      <li>When I had my right rotator cuff repaired</li>
      <li>My life is changed forever all thanks to AXE deodorant!</li>
      <li>I did have an issue with the first shipment but the situation was corrected by customer service.</li>
      <li>Thanks !  dc</li>
      <li>, I purchased the shortfall at a higher price.</li>
      <li>I am a first time user of twist.</li>
      <li>Twist is very lemony!  </li>
      <li>definitely a turn on for me :)).  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is simple citrus without any strong spice or sweetness to it.</li>
      <li>Kinda reminds me of Hawaiian Surf - reminiscent and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Have gotten enthusiastic comments from several ladies (that made my day ; )</li>
      <li>They were very helpful and made me feel they were doing everything they could to fix the problem.</li>
      <li>The citrus note is the very dominant.  </li>
      <li>The sent is not of the same quality as even a mid range Cologne, but is quite pleasant and lasts both smelling pleasant and stopping cold body Oder.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Sad to say this item has been discontinued, I assume all together, but I was extremely happy to find it online.  </li>
      <li>The scent is light enough to barely notice and still get compliments.</li>
      <li>The very first day I used it, the budding actress next door (who&#x27;s name</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>But BOY was I surprised!</li>
      <li>Also, for me, I alternate this with an odorless &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; roll-on deodorant as daily use causes a mild rash.</li>
      <li>Of all of the scents Axe offers, this is the one that bothers me the least &#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>but maybe just a might overpowering smell when compared to my Old Spice stick.</li>
      <li>I use this instead if my Old Spice stick deodorant.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I was in a kind of confused state when I was about to</li>
      <li>Always fresh and long lasting</li>
      <li>like every other axe product it performs very well.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying the same quantity in a retail store, and this particular fragrance is not easily found in our area.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve tried other sprays.  </li>
<li> Walgreens stopped carrying but the other flavors that scream</li>
<li> At first I was skeptical.</li>
<li> Been using the &amp;#34;Twist&amp;#34; fragrance for quite a while, but not able to find locally any longer.</li>
<li> It does not clash with other fragrances you may wear.</li>
<li> But I thought, ah, at less than $4 a can, I&#x27;ll give it a shot.</li>
<li> no fragrance, could be not original?</li>
<li> I am using this product everyday.</li>
<li> I use all the different scents price wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
<li> This was a VERY dishonest ad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s design can be confused with KILO(thats what happened to me, my bad. Though should not turn up when i specifically searched for AXE KILO) . Again won&#x27;t buy it again. Nothing wrong with seller though. Just the product.</li>
    <li> I like using axe, price was right.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent of the axe spray&#x27;s but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find anywhere - I like the fresh citrus type scent rather than the more harsh &amp;#34;locker room&amp;#34; type sent that all the others seem to have...</li>
    <li> I use this occassionaly and not every day. When I had my right rotator cuff repaired I could not us my stick deodorant and I tried this. It worked well. Ocassionaly I use this instead if my Old Spice stick deodorant. I have to use something which is a deodorant and not an anti-perspirant because the latter breaks my underarms out in a rash. This is good but maybe just a might overpowering smell when compared to my Old Spice stick.</li>
    <li> I buy these regularly for my husband.  He uses them daily and loves the smell and says that he feels fresher!  I love the smell too, very attractive and sexy..........definitely a turn on for me :)).  Amazon offers better price than Target or Wamart.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Axe Twist is really nice and smells really good and the 6 pack of twist was a good deal</li>
    <li> Scent is a matter of taste.  Lil Irony  But this is probably the best solution for me to eliminate underarm odor with a nice fragrance.  I&#x27;ve tried roll ons, salt crystals, balms, creams, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried other sprays.  The answer is that Axe does the job the best with no burning, or stickiness, or staining, or long drying time.  It&#x27;s cheaper than slapping cologne under your arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 15 years. If I could find it in the store, I&#x27;d still buy it there. The scent is light enough to barely notice and still get compliments.</li>
    <li> Hi quality product. The sent is not of the same quality as even a mid range Cologne, but is quite pleasant and lasts both smelling pleasant and stopping cold body Oder. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical. Can a mere deodorant REALLY get all those hot women to want me? After all, I&#x27;m a middle aged balding fat man. How can this mere deodorant get early twenties hot girls to want me? But I thought, ah, at less than $4 a can, I&#x27;ll give it a shot. But BOY was I surprised! The very first day I used it, the budding actress next door (who&#x27;s name I won&#x27;t divulge for the sake of confidentiality) stopped me in the hallway and made out with me! But me, being the skeptic that I am, thought, maybe that was just a coincidence. However, after we were finished making out, I went to the local mall to buy another case for my iPhone. But darn it, I couldn&#x27;t buy it because all these women accosted me and wanted to have me on the SPOT! WOW! My life is changed forever all thanks to AXE deodorant! Try it for yourself! You&#x27;ll be AMAZED!</li>
    <li> On time and great price, exceeded expectations&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this product but buy it for my husband who loves the &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; of the cool spray on his chest after a shower.  Of all of the scents Axe offers, this is the one that bothers me the least &#x3D;)  Buying it in bulk is convenient as this scent is not always available in stores.</li>
    <li> Very crisp, not too strong, my colleague females  give me lots of compliments. Originally, I found these in the Netherlands and I am glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> no fragrance, could be not original?</li>
    <li> I love this product and most important so does my wife she loves the way I smell and twist is are favorite I can only find it online thought.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and is one of two favorites that he uses. I am glad that it was on sale.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells awesome&lt;br /&gt;Easy twist on/off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Lasts only 8 ~ 10 hours.</li>
    <li> Twist is very lemony!  The citrus note is the very dominant.  The smell lasts for a a couple of hours.  It does not clash with other fragrances you may wear.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item for my sons! They love it, it has an amazing smell on them and they get a ton of compliments.  Sad to say this item has been discontinued, I assume all together, but I was extremely happy to find it online.  I will continue to buy is as long as I can. Just love it!!! :-)</li>
    <li> My partner LOVES the scent, and this was an excellent value.  Much cheaper than buying the same quantity in a retail store, and this particular fragrance is not easily found in our area.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It doesn&#x27;t compete with the cologne I wear. I did have an issue with the first shipment but the situation was corrected by customer service. They were very helpful and made me feel they were doing everything they could to fix the problem.</li>
    <li> BEST AXE SCENT EVER!!!!!</li>
    <li> like every other axe product it performs very well.</li>
    <li> I always buy this stuff and not simply because Prince Charles uses it!</li>
    <li> I like the product and it seldom goes on sale in retail outlets. This is a great way to buy.</li>
    <li> smells really good and not so strong that everyone knows that you ve been here..... really love it! too bad is being discontinued</li>
    <li> I am using this product everyday.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this scent anywhere in stores anymore and the price was great</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Loved the great deal even more!!</li>
    <li> It works...bought for my son, as we were unable to find this scent on shelves...he says &amp;#34;they last forever and work great&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected</li>
    <li> I rated this product as 5-Stars because it is the best Axe Body Spray FOR ME since the [Axe Proximity Bergamot ] was discontinued...Also, Shipping and cost was the very best of ANY OTHER site that I could find...  Thanks !  dc</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of twist. I was in a kind of confused state when I was about to but it, since I am using it now I like it. It worth buying for.</li>
    <li> I bought these for all the men in my wedding so they wouldn&#x27;t smell :) They came nicely packaged and everyone smelled the way I wanted them too lol. Love it!</li>
    <li> These were nicely priced when I bought them. My method is to combine two scents to make one amazing one. I use this and Swiss Army Victorionoux or something. :) so many compliments.</li>
    <li> This scent is surprising to me.I like it and my wife likes it.What is really surprising is when a woman much younger than I am told me she really liked the scent.Made my day! I am 57 the woman was in her 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These sprays are great for value. They are unavailable in any store so I buy it from amazon.</li>
    <li> I use all the different scents price wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I never run out anymore! Great scent and keeps me feeling ready to go no matter how many days I haven&#x27;t showered. Yikes.</li>
    <li> FOR GRANDSON.  IT IS HIS FAVORITE.  WE WILL SEE HOW SURPRIZED HE IS WHEN XMAS GETS HERE.  I KNOW HE WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Good bang for the buck</li>
    <li> for the ease and self-comfort and confidence that I do not project offensive this is great.  Walgreens stopped carrying but the other flavors that scream I have no idea what subtlety is remain on the shelf.</li>
    <li> This was a VERY dishonest ad. It said 4oz 4oz cans (pack of 6), wich to me meant 6 double packs (which is how this product is sold in stores). Also this was supported by the discription, which said 12 cans 4 oz each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 orders of this product, so should have received 24 cans of the product. When I received only 12 cans but was charged for 24, I contacted Amazon. After being told the discription was wrong, and I got what I ordered, I told them I was cheated and would no longer buy on Amazon. Only then did they reduce the cost on the 12 cans I had received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I needed 24 (these were gifts), I purchased the shortfall at a higher price.</li>
    <li> Bought this without knowing what it smells like but when I tried it I was happy with my purchase and will gladly buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light fresh and does not cling to the humidity in the air or your clothes. Not too smelly or fragrant. Kinda reminds me of Hawaiian Surf - reminiscent and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Have gotten enthusiastic comments from several ladies (that made my day ; )</li>
    <li> The Axe twist Fresh is one of the better deodorants for me IMHO. Give it a try, I am sure you will like it.</li>
    <li> Always fresh and long lasting</li>
    <li> good price and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> Fast ship good price great all good thx</li>
    <li> Have purchased in the always delivered on time and at a good price.,</li>
    <li> exact product and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Been using the &amp;#34;Twist&amp;#34; fragrance for quite a while, but not able to find locally any longer. The fragrance is simple citrus without any strong spice or sweetness to it. Not a waxy anti-perspirant, the body spray is effective at masking mild odor only. Also, for me, I alternate this with an odorless &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; roll-on deodorant as daily use causes a mild rash. I have sensitive skin so your mileage may vary.</li>
