    <li> Great for gift-giving!  Just make sure the person opens this in front of the right crowd...one with a sense of humor that is.</li>
    <li> Great Gag gift for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Funny little white elephant gift</li>
    <li> I use this practically every time I shart.</li>
    <li> As expected and funny gag gift for a stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> gag Christmas gift.  my family was amused, but didn&#x27;t take the time to appreciate all the writing on it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on a regular basis.  I find that often when i wipe, i end up with a substantial portion of poo on my hand.  It seems that no matter how hard i wash, the smell remains!  This is ok if I have to shake my bosses hand, or if my ex sits in my section.  however when need to blow my nose, or god forbid i have a snack (chocolate peanuts are my FAV), it can result in, well, lets just say it is not so much fun.  However, this product allows me to remove the odor that soap leaves behind.  I find that using this after i wash helps me to smell confidant and fresh after every wipe!</li>

    <li> Hilarious gag gift.  It is expensive for just being a small hand sanitizer which would normally be a dollar or so, but it can always be a refilled as it is a good travel size.  Comes with a funny explanation on the packaging explaining what a shart is comprised of and also gives directions in case a shart sneaks up on you.  A great ice breaker this is guaranteed to get a laugh EVERY TIME.  It&#x27;s the best when someone asks around for hand sanitizer and you hand it to them without saying anything and just watch their expression when they read the bottle!</li>
    <li> Dear gawd, I hope I never shart myself. But if I do, now I have this. It smells just like rubbing alcohol and isn&#x27;t at all good for your skin, but if you need a cleaning, it gets sh*t done.</li>
    <li> It is a funny gag gift, but it is pretty expensive for what it is. It&#x27;s basically a 50 cent bottle of hand sanitizer with a sticker on it.</li>
    <li> Perfect gag gifts that has a use!</li>
    <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my sister for Christmas. I don&#x27;t remember the last time she laughed that hard!</li>
    <li> Great gag gift! My brother loved it.</li>
    <li> I sharted once and this cleaned me right up.  Almost masked the smell.  Couldn&#x27;t save the underwear though.  Good buy</li>
