### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>excellent quality</li>
      <li>Mom is very happy.</li>
      <li>I did not pay attention to it when I received the set knowing that Manicure Sets are the best made in Germany.</li>
      <li>The case looks very good.</li>
      <li>THE TOOLS ARE VERY GOOD, THE CASE IS NOT.</li>
      <li>Very good quality, went through 3 others before getting these, Have a set from Germany</li>
      <li>Very good quality instruments.  </li>
      <li>Incredible quality</li>
      <li>GET OVER IT ,THE PRICE IS GREAT</li>
      <li>Great set, works well</li>
      <li>Very nice manicure set, great quality tools.  </li>
      <li>Excellent, just thought the clasp for closing could be better.</li>
      <li>I have had for 20 years still as good as the day I bought it.</li>
      <li>this was a gift for my 20 something daughter and she loved it.</li>
      <li>The leather on the case is nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received 3 Swords Manicure and Pedicure kit in timely manner and nicely packed.</li>
      <li>The manicure and pedicure items seem OK</li>
      <li>So I decides to write a request to the company - could you please replace the cuticle scissors if it&#x27;s possible that I would have a perfect set?</li>
      <li>When I was a child over 40 years ago, I had a lovely leather manicure kit.</li>
      <li>While marginally improved, the case still does not close easily.</li>
      <li>I enjoy every item in this kit.</li>
      <li>It is just barely good enough for me not to return it</li>
      <li>She was very pleased with the quality of the implements and the overall gift.</li>
      <li>Looks like it will last for very long time, without any decrease in it sharpness and great looks!</li>
      <li>One real problem is the inability of the case to close securely with all of the instruments in place.</li>
      <li>The content is the  superior quality manicure and pedicure tools, you have to pay much more usually if compare to USA products, and the quality is incomparably higher.</li>
      <li>: Feels like good quality and the tools are sharp.</li>
      <li>I would have given this set a higher rating.</li>
      <li>The people I gave this gift to really like it!</li>
      <li>That tells me they are aware of the problem and just continue to ship defective merchandise.    </li>
      <li>Case wont shut, and the nail cutters wont cut hot butter.</li>
      <li>The tools inside are sharp a well aligned and the leather case is nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a deal killer in my view.</li>
      <li>I would appreciate it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>really needs the kit.</li>
      <li>This is really well made and reminds me of the one I used to have.</li>
      <li>She has a fifteen year old set that was a third of the price that is better.</li>
      <li>You have to practice a little how to close and open it, but as soon as you are good with it, set stays closed and opens easily when needed.</li>
      <li>This is a decent mid-price manicure set.</li>
      <li>Cuticle scissors came damaged - the surface is chipped in one particular spot.</li>
      <li>Will purchase again if I ever need more, but these will probably last a very long time.</li>
      <li>I have only had this for a week or two and here are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kit comes in genuine soft  black leather set, with logo and metal polished borders.</li>
      <li>She did move the tools to her old manicure set case.</li>
      <li>The other reviewers are absolutely correct about the case!!</li>
      <li>The tools are good but the case is a little too small.</li>
      <li>This was supposed to be high quality and they missed the mark with the details listed above.</li>
      <li>Little curved scissors are so sharp and comfortable to use, it makes my fingers look like I get high price professional work done!  </li>
      <li>I ordered this set for my mother, and she is very picky, she used have a similar set long time ago...</li>
      <li>Apparently, there was a mixup in the email I used.</li>
      <li>When attempting to close the case, certain of the instruments contact each other and stop the case from closing.  </li>
      <li>The quality is well worth the few extra bucks I paid over the cost of the china</li>
      <li>Look like production quality as china, last germany set was much better, the kit is difficult to close and does not stay closed very well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this one or the other german Solingen sets.</li>

<li> I highly recommend this one or the other german Solingen sets.</li>
<li> The one that I got has the three swords crest is crooked and off center.</li>
<li> The leather is busted in some places, and it looks like someone hastily shoved the tools into the case and then closed the case without ensuring the tools were properly secured.</li>
<li> Also, the leather on the edge, behind the latch is not connected and appears that it will be the first thing to go on the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Toward the spine of the case there is the small nail clipper with a pair of tweezers on the opposite side (not the same layout in the picture)</li>
<li> /&gt;Bad: The design of the case is not very well thought out.</li>
<li> Arrive on time, precision and sharp.</li>
<li> kit is difficult to close and does not stay closed very well</li>
<li> This meant that the case was closed on one of the tools and it has unfortunately bent the seam of the case, so that now it doesn&#x27;t close properly along the entire run of the case seam.</li>
<li> the wife loves it and plans to pass it down in the family..</li>
<li> Very sharp and quality looking tools.</li>
<li> Very sharp and cuts well.</li>
<li> It just becomes a mess to keep things together and organized.</li>
<li> Over time I lost or misplaced bits and eventually it fell apart.  </li>
<li> The leather covering of this firm manicure kit is going to detach</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have time to deal with a mess!</li>
<li> They did not even give me the common courtesy of a reply.</li>
<li> The worst part is that i got it as a third year anniversary gift for leather, and my wife could not even cut one finger nail.</li>
<li> so if you put the clippers or that pair of tweezers in their slots the wrong way the case is difficult to close and might compress the tweezers.</li>
<li> The case is so horrible, it makes it not worth buying.</li>

    <li> The people I gave this gift to really like it!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Incredible quality</li>
    <li> The case looks very good. Very sharp and quality looking tools. Mom is very happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just thought the clasp for closing could be better. Arrive on time, precision and sharp. this was a gift for my 20 something daughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Very nice manicure set, great quality tools.  Will purchase again if I ever need more, but these will probably last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, went through 3 others before getting these, Have a set from Germany I have had for 20 years still as good as the day I bought it. Please bring back I need another set</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a week or two and here are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: Feels like good quality and the tools are sharp. The leather on the case is nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: The design of the case is not very well thought out. Toward the spine of the case there is the small nail clipper with a pair of tweezers on the opposite side (not the same layout in the picture) so if you put the clippers or that pair of tweezers in their slots the wrong way the case is difficult to close and might compress the tweezers. The one that I got has the three swords crest is crooked and off center. Also, the leather on the edge, behind the latch is not connected and appears that it will be the first thing to go on the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of opting for a $100+ set like I feel I should have I went cheaper and am paying for it. It is just barely good enough for me not to return it but if anyone asks me I will tell them to get another set from another maker. This was supposed to be high quality and they missed the mark with the details listed above.</li>
    <li> I received 3 Swords Manicure and Pedicure kit in timely manner and nicely packed. When I took off the wraps, the present over-exceeded my expectations. Kit comes in genuine soft  black leather set, with logo and metal polished borders. You have to practice a little how to close and open it, but as soon as you are good with it, set stays closed and opens easily when needed. The content is the  superior quality manicure and pedicure tools, you have to pay much more usually if compare to USA products, and the quality is incomparably higher. Little curved scissors are so sharp and comfortable to use, it makes my fingers look like I get high price professional work done!  I enjoy every item in this kit. Looks like it will last for very long time, without any decrease in it sharpness and great looks!</li>

    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a friend.  She was very pleased with the quality of the implements and the overall gift.</li>
    <li> The case is so horrible, it makes it not worth buying. It just becomes a mess to keep things together and organized. It&#x27;s really a deal killer in my view. The tools are well made, but then you have to figure out how to organize them. I don&#x27;t have time to deal with a mess! The other reviewers are absolutely correct about the case!!</li>
    <li> The manicure and pedicure items seem OK but the case will not close.  I had read this review before ordering it and should have remembered but since it was a gift for my husband, I will keep it and he can put a rubber band around the case to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;He really needs the kit.</li>
    <li> Look like production quality as china, last germany set was much better, the kit is difficult to close and does not stay closed very well.</li>
    <li> After a week the leather started to pull away from its metal binding. The tools were from Germany but I&#x27;ll bet the case was from China.</li>
    <li> Cuticle scissors came damaged - the surface is chipped in one particular spot. I did not pay attention to it when I received the set knowing that Manicure Sets are the best made in Germany. A couple of months I noticed it and it bothers me. So I decides to write a request to the company - could you please replace the cuticle scissors if it&#x27;s possible that I would have a perfect set? I would appreciate it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards, Lana</li>
    <li> This is a decent mid-price manicure set. One real problem is the inability of the case to close securely with all of the instruments in place. It appears to be a design flaw. When attempting to close the case, certain of the instruments contact each other and stop the case from closing.  I would have given this set a higher rating. However, I contacted the manufacturer and described the problem. They did not even give me the common courtesy of a reply. No answer. That tells me they are aware of the problem and just continue to ship defective merchandise.    Update - 1/24/15  Apparently, there was a mixup in the email I used. The manufacturer did contact me and suggested they would send a replacement case for the manicure set. While marginally improved, the case still does not close easily. There is obviously a design issue. I would not recommend a manicure set with this sort of problem</li>
    <li> Sending back. Got it as a gift for my wife, and she doesnt like it at all. She has a fifteen year old set that was a third of the price that is better. Case wont shut, and the nail cutters wont cut hot butter. The worst part is that i got it as a third year anniversary gift for leather, and my wife could not even cut one finger nail. Everything else in the kit seemed like something you could get from dollar store.</li>
    <li> Great set, works well</li>
    <li> The quality is well worth the few extra bucks I paid over the cost of the china made sets I ckecked out in the local mall and it looks like this set will last a lifetime....the wife loves it and plans to pass it down in the family..</li>
    <li> The leather covering of this firm manicure kit is going to detach&lt;br /&gt;The kit is difficult to close and does not stay closed very well</li>
    <li> Very good quality instruments.  Very sharp and cuts well.</li>
    <li> THE TOOLS ARE VERY GOOD, THE CASE IS NOT. I&#x27;LL GET OVER IT ,THE PRICE IS GREAT</li>
    <li> My wife loves it for the tools but the case is coming apart.</li>
    <li> If you want a set that will LAST! Go german! Specifically Solingen.I ordered this set for my mother, and she is very picky, she used have a similar set long time ago...She was astonished when she received this one! I highly recommend this one or the other german Solingen sets.</li>
    <li> The tools are good but the case is a little too small. I gave the manicure set to my wife. She uses it all the time with no complaints. She did move the tools to her old manicure set case. It is larger.</li>
    <li> excellent quality, i had a problem with case they promptly resolved the issue....would buy again.</li>
    <li> The case arrived damaged. The leather is busted in some places, and it looks like someone hastily shoved the tools into the case and then closed the case without ensuring the tools were properly secured. This meant that the case was closed on one of the tools and it has unfortunately bent the seam of the case, so that now it doesn&#x27;t close properly along the entire run of the case seam. Returning item.</li>
