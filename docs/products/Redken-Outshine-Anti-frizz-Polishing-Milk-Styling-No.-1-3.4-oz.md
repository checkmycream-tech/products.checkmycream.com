    <li> Redken Outshine Polishing Milk is amazing! A tiny (dime size) amount works through my thick long hair and controls frizzies (which I have a lot of) all day...even when it&#x27;s humid! I&#x27;ve tried several different \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; product and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love my Redken Outshine, nothing in this world works better on my natural curly hair.  Even on the most humid days with rain, my curls hold together without the frizzies!  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than 10 years and it is the best stuff on the market for controlling and taming the frizzes once your hair drys. I have used other expensive name brand salon products when I could not find this one and I was disappointed with the results. I have very thick, wavy hair and when my hair dries I get flyaway frizzes real bad. I apply Redken Outshine 01 after towel drying my hair and let my hair dry naturally and no frizzes once dried. Also there is no sticky, stiff feeling to your hair after it is dry. I hate that stiff yuk feeling. Where I live in far northern califoria none of the salons sell this product. Therefore I must buy off the internet or when I visit relatives in Sacramento.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy, and generally uncooperative hair. I use the Redken Outshine 01 on my damp hair, and it tames my tresses into shape! I can apply heat and I end up with a smooth, glossy look that is polished and professional. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> As always, a wonderful product for my thin, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This product was authentic and exactly what I wanted. I am very pleased with my overall results with this product.</li>

    <li> I use this on my dry frizzy fly aways, it works for a while. You have to reapply through out the day.</li>
    <li> I live in Texas and it works great! It fights frizz and leaves shine for days. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this at a salon and liked it very much.  I bought this when the sample ran out.  It lasts a long time because you only use a little (my hair is shoulder length).  It takes away the frizz and makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Only thing that&#x27;s worked on my summer frizz so far! Just watch out for the coagulated chunk caught in the dispenser opening as it&#x27;s gives you a &amp;#34;Something About Mary&amp;#34; hair effect!</li>
    <li> Great product especially when the weather is humid!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time and I&#x27;m now on my second order!&lt;br /&gt;A must have!</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It totally controls my frizzy hair.  I use it all year round for great control and shiny hair.</li>

    <li> Great bed head product for long hair! Separates to beach like waves.</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this hair produce to anyone and all hair types. I believe this helps even when you have static in your hair. I have used this produce for about 5 years know and nothing compaires to how shine and soft it makes your hair look. I have about 14 inches of hair so medium length and I use one pump (applying it at the ends more and lightly at the roots) when my hair is damp and then blow dry and style my hair. When done styling your hair looks so healthy almost as if you just walked out of the salon. This bottle usually last about a month for me .</li>

    <li> Does not have a pleasant smell</li>

As nearly anything is useful in combination with a flat iron, this adds nothing to my hair care line up.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great !!!  Received a sample of this at my beauty salon about a year ago didn&#x27;t figure it was anything great so didn&#x27;t try it for several months .. Then tried !! Wow is the greatest ever!! Have recommend to everyone !!  It&#x27;s great !!</li>
    <li> best anti frizz product i have ever used</li>
    <li> no better or worse than others I have tried.  My frizzies are indefatigable</li>
    <li> Have tried many different products for my frizzy, curly hair and keep coming back to this one.  I use it right after a shampoo as a leave in conditioner and styling product and also in between shampoos to tame frizz and restyle.  You don&#x27;t need to use much.

I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product keeps my natural curls looking fabulous! Great Stuff....</li>
    <li> Yes, it met my requirements.  I&#x27;ve used it for some time so it is not a new item to me.  I like it.</li>
