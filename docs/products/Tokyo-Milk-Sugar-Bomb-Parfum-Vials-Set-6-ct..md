### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but my favorite is the 114 it smells like rootbeer!!!!</li>
      <li>Find your favourite combo, and you will turn heads. :D</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the scent of any of these.  </li>
      <li>the sugared fennel (115) smells like some incredible baked good.</li>
      <li>Honestly, the best mix-and-match &#x27;foodie&#x27;-type scents I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>If they get the bottling perfected, I would be so happy.</li>
      <li>I bought this set from beautybar.com and bought it because it sounded good and got great reviews on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Loved the scents in this combination.</li>
      <li>They also give you 2 of each &amp; the good part of the tiny-ness of the bottles is you can carry in your purse, pocket , just about anywhere.</li>
      <li>All in all they smell really good all except the 115 to me</li>
      <li>love this set and recommend it!</li>
      <li>my favorite scent alone is the sugared creme and fennel - but the best part and most fun</li>
      <li>On their own, they&#x27;re interesting</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>so much better</li>
      <li>I love the packaging, just can&#x27;t use the product.  </li>
      <li>my absolutely favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was from shipping seeing as it wasn&#x27;t craked the top</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>but perhaps that is because they more like a body mist than a perfume.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely set of perfumes.</li>
      <li>, I would prefer roller balls, for ease of use, but a spray top makes sense since you can mix the scents.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got these...</li>
      <li>and so glad that I can get them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>so I find myself taking the top off to get the rest of the perfume out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>And Tokyo Milk just became my latest obsession.  </li>
      <li>I love using all three together.</li>
      <li>I love the different combinations and they all smell delicious!</li>
      <li>I just make sure to keep them in a part of my purse where they wont break.  </li>
      <li>So anyway--I love these</li>
      <li>The perfumes are daring, flirty, original and one of a kind.  </li>
      <li>I love this set of scents from Toyko Milk - so sweet &amp; light!</li>
      <li>Way to sweet!</li>
      <li>They all seem to smell nice but for the price, I was expecting higher quality.</li>
      <li>But be prepared - people may chase you down to find out what delicious candy you are eating!</li>
      <li>And I love the bottles, so artistic</li>
      <li>/&gt;These little vials are perfect for on the go and traveling.  </li>
      <li>the scents are fantastic.</li>
      <li>and they sent out a replacement item which I just got today and again pulled the tops off two and the spray top came right off with the lid.</li>
      <li>, they smell awesome, the scents last pretty well, and they make me feel pretty.</li>
      <li>the caps are NOT user friendly.</li>
      <li>Like the fragrance but just wish there was more of it ;-)</li>
      <li>The first scent, 113, vanilla orchid and honeyed cocoa is more orchid than vanilla, honey or cocoa</li>
      <li>I smell good enough to eat!</li>
      <li>So again two more that I can&#x27;t really use.</li>
      <li>Tonka Bean &amp; Sweet</li>
      <li>The smells are great and combinations are really endless with the ratio of one flavor to another.</li>
      <li>I just got this lovely perfume set last week, and I am in love.</li>
      <li>The second, 114, tonka bean and sweet amber has a root beer scent and it&#x27;s probably my favorite of the three.</li>
      <li>This was my first ever Tokyo Milk purchase, after longing after the line for what seems like an eternity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried Tokyo Milk stuff last year and fell in love with a couple of the scents.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a bit different than other gourmands I&#x27;ve tried and they smell great.</li>
      <li>I love the little vials - its a fun way to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with your perfume.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really like the spray tops</li>
      <li>Shipping on this item was fast and no problems encountered.</li>
      <li>and I really like it</li>
      <li>#15 was ok but the other 5?  </li>
      <li>The last one smells like sweet butter...</li>
      <li>you like these specific scents, you will love this set as it is two of each (of three different scents).  </li>
      <li>I have suggested that they make a big bottle of each scent for those customers that love the product and use it daily.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but the packaging sucks ass!</li>
      <li>but it was because he wanted to find out what my perfume was so he could get some for his wife (which was kind of sweet, and cancelled out the creepy.)</li>
      <li>But the scents are very powerful, so not much is needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a giant waste of money, the perfumes don&#x27;t even smell that great, they&#x27;re not really sweet.</li>
      <li>So I first got the sample set, one vial was completely empty and the other the spray top totally came off when I opened it</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my least favorite of the bunch.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s near unusable.</li>
      <li>One vial was almost empty, another half empty, and the caps don&#x27;t fit the others.</li>

<li> One vial was almost empty, another half empty, and the caps don&#x27;t fit the others.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even know how you get one completely empty and the lids are on SO tight that when you try to take the lid off the whole spray part comes out with it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve learned that 114 is my personal fragrance, and I will probably be buying it for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
<li> Product was delivered in a timely fashion - actually faster than expected.  </li>
<li> On the back is a flap containing names for each scent and other information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> just wasn&#x27;t on tight enough.</li>
<li> I have a purse that still smells of another perfume vial that accidently got smashed a few months back.</li>
<li> and I have to be careful with it.</li>
<li> And there&#x27;s really no way you couldn&#x27;t find</li>
<li> The first time I wore them, I passed a guy in the store and he literally followed me (which was creepy)</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the tube in the bottle doesn&#x27;t always go to the bottom</li>
<li> I would return it but after shipping its just not worth it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read studies on the subject of scents that attract men and women - and men seem to be specifically attracted to &amp;</li>
<li> you get two little spray vials of each scent.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m probably one of the rare individuals that doesn&#x27;t hate that flavor).</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s really difficult to open the bottles without spilling them all over yourself.</li>
<li> /&gt;The scents come in  small box, the part that contains the glass vials slides out.</li>
<li> but in order to review the item you have to give it at least a one star.</li>
<li> at least *one</li>
<li> /&gt;The vials are about as tall and as thick as a pinkie finger.</li>
<li> BUT the bottles are very small.</li>
<li> one complaint I have is that the cap was very difficult to get off one of the vials possibly due to being under pressure in the package while shipping.</li>
<li> I have always had a problem with floral-scented perfume and bought these on a whim at a weird little store in Chicago basically just because they weren&#x27;t florals!</li>
<li> The vials have some wiggle room in their container and could have easily broken.</li>
<li> /&gt;I am not happy with the seller who shipped the item to me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been mixing and matching these for years and never get tired of them.</li>
<li> The vials are thin and look like they could break</li>
<li> They are thin glass.</li>
<li> but I was wrong about that.  </li>
<li> Will not be purchasing from this seller again :(</li>
<li> Was so disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If I could give this seller no stars, I would. Was so disappointed. One vial was almost empty, another half empty, and the caps don&#x27;t fit the others. Will not be purchasing from this seller again :(</li>
    <li> When I got my package one of the vials was leaking I don&#x27;t think it was from shipping seeing as it wasn&#x27;t craked the top just wasn&#x27;t on tight enough. All in all they smell really good all except the 115 to me it smells like butter but my favorite is the 114 it smells like rootbeer!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these. They&#x27;re a bit different than other gourmands I&#x27;ve tried and they smell great. The first scent, 113, vanilla orchid and honeyed cocoa is more orchid than vanilla, honey or cocoa and it&#x27;s my least favorite of the bunch. The second, 114, tonka bean and sweet amber has a root beer scent and it&#x27;s probably my favorite of the three. The third, 115, sugared crème and fennel almost smells like the buttered popcorn jelly belly jelly beans and I really like it (I&#x27;m probably one of the rare individuals that doesn&#x27;t hate that flavor). On their own, they&#x27;re interesting but I almost always wear them together and I find they smell so much better layered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one complaint I have is that the cap was very difficult to get off one of the vials possibly due to being under pressure in the package while shipping. I actually ended up pulling the atomizer out and I had to do some surgery to get separate the cap from the atomizer. It still comes off every so often and I have to be careful with it.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but the packaging sucks ass!</li>
    <li> Out of the 6 bottles, I could only open 2 in a usable manner. They all seem to smell nice but for the price, I was expecting higher quality. The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long but perhaps that is because they more like a body mist than a perfume. I would not recommend these unless perhaps you want to repackage or plan to use them to add scents to something else.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely set of perfumes. I have always had a problem with floral-scented perfume and bought these on a whim at a weird little store in Chicago basically just because they weren&#x27;t florals! I&#x27;m so glad I got these...and so glad that I can get them on Amazon. There are three scents. One smells like licorice and vanilla to me, one smells like an incense I used to get in college--kind of a woody smell? The last one smells like sweet butter... You can mix and match the scents--you get two little spray vials of each scent. I love using all three together. The first time I wore them, I passed a guy in the store and he literally followed me (which was creepy) but it was because he wanted to find out what my perfume was so he could get some for his wife (which was kind of sweet, and cancelled out the creepy.) So anyway--I love these, they smell awesome, the scents last pretty well, and they make me feel pretty.</li>
    <li> I just got this lovely perfume set last week, and I am in love. This was my first ever Tokyo Milk purchase, after longing after the line for what seems like an eternity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents come in  small box, the part that contains the glass vials slides out. On the back is a flap containing names for each scent and other information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 3 different scents in the set, and 2 of each scent, so 6 glass vials total!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set contains:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;113 Vanilla Orchid &amp; Honeyed Cocoa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;114 Tonka Bean &amp; Sweet Amber- In my opinion this is almost like a Root Beer cupcake, or Root Beer float. There&#x27;s a definite licorice, or root beer type scent, with amber which is almost like a vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;115 Sugared Cr&amp;egrave;me &amp; Fennel-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vials are about as tall and as thick as a pinkie finger. They have the fragrance number and scent name printed on them. They are thin glass. The bottles are spray bottles, not roller balls as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this set and recommend it! I&#x27;ve learned that 114 is my personal fragrance, and I will probably be buying it for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like the spray tops, I would prefer roller balls, for ease of use, but a spray top makes sense since you can mix the scents. Perhaps they could have done one of each since you get 2 of each scent in this box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend carrying any of the vials with you without a case. Pay contact case might work well. The vials are thin and look like they could break easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with the seller who shipped the item to me. Sent the box within  tiny box with no padding. The vials have some wiggle room in their container and could have easily broken. But that&#x27;s a personal issue.</li>
    <li> The smells are great and combinations are really endless with the ratio of one flavor to another. Only problem I had was that sometimes the nozzle gets stuck in the lid of the vial so you end up spilling some and having to use tweezers to get the nozzle out.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the best mix-and-match &#x27;foodie&#x27;-type scents I&#x27;ve ever used. If you like sugar, if it reacts well to your body chemistry, you should be buying this. Find your favourite combo, and you will turn heads. :D</li>
    <li> I love this product...my absolutely favorite perfume. I have ordered several boxes of this item. My only complaint is that the tube in the bottle doesn&#x27;t always go to the bottom so I find myself taking the top off to get the rest of the perfume out of the bottle. Also, the sprayers do not always spray but rather spit the perfume out. If they get the bottling perfected, I would be so happy. I have suggested that they make a big bottle of each scent for those customers that love the product and use it daily.</li>
    <li> Heavenly mix of vanilla-ish scents. I&#x27;ve been mixing and matching these for years and never get tired of them.</li>
    <li> I love this set of scents from Toyko Milk - so sweet &amp; light!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this trio BUT the bottles are very small. Like the fragrance but just wish there was more of it ;-)</li>
    <li> I bought this set from beautybar.com and bought it because it sounded good and got great reviews on Amazon. So I first got the sample set, one vial was completely empty and the other the spray top totally came off when I opened it so it&#x27;s near unusable. I contacted Beautybar.com and they sent out a replacement item which I just got today and again pulled the tops off two and the spray top came right off with the lid. So again two more that I can&#x27;t really use. I got it for $18 on beautybar.com and it&#x27;s just a waste of money. I don&#x27;t even know how you get one completely empty and the lids are on SO tight that when you try to take the lid off the whole spray part comes out with it. It&#x27;s just a giant waste of money, the perfumes don&#x27;t even smell that great, they&#x27;re not really sweet.</li>
    <li> I have a *thing* about perfumes - I don&#x27;t want to smell like anything you wouldn&#x27;t want to eat! Take that however you want, but I personally think that if you want to wear something to attract someone else, it makes sense. I&#x27;ve read studies on the subject of scents that attract men and women - and men seem to be specifically attracted to &amp;#34;food smells&amp;#34; - Sugar Bomb smells the way it&#x27;s packaged..like a box of candy...my favorite scent alone is the sugared creme and fennel - but the best part and most fun is the ability to mix the scents to your liking - I feel like an alchemist ! And there&#x27;s really no way you couldn&#x27;t find at least *one* mixture that works for you and your body chemistry ( another plus for this product) - The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the fact that the bottles are so tiny. But the scents are very powerful, so not much is needed. They also give you 2 of each &amp; the good part of the tiny-ness of the bottles is you can carry in your purse, pocket , just about anywhere. But be prepared - people may chase you down to find out what delicious candy you are eating!</li>
    <li> Loved the scents in this combination. I swear one smells like root beer (114) and the sugared fennel (115) smells like some incredible baked good. I smell good enough to eat! Shipping on this item was fast and no problems encountered.</li>
    <li> This was horrible!! The bottles will not open correctly, and the one that did has NO smell at all. I would return it but after shipping its just not worth it. I would give it a no star if I could but in order to review the item you have to give it at least a one star. Save you money on this.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the scent of any of these.  I tried Tokyo Milk stuff last year and fell in love with a couple of the scents.  I just couldn&#x27;t remember which ones.  I thought they were among the ones I ordered but I was wrong about that.  I contacted the company and they said there was a store an hour away where I could sample the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like these specific scents, you will love this set as it is two of each (of three different scents).  I love the packaging, just can&#x27;t use the product.  I will try to find the one I like and would order that one.</li>
    <li> #15 was ok but the other 5?  Way to sweet!</li>
    <li> the scents are fantastic. But it&#x27;s really difficult to open the bottles without spilling them all over yourself. the caps are NOT user friendly.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely fashion - actually faster than expected.  I love the little vials - its a fun way to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with your perfume.  I love the different combinations and they all smell delicious!</li>
    <li> I have a confession to make:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am perfume junkie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bottles and lotions and vials and testers overflowing my side of the bathroom sink.  And Tokyo Milk just became my latest obsession.  The perfumes are daring, flirty, original and one of a kind.  And I love the bottles, so artistic and I keep them even after the perfume is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little vials are perfect for on the go and traveling.  I just make sure to keep them in a part of my purse where they wont break.  I have a purse that still smells of another perfume vial that accidently got smashed a few months back.</li>
