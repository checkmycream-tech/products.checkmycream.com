### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>PTR in-wrinkle is the best!</li>
      <li>One of the best beauty products I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Best thing I have found yet</li>
      <li>Great pricing and</li>
      <li>Watch on Amazon they come up with some great prices..</li>
      <li>This can be compared to the TURBO version at a greatly reduced price.</li>
      <li>great product, have used it for years</li>
      <li>Fantastic product and best price anywhere!</li>
      <li>I was hoping that this would be a good additional to my anti-aging arsenal, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 36 and have good skin;</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>Fabulous stuff!!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, although I liked it.  </li>
      <li>Great price on Amazon for a fabulous product  love it must try.</li>
      <li>Works good, easy to spread everywhere.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily absorbed, has a great consistency and texture, and no odor.</li>
      <li>but I sure cannot recommend the product.  </li>
      <li>I also love PTR UW foundation (medium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I now have as many favorite products in PTR as I do in Perricone and Kinerase.</li>
      <li>It has become my favorite product.</li>
      <li>It is an OK product but does not produce the results it claims to.  </li>
      <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products and I will order again.</li>
      <li>I do believe it works, although I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with, but it keeps them at bay.</li>
      <li>But, I do love the way it makes my skin feel--very silky and not at all greasy.</li>
      <li>More bang for the buck</li>
      <li>I love this Peter Thomas Roth product and will surly order from these folks agin.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, once a day.</li>
      <li>This was a great price and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really see  a great difference</li>
      <li>The product itself is ok, however the bottle ran out very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Wrinkles disappearing: what joy for this 70 year old!</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily into my skin without being greasy.</li>
      <li>Peter Thomas Roth products work and are backed by scientific evidence which is important to me.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product and use it with Firmx undereye puffiness concealer.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>One day I noticed the wrinkles by my nose/mouth and the line between my eyebrows faded significantly, and I&#x27;m still seeing improvements on a weekly basis.      </li>
      <li>I love how light this product feels on your face and it really does seem to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say that I have seen any special changes in my skin, but keep trying.</li>
      <li>This works better than my 450.00 cellcosmet serum and that is really saying something.</li>
      <li>but it does the job; is light and goes right into my skin...</li>
      <li>is that it is so mild that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes even if some gets around them.  </li>
      <li>it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Guess my old regimen was working better than I thought.  </li>
      <li>Is a bit pricey but worth the money..</li>
      <li>At first, I only used the night cream, because I liked the texture.  </li>
      <li>Great shipping not sure about results.</li>
      <li>For the price this cost i would expect way better results like actually noticeable ones.</li>
      <li>I think i saw a tiny reduction but  not even sure.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because of the great reviews (in a department store), but I was seriously underwhelmed with the results.  </li>
      <li>This was definitely worth the money - I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t mean to order this one but the fast acting serum works wonderfully</li>
      <li>Then, I started using this unwrinkle serum twice a day, not thinking much about it...</li>
      <li>but it really does work.  </li>
      <li>Much too pricey for no results.  </li>
      <li>I have used a lot of anti wrinkle products but this one really does reduce the lines.  </li>
      <li>Some skin care products really irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>Once I stopped using this and went back to my cheaper &#x27;tried and true&#x27; method, that has continued to work.  </li>
      <li>no crows feet but just a few fine lines that I notice under my eyes when I smile.  </li>
      <li>So far I really like this Serum.</li>
      <li>so I am very excited to see it after a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>Right now PTR is part of my daily regimen.</li>
      <li>Cost performance is very high for Chinese customers.</li>
      <li>I feel like the packaging is very misleading, mine only lasted a couple weeks.</li>
      <li>Maybe it works for some skin conditions and types but not my caucasian nearly 60 year old skin.  </li>
      <li>They melted almost completely away using this product.  </li>
      <li>Skin feels clean, tight, soft and refreshed after use.</li>
      <li>Instead of my skin improving, it actually worsened, the lines deepened, lost skin tone and even found new lines appearing.  </li>

<li> Who knows, really, but as long as the aging process has remained frozen on me for so long, I will continue to use some brand or other of spray non-alcoholic toner, serum, moisturizer, eye cream (and sunscreen whenever I leave the ) on a several time daily basis.  </li>
<li> PTR products have really taken it a notch over the past 2 years.  </li>
<li> this actually did anything that it claimed to do other than moisturise.</li>
<li> This did not live up to the hype.  </li>
<li> I ordered this because I liked the peel pad, but I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> I am not very wrinkled, so I probably won&#x27;t get the Un-wrinkle again.</li>
<li> and I really never saw any difference at all.  </li>
<li> a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other far less expensive products that actually minimized the appearance of these lines.  </li>
<li> the only negative is the ridiclious packaging.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t do anything for lifting or contouring.  </li>
<li> So I would say not worth the money.</li>
<li> Peter Thomas Roth has not let me down.</li>
<li> I mean, this product is only 1 ounce, and it is in a container that could hold 6 ounces.  </li>
<li> no smelly mess.</li>
<li> The price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s probably wort it.</li>
<li> Dont waste your money</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
<li> Disappointing</li>
<li> just stupid.  </li>
<li> The product I got was totally a fake stuff!!!</li>
<li> I swear this stuff is removing the terrible crease between my eyebrows and the lines on my forhead!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cost performance is very high for Chinese customers.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and best price anywhere!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I liked the peel pad, but I was disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> Works good, easy to spread everywhere.  I do prefer the night cream though.  More bang for the buck I guess</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, especially as part of a regime that includes othe PTR unwrikle products, such as UW peel pads, UW eye, UW lip, UW night - as well as the glycol acid cleanser and moisturizer, and PTR oxigynating serum. I also love PTR UW foundation (medium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you think i work for ptr i do not! to prove it - for a daily face cream with spf, I prefer body shop vitamin C face cream.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Great pricing and it arrived quickly. I will definitely shop here again for this line of products, gifts or personal items.</li>
    <li> This works better than my 450.00 cellcosmet serum and that is really saying something.</li>
    <li> This did not live up to the hype.  Much too pricey for no results.  Of course they always dont say 100% will have results; but come on.: Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> I love how light this product feels on your face and it really does seem to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It has become my favorite product.</li>
    <li> It is an OK product but does not produce the results it claims to.  Not even close.  So I would say not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and believe it works.  the only negative is the ridiclious packaging.  I mean, this product is only 1 ounce, and it is in a container that could hold 6 ounces.  just stupid.  I keep using it though, but would not lug it around for travel.</li>
    <li> Fabulous stuff!! Is a bit pricey but worth the money.. Watch on Amazon they come up with some great prices..</li>
    <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products and I will order again. I am not very wrinkled, so I probably won&#x27;t get the Un-wrinkle again. But, I do love the way it makes my skin feel--very silky and not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I swear this stuff is removing the terrible crease between my eyebrows and the lines on my forhead!!! I tried the sample and then bought the big size. Not inexpensive but it does the job; is light and goes right into my skin...no smelly mess. Peter Thomas Roth has not let me down.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really see  a great difference</li>
    <li> This was a great price and fast delivery. I love this Peter Thomas Roth product and will surly order from these folks agin.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The product itself is ok, however the bottle ran out very quickly.  I feel like the packaging is very misleading, mine only lasted a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> But my wife loves them we should split our account???? maybe</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a big difference so i just don&#x27;t know....probably will try something else.</li>
    <li> I have only been using Un-wrinkle for 2 1/2 days and I can actually see a difference in my skin!  It is smoother already so I am very excited to see it after a few weeks.  This was definitely worth the money - I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Manly used this for  my frown line.  I think i saw a tiny reduction but  not even sure. For the price this cost i would expect way better results like actually noticeable ones. Final verdict this is overpriced,  and i saw nothing to tell me this actually did anything that it claimed to do other than moisturise.</li>
    <li> Great price on Amazon for a fabulous product  love it must try.</li>
    <li> I never go a day without my Un-wrinkle. One of the best beauty products I have ever used. It absorbs easily into my skin without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Wrinkles disappearing: what joy for this 70 year old!</li>
    <li> This serum works.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to - - I tend to favor lifting/firming/contour instead of wrinkle/filler products.  But I&#x27;d bought it as part of the promotional unwrinkle kit.  At first, I only used the night cream, because I liked the texture.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, although I liked it.  Then, I started using this unwrinkle serum twice a day, not thinking much about it... One day I noticed the wrinkles by my nose/mouth and the line between my eyebrows faded significantly, and I&#x27;m still seeing improvements on a weekly basis.      My only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t do anything for lifting or contouring.  But obviously, that isn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s designed to do.  Also, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement around my eye area, but again, that isn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s marketed for.  I almost bought the eye kit today, but I&#x27;m going to wait a bit.  PTR products have really taken it a notch over the past 2 years.  I now have as many favorite products in PTR as I do in Perricone and Kinerase.</li>
    <li> Great shipping not sure about results. Didn&#x27;t mean to order this one but the fast acting serum works wonderfully</li>
    <li> This can be compared to the TURBO version at a greatly reduced price. I enjoy this product and use it with Firmx undereye puffiness concealer. Peter Thomas Roth products work and are backed by scientific evidence which is important to me. As a former Dermatology Pharmaceutical rep I need and want to know how the products work and the claims are substantiated.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this Serum.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t say that I have seen any special changes in my skin, but keep trying.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, once a day. It&#x27;s easily absorbed, has a great consistency and texture, and no odor. I do believe it works, although I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with, but it keeps them at bay. The price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s probably wort it.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with the glycolic acid face wash for several months.  Instead of my skin improving, it actually worsened, the lines deepened, lost skin tone and even found new lines appearing.  Guess my old regimen was working better than I thought.  Disappointing but I sure cannot recommend the product.  Maybe it works for some skin conditions and types but not my caucasian nearly 60 year old skin.  Sorry I cannot give it a better review.</li>
    <li> great product, have used it for years</li>
    <li> You have to keep using this to get the results but it really does work.  I have deep wrinkles in the frown line area.  They melted almost completely away using this product.  It&#x27;s not cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The product I got was totally a fake stuff!!! So disappoint about this...</li>
    <li> PTR in-wrinkle is the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using skin care since I was a teenager.  Twenty years later I still look like a teen, still get carded, so something must be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using Peter Thomas Roth about ten years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Un-Wrinkle serum is that it is so mild that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes even if some gets around them.  Some skin care products really irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Un-Wrinkle work?  Who knows, really, but as long as the aging process has remained frozen on me for so long, I will continue to use some brand or other of spray non-alcoholic toner, serum, moisturizer, eye cream (and sunscreen whenever I leave the ) on a several time daily basis.  I try out different brands.  Right now PTR is part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the great reviews (in a department store), but I was seriously underwhelmed with the results.  I used the entire tube and I really never saw any difference at all.  I&#x27;m 36 and have good skin; no crows feet but just a few fine lines that I notice under my eyes when I smile.  I&#x27;ve used other far less expensive products that actually minimized the appearance of these lines.  Once I stopped using this and went back to my cheaper &#x27;tried and true&#x27; method, that has continued to work.  I was hoping that this would be a good additional to my anti-aging arsenal, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of anti wrinkle products but this one really does reduce the lines.  Best thing I have found yet</li>
    <li> Use this every am with the peel pads. I use pads, wash off then give this serum a chance to soak in before applying moisturizer. Skin feels clean, tight, soft and refreshed after use.</li>
    <li> I use this after I wash my face...a little goes a long way. This size lasts for months. Worth the price!</li>
