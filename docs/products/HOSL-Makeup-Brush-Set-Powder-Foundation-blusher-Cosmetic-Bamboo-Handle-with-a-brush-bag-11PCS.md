<li> These brushes are softer than expected and the handle is a very glossy bamboo.</li>
<li> There has been minimal shedding of only a couple of brushes (my most-used ones), and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
<li> Arrived earlier than the expected date!</li>
<li> They had a bit of an odd smell, sort of like nail polish remover, so I let them set out for a day or two.  </li>
<li> The silver part of the brush is attached to the handle tightly and doesn&#x27;t wiggle at all.</li>
<li> Even after the second time I cleaned them there has yet to be any shedding or anything wrong</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t leave behind any bristles.</li>
<li> NONE of the hairs have shed and I am shocked.</li>

    <li> They arrived quickly packaged in a sack and each individually encased in plastic.  They had a bit of an odd smell, sort of like nail polish remover, so I let them set out for a day or two.  They are very soft brushes.  I have used them to apply concealer, powder, blush, eye shadow, and to blend.  They are magnificent.  They don&#x27;t leave behind any bristles.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my brush set, I will definitely order from this company again!</li>

    <li> I have never written a review on amazon before, but I was so enthralled by these brushes I just had to. They came VERY quickly, about 2 weeks early. These brushes are softer than expected and the handle is a very glossy bamboo. I am absolutely in love. They were each wrapped individually in a plastic cover when they came to keep them in perfect condition. NONE of the hairs have shed and I am shocked. These are HIGH quality brushes for a very cheap price. They are near perfect. The silver part of the brush is attached to the handle tightly and doesn&#x27;t wiggle at all. I REALLY recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I like them and think they are a good buy for the price. Good solid brushes and they dont shed hairs all over your face.</li>
    <li> I completely love the brushes.....BUT!!! They take forever to reach your destination. But fortunately, I was in no rush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
