      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I used a cap on top and foil on bottom.</li>
      <li>I would recommend for sure.  </li>
      <li>More tips, my stage name is savvy.</li>
      <li>I just thought it would have more tools to work with</li>
      <li>So... for bleach, this is IT! :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more after I write this.</li>
      <li>Most people will just give up and cut it out.  </li>
      <li>There was some lavender at first, but I kind of liked that.</li>
      <li>So, to sum up, for the price and the fast service,and most of all the results, I&#x27;d say try it,it really is a good product.</li>
      <li>but I have better results w/ cheap bleach dyes.</li>
      <li>This product is great for bleaching knots on lace front and full lace wigs to get a more natural looking scalp and hairline.</li>
      <li>It was So easy.</li>
      <li>(And people constantly ask me about my hair, stating how beautiful it is.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many types of products to streak my hair with bright blonde streaks.</li>
      <li>Good dye, lifted better than the Loreal blue flash.</li>
      <li>i strongkly reccomend this to anyone that wants to bleach their hair without paying salon prices!!!</li>
      <li>I was so excited</li>
      <li>/&gt;Have fun!</li>
      <li>This was extremely frustrating because I wasn&#x27;t able to do the best job I could have done.</li>
      <li>After bleaching her hair, we dyed it bright blue</li>
      <li>So, true henna will build up and darken on your hair with repeated use, and it is a b(ch to get off because it fuses/bonds itself with the hair.  </li>
      <li>The cap is such good quality that I&#x27;ve kept it as my day to day shower cap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but overall this is a really good product</li>
      <li>I loved henna, and my red hair.</li>
      <li>you have longer hair, I would absolutely suggest getting more than one package.  </li>
      <li>Good amount if you&#x27;re only bleaching your ends like I was.</li>
      <li>I bleached my hair using a full</li>
      <li>The instructions were easy to follow and the results were exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>My hair was colored a very dark red, and this took it to a bright orange at the ends and white at the roots (which was perfect for what I needed to do for recoloring), so if you want it lighter, buy more for reapplications.</li>
      <li>,I thought it was mild compared to MP.</li>
      <li>It was quick, painless and my hair was not damaged from the bleach.</li>
      <li>I lifted out to light blonde the first night and (in true I-want-it-now fashion)I lifted it out the very next night with awesome results.</li>
      <li>so if your hair is longer, I highly suggest you buy more than one.</li>
      <li>I did wait till day two to highlight because I enjoyed the new color and feel.</li>
      <li>and this is the FIRST time I decided to do an at home cap kit myself!</li>
      <li>The old product worked faster and better in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I ended up using a demi permanent color, Ion warm red with a 10 developer.  </li>
      <li>Works great even on black hair!</li>
      <li>Still lifts amazing; Anytime I&#x27;ve used it, even when dying my hair dark brown, it lifts to a good blonde highlight.</li>
      <li>I read somewhere that red color is a sort of filler for hair that has been damaged from bleach, and I can honestly say that it works great on green!</li>
      <li>I have this stuff on my head right now.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to use chemicals, and have been going pretty much chem free for over a year now.  </li>
      <li>The instructions are very clear and easy to follow, and it came with everything I needed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m night sure if the vendor tampered with it or what &amp; also the hair changed colors rather quickly than it did last time.</li>
      <li>It bleached my whole head of hair white white, so that it could be dyed to a brilliant color.</li>
      <li>It did leave some brassy tones but that&#x27;s normal when make a huge color transition.</li>
      <li>, then mix up your bleach and just put it right on top of your coconut oiled hair, starting from the tips and working your way up.  </li>
      <li>did a strand test first, as per the instructions, and it turned out that I needed to leave the mixture on for about 90 minutes.</li>
      <li>I will be more strategic on my next venture</li>
      <li>But this shiz REALLY works for this mama!</li>
      <li>It worked pretty well</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This product works pretty well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product!  I leave it on 30 minutes,  which does lift but has a yellow tint. I follow with virgin snow toner, found at sally beauty supply, also leave this on for 30 minutes.  Absolute platinum blonde! No damage! Better results and way cheaper than any salon and I have tried everything over the years.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many types of products to streak my hair with bright blonde streaks. This is by far the best I have come across. I order it online if I cannot get to a beauty supply store. I can only find it so far at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews online I could find and I was amazed by all the posetive feed back, most people claim to have dyed their hair black dozens of times and this product magically turns their hair platnum blonde in one use. I was planning on reviewing it and I had hoped to leave such a review, but that&#x27;s not what happened. I used a pre-dye hair stripper thing that&#x27;s safe to use before bleaching your hair, its purpose is to remove the black and it did just that, but turned my hair a dull redish rustic brown. After using this bleach on it, all the darkest spots and pretty much just as dark and the only thing it managed to do was turn my orange spots yellow. Also people claim that this stu[[ASIN:B0041T9F5C Beyond The Zone On/Off Scalp Radical Bleach Kit]]ff won&#x27;t damage your hair at all, I left it in for thirty minutes and it is breaking off at the ends very badly. My hair is now stretchy, brittle, weak dry and pumpkin orange. But if this product works for the majority than id still recommend it, maybe I&#x27;m just the one in a million person whose hair didn&#x27;t take it well.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  I have used it on my son&#x27;s medium brown hair for years.  We pull it thru the cap everytime and get awesome results.  I would recommend for sure.  We leave the solution on for about 70 minutes each time and then rinse it out with shampoo.  Great product!</li>
    <li> i have light brown hair and it worked so good but i also did it on my friends hair who has dark brown hair and it worked even better! this is a great bleach for a good price i strongkly reccomend this to anyone that wants to bleach their hair without paying salon prices!!!</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well. I went from black hair to a dark blonde. It did leave some brassy tones but that&#x27;s normal when make a huge color transition. But, for as dark as my hair was this worked really well. I have a pixie cut and it&#x27;s pretty thick and I had to use the entire thing so if your hair is longer, I highly suggest you buy more than one. but overall this is a really good product</li>
    <li> Good dye, lifted better than the Loreal blue flash. However, my hair came out uneven, it was near white in some places and orange-yellow in others. This may be my hair doesn&#x27;t take well to bleach though. Good amount if you&#x27;re only bleaching your ends like I was.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to use chemicals, and have been going pretty much chem free for over a year now.  I have been using henna on my hair as well, for over a year, after it became so damaged from bleaching that it was breaking off like crazy. So, true henna will build up and darken on your hair with repeated use, and it is a b(ch to get off because it fuses/bonds itself with the hair.  Most people will just give up and cut it out.  I loved henna, and my red hair. But, my hair was getting darker and darker, and I did want to lighten it up for summer.  So, I really didn&#x27;t want to use bleach, but I have tried all the natural remedies with no results whatsoever (honey, lemonade and olive oil treatments, harsh shampooing).  I found this in Sally&#x27;s beauty supply (for about half the price it is here..) and got two packages.  My hair is in good condition, mid back, thin to medium.  Two hours before using the bleach, I saturated my hair with pure coconut oil, and plastic wrapped it so the heat would help it penetrate.  It&#x27;s a tip I learned on the internet that the girls said would help prevent my hair from breaking in the case I needed to bleach it more than once.  It works! I bleached my hair using a full Beyond the Zone bleach pack each time, two days in a row, and aside from being a bit frizzy and of course dry, it didn&#x27;t melt or damage it too much at all.  It also does not inhibit the work of the bleach, so just go for it! After you have had the coconut on your hair for at least two hours (more is fine!), then mix up your bleach and just put it right on top of your coconut oiled hair, starting from the tips and working your way up.  In case you are wondering if any oil will work, they say the coconut works the best, so stick with it.. Anyway, I left the bleach on my hair for 30 minutes the first day, then rinsed and conditioned it, air dry.  Day two, 60 minutes.  Apply your bleach and put a plastic cap over it, the heat helps it develop.  Be sure and do your coconut oil soak before each bleach, just saturate it, doesn&#x27;t have to be dripping off.  The first bleaching I did didn&#x27;t lighten it a whole lot, but day two lightened it up a lot.  It&#x27;s not a banana yellow shade, its more a greenish/gold blond with a few red streaks here and there.  After you rinse and lightly shampoo out the bleach (I read that too much shampoo/vigorous will break the hair), then apply a toner while it&#x27;s still wet.  I used wella color charm mixed with a 20 vol developer, and it will really tone out those crazy spots you get all over from different levels of bleach (yellow roots, white bangs; just make sure there is no red or brown to be seen, toner won&#x27;t help any with that), temporarily.  Anyway, hope this helps.  My hair is not a gorgeous shade of blond, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.  I will pass on the same advice that I ignored &amp;#34;if you are going to use henna, you better be sure because its permanent&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; I ended up just getting the length of my hair cut off, because that green tone got worse after several days, and nothing could fix it.  I got fed up with messing with it, and had it cut off. My hair is growing out, and I am leaving my natural color alone, and cutting off the old dyed part a little at a time.ore each bleach, just saturate it, doesn&#x27;t have to be dripping off.

I got fed up with messing with it, and had it cut off. My hair is growing out, and I am leaving my natural color alone, and cutting off the old dyed part a little at a time.the wild streaks stuff in to make the color a dark brown, almost coffee ground color.  It was a thick muddy consistency, but I smeared it in.  After all, how much worse can it get? So, I sat around looking like a muddy swamp monster for about 45 minutes, hair uncovered. I washed it out and hallelujah! I can leave my house again without fear of being captured and sold to the circus! Anyway, the color of my hair is unexpected.  It did not turn it brown at all, only softened the red and COMPLETELY got rid of the green.  My hair is a uniform color, I would call it a ronald mcdonald orange, or maybe, vibrant, psycho, demented clown orange..  I read somewhere that red color is a sort of filler for hair that has been damaged from bleach, and I can honestly say that it works great on green! So, I used Argan One and Only in light chocolate brown with a level 10 developer. Problem solved, or so I thought. It came out a nice color, washed out in only TWO shampoos (with cool water and organic very gentle shampoo), and gave me the worst headache ever. I ended up using a demi permanent color, Ion warm red with a 10 developer.  It worked well enough, but still had a slight green hue, especially after a wash.  It&#x27;s still an improvement from before.  Lesson learned: if you intend to henna, realize that it&#x27;s very permanent.  very permanent.</li>
    <li> no complaints and this is the perfect blech to dye your hair thats not too harsh but just right!! this was discovered to me by salons in what kind they use!!</li>
    <li> Great product it worked really well for the price would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but wants great results</li>
    <li> Lightens quickly with out odd discolorations</li>
    <li> This product was not too thick or too thin.  It was very effective at removing color.  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow, and it came with everything I needed.  I have very thick hair that falls just below my shoulders, and I used every last bit of product, so it you have longer hair, I would absolutely suggest getting more than one package.  My hair was colored a very dark red, and this took it to a bright orange at the ends and white at the roots (which was perfect for what I needed to do for recoloring), so if you want it lighter, buy more for reapplications.</li>
    <li> I used it on my sisters hair for highlight, a year later they are still there! Works great even on black hair!</li>
    <li> Works awesome!  But be careful, it&#x27;s strong stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun!</li>
    <li> I have this stuff on my head right now.  I got it from Sally for the same price that it is on here.  It&#x27;s burning and smells horrible, but my hair is getting lighter by the minute. I&#x27;d recommend that you use this stuff with the window open.  Unfortunately, my bathroom has no windows so it was really bad. I used the bathroom fan, but it didn&#x27;t help much.  I would use this again and I&#x27;m willing to put up with the burning and smell for the result.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well I just thought it would have more tools to work with I mean it was pretty good</li>
    <li> This product was too extreme - it turned my hair white/grey.  This is not for natural looking highlights.</li>
    <li> This product had it&#x27;s pros and cons for me. The actual bleach worked quickly and efficiently. I picked this product because it has a 40 volume developer and that is what salons have used on me in the past. The parts of my hair that had been bleached previously turned snow white and would have almost looked good without any type of toner. The regrowth in my hair was harder to bleach and did turn brassy. I did have a few problems with this product, however, and that is why I am only giving it three stars. I have thick, coarse hair that is a few inches below my shoulders. I used the highlighting cap and utilized all of the holes in the cap. The main issue I had with this product was that there was not enough bleach! If I had chosen to bleach all of my hair, I would&#x27;ve needed at least four kits to have enough product to do so. I still didn&#x27;t have enough product to cover all of the hair that I needed done, so I focused the bleach on the top parts. This was extremely frustrating because I wasn&#x27;t able to do the best job I could have done. If you have even slightly more hair than the average person, I would recommend getting two kits or buying the items separately. This kit ended up disappointing me. I was not expecting salon quality results, but I was expecting to have enough product to cover the 1/5 of my hair that I wanted to bleach.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair unnatural colors often so I bleach often as well. I bleached out my hair a while ago from a dark brown and it turned an orange/red and I couldnt get it out. I recently used this to bleach my hair from black and it worked AMAZING. It came out a golden blonde. I love this stuff. I used to use it years ago and now I know im sticking with this stuff</li>
    <li> My daughter is at the age where everyone is dying their hair to every color in the rainbow. Her original color is dark brown and I knew I would need to bleach it before changing the color. I looked at several different products including a beauty supply house that is local to us and I did not like having to know how many ounces of this to mix, and the fact that I would have chemicals left over when done. I tried Beyond The Zone On/Off Scalp Radical Bleach Kit, and was very impressed with the ease of using this product. No measuring was need because everything was done, all I had to do was mix it together. The instructions were easy to follow and the results were exactly what I wanted. Her hair was not excessively dry, which was a concern. After bleaching her hair, we dyed it bright blue and it looks great! I will use this every time I need to bleach hair when changing colors.</li>
    <li> Fast acting - it began stripping the color (permanent dye) from my hair almost instantly. I&#x27;ve used this bleach several times with great results - it even comes out less yellow and brassy, a bit whiter than other brands I&#x27;ve used (e.g. Feria). BUT BE WARNED - because this bleach is so strong, it WILL burn any skin other than your scalp, so be very careful around your ears, neck, and eyes! I accidentally burned my ears once and even a week later, the blisters</li>
    <li> My hair is about to the bottom of my ears.. It was brown/blond and I wanted a crystal blue, this did the trick! It bleached my whole head of hair white white, so that it could be dyed to a brilliant color. Love this stuff, do recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is great for bleaching knots on lace front and full lace wigs to get a more natural looking scalp and hairline. Youtube has great videos on how to bleach knots using this product</li>
    <li> I used this exact same bleach in October 201. on some bad quality Brazilian hair &amp; it did what it was suppose to do , the only thing is I got it directly out of sally&#x27;s beauty supply store in baton rouge. SO I decided to order offline with my amazon gift card again the exact same bleach but this time it made my hair feel like bubblegum ,it didn&#x27;t even feel like hair anymore idk why the packaging was different because when I bought it from sally&#x27;s it was difficult to open I needed scissors BUT when I received it from whoever the vendor is , all I had to do was pull it apart. I&#x27;m night sure if the vendor tampered with it or what &amp; also the hair changed colors rather quickly than it did last time.</li>
    <li> New packaging, same product. Yet the powder now comes with about half of what it used to- good thing we had some powder left over from the last one, or hair would&#x27;ve been a hot mess and unfinished. Still lifts amazing; Anytime I&#x27;ve used it, even when dying my hair dark brown, it lifts to a good blonde highlight. If its med. brown, some parts can be almost \\&quot;bleach blonde\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, does not take to dyes easily and is damaged. I used two packes on my hair and managed to get my hair from black to an off white/pale yellow in one try! It was quick, painless and my hair was not damaged from the bleach. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have to say I loved this product! I have darkish blond hair and I wanted to lift it out to platinum...I usually only use Manic Panic bleach, but this was a better price point at the time and I decided to give it a try. It was great. I see that a lot of people complain about the smell,I thought it was mild compared to MP. I live with roommates and no one even noticed I was doing my hair! So smell was not an issue for me. This was also the gentlest bleach I have ever used. I lifted out to light blonde the first night and (in true I-want-it-now fashion)I lifted it out the very next night with awesome results. I already had toner shampoo and conditioner witch I totally recommend and just for effect, I did slap some Manic Panic Virgin Snow on it. There was some lavender at first, but I kind of liked that. So, to sum up, for the price and the fast service,and most of all the results, I&#x27;d say try it,it really is a good product. I&#x27;m ordering more after I write this.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was very skeptic. I colored with Argon oil hair color from Sally&#x27;s; Didn&#x27;t use conditioner so I could highlight after. My hair was unbelievably soft.  I did wait till day two to highlight because I enjoyed the new color and feel. I used a cap on top and foil on bottom. It was So easy. It did not smell bad nor did it damage my hair as I expected it to. No copper ugh at all.  I have long layers and there was plenty. I will be more strategic on my next venture but I am well pleased and will recommend this to anyone. No more $125.00 hair do&#x27;s for me.</li>
    <li> I must say for atleast 15 years I have been getting salon highlights and this is the FIRST time I decided to do an at home cap kit myself! For $8.99 this did a GREAT job. I was nervous doing it myself as I spend a fortune to keep my hair looking good. Its important that you keep the cap tight and comb out the strands well that you pull through and tug on the hairs about every 10 min to ensure that you are getting as close to the scalp as possible with the bleach to avoid orange roots. I left it on for 45 min and I&#x27;m VERY pleased with my result. In hind site I could have left it on another 5 min for a total of 50 min but I was nervous. Don&#x27;t wash it out t0o soon or you will get ORANGE hair and it will be harder to correct! I will DEFINATELY use this product again! It comes with everything you need....bleach, developer, brush, hook, and cap! GREAT DEAL! Thanks! nicci[[ASIN:B0041T9F5C Beyond The Zone On/Off Scalp Radical Bleach Kit]]</li>
    <li> This is not for beginners. Not everyone can bleach their own hair at home. I loved this bleach kit. Although I was a little weary of 40 volume developer (which is highest strength) I knew what could potentially happen. Bleach is a very risky chemical to put on your hair especially if your hair is already damaged and breaking. I wanted to have bleach blonde highlights in my dark brown hair. I followed the directions and left it one for about an hour and a half. I rinsed it out and looked in the mirror, my hair was orange and red. I didnt freak out completely because I knew I had to tone it. I used Wella T10 Pale Blonde toner and left it one for about 45 mins. I was so excited when I rinsed and blow dried my hair. It is a beautiful pale blonde color which was exactly what I wanted. To maintain this look, I would recommend getting purple shampoo and a good conditioner. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for people that want to do their own bleaching. It has never burned me. My hair comes out all the same color. No spots. Since my hair is short I usually get 2 to 3 uses out of it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE! It&#x27;s the ONLY bleach I&#x27;ve used for years, and the only bleach that works so fully in doing exactly what I want it to do. My hair shimmers, but the glisten may not be such a natural look, but if you&#x27;re looking for a shimmery, blingy platinum blonde, THIS is the blonde to go for! (And people constantly ask me about my hair, stating how beautiful it is. I&#x27;m in a high profile public eye, and my celebrity friends even ask me about my hair (after saying they think it&#x27;s pretty.) :-)&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s my secret: Leave it on no longer than 12-30 minutes (LESS time is better (it will fade lighter in time, and the longer you leave it in, you risk damage and breakage). (Trust me. Sounds like a little bit of time, but remember, Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day, k? This IS bleach, and nuthin to mess around with.) You wanna lift those roots slightly (on touch up), but no more! Your blonde will happen. Get it up to that yellow, and then suck it up and Let it be yellow for 2 weeks. No toner. Because I&#x27;ve been doing it so long, only my roots are yellow for a week, but the rest of my hair is light blonde. (This is coming from a level 4 brunette (read: in hair color terms, that&#x27;s almost black). Don&#x27;t keep putting the bleach on the blonde parts. When you touch it up, be careful that you ONLY do the roots!! Also, make sure you&#x27;re not following any other hair processes. You really only want this to be your only process. No perms before this. No previous haircolor. My tip is only gonna work on virgin hair. And then it will still vary by person, age, and your hormone level. But this shiz REALLY works for this mama! (One of my friends in M*tley Cr*e even said how beautiful my hair is.(and um.. you know they&#x27;re around Pam Anders0n and such... (just sayin...) So... for bleach, this is IT! :-) Good luck! :-) More tips, my stage name is savvy. I&#x27;m not hard to find. ;-)</li>
    <li> works okay but I have better results w/ cheap bleach dyes.</li>
    <li> i always used this when my hair was short, but since it has grown out i realized how little actually comes with this. Buy two if your hair is past your shoulders. It does burn when it omes in contact with skin but i think it would with any bleach.&lt;br /&gt;Just beware because i ran out of bleach halfway through and looked awful.</li>
    <li> Had my mom do this kit on me.... If you have the chance just buy it yourself and have a pro apply it, they&#x27;ll know how to even it out, I have 10 different tones from bleach to my natural dark brown in my hair permanently. It works well just get someone that knows what they&#x27;re doing!</li>
    <li> have not heard anything but good things about this product so I&#x27;m sure i won&#x27;t have any problems using it. my only complaint is that when i bought it i had it rushed shipped, i needed it in 2 days, and the next day i got an email saying that they couldn&#x27;t ship it next day because of my address, i could get a full refund and cancel the order, or be refunded the difference of shipping an have it shipped through the regular mail, very upset that i didn&#x27;t get the product when i needed it, but other then that, no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been dying my hair a dark red for almost two years, and decided that I wanted to go back to turquoise again. After first using a color lift to get some of the red out, I then bleached it using two packets of Beyond The Zone On/Off Scalp Radical Bleach. My hair is past my shoulders, so if your hair is longer than a bob or is particularly thick I would definitely recommend buying two packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a strand test first, as per the instructions, and it turned out that I needed to leave the mixture on for about 90 minutes. I would certainly always do a strand test first, especially if you&#x27;re lightening your hair from a strange tone like I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes a mixing bowl, gloves, a GREAT reusable cap, a tinting brush, and a hook/mixer combo which is great if you&#x27;re planning on giving yourself highlights. The cap is such good quality that I&#x27;ve kept it as my day to day shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this bleaching kit. It got my hair much lighter than I thought it would, it didn&#x27;t fry my hair, and it was very evenly toned. I didn&#x27;t need to use a toner, and my turquoise dye job looked great!</li>
    <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s high lift so you have to pay close attention to your hair so you don&#x27;t damage it. It comes with gloves, a small mixing bowl, application brush and a mixing spatula. This kit is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of bleach! :D Stings a little though but only the front part of the head though</li>
    <li> Okay. So This product got really good reviews so I went out and got it. It turned my hair orange the first time. But in all fairness I didn&#x27;t keep it in long enough. I bought it for the second time today and kept it in for an hour and it still turned orange. The old product worked faster and better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> To be honest this thing burned pretty badly when it accidentally got on my ears.(but left no rash thankfully), if you have a tendency towards sensitive skin be careful. Use lotion or Vaseline on your forehead and ears just in case. Also my hair was pretty damn dry after this. I had leave a deep conditioner on my hair for hours even though I only left it in for 30 minutes. I also feel like I&#x27;m losing an abnormal amount of hair, but I will admit that&#x27;s probably my paranoia about hair loss speaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a light red and this seem to do less for me than people with darker hair. Definitely use a toner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair to your chin or past that I suggest two kits or more. Trust me you do not want to be stuck with uneven hair color because you were too cheap to buy two.</li>
