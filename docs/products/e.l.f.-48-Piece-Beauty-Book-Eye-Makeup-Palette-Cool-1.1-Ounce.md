    <li> I am a loyal Sheido product purchaser.  I had purchased their multi-color make-up book and loved it so much I went back to buy another one a few months later.  Unfortunately, their multi-color make-up book was a promo product.  I was disappointed but determined to buy something that I liked for travel as well as the application and color selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure if I would like anything else but thought I would give this e.l.f. product a try...and I am so glad I did.  The price and the quality was wonderful.  The colors are smooth and easy to apply...no clumping or running and blend easily.  I keep my 48 piece eye makeup book in my to-go travel bag at all times...the size is just right.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 9 year old daughter to play make up.  She loves all the colors.</li>
    <li> I love these colors! They last ALL day through.</li>
