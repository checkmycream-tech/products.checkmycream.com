    <li> Smells just like sunscreen.  I actually really like the smell but it&#x27;s a bit overpowering and I feel only really suitable for the beach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad they sale this online. I have been wanting to buy it for years but it is not in stores anymore. Smells amazing, wish they had a bigger size perfume bottle.</li>
    <li> It is May 2011 and I was looking for a great, new summer scent. I was inspired by the movie Soul Surfer and thought it was cool Bethany had a perfume line. It has a very light, but pleasant tropical smell. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was a bit stronger, but all in all it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Very good! thank you...</li>
