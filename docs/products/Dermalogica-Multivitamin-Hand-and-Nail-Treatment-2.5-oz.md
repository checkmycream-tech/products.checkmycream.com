    <li> Great product. Shipped quickly with no problems. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a couple months, and it works very good on my hands. But I can buy similar products for less money. Too expensive.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly was exactly as described</li>
    <li> So far so good but not as good as loccitane hand cream, assorb not very fast and not enough moisture</li>
    <li> I love this item my hands are addicted to it! Fast delivery and fair price!</li>
    <li> VERY PLEASED WITH PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday.  I wish they would sell it in a larger size.  Its not greasy.  Skin feels nourished and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product keeps my cuticles in check. Fast delivery Thank you !</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin. I am also skeptical of seemingly over priced beauty products. I have to wash my hands ALOT in my profession. This product used regularly restored my hands to their moisturizer, hangnail free, unbreakable nail state. You do have to use it daily to see results. But it works.</li>
    <li> Fabulous hand cream.  Lasts for days!</li>
    <li> After noticing my mother&#x27;s hands, I frantically ran out for an anti aging hand lotion. I like this stuff because of the vitamins in it, and that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands stinky and greasy. This is the only stuff I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> very good. keeps nails strong and lightens &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; considerably</li>
    <li> Love it but it&#x27;s too expensive to continue.</li>
    <li> by far this product is the best hand treatment I have ever used....you can actually see the fine lines disappear before your eyes...light consistency feels good on hands and nails....try it you will not be disappointed</li>

    <li> Moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product in the past, and I absolutely love it! It really helps to moisturize your hands and is great for your nails too.</li>
    <li> Worth trying!! This product was a great purchase. In my line of work I am constantly washing my hands and they dry out quickly.  Since I have been using this product my hands are soft and my cuticle are not so rough. I use twice a day and began to notice a difference after about a week 1/2. I will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for about 2 yrs. and like it quite a bit.  I like its vitamins and what it does for my cuticles.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is because I don&#x27;t think it is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love Dermalogica products.</li>
    <li> My nails looked terrible and then I tried this. It helped with the extreme dryness of the climate in this area. I also highly recommend the seller. Vey prompt service.</li>
