      <li>I fact, I need to do that right now, while the supply is available!!!</li>
      <li>I thought Amazon&#x27;s prices were too good to be true, but decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>so I love it.</li>
      <li>The bustier top is plastic but made to look like frosted glass.  </li>
      <li>I have been told that teenager love anything Betsey Johnson.  </li>

      <li>I love the way my wife smells when she is wearing Betsy Johnson.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I have been an admirer of most things Betsey Johnson for years.  </li>
      <li>and I love wearing it...</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this from Sephora and I fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful and colorful, the scent is not bad</li>
      <li>I am in my early thirties and it is a perfect scent for me because its not too powerful or in your face.</li>
      <li>However the perfume is so strong the scent still lingered on my skin after being washed but it was much more tolerable.  </li>
      <li>Very nice bottle, but the scent is for a 50 year old woman</li>
      <li>It came very quick when ordered around the holidays.  </li>
      <li>The candy taste like it smells, and it smells like strong perfume.  </li>
      <li>but for me it&#x27;s just way to strong.  </li>
      <li>Now, this one is a hit for me, I loved it from the first whiff of it right out of the bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did get a genuine bottle.  </li>
      <li>as many people find the bottle I find it charming, all ruffles and frills in it&#x27;s little plastic dome, and I love how it looks on my dressing</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and was happy to find it for less.</li>
      <li>and I am over all happy with the look minus</li>
      <li>I guess I should have paid full price.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a bad smell at all</li>
      <li>This eua du parfum has a medium to mild scent.  </li>
      <li>This is such a sensational collection and every lady should have one.</li>
      <li>Sexy, elegant, and a romantic smell.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume mainly for the bottle, and I&#x27;m kinda glad that&#x27;s all I wanted it for.</li>
      <li>Smells good and lingers long after spraying</li>
      <li>Not only does this smell amazing</li>
      <li>It is so worth what you pay.</li>
      <li>I do however feel it&#x27;s worth what I paid</li>
      <li>I love this perfume and I am really sad that it is being discontinued, it holds on me forever and the scent is fabulous, I also love the really cute packaging and will really be bumbed out when it is gone</li>
      <li>The scent smells very much like the candy</li>
      <li>There were no common notes between the true sample and this bottle whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to start off by saying as most know, scent is one of those things that can be different for everyone.  </li>
      <li>The bottle looks like a youger audience is being targeted, in my opinion, but the smell would fit someone more mature aged...</li>
      <li>When I first bought it, it was in dept. stores and Sephora and was much pricier.  </li>
      <li>but  is not really my taste because I like sweeter perfumes, this is quite strong,  but what else can you expect from Betsey Johnson you will be noticed!</li>
      <li>Good news is, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>It was so strong with one spritz that it gave me a headache almost instantly.  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful at first but only last for a little while.</li>
      <li>This perfume may smell wonderful to or on one person but be the most horrible scent for another.</li>
      <li>Smells a little like spice, not my favorite scent</li>
      <li>I compared this scent directly to the real thing&#x27;s sample which I had received at a Sephora, and they&#x27;re not even close.  </li>
      <li>The first time I wore it, I walked around smelling like I had came out of vacuum seal.</li>
      <li>Upon the first whiff It brought me back directly to my childhood.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely not the real thing.  </li>
      <li>the old ladies at my grandmothers church used to eat all the time called \\&quot;violets.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>From far it looks glass but upon closer inspection, clearly it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>She has so many perfumes that I expect it will last a few years.  </li>
      <li>The original is fresh and musky, but this just smells like your typical heavy, super-sweet drugstore perfume.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend for any aged woman.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product was as described. Great buy</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from Sephora and I fell in love with it.  Amazon vendors had the best price. I did get a genuine bottle.  Smells just the like the previous bottle I ordered on Amazon. This eua du parfum has a medium to mild scent.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m offending others noses when I wear this.  I think it has a hint of musk/spice... but very low or no floral undertone.  (I tend not to like floral parfum).  Stays all day. Highly recommend for any aged woman. I&#x27;m 48 and I love wearing it... I get nice comments too sometimes.  :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I am really sad that it is being discontinued, it holds on me forever and the scent is fabulous, I also love the really cute packaging and will really be bumbed out when it is gone that is why I am stocking up on this fragrance it makes a great blog on my youtube channel and several subs have ordered it after I did a scent review!!!!!  Love,it big time!!!</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this scent all the time. personally I love the smell</li>
    <li> Smells good and lingers long after spraying</li>
    <li> My wife says it Smells incredible!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, awesome baudy packaging.</li>
    <li> Great price.  My daughter loves this perfume.  When I first bought it, it was in dept. stores and Sephora and was much pricier.  Love that it is cheaper!</li>
    <li> Perfect, well packaged by seller. My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before In a store. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long because it is not authentic.  I guess I should have paid full price.  Close imitation though.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the Amazon price anywhere else.  My girlfriend loved the scent and the bottle.  She has so many perfumes that I expect it will last a few years.  It came very quick when ordered around the holidays.  Another great connect by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought it just for the packaging...,Its soo beautiful.The smell is okay,I&#x27;m keeping it to.decorate my perfume display.</li>
    <li> I must be honest in saying this perfume was bought for the bottle.  I have been an admirer of most things Betsey Johnson for years.  I love the shape of the bottle, the uniqueness of the design, and wanted it on my dresser and if the perfume smelled good that would be a bonus.  If I base my review solely on the bottle, it would be 4 out of five stars.  The bustier top is plastic but made to look like frosted glass.  From far it looks glass but upon closer inspection, clearly it isn&#x27;t.  The dome is a cute idea for the packaging, but in a barbie/matel pretend makeup sort of way.  I would have hated to buy it retail knowing that the topper isn&#x27;t glass.  I would have loved the bottle much more if it was. I do however feel it&#x27;s worth what I paid and I am over all happy with the look minus all the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the scent of the perfume.  I&#x27;d like to start off by saying as most know, scent is one of those things that can be different for everyone.  This perfume may smell wonderful to or on one person but be the most horrible scent for another. This is my experience;&lt;br /&gt;I personally can&#x27;t say I care for TooToo nor do I hate it.  I just don&#x27;t like it for me.  Upon the first whiff It brought me back directly to my childhood.  The scent smells very much like the candy the old ladies at my grandmothers church used to eat all the time called \\&quot;violets.\\&quot;  [[ASIN:B003MUHDF0 C. Howard Violet Candies, 0.88-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)]]  The candy taste like it smells, and it smells like strong perfume.  The perfume smells like the candy.  It was so strong with one spritz that it gave me a headache almost instantly.  The little I put on my wrist was promptly washed off with dish washing soap to get rid of it.  However the perfume is so strong the scent still lingered on my skin after being washed but it was much more tolerable.  Diluted it&#x27;s not a bad smell at all but for me it&#x27;s just way to strong.  So in it&#x27;s bottle it shall stay.  I&#x27;d say 3 out of five on the scent alone, not the worst smelling perfume, but too strong for me.ne, not the worst smelling perfume, but too strong for me.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Too bad I heard that it was not going to be made anymore. Trying to stock up now. The price on this was terrific. I&#x27;ve seen where the price is hiked up because it will be hard to get a hold of in the future. The only downfall I have it with the tutu on the bottle. You have to pull it down every time you spray or it gets in the way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s being discontinued, this fruity, floral, musk and patchouli scent smells heavenly on my skin, and even my perfume loathing husband loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tasteless as many people find the bottle I find it charming, all ruffles and frills in it&#x27;s little plastic dome, and I love how it looks on my dressing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly I&#x27;m also one of those people who likes leopard miniskirts and wears a pushup bra to the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Now, this one is a hit for me, I loved it from the first whiff of it right out of the bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Too Too&amp;#34; is such a beautifully yummy fragrance with wonderful staying power without being overwhelming, and the packaging is lovely and makes you smile!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this one again...I fact, I need to do that right now, while the supply is available!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way my wife smells when she is wearing Betsy Johnson. It makes it hard to say &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; to any request. I just want to attack her!</li>
    <li> I was worried they were going to just stuff this into a box and ship it off, but when I received it the perfume was secured well. It was in good condition and smells wonderful. Very Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it is because it came through the mail, i.e. sitting in the heat somewhere, etc. the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. It is wonderful at first but only last for a little while. not very happy about this. My mistake though.  I wouldn&#x27;t order fragrance through the mail again.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the real thing.  I thought Amazon&#x27;s prices were too good to be true, but decided to try it.  I compared this scent directly to the real thing&#x27;s sample which I had received at a Sephora, and they&#x27;re not even close.  The original is fresh and musky, but this just smells like your typical heavy, super-sweet drugstore perfume.  There were no common notes between the true sample and this bottle whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t think the perfume has turned - because turned perfume smells alcoholy and sour, which this didn&#x27;t.... my guess is these are high-level manufactured fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t forget that you can&#x27;t return fragrances through the mail, so order at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Smells a little like spice, not my favorite scent but it&#x27;s not terrible. The bottle looks like a youger audience is being targeted, in my opinion, but the smell would fit someone more mature aged... The bottle is very cute and creative that is a 5 star</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this. I am in my early thirties and it is a perfect scent for me because its not too powerful or in your face. It seems to last all day while I work, but I have to reapply if I do anything after work. I would recommend</li>
    <li> Smells musky. But, beautiful bottle. Used as decoration.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it...so I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been told that teenager love anything Betsey Johnson.  I wanted to by a teen and two pre-teens a bottle of perfume and the Betsy Johnson brand seemed like a good gift.  I am happy with the purchase.  The final judge will be the girls when they get them for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is such a sensational collection and every lady should have one. Sexy, elegant, and a romantic smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a gift the packaging on this bottle is exquisite the scent is memorable</li>
    <li> bought for a friend and she loved it</li>
    <li> Let me be honest here. I bought this perfume mainly for the bottle, and I&#x27;m kinda glad that&#x27;s all I wanted it for. It looks like it would smell really good, and lets face it, Betsey Johnson is name brand, so you would assume it would. It literally smells like the plastic container it&#x27;s in. It&#x27;s horrible. The first time I wore it, I walked around smelling like I had came out of vacuum seal.Good news is, it doesn&#x27;t last long. With that being said, this just sits on my vanity for looks. I refuse to actually wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and was happy to find it for less.</li>
    <li> I got this at marshalls for fifteen dollars and was amazed at the smell and quality. It is so worth what you pay. Not only does this smell amazing but the scent lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> Very nice bottle, but the scent is for a 50 year old woman</li>
    <li> I love my Betsey Johnson - smells awesome on me.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and colorful, the scent is not bad but  is not really my taste because I like sweeter perfumes, this is quite strong,  but what else can you expect from Betsey Johnson you will be noticed!</li>
    <li> The price for this size bottle is really great ($32.14 for a 3.4 oz)!  It&#x27;s being discontinued to snap it it while you can.  It has a great fragrance and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This scent is absolutely perfect and the bottle is just adorable.</li>
