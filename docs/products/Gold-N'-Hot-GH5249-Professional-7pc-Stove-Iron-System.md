      <li>Love this set.</li>
      <li>The carring bag provides a place to keep all of the supplies together and makes it easy to store away when not in use.  </li>
      <li>and it was fine.</li>
      <li>I love my Gold N&#x27; Hot set!  </li>
      <li>I returned this product because I burned out a huge section in the front of my hair using the curling iron - the product was faulty.</li>
      <li>Pulling my curlers in and out, I find not to be a smooth transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great buy for someone looking for a permanent solution to cheap curling and flat irons</li>
      <li>It honestly leaves my hair very soft and healthier looking even though I&#x27;m adding heat</li>
      <li>The instructions warned that there was a special oil coating on the irons and that once heated the coating would burn off.</li>
      <li>I am experienced with using curling irons, flat irons, hot combs, etc.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!!</li>
      <li>The stove gets hot quickly and all of the irons work well.  </li>
      <li>It comes with 3 irons that are ideal for short hair, a one inch flat iron and a hot comb.</li>
      <li>The Golden hot pressing did not straighten my hair very well.</li>
      <li>Love this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>The product lives up to the Gold N&#x27; Hot brand</li>
      <li>The curling irons, insulated bag, hot stove and pressing comb.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It got too hot.</li>
      <li>You never know the exact temperature</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time as of December 1214</li>
      <li>It works great with getting her hair straight and it last long too.</li>
      <li>so I use my 1 inch flat iron more often.</li>
      <li>As the cordless thermal Marcel irons are hard to find individually, this is a great alternative to the $250 full iron set!</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it, says it was exactly what he needed for class.</li>
      <li>Absolutely superb😃😃😃😃.</li>
      <li>Burned my hair and very smokey.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has basic knowledge of straightening hair and want to achieve a more professional result.</li>
      <li>The stand that the irons sit on is too high to put large Marcel irons in.</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is that the pressing comb does not get very hot, it is too lightweight.</li>
      <li>In new to pressing and thermal styling</li>
      <li>It is still in the new process.  </li>
      <li>When I applied the iron to my hair, the oil suck to it and when I tried to open the curling iron to free my hair it would not open.</li>
      <li>Instead, I heard and smelled my hair frying and seconds later the iron pulled free from my head with a giant plug of my hair.</li>
      <li>The stove can fit a huge flat marcel iron (i adore my Kentucky maid xtra large iron) or two smaller flat and round iron.</li>
      <li>Take a long time to get your curlers hot between each curl.  </li>
      <li>Although I never walk off from my oven with the combs inside, I use the wet towel to cool the irons down a little, because the ceramic heater gets hot very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The stove an one flat iron would cost as much at beauty supply store.  </li>
      <li>If you are using the stove iron system for the first time, I suggest you use an old wet towel to touch all sides of the irons before putting them in your hair.  </li>

<li> The Pieces did not fit in stove.</li>
<li> Also, it not smooth inside.  </li>
<li> This is an old school tool and if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, you will be very confused....</li>
<li> Hard to maneuver.</li>
<li> Try it out you wont be sorry!</li>
<li> I was in shock and it felt like a bad dream.</li>
<li> My tools was not promptly made it was horrible</li>

    <li> This was bought for my granddaughter who is currently going to beauty school. She absoutely loves it. It&#x27;s just what she needs for her classes</li>
    <li> Loved  it,Perfect for cosmometology students and great for when I do home hair visits! Travels well and the case is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hair professional, but had used pressing combs and marcel round stove irons over 25 years ago.  I&#x27;ve never used a ceramic heater, but the burners on my oven.  The convenience of the ceramic heater allowed me to do my hair in the bathroom versus the kitchen.  Love that!  The handy bag allows me to keep everything together under my sink. Love that! The ceramic heater reaches the perfect temperature, and the pressing comb and irons work perfect, just as they did in the good old day (:&amp;#62;)). Love that, too! Since it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used the marcel irons, I had to refresh myself on how to use them.  If you are using the stove iron system for the first time, I suggest you use an old wet towel to touch all sides of the irons before putting them in your hair.  Although I never walk off from my oven with the combs inside, I use the wet towel to cool the irons down a little, because the ceramic heater gets hot very quickly.  Never leave your irons in the stove and come back to put the combs immediately in your hair, because IT will burn your hair out.</li>
    <li> In new to pressing and thermal styling but this kit gets it done for me. Perfect for new hairstylists. Good buy</li>
    <li> It okay.  Take a long time to get your curlers hot between each curl.  Also, it not smooth inside.  Pulling my curlers in and out, I find not to be a smooth transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that it comes with, you get a bargain.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is in cosmetology school. He absolutely loves it, says it was exactly what he needed for class.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to open and try out the oven and pressing comb.  The product lives up to the Gold N&#x27; Hot brand~excellent.  I have got to learn to use them all proficiently, but that onus is on me. Not the system&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my mom. She loves it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this set! I was tired of cheap curling irons breaking on me and since I have a lot of hair, I bought this set. Best decision I ever made! I now can have salon quality hair, without the salon price! Great buy for someone looking for a permanent solution to cheap curling and flat irons lol</li>
    <li> I returned this product because I burned out a huge section in the front of my hair using the curling iron - the product was faulty. I am experienced with using curling irons, flat irons, hot combs, etc. so this was not user error. The instructions warned that there was a special oil coating on the irons and that once heated the coating would burn off. I followed instructions and allowed the iron plenty of time, on the highest heat setting possible, to burn off. A few minutes later after the iron had cooled a bit I tested it with a paper towel and it was fine. When I applied the iron to my hair, the oil suck to it and when I tried to open the curling iron to free my hair it would not open. Instead, I heard and smelled my hair frying and seconds later the iron pulled free from my head with a giant plug of my hair. I was in shock and it felt like a bad dream. I must say that the other irons that came with the package did not have this oil on them, so my guess is that I received an iron that had not been QC&#x27;ed before it left the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> My items came faster than I thought. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> My tools was not promptly made it was horrible</li>
    <li> I love my Gold N&#x27; Hot set!  I think it&#x27;s wonderful, because as a stylist I can take it along with me when I do homebound clients.</li>
    <li> I used this when I visit clients in there home............The best thing since sliced bread! Try it out you wont be sorry!</li>
    <li> It got too hot. The Pieces did not fit in stove. Hard to maneuver. I would choose a different brand</li>
    <li> I love love love this product... Is all I can say....Great product...</li>
    <li> Great the job done.....</li>
    <li> Love this set. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This was an awesome value for the price. As the cordless thermal Marcel irons are hard to find individually, this is a great alternative to the $250 full iron set! It comes with 3 irons that are ideal for short hair, a one inch flat iron and a hot comb. Shipping was fast!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to flat iron my granddaughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s saving me about $40 a week and about 4 hrs of wait time at a local salon.  The set is a awesome bargin.  The stove an one flat iron would cost as much at beauty supply store.  The carring bag provides a place to keep all of the supplies together and makes it easy to store away when not in use.  The stove gets hot quickly and all of the irons work well.  The 1 1/2 inch flat iron that comes with it does not fit well in the stove so I use my 1 inch flat iron more often. Otherwise it&#x27;s awesome.  I would recommend it to anyone who has basic knowledge of straightening hair and want to achieve a more professional result.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister to straighten her hair and it works close to the salon irons quality. It works great with getting her hair straight and it last long too.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my set it is just what  I wanted</li>
    <li> It just burns your hair...</li>
    <li> I brought this because of the bag.  It all works well, I have no complaints.  I wish it came with a smaller flat iron.  No complaints though.</li>
    <li> This product is a good value for the price.  The curling irons, insulated bag, hot stove and pressing comb.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is that the pressing comb does not get very hot, it is too lightweight. The Golden hot pressing did not straighten my hair very well. Therefore, I bought a Kentucky Maid pressing comb that worked wonderfully and  straighten my hair with ease.</li>
    <li> You never know the exact temperature so there&#x27;s no temp control. It burned (3) sets of my hair extensions that were well over $1k each. And hair stayed on the rod as I had to pull it out. Don&#x27;t care for this.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t complain,good product!</li>
    <li> Great product.I&#x27;m doing the heck outta some hair now.</li>
