<li> The silver capped product is a different color for the blonde and I prefer it over the black capped brow pencil that was sent to fulfill this order.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like eyebrows that are dark or different than hair color</li>
<li> Have always used this shade it is not so dark but is getting harder and harder to find?</li>
<li> /&gt;Shame on you for displaying a picture of one pencil and sending the other one.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s simply looks natural with blondes, and finding one that was acceptable was difficult.</li>
<li> I ordered the mary kay pencil with the silver tip but got the one with the black tip.</li>
<li> The newer version with the black cap.</li>
<li> I ordered this Mary Kay Brow Definer Pencil thinking that it would be the pencil shown in the picture, with the silver lid, but instead received the one with the black lid.</li>

<li> website showed the pencil with the black also</li>
<li> On some occasions when you sharpen them then attempt to use them the lead breaks and you are forced to sharpen again which is wasteful but that is the only negative.</li>
<li> I know very little about applying make-up, so I appreciate the ease in which to use this product.</li>
<li> I am sad that it&#x27;s not the same product as pictured.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I got nothing in the box I paid for a box</li>
    <li> Perfect blonde color and great texture.</li>
    <li> This is the best brow pencil for a blonde.  Not too dark and/or too light.  The color is perfect.  Stays on all day.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Mary Kay Brow Definer Pencil thinking that it would be the pencil shown in the picture, with the silver lid, but instead received the one with the black lid. There is definitely a difference in the two pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have read more of the reviews and noticed others had this problem also.</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for my light complexion and not so perfect application. I know very little about applying make-up, so I appreciate the ease in which to use this product. I&#x27;ve used this for years.</li>
    <li> As you can see from the picture, I thought I was buying the eyebrow pencil that had the silver cap. Guess what I got? The newer version with the black cap. To me, this was very deceiving. The pencil is not the same. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve had. This purchase was a replacement for one I used &amp;#34;to the bone&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s simply looks natural with blondes, and finding one that was acceptable was difficult.</li>

    <li> I have gray hair and the color on these is the only one that doesn&#x27;t look penciled.  I don&#x27;t like eyebrows that are dark or different than hair color so this works well.  And Mary Kay is the only one I have found that has the blonde color option.  Like most brow definer pencils sometimes they don&#x27;t sharpen well.  On some occasions when you sharpen them then attempt to use them the lead breaks and you are forced to sharpen again which is wasteful but that is the only negative.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fair skin</li>

    <li> Received quickly and with free samples that I was not excepting to get!  Would order again without any hesitation!  Went beyond my expectations.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love these. They are the exact shade that I need. I like the pencil style so that you can sharpen it when needed and you know how much you have left (unlike the mechanical pencil style - where you are surprised when you run out).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and find it still the most dependable pencil for natural looking brows.  Nice to not have to contact a Mary Kay person.</li>
    <li> Great product, price and fast delivery. I will be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Have used Classic Blonde eyebrow pencil since 1985 - there is nothing on the market that beats the quality of Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a brown pencil that works better for my very blonde, barely there brows. I will keep buying this pencil.</li>
    <li> I really like the Mary Kay Signature Brow Definer Pencil and how smooth it goes on.  It doesn&#x27;t look waxy like some pencils I&#x27;ve used.  I do have eye brows and so I don&#x27;t have to put much on.  I do extend my eye brows out where there isn&#x27;t any brows and the pencil line that I put on goes on smooth and looks natural and not waxy.  I highly recommend this pencil.  I will order this pencil again and again.</li>
    <li> I have used so many different eyebrow pencils, and this one is by far my favorite. I keep coming back for it...just make sure it is the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Mary Kay pencil, the kind you sharpen. The twistable one is just not the same.</li>
    <li> This is not the product I wanted--maybe they don&#x27;t make it anymore--it works o.k--products change so often--thank you.E. L. LOrd</li>
    <li> Nice to find this on Amazon, didn&#x27;t have to look around for a store or representative.  Very nice product, excellent color and applies smoothly.  Delivered as promised, will order again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the mary kay pencil with the silver tip but got the one with the black tip. The colors are different. I would like to get whats pictured but I&#x27;ll just keep it now because it would cost more than the pencil to send it back.</li>
    <li> This is a nice final touch to my makeup routine. Stays on all day. Best results when pencil is sharp!</li>
    <li> Quick service &amp; no shipping chg. as stated but formula &amp; color seemed changed &amp; was much darker. Mary Kays mistake, not seller.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow pencil ever, have used forever, much easier going thru Amazon!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Blonde Brow definer matches my eyebrow color the best of any brand.&lt;br /&gt;However I seem to remember the pencil being longer.</li>
    <li> Great color, perfect definer and doesn&#x27;t glob up. Brow liner stays on.</li>
    <li> Am very pleased with my purchase. Was surprised that the size is much smaller than I used to purchase.  Was received very promptly.</li>
