<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t break me out, stays for hours.. It will turn your skin a slight white cast, so I usually put a little foundation over it.  I live in Florida, where sunscreen is a must, and this is my go to face sunscreen for days on the beach or kayaking.</li>
    <li> not greasy, and penetrates well the skin</li>
    <li> If you exercise in the sun this stuff is fantastic.  Stays on, protects, doesnt make you look like a ghost</li>
    <li> Just received the product. Has a 1.5-2 month expiration date, seriously?</li>
    <li> This sunblock works great! As I think a few others may have mentioned, its a little &#x27;thick&#x27; when you put it on, but does not stay that way like many of the zinc products do and never seem to work into your skin, or make the hair on your arms white until washed off. It does not seem to work itself off from sweat and heat either. I put on a good amount before a bike ride that was only intended to be about 1 to 1.5 hours long. I had forgotten to bring additional sunblock to reapply and my ride ended up going well over 3 hours. I though for sure I would be burnt later that evening or the following day. I am happy to say I was not with the exception of a a small area up near my jersey sleeve where I did not apply it as evenly.</li>
    <li> Makes my face skin oily, I don&#x27;t like it almost at all. Though, you might like it if your skin is less oily, since it lasts quite a while and feels comfortable on skin. Good for the price, though</li>
    <li> I spent this last summer hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, enduring the&lt;br /&gt;deserts of Southern California, the high altitude sun of the Sierras,&lt;br /&gt;and the winds and cold of Oregon and Washington. Zealios sun protection&lt;br /&gt;worked great in all conditions, but especially, it goes on easily with&lt;br /&gt;no greasy mess, lasts a long time, and keeps the harmful rays off. I&lt;br /&gt;prefer it to any other sunscreen product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, goes on like good lotion and is not white.  Excellent sun protection</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen.  It feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen and I really appreciate the fact that it is Paraben and PABA free.  Also, I have super sensitive skin and I have absolutely no problems with this product.  I live in New Mexico, which in addition to being the Land of Enchantment could also be nicknamed &amp;#34;The Land of the Blazing Sun&amp;#34;.  High altitude and approximately 320 days of sunshine per year means using a good sunscreen here is a must - especially for our all-day mountain bike and hiking excursions.  Zealios is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I love this oil free sunscreen- lightweight and very mild scent. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Works great , I don&#x27;t get a rash from the sun or the sunblock any more.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite sunscreen since I was introduced to it several years ago.  It is the only sunscreen that actually feels smooth, not chalky, on my skin.  Unlike like other products, when I perspire, it does not turn white and streak.  I also appreciate Zealios does not contain harmful chemicals.  It is effective in preventing sunburn.  In short, Zealios feels good, looks good and is safe.</li>
    <li> I actually love this sunscreen but sadly have had to stop buying it as it is the most expensive sunscreen on the market.  $15 for 88ml/3 oz.  Our family an easily go through one tube on a weekend.  It is a shame as the product is great but the price is not.</li>
    <li> Great for active lifestyles! I use this when I go for long bike rides. Since I don&#x27;t sweat it off, I don&#x27;t have to reapply, and I don&#x27;t get burned. Rad.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive and acne prone skin. Typically mineral sunscreen causes the least amount of problems for me. Not so much with this one unfortunately. I used it only a couple times but I immediately got a really horrible breakout, and it also caused my chest to break out really badly as well. I ended up throwing it away because it wasn&#x27;t something that I could deal with.</li>
    <li> My skin burns easily, so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years.  This product is outstanding.  I especially like the fact that it goes on smoothly without any greasy feel.  It holds up well with vigorous exercise and sweating.</li>
    <li> Not a pure zinc oxide sunscreen. Still has chemical sunscreen products in it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I have tried a zillion sunscreens and this one is amazing. I rarely write reviews but I felt compelled to write one because I am in love!</li>
    <li> After all day in the sun, my skin doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; feeling in the evening.  It is the best sun block I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried lots!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best.  Being an athlete and having an active lifestyle, it&#x27;s important that my sunblock is unaffected by sweat.  Somehow this stuff continues to be effective during the most intense workouts.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t run and goes on light.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen that isn&#x27;t greasy that I can use on both my face and body. Zealios is paba and oil free and it also doesn&#x27;t leave a chalky residue on the skin. My husband bikes to work so he needs a long lasting sunscreen that he won&#x27;t sweat off and Zealios works the best. I also use it to protect our our active 2 and 5 year old boys. They are very particular about what kind of sunscreen we use on them, and they especially hate it when sunscreen stings their eyes. My boys like Zealios because it goes on smooth and clear and it doesn&#x27;t burn their eyes when they wear it while playing or swimming. We love Zealios for out whole family!!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for non chemical sunblocks that work well.  This one is great.  It goes on easily is smooth &amp; clear.  Nice smell.</li>
    <li> yes, it hase good price, but please note that it will expire on AUG 2015</li>
    <li> Consistency is very good, spreads beautifully and does the job.</li>
    <li> We love Zealios! We live at the Jersey shore so my 3 very pale daughters are in the sun constantly between surfing, swimming, lacrosse, soccer, etc!  Zealios is the only zinc oxide based lotion that truly works in the water and it goes on so easily compared to other zinc based lotions.  My girls love it!  I highly recommend it to highly active people who love to be outdoors or in the water!</li>
    <li> I like the product but I feel it is a little greasy on my skin. Great Sunblock though.</li>
    <li> I have applied Zealios for skiing, high altitude mountain hiking and ocean/beach activities. I love that it provides both UVA/UVB protection, very water resistant and is Paraben and oil free. It feels wonderful applying it to my skin and wears well for many hours. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and i love it. From surfing to being outside all day for work, this sunscreen is awesome. I love that it is oil free and actually feels oil free going on. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Zealios is great stuff. It isn&#x27;t oily and have I have worn it playing sport, mostly rugby, many times and have never had it run into my eyes or really ever notice I was wearing Sunscreen at all. Definitely recommended at anytime but especially for sport.</li>
    <li> I am an elite cyclist and this is the perfect sunscreen for riding and racing. I used to hate sunscreen and often skipped it, but I will never skip again after buying this. Have repurchased many times and love the light, non-sticky formula that I can use for my body and face without getting breakouts. A+++++</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen ever. I have not been burned using it. I gave it to my niece and mother who are incredibly fair and they wore it in Hawaii snorkeling and swimming and neither got burnt either. Also it isn&#x27;t greasy so hands don&#x27;t feel gross after applying. A little goes a long way. Won&#x27;t use another sunscreen again.</li>
    <li> works like nothing else I have tried</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! It stands up to hours on the bicycle or hiking. It stays where you put it. Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes when sweating.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very different from any I have tried in the past.  It is odorless, rubs in thoroughly without leaving a greasy feeling to your skin, and protects for hours.  I use it on my face and arms whereas in the past with other sunscreens I have had to use two types.  It has the feel of a cosmetic grade sunscreen and the performance of an industrial grade sunscreen.  Impressive.</li>
    <li> Zealios sunscreen is an excellent product.  I wear sunscreen everyday and have tried all different brands in search of the best.  Zealios is by far the best sunscreen I have used. I like the consistency and feel on my skin.  My skin did not burn while in the sun nor did I experience the \\&quot;eye burn\\&quot; stinging that occurs with other sunscreens that run into my eyes when I perspire. Zealios sunscreen goes on smoothly and stays on.  It is PABA free and oil free, so no breakouts!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Zealios stays on and protects when I am paddling in salt water in Puget sound or hiking around mt rainier. I&#x27;ve gotten some as presents for my outdoor enthusiast friends. And it doesn&#x27;t smell like other sun protection products which is useful if you are in bear country in Karnak Alaska!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I use this on my 10 year old daughter during surf lessons and also when she is on the beach and at the pool.  We live on the beach in Los Angeles and it&#x27;s important to have great sun protection.</li>
    <li> I bicycle about 150 miles per week exposed to the sun and elements outside. I&#x27;m giving it five stars because it does work. A little bit goes a long ways and protects my skin all day even when sweating in the hot sun. I use this on my face, my arms and legs. Zealous provides protection all-day with one application. I never got a sunburn when using this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not oily, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and doesn&#x27;t have any of the nasty ingredients that nearly every other sunscreen has. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen, especially for kids.  Safe, non toxic ingredients.  Made in USA last time I looked.  Does not make the kids face white, blends in well.  Does not cause itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Worked great when we used in Play Del Carmen, Mexico, you can get burned there in no time. Lasted all day while playing volleyball and swimming in the ocean. Not greasy and absorbed fast.  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Finally, a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in hives after exposure to sun.  Went on clean, no greasy feeling, and it actually stopped the sunburn.  So glad I finally found a great sunscreen!  Even my husband used it, and he didn&#x27;t complain about it being &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.  No smell, works, great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> A wee bit pricey, but an excellent product.  Not greasy, smells pleasant, disappears when applied, didn&#x27;t get sunburnt at all.</li>
    <li> Our kiddo has very sensitive skin and has always broken out in thick leathery hives after having sun screen applied to his face and then going out in the sun.  (heat rash would usually show up later from clogged pores)  We&#x27;ve tried almost every brand of barrier sunscreen and this is the first one that didn&#x27;t do this.  We are thrilled with this product.  It feels nice and silky.  Disappears completely with no chalky residue.  We used it all week at Disney with no issues.  Stocking up on it to make sure we don&#x27;t run out this summer.</li>
    <li> stings when it gets into eyes (sweat)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he &amp;#34;hates wearing sunscreen&amp;#34;.  I read the reviews and hoped the product would live up to its reviews.  It did.  He&#x27;s actually willing to wear this sunscreen daily to work because he says he can&#x27;t feel or smell it.  He used it all day at the beach and it held up really well.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.  We&#x27;re already reordering it.</li>
    <li> The first zinc-based sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used that actually soaks in.  No residue : )</li>
    <li> My family (wife and  daughters) and I used Zealios on a 6 month trip around SE Asia.  We are all quite fair skinned and wife/daughters tend to react to many sunscreens too. Zealios was the best thing we used.  Set it and forget it.  I am bald and used this for multi-hour surf sessions broiling under equatorial sun.  It is thick, but non-greasy and does rub in and once it&#x27;s on there it is very effective.</li>
