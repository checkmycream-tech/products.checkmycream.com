      <li>:-)</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to use this palette!</li>
      <li>I have Italian/olive skin and the green works great on redness and the orange works GREAT on under eye circles</li>
      <li>Having 5 shades makes it easy to match to your skin tone</li>
      <li>THe creamy formula goes on smooth and is easy to blend with the other colors to get the best result.</li>
      <li>I have uneven skin tones and this product makes my skin as even and flawless as can be.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and lasts too.</li>
      <li>Looks professional and provides a nice variety of color for many looks.</li>
      <li>This is especially true if you only end up using one or two of the shades.  </li>
      <li>Got to me quick but the product is not of the quality of coverage I would expect from Forever Make-Up.</li>
      <li>It has many is different shades for most of your coverup needs.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite beauty tools to use because of the green tint in it which camoflages red undertones beautifully!</li>
      <li>The green is also great for the redness around the nose.</li>
      <li>The peach corrector works great under eyes, the green corrector is just right for combating redness.</li>
      <li>Its fine although I expected more.</li>
      <li>I bought this tried to use it many times using different techniques.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this item at Sophora, a beauty supply store over 6 years ago.</li>
      <li>i love the different shades offered.</li>
      <li>Every shade is creamy, smooth, extremely pigmented, and easy to blend.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Have no idea which color to use on certain areas of the face?</li>
      <li>I use a very slighly moist finger tip to spread it on.</li>
      <li>It kept giving me the cakey look and it was too much to deal with.</li>
      <li>Go to the pharmacy or grocery store and buy one for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I really like this concealer</li>
      <li>A little bit really goes a long way, so ultimately, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
      <li>The most orange shade is supposedly for the blueish purple dark circles, which I have.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my \\&quot;can&#x27;t live</li>
      <li>I just wish it had pink and a more yellow tone as well.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected, order was shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I love the green one it helps with red blemishes and red spots on your face.</li>
      <li>The only reason I give this product 4 stars is because you have to be real careful when applying it since its easy get a cakey look later on in the area.</li>
      <li>I suppose the other shades could be used as regular concealer, but I have other products that both match my skin and perform better.  </li>
      <li>Also I think is not a good idea to buy the palette because most likely you are not going to need all the shades.</li>

<li> It completely camouflages my dark circles, and people have told me it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
<li> The first one lasted forever, at least two years.  </li>
<li> I had to have some facial surgery which resulted in some pretty serious bruising.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve put all my other concealers aside and have been using this exclusively for several months.</li>
<li> Kinda dry, too.</li>
<li> You will still need to use foundation (I use loose mineral based powder) over it.  </li>
<li> it´s a little bit to oily and don´t last long</li>
<li> I only know how to use it because of the previously mentioned website.  </li>
<li> Its a little thick so you don&#x27;t need much of it.  </li>
<li> If you want to try it get it at Sephora.com or somewhere where you can return it because if it doesn&#x27;t work you do not want to be stuck with this when you spent $40.</li>
<li> Neither color performed as expected.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if their other products are like this, but I really do NOT like this product.</li>
<li> Also, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> The orange-y color is just a shade of beige (not salmon), and the green only turned my pink areas green (even with careful application and covering with foundation).  </li>
<li> , received the wrong pallet the first time.</li>
<li> I plan to purchase all the other palettes as well,</li>
<li> Otherwise, you have to experiment which of the other shades work for you.  </li>
<li> I hare really dark circles and have tried innumerable amounts of concealers before and none have worked.</li>
<li> When I use it under my eyes to cover dark circles I apply it over my eye cream,  </li>
<li> Also, the package arrived closed but not sealed, and the texture looked pebbled, as though water had condensed and dried inside.  </li>
<li> The green tint is for covering redness, the others are dark circles under the eye.  </li>
<li> A little goes a LOOOONNNGGG way.</li>
<li> I got it thinking I could use the green to cancel redness, and that maybe the orange-y color was a salmon shade to be used to correct under eye circles.  </li>
<li> Sometimes if my eye cream has dried  before I use the concealer</li>
<li> I still have a shiny nose after a few hours but that is what touch ups are for.</li>
<li> The green one does not cover redness.</li>
<li> Its a little bit too thick for my skin.</li>
<li> This palette really covered the worst of the bruises, and made it possible to actually face friends and family without being too scary.  </li>
<li> Also, the product is quite dry and difficult to apply.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re used to less expensive drug store products this is probably a step up,</li>
<li> I tried this one out finally and it creases, flakes, and makes my complexion look patchy and disgusting.</li>
<li> :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> …wish there was more product for the price. :( I would&#x27;ve given 4 cause of the price but I just can&#x27;t! Otherwise I am totally happy with this palette. I have Italian/olive skin and the green works great on redness and the orange works GREAT on under eye circles - conceal with orange then place your foundation over that; Apply concealer if needed. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> MUF makes great quality products, this concealer palette is no exception. The peach corrector works great under eyes, the green corrector is just right for combating redness. THe creamy formula goes on smooth and is easy to blend with the other colors to get the best result. I have tried it without face primer and with, but it blends a lot nicer on top of primer prepped skin.</li>
    <li> This product is a Very good blemish cover up. I use it under my foundation &amp; it covers up well. I love the green one it helps with red blemishes and red spots on your face. Its a little thick so you don&#x27;t need much of it.  I give this product 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d return this product if I could.  I got it thinking I could use the green to cancel redness, and that maybe the orange-y color was a salmon shade to be used to correct under eye circles.  Neither color performed as expected.  The orange-y color is just a shade of beige (not salmon), and the green only turned my pink areas green (even with careful application and covering with foundation).  Also, the package arrived closed but not sealed, and the texture looked pebbled, as though water had condensed and dried inside.  I suppose the other shades could be used as regular concealer, but I have other products that both match my skin and perform better.  If you&#x27;re used to less expensive drug store products this is probably a step up, but I think you can get higher quality products at similar if not better prices.  This is especially true if you only end up using one or two of the shades.  If nothing else, buy the product on Sephora so you can return if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product on a website about make up products for women over 40.  It does what it is supposed to do, conceals and provides an even skin tone.  You will still need to use foundation (I use loose mineral based powder) over it.  I only gave it 4 stars because it did not come with any instructions.  I only know how to use it because of the previously mentioned website.  The green tint is for covering redness, the others are dark circles under the eye.  The most orange shade is supposedly for the blueish purple dark circles, which I have.  Otherwise, you have to experiment which of the other shades work for you.  Also, the product is quite dry and difficult to apply.  I use a very slighly moist finger tip to spread it on. A little goes a long way.  So, again, it works great but there are no instructions and it is not the most user friently.  But, it does make an even skin tone and your make up will last longer during the day.  I still have a shiny nose after a few hours but that is what touch ups are for.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s one of my favorite products in my makeup drawer. I have uneven skin tones and this product makes my skin as even and flawless as can be.  It&#x27;s my \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without\\&quot; product.    Also, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This palette concealer I find is ideal for tanned skin tone, like mine.  The cream glides on smooth and gives wonderful coverage.  I am very pleased with this palette.  Thank you MUFE!</li>
    <li> This is my second palette of camouflage cream.  The first one lasted forever, at least two years.  It is an excellent product that you can mix to get the right color to match your skin. When I use it under my eyes to cover dark circles I apply it over my eye cream,  Sometimes if my eye cream has dried  before I use the concealer I use the tiniest dot of eye cream on my finger to moisten the concealer before applying to my under eyes. I use foundation to finish my make up regimen.</li>
    <li> I had to have some facial surgery which resulted in some pretty serious bruising.  This palette really covered the worst of the bruises, and made it possible to actually face friends and family without being too scary.  Yay!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, order was shipped fast. I&#x27;m excited to use this palette!</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer it is nice and compact. I just wish it had pink and a more yellow tone as well.</li>
    <li> Got to me quick but the product is not of the quality of coverage I would expect from Forever Make-Up.</li>
    <li> Have no idea which color to use on certain areas of the face?</li>
    <li> Its fine although I expected more. Its a little bit too thick for my skin. What I like bout it is a range of shades.</li>
    <li> :-) Came just as described! Condition new. ♥</li>
    <li> Love this coverup set. It has many is different shades for most of your coverup needs. The green is perfect for redness and the others are great alone or for blending. Goes on smooth and lasts too.</li>
    <li> The product is very good for covering blemishes and to cancel out redness. A little goes a LOOOONNNGGG way. The only reason I give this product 4 stars is because you have to be real careful when applying it since its easy get a cakey look later on in the area. Also I think is not a good idea to buy the palette because most likely you are not going to need all the shades. I only use 2 shades out of the 5.</li>
    <li> This palette might just be THE ONE for me. I hare really dark circles and have tried innumerable amounts of concealers before and none have worked. The orange one in this palette specifically is the winner for me. It completely camouflages my dark circles, and people have told me it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. The green is also great for the redness around the nose. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> it´s a little bit to oily and don´t last long</li>
    <li> I am a concealer buff and love to contour etc. this palette is awesome. It has coverage without caking or being greasy. Looks professional and provides a nice variety of color for many looks. I plan to purchase all the other palettes as well, great !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this tried to use it many times using different techniques. It kept giving me the cakey look and it was too much to deal with. If you want to try it get it at Sephora.com or somewhere where you can return it because if it doesn&#x27;t work you do not want to be stuck with this when you spent $40.</li>
    <li> Great product but I only use one of the colours.</li>
    <li> Greatest concealer I&#x27;ve used by far.:)</li>
    <li> Came on time, received a nice bonus gift and absolutely love the product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and have used its magic for some years - great deal and lifts years in minutes!</li>
    <li> i love the different shades offered. i start out with the darkest and end with the lightest. Great coverage and smooth consistency!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite concealer products. Every shade is creamy, smooth, extremely pigmented, and easy to blend. A little bit really goes a long way, so ultimately, it&#x27;s a great value. Having 5 shades makes it easy to match to your skin tone year-round. I&#x27;ve put all my other concealers aside and have been using this exclusively for several months. I&#x27;ve got nothing but good things to say about this.</li>
    <li> The green one does not cover redness. Kinda dry, too. Go to the pharmacy or grocery store and buy one for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Also, received the wrong pallet the first time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this concealer after using Mineralogie&#x27;s for about a month. I have combination skin and need a good full coverage concealer, which is what I thought this was. I tried this one out finally and it creases, flakes, and makes my complexion look patchy and disgusting. I don&#x27;t know if their other products are like this, but I really do NOT like this product.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this item at Sophora, a beauty supply store over 6 years ago. They never carried it again. This is one of my favorite beauty tools to use because of the green tint in it which camoflages red undertones beautifully! I did a search on Amazon to find it again and lo&#x27; and behold there it was! Thanks so much!</li>
