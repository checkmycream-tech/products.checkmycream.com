    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the best cream ever!</li>
    <li> By far, this is the best skin cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Other brands, even very expensive ones, always cause my skin to develop little white milia. Skinderma is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that does not. It has a great, clean smell... No perfumes...</li>
    <li> It was new &amp; had not been open. It is great!</li>

    <li> I have psoriasis all over and extremely dry skin on my face. After reading the positive reviews I read I purchased this product only to be highly disappointed! Save your money! It smelled and felt like I was using coco butter from cvs! Booooo this product sucks</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. Try three jars and nothing has changed. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this yet. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference and I feel like you have to use a lot of it to cover your entire face and neck.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this prodct!</li>
