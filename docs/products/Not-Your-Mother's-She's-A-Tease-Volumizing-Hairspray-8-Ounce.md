      <li>Amazing deal!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things from mouse to powder and then has been my best find no teasing need just spray and poof ur hair with ur fingers and spray all over to set.</li>
      <li>It smells so good and does have a very nice hold to it.</li>
      <li>but I think it just needs a good shake</li>

      <li>Smells good.</li>

      <li>The smell was a lot better!</li>
      <li>Holds a tease very well, smells delicious.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, decent hold, not sticky.</li>
      <li>What I like best, though, is that it isn&#x27;t sticky at all, and when the spray dries, my hair feels normal.  </li>
      <li>And now I love the scent it smells nice like apples.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>but I really love this product now.</li>
      <li>and you can forget about wearing perfume:)</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>It was an add on product but shipped for free!</li>
      <li>and I love having more volume.</li>
      <li>Oh my gosh I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>my hair looks even more amazing really curly bouncy voluminous curls!</li>
      <li>I was happy to try it since I love the Sea Salt Spray by the same brand.</li>
      <li>Light hold that lasts for an evening out</li>
      <li>would def recommend to anyone with flat hair looking for a great cheap lift without the hassel of teasing</li>
      <li>Smells good, works great, leaves hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff, it makes my hair more thicker and stays in place, even when it is humid out, thank youi</li>
      <li>Once I finish, I do a quick gently spray all over to set it, and it lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>If you use some on your roots it does an absolutely amazing job while keeping the smell light enough to not bother you or anyone else.</li>
      <li>and I definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting such excellent results.</li>
      <li>I have straight, fine hair this made it look like I have more hair than I really do.</li>
      <li>nozzle give a pretty powerful spray, so the best way to use it is in small spurts.</li>
      <li>But now 2 years later I completely am in love with this product!</li>
      <li>Gives me amazing big hair!</li>
      <li>you will CLEARLY see how much more volume you now have.</li>
      <li>truly will get volume with this product if you use it the right way.</li>
      <li>Great hairspray; creates volume with a little backcombing, just like the Pinterest posts stated!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of many of Not Your Mother&#x27;s products, including the sea salt spray and the dry shampoo,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it smells like nair to be honest but its not a good smell and its very strong and lasts throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It gives a little volume which is nice, but a more natural look</li>
      <li>Most companies say they do but these products definitely do!</li>
      <li>When I first sprayed it in my hair</li>
      <li>But this one really does!  </li>
      <li>but when I went back to buy more, there was none on the shelf.  </li>
      <li>I definitely love this hairspray and have purchased it multiple times</li>
      <li>It works really well!</li>
      <li>Has a medium hold, good if you don&#x27;t want your hair too crunchy or stiff.</li>
      <li>works pretty good as long as i spray it only on my roots and not my whole head</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally extremely straight and this spray will hold curls all day.</li>
      <li>very girly smelling and</li>
      <li>It was on 25 products that really work and it does</li>
      <li>My other hairspray works better for me for some reason.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this at a local &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, if you have super fine, limp hair, give this stuff a shot.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine, limp hair that just lays flat most of the time.  </li>
      <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
      <li>Nothing more or less than that.</li>
      <li>Shake the bottle gently, and lift sections of your hair with your fingers, gently spritzing the products directly onto the roots.</li>
      <li>but this is sooo worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>I have tried endless hairsprays to try and give my hair more volume, however most just seem to weigh my thin hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found this hairspray to be quite sticky and, even with a light hand, too heavy for my taste.</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
      <li>As one reviewer stated, lift your hair in small sections, give it a quick spray and your hair will appear much more thick and voluminous.  </li>
      <li>the big thing was the hold, my hair isn&#x27;t that hard for most hairsprays and this one just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I usually love not your mother products, this hairspray didn&#x27;t hold and smelled unappealing to me</li>

<li> I have very thin and flat hair and am pleased with this product.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell, and I&#x27;m generally not picky at all with scents.</li>
<li> I never liked using hairspray before, but now have a spray that will set a style in my limp, fine, hair.  </li>
<li> I can only speak for myself, but the scent is not at all offensive as some of the other reviews claim.</li>
<li> cuz it will make my hair dry and</li>
<li> I barely sprayed a little on my hair and could smell it for hours, plus it didn&#x27;t do anything to give volume to my hair.</li>
<li> I use both products - one to get the volume and the other for areas where it needs to stay put.</li>
<li> I usually shampoo every day, but when I don&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t feel built up the next day.  </li>
<li> product works extremely well.</li>
<li> This is really weird but the first time I bought this</li>
<li> Like this product, but can&#x27;t use it a lot in the summer due to the humidity affect on my hair.</li>
<li> It seems wet and slow to dry, set up.</li>
<li> So i shook the bottle and sprayed my hair upside down.</li>
<li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
<li> Totally worth it for me and not too expensive!</li>
<li> It is not very strong and does not hold curl, etc....would not recommend.</li>
<li> Sure the other reviewers hated the smell</li>
<li> Product was a little drying for my hair.  </li>
<li> As other reviewers mentioned, the smell is a bit off-putting, and unfortunately, the scent lingered in my hair for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I start on one side of my head and lift small sections, spray, release, and continue around my head.</li>
<li> The ones that say they do usually don&#x27;t on my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great hairspray; creates volume with a little backcombing, just like the Pinterest posts stated! I will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I have very thin and flat hair and am pleased with this product.  It does add a bit of volume; but, don&#x27;t expect a miracle either!  It does not work as a freeze hairspray.  For this, my pick is John Freda Moisture Barrier.  I use both products - one to get the volume and the other for areas where it needs to stay put. NYM Volumizing Hairspray will not make your hair feel sticky and does hold the volume without freezing it.</li>
    <li> I got this, well, two of these in sample boxes I subscribe to. while I don&#x27;t hate it, I did not find anything great about it. However i took off an extra star for the smell. I can&#x27;t stand the smell, and I&#x27;m generally not picky at all with scents. It smells... Off. Like they spilled an extra chemical in the batch when they were making it. I&#x27;ve had two bottles so its not a fluke. Also whenever I wear it, my bf asks me why I smell like nair (which he hates and which I don&#x27;t use because nair sucks). I don&#x27;t know if it smells like nair to be honest but its not a good smell and its very strong and lasts throughout the day. Therefore I would never repurchase.</li>
    <li> Light hold that lasts for an evening out</li>
    <li> Awesome price and great shipping. Not Your Mothers&#x27;s Products are the best hair products you can buy.</li>
    <li> I got this hair spray as a sample, and though I&#x27;ve not liked hair spray before, tried it.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I don&#x27;t find the smell offensive, (and I usually don&#x27;t like scents). What I like best, though, is that it isn&#x27;t sticky at all, and when the spray dries, my hair feels normal.  I usually shampoo every day, but when I don&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t feel built up the next day.  I never liked using hairspray before, but now have a spray that will set a style in my limp, fine, hair.  Yay!</li>
    <li> This is really weird but the first time I bought this I totally hated it I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it didn&#x27;t work for me. But now 2 years later I completely am in love with this product! I like to curl my hair and then while shaking my hair spray it in for a while all over my hair and then voile my hair looks even more amazing really curly bouncy voluminous curls! And now I love the scent it smells nice like apples. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula but I really love this product now.</li>
    <li> Like this product, but can&#x27;t use it a lot in the summer due to the humidity affect on my hair. Not the product&#x27;s fault. Not a fan of the smell of it but it works!</li>
    <li> I dont feel like this helped with volume for me at all. My other hairspray works better for me for some reason. Oh well :/</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great for people who don&#x27;t want to look like you use anything in your hair.  It gives a little volume which is nice, but a more natural look</li>
    <li> Smells good, works great, leaves hair soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I definitely love this hairspray and have purchased it multiple times</li>
    <li> Has a medium hold, good if you don&#x27;t want your hair too crunchy or stiff. Great smell! However I&#x27;m not sure how &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; it is.... I don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Best hold since aquanet. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Adds volume as advertised. Smells good. My hair is naturally extremely straight and this spray will hold curls all day.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is by far the best I have ever used. Some people complain about the smell but I loved it. I have difficulties with a lot of hairspray because my hair is thin and doesn&#x27;t like to stay all day but I hate feeling like my hair is stiff. It is definitely not meant for keeping your curls in place. Its a volumizing hairspray! If you use some on your roots it does an absolutely amazing job while keeping the smell light enough to not bother you or anyone else. Not your mother&#x27;s products are the only hair products I&#x27;ve found that actually work. Most companies say they do but these products definitely do! I have converted all my friends and will happily keep buying their products :)</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh I love this stuff. Want to kill my sister for introducing me to it. I used to buy Suave at $1 a can but this is sooo worth the extra money. Excellent hold and great scent.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive product that works as well as Aveda powder</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair and this is my go to spray. I&#x27;ve tried many things from mouse to powder and then has been my best find no teasing need just spray and poof ur hair with ur fingers and spray all over to set. Has great hold and lasts throught the day would def recommend to anyone with flat hair looking for a great cheap lift without the hassel of teasing</li>
    <li> Gives me amazing big hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily, has a good smell and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I usually love not your mother products, this hairspray didn&#x27;t hold and smelled unappealing to me (that&#x27;s just personal opinion though) the big thing was the hold, my hair isn&#x27;t that hard for most hairsprays and this one just didn&#x27;t work. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> this stuff is worthless. when used as directed, it does nothing for volume.  and it doesn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;hold\\&quot; to it so it doesn&#x27;t work as hairspray either.</li>
    <li> I just bought this hairspray at walmart. When I first sprayed it in my hair omg the smell was horrific. So i shook the bottle and sprayed my hair upside down. The smell was a lot better! very girly smelling and the volume it gave my hair was awesome. I have straight, fine hair this made it look like I have more hair than I really do. Sure the other reviewers hated the smell but I think it just needs a good shake and you can forget about wearing perfume:)</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, decent hold, not sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It smells so good and does have a very nice hold to it. I would recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I received this item as a sample. I was happy to try it since I love the Sea Salt Spray by the same brand. This one is awful! The smell is horrible. I barely sprayed a little on my hair and could smell it for hours, plus it didn&#x27;t do anything to give volume to my hair. Skip this one!!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, limp hair that just lays flat most of the time.  I&#x27;ve always been looking for a hairspray that creates volume.  The ones that say they do usually don&#x27;t on my hair.  But this one really does!  As one reviewer stated, lift your hair in small sections, give it a quick spray and your hair will appear much more thick and voluminous.  I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff on Amazon since they stopped carrying it at my local drugstore.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it!  I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about with the horrible smell.  It just smells like hairspray to me.  Anyway, if you have super fine, limp hair, give this stuff a shot.  Totally worth it for me and not too expensive!</li>
    <li> However it has a weird smell to it. It does hold well. I would purchase again. It was on 25 products that really work and it does</li>
    <li> I originally bought this at a local &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34;.  Like it a lot but when I went back to buy more, there was none on the shelf.  So....I thought lets go to &amp;#34;amazon.com&amp;#34;.  And voila!</li>
    <li> Perfect price perfect product! It was an add on product but shipped for free! It works really well! Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy!</li>
    <li> I found this hairspray to be quite sticky and, even with a light hand, too heavy for my taste. As other reviewers mentioned, the smell is a bit off-putting, and unfortunately, the scent lingered in my hair for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of many of Not Your Mother&#x27;s products, including the sea salt spray and the dry shampoo, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to skip this one.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal! Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I got this as a smaller-sized sample and I definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting such excellent results. I have very thin hair and I love having more volume. I tend to try and tease my hair, only to get it knotted and tangled and not at all voluminous. I have tried endless hairsprays to try and give my hair more volume, however most just seem to weigh my thin hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works extremely well. I can only speak for myself, but the scent is not at all offensive as some of the other reviews claim. It smells like hairspray. Nothing more or less than that. I had no complaints on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle give a pretty powerful spray, so the best way to use it is in small spurts. Shake the bottle gently, and lift sections of your hair with your fingers, gently spritzing the products directly onto the roots. Hold your hair upward and count to 10, then slowly release it. you will CLEARLY see how much more volume you now have. I start on one side of my head and lift small sections, spray, release, and continue around my head. Once I finish, I do a quick gently spray all over to set it, and it lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You truly will get volume with this product if you use it the right way. It is a low-cost alternative to more expensive brands, and works just as well. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> The hairspray has a peculiar scent that lingers all day in your hair.  I just can&#x27;t use it.  The scent seems not to bother some people.</li>
    <li> works pretty good as long as i spray it only on my roots and not my whole head cuz it will make my hair dry and all knotie</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this hairspray. It seems wet and slow to dry, set up. It is not very strong and does not hold curl, etc....would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, it makes my hair more thicker and stays in place, even when it is humid out, thank youi</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products. I use it regulary.</li>
    <li> Holds a tease very well, smells delicious.</li>
    <li> Vendor excellent.  Product was a little drying for my hair.  Vendor awesome.</li>
