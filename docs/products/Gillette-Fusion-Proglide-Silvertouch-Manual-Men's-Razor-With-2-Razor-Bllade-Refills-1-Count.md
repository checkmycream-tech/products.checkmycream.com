      <li>and I challenge anyone to give me a good reason not to recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>But it is good.</li>
      <li>It gives a good shave</li>
      <li>Gillette makes good razors, this is a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>He loved it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>, I think this is as good as it gets.</li>
      <li>works well and good price</li>
      <li>The flexball technology gets close to the skin and makes getting a great shave very easy.  </li>
      <li>Great close shave and very comfortable to use</li>
      <li>blades are really very good providing close as well as smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gace me great shaves, but once I started traveling weekly for work I wanted something a bit more one step.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to try this product and see if the already good Fusion could be improved upon.</li>
      <li>This is a good blade, Comfortable to use and the shaving is great.</li>
      <li>Love it !</li>
      <li>still doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the original mach 3 razor, but good overall...best with a good shaving cream and some sort of scrub beforehand</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable to hold, and I get a great shave out of</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice razor</li>
      <li>So for the Proglide, It really does an excellent job</li>
      <li>I have had a mach 3 for years which I liked, so when the fusion came out I thought why not try it.</li>
      <li>The blade cleans nicely, doesn&#x27;t rip my face apart and glides nicely across my face.  </li>
      <li>Nice shave with this one.</li>
      <li>I protects the blade and ravels nicely in a plastic baggie.</li>
      <li>I liked the razor quite a bit but decided I would try out the Dollar Shave club that my friends were all raving about.  </li>
      <li>I feel that Gillette has some of the best shaving gel on the market, so before using this product I had a sense it would be decent.  </li>
      <li>When Gillette released the Fusion line of razors many years ago I laughed saying that soon we would get 6 blades, 7 blades until it was a 20 blade razor that became comical.  </li>
      <li>The razor works very smoothly and gives nice results.  </li>
      <li>Notwithstanding, this is a nice razor and the holding tray included is quite ingenious.  </li>
      <li>I received this product from the brand, and it is by far the best razor on the market!I have used Gillette products before.</li>
      <li>It gives it a nice balance and good heft, making it more comfortable to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Both are great razors, but unless the design of the Fusion&#x27;s trimmer is a no compromise must-have for you, I&#x27;d go for the most economical one.</li>
      <li>This is a great quality razor if you are willing to spend the money for the cartridges.</li>
      <li>It does make for a very smooth shave and the razor handle itself</li>
      <li>Very smooth for sure.</li>
      <li>Have a towel handy and wipe your hand, and you will be fine</li>
      <li>I have used a Norelco, Shick and many Gillette models.  </li>
      <li>How many blades will we eventually find on a razor?</li>
      <li>My Husband &amp; Sons Love this Razor .</li>
      <li>If Gillette made a version of this sized more like their Custom Plus razor it would deserve 5 stars.</li>
      <li>None better than Fusion.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not so much better than its sister products.</li>
      <li>Thought after two or three blades, how much better could a razor shave.</li>
      <li>and it could not have worked out better.  </li>
      <li>I love this razor and</li>
      <li>the lubricating strip does almost nothing, like most razors.</li>
      <li>This is a brand that our family finds reliable and to be worthwhile when a cost/benefit comparison is computed.</li>
      <li>But with the proglide, it was nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I can guarantee your face will have that nice smooth feeling  of a close shave</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more of these.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any more smoothness either.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(Amazon insists I say one more word, so here it is: WORD)</li>
      <li>I have been stuck on three blade razors for, I guess, two decades now and always thought that more than three blades was just another ploy to get me to change.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes I feel that the shave should be closer as I get a more prominent stubble by the end of the day with these.</li>
      <li>Pick one up and start enjoying it.</li>
      <li>Love it for my legs.  </li>
      <li>A reasonable price to pay for a great feeling.</li>
      <li>great razor from Gillette comes highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This one is static, but that&#x27;s easier for me to control!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>is a good step in the right direction.</li>
      <li>I suppose thats true about most razor refills though!</li>
      <li>It gives a smooth shave, easy to change blades and has a nice balance.  </li>
      <li>This razor gives me about as good a shave as a 2 blade disposable for a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>After using it for the first time, I loved the way it felt shaving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a long time, always get the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to make many passes with this razor and it rinses off easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best razors in the world!  Nothing else to say...</li>
    <li> I am a long time fusion user, so was anxious to try out the new Silvertouch. It looks the same as the regular fusion and I believe the cartridges are interchangeable. As with other fusions, it gives a clean shave and feels extremely smooth on sensitive skin.  The Silvertouch not only gets the job done quickly, I got zero cuts during the shave and no irritation afterwards.  This is a great quality razor if you are willing to spend the money for the cartridges.</li>
    <li> As far as razors go this Gillette Fusion does all it needs. I&#x27;m generally the type to go out and get what ever&#x27;s on sale. After trying this one I may splurge and purchase it on a regular basis. It is a little more expensive than the average razor though.</li>
    <li> I have used other razors in the series. This is by far my favorite. I put it into my Power handle and it makes short work of my scalp and facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No knicks, no abrasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner!</li>
    <li> I love that this razor has single blade in the reverse position for tight spots (under the nostrils, for example).  The 5 razor head does provide a clean shave and generally does not require passing over the same spot to get a close shave.  I feel that the 5 razor head may be a bit of overkill because the size does make a precision difficult.  Fortunately the rear facing single blade allows for precision; however, maybe a smaller 2 or 3 blade could do the job without flipping it over (and may also keep replacement head costs down!).</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with a brush and double edge vintage Gillette razor.  It gace me great shaves, but once I started traveling weekly for work I wanted something a bit more one step.  The Gillette Fusion is an excellent razor; it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and gives me a nice close shave.  The replacements blades are a bit pricey, but it ends up being worth it.  I especially like the one single razor for trimming sideburns and my neck.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch produces an easy and sharp shave that knocks them down smooth without pulling on your face and feeling as if you will cut yourself.  The handle and head are well-balanced, and I actually prefer this one vs. my Mach 3 in terms of closeness of shave.</li>
    <li> I use a Norelco 3-Rotary electric, but have used the Fusion and Fusion-ProGlide since they can out to save time.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else does this, but for the sideburns-down sides of my face, I shave with the blade ... Completely dry.  I go with-the-grain, never have any razor burn or nicks and its just as close as I could want.  Then I touch-up under my nose and chin with the Norelco, and I&#x27;m ready to go to work in 2 minutes instead of 10.</li>
    <li> This review may help you decide between Gillette Fusion Proglide models and Schick Hydro 5 razors.  Both brands provide the same quality shave, so according to my husband, it all comes down to price and ergonomics (specifically, grip).  My husband prefers the proglide models and this one in particular immediately got a positive reaction on the lubricant strip. He usually complains of the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; regardless of the razor brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn&#x27;t try to grow anything on his face, so he says he has no use for the power models.  The Silvertouch handle feels heavier, but the grip slips more when wet and/or soapy, so it isn&#x27;t better than the standard Fusion Proglide.  The razor cartridge that comes with the Silvertouch did provide the least amount of irritation after shaving while the Schick Hydro 5 created the most irritation.  Also, the grip of the Schick Hydro 5 was the least intuitive of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband shaves 2 to 3 times per week using bar soap in lieu of shaving cream or gel.  The blades of Gillette models last 6 to 12 months before needing replaced whereas the Schick model blades need to be replaced much sooner (more pull, more irritation).  He credits it to the Gillette models Lubrastrip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to buy the proglide razors the most simply because I&#x27;ve used them myself and like how they shave.  The ironic part is while I think the proglide is the best razor designed for men, I find myself buying the schick hydro silk instead of gillette razors for women.</li>
    <li> Best razor out there. Would purchase again without hesitation.  I have a pretty tough beard and get about one week from each blade, which is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every iteration of the Fusion line and this razor is the best yet. However, it&#x27;s not so much better than its sister products. Depending on the price of the blades and, more importantly, the replacement cartridges, you might be better off waiting a bit for the prices to go down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blades shave well and didn&#x27;t give me any irritation. It&#x27;s a fast, clean, and comfortable shave. Gillette touts that these are the thinnest blades yet, but I don&#x27;t think you get a noticeably better shave than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference, in my opinion, is the handle. It&#x27;s heavier than handles in previous models -- even the ones that use a battery. It gives it a nice balance and good heft, making it more comfortable to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this style of razor (a lot of my friends swear by safety razors), I think this is as good as it gets. I suggest waiting a bit (see review date) for the price to go down.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite razors - very smooth, quick shave with no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is the refill prices - for this model, about $3.80 each when you buy an 8-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the precision trimmer, but find it a little short. It doesn&#x27;t work great on sideburns if you&#x27;ve let them grow out a little too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the lubricating strip does almost nothing, like most razors. But overall this is a great model if you don&#x27;t mind the refill prices.</li>
    <li> Razors have improved so much during my 75 years that I find it hard to remember how lousy they were back when.  The double edge blade that would always bring blood, either when changing the blade or shaving.  I have used a Norelco, Shick and many Gillette models.  the blade razors are for the most part excellent.  The electric takes too much time to shave (I don&#x27;t have that many years left).  So for the Proglide, It really does an excellent job, the pivot head wraps around the curves like a glove.  It gives a smooth shave, easy to change blades and has a nice balance.  I really like this thing!  Would I recommend to my friends?---I certainly would, especially those with a few wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor at a very good price.  Like most razors, the major cost is in the replacement blades however these seem to be about as reasonably priced as it gets.  The razor works very smoothly and gives nice results.  The blades seem to last for about a week given daily use.  I find the razor to be very similar to a previous model from Gillette, but the price has remained about the same and it seems like the design has just been revamped.  This is a brand that our family finds reliable and to be worthwhile when a cost/benefit comparison is computed.</li>
    <li> Keep it simple, Stupid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to the Mach 3 Turbo and stay there. These blades are not good.&lt;br /&gt;(Amazon insists I say one more word, so here it is: WORD)</li>
    <li> Not too bad, I&#x27;ll continue to use this. I don&#x27;t know how expensive the razor refills are, I&#x27;ll have to go check it out, even if it&#x27;s more expensive than others.. I&#x27;ll still use it.</li>
    <li> This razor shaves smooth, does not give any razor burn even when using dry. It is easy to hold, light weight and does the job. I personally like men&#x27;s razor to women&#x27;s razors as I think they do shave better. I really have no complaints about it, except my boyfriend thinks it is his because it is a men&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because there was a coupon for it and I&#x27;m never lacking in need for razors.  I personally need the edging blade on a razor as I have a beard that won&#x27;t stay trim without a daily edging.  I liked the razor quite a bit but decided I would try out the Dollar Shave club that my friends were all raving about.  I picked up the top tier that was similar to the Fusion Proglide in features and tried to live with them for 2 weeks.  I hate them.  They tear up my face and the &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; of them feels off.  I decided to switch back to my fusion that was lying around and I instantly decided it&#x27;s the only razor i&#x27;m buying for now on.  Forget trying others.  The fusion just works and I don&#x27;t end up with a bloody face / neck that isn&#x27;t even well shaved.</li>
    <li> How many blades will we eventually find on a razor? :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thought this would be extreme but I have to say the razor is different, easy to use, and really effective. Why are all the blades so darn costly though?</li>
    <li> Thank you very much Amazon for your help with this Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With 2 Razor Bllade...</li>
    <li> I wanted to get an electronic razor, but during this time, I was on a budget. My boyfriend, really likes this and said it was a lot better, than what he had. He gave it a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This razor truly does deliver a smooth, close shave and is great for sensitive skin.  I know it&#x27;s available locally, but Amazon&#x27;s price is comparable and you just can&#x27;t beat the home delivery.</li>
    <li> great shaver! I am a woman but i love this shaver and will not go back to another razor. highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Shaves close smooth for 5 shaves then you can use it for 10 shaves without the super smooth feel but it shaves fine. The cost of blades makes it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: After wiping the blade, hang it upside down in a glass with any cheap oil in it for 10 sec. swirling it a few times. Remove and shake excess oil off the blade. The blade lasts twice as long. I keep the oil in the glass for several weeks before changing it.</li>
    <li> I like these fusion blades and this handle has some heft to it - makes it feel substantial in your and but not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the Fusion handles that vibrate, but they seem to irritate my face with the same blades.</li>
    <li> With a brand new sharp Schick Quattro Razor I nearly always cut myself and there is blood, it gets better after while as it gets duller. With these blades I didn&#x27;t cut anything and shave was good, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same areas second time.</li>
    <li> I KNOW that these razors are sold at a 500% mark-up:  however,  the price is what it is.  The product is perfect.  These are the only razors that do NOT leave my face looking like hamburger after a shave.  The shave is smooth and only requires one stroke:  none of this &amp;#34;up and down&amp;#34; and over the same area again and again.  These razors are worth what you pay for, especially for those with acne prone or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have had a mach 3 for years which I liked, so when the fusion came out I thought why not try it. It is the Worst razor I have ever used. It literally feels like shaving with an angle grinder. It doesn&#x27;t matter what blades I use. I have tried to like this razor but it just rips up my face. Additionally, the replacement blades just aren&#x27;t worth the $ they are being sold for. I suppose thats true about most razor refills though! Anyway, just my experience.</li>
    <li> I thought 3 blades would be enough for a razor and 5 would be overkill. I imagined I&#x27;d slice a chunk of my chin off or something, I was wrong. This razor cuts so smooth. It cuts down the time it takes to shave. I don&#x27;t have to make many passes with this razor and it rinses off easily. It looks pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a long time, always get the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just buy this from Target or another store but since I have Prime I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for me stating to please read is to let people know my kit did NOT come with the 2 free cartridge as advertised. I only received one cartridge and the razor itself. I&#x27;m not bent but just letting people know it doesn&#x27;t come with two additional blade cartridge.</li>
    <li> used for 2 weeks now, this Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor are not so smooth as expected, might try another model next time.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this razor is good on his sensitive skin. I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Love it for my legs.  It is a little pricey but it does a great job so I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my 5 yr old gilette fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say apart from this is the best razor I have used. The blades last a good month and shaving is far easier than with the cheaper models.</li>
    <li> A little information about me. I have sensitive skin.  I am prone to get razor bumps if I don&#x27;t shave at least every four days or if the razor is super sharp.  My test for any razor. The blades have to give me a smooth bumpless shave after at least one week. I normally shave every week day.  The blades have last last from Tuesday through the following Monday.  So far, the Gillette Fusion Proglide past with flying colors. I have been using the razor for the two weeks and the Fusion Proglide is going strong. Compared with the Shick hydra Five which only lasts one week for me, the Proglide is good value although it has the highest price for replacement blades they last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Gillette Proglide because at the end of the day, a smooth close shave is all I ask from any razor.</li>
    <li> This is a good blade, Comfortable to use and the shaving is great. my only con is that the Blade dulling quickly. I don&#x27;t know if Gillette are doing this on purpose but one would expect that a razor that is not cheep will last longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette Fusions for several years now. I really like the contour and feel of the handle. The blades themselves are the best I have used, which is why I stay with the Fusion. I do and will continue to recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
    <li> Yeah !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;Not the new, fancy, pivoting versions.  This one is static, but that&#x27;s easier for me to control!&lt;br /&gt;What I really wanted was a good case to travel with and I have yet to find one, but the plastic tray works pretty well. I protects the blade and ravels nicely in a plastic baggie.</li>
    <li> 5/28/14  Purchased this for my fiance a couple of months ago and he just loves it....He was in need of a new razor and we looked at allot of them, but nothing excited him.  I went online and did some research and came across the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Manual Men&#x27;s Razor and purchased it via Amazon and it could not have worked out better.  My fiance highly recommends it and would give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> It was alright because ive tried a lot of 5 blade razors but 5 blades doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave and barely even trims my facial hair. But the gillette fusion proglide was the best one</li>
    <li> best razor i&#x27;v e ever used</li>
    <li> I received this product from Gillette and have now used the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor for a couple of weeks, shaving every other day.  The blade is still sharp and gives me a great shave without any skin irritation.  I have sensitive skin and no matter what products I use, I always seem to have red bumps after I shave.  But I haven&#x27;t with this razor.  The flexball technology gets close to the skin and makes getting a great shave very easy.  A great product all the way around.</li>
    <li> Thought after two or three blades, how much better could a razor shave. I love this razor and it it gives the best, closest shave I have ever seen. I&#x27;ll be getting more of these.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; from the regular Fusion blade, and this does the job, but I feel like my legs are drier with the proglide than with the regular fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m torn because I like it, but I&#x27;m also worried that maybe I&#x27;m stripping some oils from my legs by using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I bought 2 of these Razors and my husband loves his!</li>
    <li> ...but not anymore.  I have been stuck on three blade razors for, I guess, two decades now and always thought that more than three blades was just another ploy to get me to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert.  The five blades require fewer return strokes and have noticed much less razor rash afterwords.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Smooth and delivers a clean shave time and time again. I&#x27;m a loyal user of Gillette and have been since this mug could grow some peach fuzz. Gillette and I have seen many girlfriends, and he always helps me look like a 15-year old who has baby-butt skin. Girls like the soft face, but not the face of a 15-year old. Show the girls you can grow a beard first, then shave with this razor - then let her touch your face and she&#x27;ll be totally sold on you; women loveee soft skin yo.</li>
    <li> still doesn&#x27;t seem as good as the original mach 3 razor, but good overall...best with a good shaving cream and some sort of scrub beforehand</li>
    <li> My Hubby says the Silvertouch glides so smooth on his face. He says it&#x27;s very smooth compared to other razors. If you have sensitive skin, this is the razor for you!!</li>
    <li> works well and good price</li>
    <li> Love it ! a shave so smooth. doesn&#x27;t pull like other razors. but! its much more expensive. I thought it might come with a razor handle with blade and 2 replacements. but sadly it came with two blades total. Guess im addicted to a smooth shave though, so ill buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this razor.</li>
    <li> the proglide is most comfortable razor on the market for me.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried all the competitors but i keep coming back.&lt;br /&gt;nothing else is as smooth and it gives little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;get it!</li>
    <li> Received on time.  Not much different.  But it is good.Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using the ORIGINAL Gillette Fusion for years. After deciding to try a new razor, I ordered the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch. The silvertouch version is the same as the other Proglides except this one is silver. After using it for the first time, I loved the way it felt shaving. With the original, I felt some tug and pulling sometimes. But with the proglide, it was nice and smooth. Overall I am satisfy with this product and I RECOMMEND THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A RAZOR.</li>
    <li> I just replaced my 2-3 year old model, and it had the same blade from day one!  yes, I said day one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was actually becoming a joke, how long the original one was lasting.  gillette was losing money on me, since it lasted so long.  it stayed sharp enough all that time, to handle me using it 1-3 times a week, alternating with an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably could have used it longer, but decided to retire it.  I am curious to see if these last as long.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed.  Much better than expected for a hand held razor.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a great shave. The only issue is when the handle gets soap or shave cream on it, it is very difficult to hold and is very slippery and might fall from your hand.</li>
    <li> Bought with Amazon coupon, ended up paying $9 for it. Considering I was paying $15 for a single Mach3 Razor overseas.  I get a close clean shave every time I use it. It&#x27;s prob the best razor money can buy now.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  He says it provides a nice smooth shave and that he doesn&#x27;t expect anything less from Gillette.  He indicates that he would score it a five but the refill blades are pretty expensive.  Bearing that one reservation in mind, we do recommend this item for purchase.</li>
    <li> My son used this razor, so here is what he said about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor is above average. It stays extremely sharp through many shaves. It allows a very close shave without discomfort; the only drawback I would cite is that the handle tends to get very slightly slippery when wet, which opens the possibility of slipping while shaving. This has only happened once, but is a small concern. All in all a very good product, and probably the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have used Fusion products for several years and was curious to know if the latest version were better. It isn&#x27;t and that is a compliment to Gillette&#x27;s quality control. I requested this version and tested it during a long weekend trip. No surprises. None better than Fusion.</li>
    <li> This product stinks. It does not shave very close. I&#x27;m not happy with it.  I will not buy another Gillette product.</li>
    <li> This delivers the smoothest and closest shave in my 40+ years of navigating a razor around beard and other facial features. But it is large and somewhat unwieldy. If Gillette made a version of this sized more like their Custom Plus razor it would deserve 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My Husband &amp; Sons Love this Razor . They will not use anything else . They say it is the only razor that will not cut them .</li>
    <li> This razer is awesome, love the metal/aluminum finish. Also great how it comes with an extra head. Found it for cheaper at my local walmart after purchasing, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> Great blades; the price gets to me though. Still, no nicks almost ever.  (I think the main time that I get nicked is when I am not paying attention to the blade on the back).  Sometimes I feel that the shave should be closer as I get a more prominent stubble by the end of the day with these.</li>
    <li> I am definitely the target market for this product. My skin is extremely sensitive and I frequently have severe irritation if I don&#x27;t use the right blade or shaving cream. I was thrilled to try this product and see if the already good Fusion could be improved upon. I am very happy to report this is a good step in the right direction. The shaving experience for me has involved considerably less irritation. Is there a trade-off?  Yes. I found that blade life is reduced and the lubrication strip doesn&#x27;t last all that long. Given the replacement costs of the cartridges, I am hoping that Gillette can extend the life of the product a bit. However, if you are plagued with skin irritation, as I am, you will find this to be helpful.</li>
    <li> Smooth...  The handle feels snug and pleasantly heavy in hand, changing blades is a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get three shaves out or each blade, sometimes four.  The first is a joy, the second excellent, and the third decides whether to use it once more.  Once a blade feels a little scratchy, I replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks complain about price, but I look at it this way: I shave every other day, so a blade lasts me a week, an 8-blade package two months.  A reasonable price to pay for a great feeling.</li>
    <li> I have long used the Gillette Fusion razor and this is obviously supposed to be better. I agree that it is, but I didn&#x27;t really have any problems with the Fusion razor and buying replacement blades is cheaper than with this Proglide version. It does make for a very smooth shave and the razor handle itself does seem of better quality, but I don&#x27;t see a huge variation between this an the non-Proglide razor. Certainly a great razor and one I&#x27;ll continue to use, but when it comes down to ordering replacement cartridges, I&#x27;ll probably go with whichever is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Gillette makes good razors, this is a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used their products from the old Blue 2, to the mach 3 (still my favorite) and even their new pro-fusion 5 blade monstrosity with battery-operated ultrasonic buzzing (this sits in my drawer after a month of use).  I think just like the last pro-fusion blade I purchased, Gillette is trying too hard with the flexball razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep trying to imagine when I&#x27;m shaving, how having lateral movement in the razor head would ever come into play and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me;  after years and years of shaving I know that any lateral movement of the razor typically means razor burn and or cuts.  I have been conditioned to know that any razor rotation &#x3D; pain and suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability of this razor to overcome that might be great for some, but I am a creature of habit and that movement while shaving will forever be a no-no to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the razor has the same great close shave, and smoothing / soothing gel on the blade that I&#x27;ve come to appreciate from Gillette.  The handle is comfortable to hold, and I get a great shave out of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the gimmick is lost on me and I will be switching back to the mach 3 after this blade is toast, since those razors still give me a great shave and are 50% of the cost of the pro-glide cartridges.</li>
    <li> I received this product from the brand, and it is by far the best razor on the market!I have used Gillette products before. This was well thought out. After shaving with the Gillette Fusion Proglide, my skin remained smooth, no bumps...I get razor burn quite often with other razors, but this time my skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. This is an excellent shaver. Gillette has outdone itself this time. I am sure they will come up with something else in the near future with the development of technology.  I know that this is all about my experience, I could not help but sharing this with my closest friend and family members. One of my childhood friends had for years used electric shaver, after sharing my experience with him, he went and purchased one despite his skepticism. I even offered to give his money back if he was not satisfied with it. He loved it!&lt;br /&gt;This razor has sidelined all previous razors with its cosmetic, smoothness, handling, comfort and contour. Shaving is quicker for me now than ever before. The pivot, oh my..., makes such a huge difference. It offers such great contour, and glides so smoothly over the skin. It does not need any improvement. Pick one up and start enjoying it. The Gillette Fusion Proglide, in my view, is the Maybach of Gillette products, and all razors. Excellent! Molto Bene Gillette!</li>
    <li> I received the product from Gillette and was very happy. Great close shave and very comfortable to use</li>
    <li> the razor is good but the handle needs more grip when it gets wet its very slick and hold on when wet. the blade gives a close shave its just the handl that needs improvement.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I&#x27;ve bought Gillette Mach 3 Turbo before this razor, and there is no comparison as to quality and the quality of the shave. i bought this for my mentally challenged cousin who i shave on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stayed away from going past the triple blade until now. I tried a similiar 5 blade product a few years ago when they first came out and cut my jaw and neck to shreds. That did not happen with this razor. Gillette got it right and the extra blades really do help get all the hair on the first run, cutting back on blade passes that can cause irritation. The gel strip is very helpful. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s literally pro glide. I have been using it for a few weeks now and its the best razor I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was wrong, thinking it might be not as good as it is mentioned in the ads.&lt;br /&gt;Five blades are really very good providing close as well as smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product</li>
    <li> Use as a back up to my Braun series 7, great razor with no irritation,very smooth and sharp. The handle has a little weight to it.</li>
    <li> Nice shave with this one. Very smooth for sure. It will be hard to top this one, but I bet they are working on that already.</li>
    <li> Great Razor for a good Shave.</li>
    <li> I used to use 2 blade disposables.  This razor gives me about as good a shave as a 2 blade disposable for a much higher price.  It does not shave as well as the fusion power razor nor as well as the Schick Hydro 5 disposable.  Save your money</li>
    <li> I tried this razor, and yes it does shave close. Yes, it gives a smooth shave. The issue is the cost of the blades. The replacement blades are right at $4 a blade. I am simply not going to spend $4 per blade for razor blades. Remington has a five blade razor, and the blades come in at $1.65 per cartridge, well under half what the Gillette Fusion blades cost. I have been exceptionally pleased with the Remington razor, and at half the cost on blades, I will stick with that one. I find the quality of the shave to be equivalent between the two razors. (Remington King of Shaves Azor 5 Blade Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with 3 Cartridges)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to go back to a 2-bladed razor after using this 5-bladed Gillette Fusion razor. As you might expect, you get a very smooth and close shave - much more so than ant other razor I&#x27;ve used, even including fancy electric shavers. The head has a very nice pivot, and the handle is very nicely designed. The whole razor has some heft to it, and that makes it nice to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two cartridges which, if kept clean and dry, should probably last a while. I very much like and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this razor at a steal. two cartridges and a $3 coupon. i couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. ive been using proglide for almost 2 years and have not had a problem.</li>
    <li> This razor gives you a smooth shave ... let&#x27;s face it, that&#x27;s the least that you would expect from your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is easy to hold and, unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find that&#x27;s too slippery when soapy or wet.  The handle is slim, as is the snap-in protective base.  My prior razor had a snap-i base which was quite large which made it take up a big chunk of my toiletry case when traveling.</li>
    <li> When Gillette released the Fusion line of razors many years ago I laughed saying that soon we would get 6 blades, 7 blades until it was a 20 blade razor that became comical.  Now many years later we still have 5 bladed razors with slight improvements, this time to the handle itself.  For those that haven&#x27;t used the Fusion line of razors you are getting a less than stellar shave and you owe it to yourself to test this out asap.  The only problem with using a Fusion razor is you won&#x27;t want to go back!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors are worth every penny and I challenge anyone to give me a good reason not to recommend this product.  Top notch shaving by the best shaving company in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch 1 Razor 2 Cartridges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice razor but I do not see a significant upgrade from my Fusion power.  I know it is the Fusion Proglide which seems to indicate it is an upgrade but frankly I just didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  It gives a good shave but I didn&#x27;t find less pull than my Fusion Power.  I didn&#x27;t see any more smoothness either.  All in all it is a fine razor but I don&#x27;t see it as an upgrade from the Fusion Power.  Perhaps from a plain Fusion it is an upgrade.</li>
    <li> this is just the best razor ever.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, I&#x27;m still on the same blade for over 1 week now, and it still shaves smooth and pain free on the same blade, no nicks or cuts either!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the replaccement blades are expensive/costly (so I always look for money saving coupon if I can fnd one)&lt;br /&gt;This great razor from Gillette comes highly recommended!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no question, the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch provides a close shave. I like the weight of the handle, and the built-in trimmer is fantastic for detail work around the sideburns and nose. That said, I recently tried the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable, and I think it trumps the Fusion Proglide by one star. The Hydro 5 lubrication resulted in a smoother, effortless shave. I think it&#x27;s the most comfortable razor I&#x27;ve used, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken, it&#x27;s cheaper than the Fusion Proglide. While the Hydro 5 does have a built-in trimmer (a pleasant surprise for a disposable), the Fusion Proglide&#x27;s beats it with regard to ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are great razors, but unless the design of the Fusion&#x27;s trimmer is a no compromise must-have for you, I&#x27;d go for the most economical one. On that point, I believe the Shick Hydro 5 Disposable wins.</li>
    <li> The fusion blades are great I get a close shave every time with little to no irritation. The handles are barely mediocre. They are metal, with rubbery grips and a plastic blade holder. I have to replace the handle at least twice a year. Either the rubber grips disintegrate or the plastic blade connector breaks. I&#x27;ve tried the fancier handles available on Amazon rom Art of Shaving, which is owned by Gilette. No better and much more money. I keep using these because there is no better option.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave.  This razor will give you a smooth daily shave!  I can guarantee your face will have that nice smooth feeling  of a close shave and you&#x27;ll get through the day without the afternoon \\&quot;shade\\&quot; that comes up, which is especially bad for guys who have an afternoon DI inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the handle gets slippery if your hands are really wet or you have shaving cream/soap on them.  It must be a mix with the plastic handle and soap &amp; water.  And I don&#x27;t know what can be don as they already have grooves built in.  Have a towel handy and wipe your hand, and you will be fine (that&#x27;s what I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this razor is a winner!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product specifically to help me with chronic razor bumps caused from everday shaving. Definitely di dnot elminate my issues with razor bumps, but the product does give a good shave.</li>
    <li> Ah the world of men&#x27;s disposable razors, such a ho-hum realm.  I have purchased dollar store razors and top shelf razors with truly wonderful and hideous results from both the former and latter. Therefore just how well does this razor by Gillette measure up?  First and foremost I feel that Gillette has some of the best shaving gel on the market, so before using this product I had a sense it would be decent.  After using it now for about two weeks I can safely say that this product is better than decent, actually it is quite nice.  Usually a lousy disposable razor lasts me about four uses and rips my face apart.  A great disposable razor usually lasts me about six to ten times before I change the blade or throw it away and it doesn&#x27;t murder my face.  This razor came with one replacement blade and I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  Actually after two weeks I am about to use it.  I usually shave every other day, so this would land my use of this razor about seven times I believe.  The blade cleans nicely, doesn&#x27;t rip my face apart and glides nicely across my face.  The handle of the razor itself could have a bit more of an angle to it because it is a bit ergonomically awkward.  Notwithstanding, this is a nice razor and the holding tray included is quite ingenious.  I could see myself actually buying replacement blades once the ones I have become useless.</li>
