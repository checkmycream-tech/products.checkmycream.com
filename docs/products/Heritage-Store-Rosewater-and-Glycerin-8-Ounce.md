<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product, keep producing this one!</li>
    <li> Great to refresh dry skin- doesn&#x27;t mess up makeup!</li>
    <li> Love it. It moisturizers the face while making it feel fresh and clean. I also put it in my hair.</li>
    <li> I just started to use the Rose water as a moisturizer after I clean my face in the morning and besides the wonderful smell I will have to wait a bit before seeing the results of extended use.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. i have only used for a few days, but have noticed that it keeps my face hydrated.</li>
    <li> Oh so wonderful! It&#x27;s healthy and clean gets a 0 on the think dirty cosmetic app!</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and just didn&#x27;t get the appeal, so I stopped using it. Yesterday after showering, I wanted to moisturize but it was very hot and dry here and my usual moisturizers would not have been ideal. (I whip shea butter with oils to make a body butter) So, on impulse, I sprayed this on and then used a lavender lotion over the top. I absolutely LOVED the scent! And today, even though it&#x27;s still very dry and I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, my skin is still moisturized. I will continue to use and will buy again. Very happy!</li>
    <li> A good natural hand spray, but it doesn&#x27;t moisture very well.</li>
    <li> One of my coworkers liked this product so much that recommended it to other three coworkers, I had to buy 4 more for them.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin and often have terrible eczema outbreaks. This is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that works so well at keeping my skin from getting dry and flaky. I&#x27;ve tired everything from over priced lotion, to coconut oil, to petroleum jelly, and this is just the best, it creates an awesome protective layer on your skin. Granted, it&#x27;s really just the vegetable glycerin that is so awesome, and you could just buy that, but this stuff is really nice and comes in other scents as well. Also, the atomizer makes it really easy to apply this all over your body; I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> i love rose water.  this brand is great.  i will most definitely be ordering another one when this one is empty.</li>
    <li> I stopped using lotion for my face and have been using this instead. I always wore lotion on my face before and this works just as good as lotion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference on my face..it smells nice but it does not give any improvement ..what a disapointment.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin and It helps my skin stay moisturize  and it helps to glow....love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how well it moisturizes giving the fact that it&#x27;s just &#x27;water&#x27;. I have an oily-combo skin and I can use it in place of both serum and moisturizer in a lazy day and it does a great job in keeping my face hydrated all day in the dry heat of Tucson. I&#x27;m not a fan of rosy scent but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It goes away after a few seconds anyway. Love!</li>
    <li> I use it as a face lotion daily, leave in conditioner for my hair and just when I want to look glossy and fresh. I love it and will repurchase. It smells really good.</li>
    <li> I refresh my face with this every night before bed.  It feels and smells terrific.</li>
    <li> I use this as a toner either in the morning or night. I love the smell and also it makes my skin soft and it bales my skin to absorb my lotions.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product as a curl refreshing mist.  Leaves my 2nd/3rd day curls feeling refreshed, soft, bouncy and it smell delicately pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, type 2C swavy/curly hair, and I was shopping around for a moisturizing refreshing curl spray and I had this item at home and when I tried it on my hair to see if it would refresh my curls, the outcome was truly amazing!!  After spritzing my hair with this water, I &amp;#34;scrunched&amp;#34; my hair and applied a little bit of leave it conditioner with a little bit of coconut oil as my finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the one with glycerin in it because curly hair craves moisture and glycerin is a humectant which attracts water from the environment  increasing moisture to the hair and or skin. Another aspect of glycerin’s benefit is that it is a skin-identical ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin. In that respect it is one of the many substances in skin that help maintain the outer barrier and prevent dryness or scaling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product as a curl refresher.  It has become a staple in my curly hair arsenal.</li>
    <li> enjoy using it and so nice smell</li>
    <li> I use it with Bragg Apple Cider for my face.</li>
    <li> Best quality Rose Water out there. Put in Mask, Use it as Toner, Hydrate your hair. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I use this every day to set my make up. Great fragrance and softening properties of the rose water and glycerin. Can also be used as a light spray moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This simple toner works great to hydrate my skin, particularly when the air is dry and cold.  And the floral rose scent smells nice and light.</li>
    <li> Smells good; I actually liked the OZ toner better; I bought this one just for spritzing during the day, but wound up going back to the OZ, it was a bit more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> VERY hydrating!! I have keratosis on my arms and oils are too strong but this is just right. The only down side is I have very sensitive skin and it irritated slightly the very first time I used it. I learned quickly to mist it on my skin and let it dry and not apply too much. the smell also took a little getting used to for me but I&#x27;m not accustomed to wearing perfumes or anything like that. I&#x27;m getting used to it and I LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> My favorite face/body tonic/refresher. The rose scent is so light that even my husband uses it on his face.</li>
    <li> I use this as a natural toner, makeup setting spray, stress and skin-irritant relief and more. Great price for its ability to hydrate and balance the skin-make sure to get the one with glycerin for added hydration benefits.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin incredibly hydrated and dewy. Smells like roses too. Great quality product for the price. I wasted my money on the Mario Badescu rose water and herbs spray and I read the ingredients... No rose water or herbs! Just artificial scents and aloe... Wtf? Anywho, this product is awesome. I use it to add hydration to my skin or to set my makeup. Love this.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.  I spritz it on my face before putting on my moisturizer and as a finishing spray when I&#x27;m done with my makeup.  The glycerine adds a tiny bit of moisture and the rose smells absolutely heavenly.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not even sure why I bought this. I&#x27;m not even that big a fan of the rose scent. It&#x27;s nice, but not my favorite. I blame my Amazon Prime for my random purchases—free 2-day shipping and all of a sudden it&#x27;s like I have a shopping mall at my fingertips in bed at 2am when I should be sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have been using this as a toner after I wash my face and to set my makeup. I really like how refreshing it feels on the skin. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how much I should put on so as a toner I sort of just spray all over until my face feels slightly damp, which is usually like 6-7 sprays (not much comes out per spray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s important to mention that I generally break out with at least one or two blemishes right before my time of the month, but not this month. I haven&#x27;t changed anything in my facial routine except for this stuff. I have also noticed my pores are less visible, and my complexion looks healthier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically glorified water that smells nice on your skin for a minute before the scent evaporates. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel any different or hydrated either. I should have known from reading the description about &amp;#34;vortexed and magnetized&amp;#34; water that this product is useless. I regret this impulse purchase.</li>
    <li> Addicted to the spray! Love the smell love and how it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. Rose water also helps with red or ruddy skin tones; it&#x27;s super soothing. I use morning and night.</li>
    <li> So far its been about a week and i noticed the rose smell is strong at first but then it goes away. I use it as a toner and love to refresh my face. It also moisturizes my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very fine mist and pleasant scent, very refreshing. Use to set makeup &amp; help moisturize skin.</li>
    <li> This is great!  I love how it sprays lightly but covers well.  I had a mild sunburn and it felt nice and soothing!  Will buy this product from this supplier again!</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product if you have dry skin. After I wash my face, I spray it and let it soak in. I then add my moisturizer and let me tell you....... My skin feels amazing after! It&#x27;s much more softer and I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s gotten much clearer. I must say, it did cause my skin to act up in the beginning but I have sensitive skin so I just had to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Great as a makeup setting spray, as a toner, or a skin soothing spray.</li>
    <li> These older beauty treatments can&#x27;t be matched let-alone beat. I am older and I bet you could never guess my real age.  This rose water has been used by my mother, grandmother and all 3 of my own daughters. My skin feels soft and silky and the rose water blends and sweet ends my own natural fragrance. I dip my brushes in it and it enhances my shiny blond hair. Dean, my husband for the last 28 years, has never once not nestled his lips and face in my heck and hair. My ROSE WATER and I pass the test of time. Time does tell. Love to all.  Mawolf</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Be prepared to pay around $10 for it. Amazon used to offer it via prime and subscribe and save and wish they&#x27;d do it again for the savings. If you like the scent of roses, you&#x27;ll most likely enjoy this refreshing product.</li>
    <li> Great product and very affordable.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell and results of this product. I have adult acne that is agitated by my favorite hair product. I&#x27;ve been spraying this on my face morning and night, letting it set for several minutes, and then wiping my face with which hazel. I&#x27;ve replace my acne wash once a day with this routine. My skin is improving quit a bit and I&#x27;m really happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the shipping of this product. They waited a really long time to send it. I was starting to wondering if they even received my order. Then when it came it was in a bubble lined envelope and the product been slightly smashed and had leaked.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely Love It!!! I have such an issue with my skin drying out during the day, but with just one spritz of Heritage Spray my skin is Revived!!(Sorry for the infomercial)I recommend it to all!!</li>
    <li> Bottle came shrink wrapped and had leaked a little. The product smells good too. I had planned to use this as a toner but it&#x27;s too oily for my skin.</li>
    <li> smells incredible ...love it. I use this to set my make up and to refresh my face after a shower</li>
    <li> So far i like it. I like that it doesnt contain alcohol.  I spray it on my face morning and night,  it helps keep me moisturized.</li>
    <li> The best thing ever for skin. Better than sticky lotion and lasts longer.  Feels good after a shower.</li>
    <li> Oh I love the smell!! I can see a difference in my skin tone already!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect for combination or dry skin that is prone to clogged pores. Gives my skin a dose of soothing hydration without the threat of blackheads. It&#x27;s great for setting makeup and I&#x27;m sure it could be used on any part of the body with great success. It does smell strongly like roses, but that should be obvious. My only gripe with this product is that the spray could be finer, if that makes sense. The bottle produces more of a spritz than a fine mist. BUT I think I&#x27;ll survive. Other than that, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The rosewater with the glycerine is OK, but I prefer them separate.</li>
    <li> This rose water smells GREAT.. and my skin has been loving it ... i use it every day ... specially now in winter time since my skin gets really dry...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brand&#x27;s Rosewater and Glycerin in a smaller bottle, non-spray, and fell in love with it. I decided to purchase a bigger bottle and the spray is just a great advantage! I can spray a cotton ball and use it that way, or spray it directly onto my skin. I love this brand because it is chemical free - rose oil, water and glycerin.  My skin is dry, dry, dry so I use this as a toner and it helps keep my skin moist. I have now purchased several to send to friends who are into more natural skin care products. And the scent is so divine! It may look and be inexpensive but I&#x27;ll put it up against one brand I purchased that cost $40 for 4 oz - and isn&#x27;t any better (just in a glass bottle instead of plastic).  This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> My mom was talking about how her grandmother used to smell, so I ordered this for her. She said it reminds her of her. I think it smells wonderful and use it myself. It doesn&#x27;t bother my nose either like some sprays do.</li>
    <li> Rose water smells wonderful and is very hydrating. I like this for a face moisturizer and also on top of makeup to mist more moisture on top. Also I&#x27;ll soak my beauty blender in this and use it to blend my makeup. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s like amazing and I can&#x27;t live without it....but...I do like it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have extra dry skin( thanks acne meds) and I use this as a facial mist right after I put on my hyaluronic acid serum after a shower. It smells great, and seals moisture. I also sometimes use it after I have put on my make up to get rid of any cakiness!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. It keeps my face very hydrated and fresh.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! I can&#x27;t believe you can use rose water and glycerine for so many things. I use it to moisturize my SUPER dry hair through out the day, I use as dually a face toner and facial moisturizer, and even tho I spend 20 mins putting on lotion every morning I&#x27;m ashy by lunch so I use this to re moisturize my skin! I also use it in my hair water spray bottle. It&#x27;s perfect! I use it for everything everyday :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty stingy with my five star ratings but despite the fact that this leaked out about 25% during shipping, I absolutely love the product! My husband and I use this daily after we shower. We spritz our face and then moisturize while it is wet using a few drops of pure almond oil or fractionated coconut oil. What an amazing light way to moisturize! We have been using the product through all four seasons now and it works amazingly well summer through winter. Occasionally we use this as a refreshing spritz but general use is in the morning as our face &amp;#34;lotion.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this really. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue and it does not clog our pores. It doesn&#x27;t really make us look any younger or offer any SPF but our skin has never looked better. It is a bummer about the shipping leakage... Seems to be a problem for a lot of people. Hopefully the seller will figure it out one of these days.</li>
    <li> I like using this product after a shower before and after drying.  It is also good to spray on your face and hair.  The smell is so fresh.</li>
    <li> You know it&#x27;s good when your friends start telling you that your skin looks flawless!  Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Great for my skin. Very nourishing. Spray it on after a shower to lock in moisture. Be sure to shake!</li>
    <li> Great skin refresher for the cold months, it also has moisturizing benefits.  I love the smell of rose too!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I switched to this instead of lotion for my face and love it. It&#x27;s refreshing and not heavy.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time and my skin is very sensitive to products. I absolutely love this stuff! For me, how I use it, I just put it on my face right when I wake up and then again before bed. I don&#x27;t really put it on after makeup because I don&#x27;t want make up to smear or anything. I would recommend this prior to putting on makeup and then letting the spritz settle a bit and then put on makeup. Great for a late night/early morning refresher. It smells great too and moisturizes in a light but effective way.</li>
    <li> i think it kind of smells ok, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin like the reviews i read said it does though.</li>
    <li> Lotion of any kind made by anyone will break me out and with hormonal acne I am always carefully selective on what new products I try so when I researched sprays EVERYONE suggested I try this. My face soaks this stuff up without clogging pores. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Amazed to find this again - my grandmother use to have it - a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I use this as a face and hair spray. The mist feels lovely as a skin refresher (you can spray all over). The rosewater smells great.</li>
    <li> The rosewater was fragrant and excellent. They may have mixed a little too much glycerin into the product, so the residue is slightly stickier than I would have preferred, and the spritzer does not spritz evenly. But overall a very good product and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells good, and makes my hair feel even better.  This is my first time using but I&#x27;ve heard good things.. my hair is natural, and it seems to help keep it moist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard great things about rose water, and I am beginning to understand why. I am only a week into using it, so I haven&#x27;t seen night and day differences, but it is definitely a better alternative for sensitive skinned people with (lots of) acne compared to witch hazel, at least in my opinion. I gave it a 4/5 because I usually spray it on and let it dry instead of rubbing it in, and sometimes there can be shiny patches (very small) on my skin - which is likely from the glycerin. This isn&#x27;t an issue because I put my make up on over it, but may be for someone who chooses not to wear make up on top of it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells.  Haven&#x27;t use it long enough to say if it works.</li>
    <li> So wonderful and makes your skin super soft and healthy... turned the whole family onto it and my grandson loves it because it smells divine.</li>
    <li> The smell is divine and I really feel the healing qualities. I use this in combination with apple cider vinegar for my face and have notice a big different for the betert in the quality of my skin in a week&#x27;s time. Got to me on time and the ordering/shipping process was painless.</li>
    <li> Best skin refresher I have ever used. Under makeup, or over!</li>
    <li> I prefer this product for hair rather than face or body. I&#x27;ve noticed when I spray this after washing my face it makes my pores appear larger so obviously glycerin doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin lol. Still a good product I&#x27;m also not too fond of Roses but I like the smell and it has a nice spray stream it never gets gunky like some spray bottles.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, and really is cool &amp; refreshing, especially on these HOTTTT summer days. Will definitely use seller again.</li>
    <li> I use this after Aloe for extra moisturizing on my face, works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I have been using this to keep the ends of my hair hydrated and it has been working out very well for me. It has added a soft feel to my hair as well. I will keep on using this! Works well on my legs too!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!!! I use this on my face and body, and mix it with apple cider vinegar as a face toner. It makes your skin so soft and supple and smells so pleasant!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this as an after shower spritz. It light and nontoxic. I always come here to purchase this.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and does not leave the skin dry at all.  Leaves skin very smooth.  Glad one of my friends recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing but in the future I am just going to make my own.</li>
    <li> Nice, for healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. It smells so rosey.</li>
    <li> I use this prduct as a leave in on my dry 4a 4b hair, after I wash it I mix it with aloe vera gel, rosemary oil. I can&#x27;t be without this product.  If you have a weave , its an excellent wash and set.</li>
    <li> I bought this to soothe my skin and use as a setting spray after applying makeup. For the price you get so much product, you could never find a setting spray with a deal like this in stores. Works great, smell is strong at first but you get used to it</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after watching reviews on Youtube. Every person who reviewed this product raved about the scent. I was nervous about buying it because I don’t really like the smell of roses. This product is AMAZING! It smells really good and it leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I plan on buying another bottle.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use this as a base to add oils to rather that just plain water and my hair loves this stuff. It keeps my hair nice and moisturized</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I mix with apple cider vinegar and use a a daily toner. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Great smell to this product.  I wished it was in a bigger bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> I love using this moisturizer on my face as it is lightweight but still does a great job. In the summer, I keep it in the refrigerator, and it&#x27;s so refreshing to spray on a cool lotion! I actually started keeping it in the refrigerator because I live in New Orleans and the hot humid climate would cause a slight bit of mold around the nozzle. I&#x27;m sure this would not happen if stored at a proper room temperature, but the fridge completely eliminates the problem. BTW it seems odd to call this a lotion since it&#x27;s a clear liquid...perfect for those who don&#x27;t like the greasy feel of lotion!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Better than I expected. High quality.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! All my acne and most of my blackheads went away with simply washing my face, cleaning it after words with a cotton ball and then spraying this! No cream needed!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and on my arms and it leaves my skin feeling so smooth</li>
    <li> Price reasonable and works good. I like the smell of rose, fresh and real.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good.</li>
    <li> Love the smell; just like a rose garden; this will make your skin soft and hydrated.  I spray it on after washing my face and again at bedtime.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Delivery and product was as explained on details. Gives light moisture. Skin tone has improved. Smells great. I feel like I&#x27;m inside a misty flower shop when I spray this all over my body.</li>
    <li> This is extremely refreshing to just spritz on your face. I love the simplicity of it and the smell is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Great smell, and my skin soaks it in! I heard about it originally from this article http://www.mothermag.com/carolyn-murphy/</li>
    <li> Great for your skin. I always spritz it before I put on my makeup and after cleansing, exfoliating and toning.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and lightly moisturizing - love the delicate scent.  It is a very good value.</li>
    <li> Sticky. Fragrant but very sticky.</li>
    <li> I loved this product in my hair, on my skin, everywhere, the scent is heavenly, and the moisture is awesome!</li>
    <li> I tend to have very dry skin during the winter months, especially my hands.  I use Africare pure glycerin in tandem with Heritage Rosewater &amp; Glycerin and the combination keeps my hands smooth and soft.  I personally don&#x27;t use either one on my face because my skin is very sensitive, but it&#x27;s wonderful for my hands.  The pure glycerin is a thicker substance and you only need to use a little pea size drop and then lightly rub that in, then I spray with the rosewater and rub in.  Works for me to keep my hands from drying out and for cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Great to use as a makeup setting spray!</li>
    <li> My skin is dry and this keeps you looking beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Great smell and perfect for making hair soft and silky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I have just started using this on my face as a moisturizer and on my body as a lotion and OH MY GOSH! My dark spots are clearing up, my skin no longer feels tight and dry, and my acne has subsided. I now use this product as my ONLY moisturizer because most moisturizers cause my skin to break out. I use this product after Neutrogena Stress Free Foam wash and toner. Beautiful results!</li>
    <li> love this stuff - simply the best pre moisturinzing spritz out there</li>
    <li> Not worth the money in my opinion. Gained no benefit from it whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I mix this with aloe vera juice, a bottle of rosewater (no glycerin), spring water and this bottle of rosewater with glycerin. Works great to moisturize my hair daily and then I seal with jojoba and caster oil and my shea butter. Smells great but the scent does not last long. I have been using for about 2 months and my hair loves this much better than just plain water. My daughter took my first batch so I had to purchase another one for myself. Great for if your hair is in braids too.</li>
    <li> never tried this before now, and am really liking it!  I love rose scented things.  It works great after clarifying with the rose scented witch hazel.  A spritz of this on the face before using primer or foundation.  I also have used it in my hair to tame frizzy ends.  it is a really lovely product.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m going to focus on the product: I love it. It&#x27;s great for a light moisturizer, and it smells wonderful. I spritz it on after my shower and sometimes about half an hour before I do my makeup if I&#x27;m going out in the evening. Since I don&#x27;t wear perfume, the hint of rose is perfect. It&#x27;s just enough that your special someone will definitely be able to appreciate it in those close-up moments. I also spritz a bit on my hair when it gets some frizz, and it does the job without feeling like I added product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars: The whole vor-mag water thing is pseudoscientific nonsense. There is no science to back up these claims, and it&#x27;s a completely unnecessary claim to make because the product works well. It seems like they&#x27;re insecure about the product, so they decided to add a useless step in the manufacturing process to create the illusion that this is cutting edge stuff. While I do love this product, I don&#x27;t feel completely comfortable continuing to purchase it due to this issue. If this doesn&#x27;t bother you, it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try.</li>
    <li> What a great fragrance and it makes my skin so clean and smooth as well. Will definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I have had oily/combination ance prone skin for years and I am always very cautious on what I put on my skin, specifically my face. I have gone thru and heard many benefits of rosewater for years but haven&#x27;t tried it... until now! I love this product! It moisturizes just enough but not too much for all over day or night wear! My face feels so soft and supple whether it&#x27;s at night or the morning! And it&#x27;s so wonderfully priced! I actually went to my local Vitamin Cottage yesterday and I thought they had stopped carrying it so I thought I had to find yet again something else, but nothing tickled my fancy, so instead I did a little more research and come to find out they just moved it over an aisle! Thank goodness! I would recommend to anyone! If you have sensitive, breakout prone, different from day to day skin, give this a try, I highly doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed! :-)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love this stuff. I&#x27;m a moisturizer fiend and this is now my go to for a light all over body moisturizer. It smells lovely, dries quickly and leaves skin moist, but not oily. As other reviewers mentioned, this can feel a bit tacky for a few minutes, but to me, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Don&#x27;t spend your money on crazy high end stuff!</li>
    <li> I use this rosewater as a toner on days and or nights when my skin is dry and needs some moisturizing.  It&#x27;s also great after a day in the sun.  I brought some with me during my vacation to Mexico and carried it in my beach bag.  Super refreshing!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It smells great but the smell disappears almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Love this product have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Great for the skin! I love it!</li>
    <li> Very good rosewater will buy again.</li>
    <li> We use this for our curly haired little boy. Makes his curls look and smell fabulous without being greasy or crunchy.</li>
    <li> I had really. really dry skin. I was trying various toners, natural and store bought. This was the answer to my prayers. I spray it on and let my fave natural absorb it and then apply additional moisturizers. No more drying out, no flaking.... proper moisture!!</li>
    <li> This product has become a staple for me. I have oily, acne-prone skin. This stuff is great to spray on before moisturizing, if your face is having a dry day. Also, I use this after makeup application to set my makeup. I feel like it takes the dry appearance away after I use translucent powder. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of this now and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Every day will begin with an elegant aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Rose mist will feel like clothes of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Hair as well, also moist.</li>
    <li> My face is super sensitive, and it does not work for my face. It smells very rosy and nice.</li>
    <li> HAd for over a month...I really like it and it saves space. Follow directions!!!! No directions for removal so when I move I&#x27;ll have to figure it out.</li>
    <li> Love this spray sooo refreshing and smells amazing!! Has not broken me out which is great!</li>
    <li> I use this spray to set my makeup.  It truly makes it last all day and gives you a beautiful glow.  I do not recommend this product if you have very oily skin because it is definitely ultra-hydrating. I can imagine it would make you very shiny if you already have oily skin.  I think it works best on dry to normal type skin.  The smell is great but it does not linger - which I enjoy.  It is also very refreshing.  Be sure to shake the bottle before you spray.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff; lovely scent, and nice and hydrating.</li>
    <li> It exceeds my expectation every time I purchase this product through amazon</li>
    <li> love this product. smells great and keeps my skin well hydrated. does not clog my pores.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday after washing your face. This is an old fashioned beauty trick-that really works! So much cheaper than the fancy brands and much more efective</li>
    <li> Now part of my nightly ritual.  I spray it on my face and I&#x27;m done!  The next morning no dry skin and nothing to scrub off.</li>
    <li> Heavy, heavy rose smell.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I gotta say that I&#x27;ve spent thousands on beauty/skin care products. Fancy moisturizers, blah blah. I LOVE THIS STUFF. It is now the only moisturizer I use. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily AND gets dry/flaky easily. This stuff doesn&#x27;t break me out, can be applied in seconds, dries in a minute or two - I just love it. If you&#x27;ve read that glycerin can be bad for your skin, do some more research. Vegetable glycerin is very good for your skin - and hair. It can even be used as a leave-in conditioner. The smell is heavenly. I&#x27;ve purchased 3 or 4 cases just so I won&#x27;t run out. Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> The product did not arrive as pictured.  Even though it clearly says &amp;#34;with atomizer&amp;#34;  in the description,  as well as on the bottle label,  the bottle arrived with not spray top. This was the whole reason I chose this item over other ones.  I can&#x27;t mess with returning it at this point since it is a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and is moisturizing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched and searched locally for this product to no avail, but thanks to Amazon, I finally have it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fabulous for dry skin and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Product and service excellent.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I like the plain rose water best. But this is lovely!</li>
    <li> My derm. recommended this product, but specifically rose water with glycerine. I was having issues with skin breaking out, and even the lightest non-comedogenic creams and lotions didn&#x27;t help but possibly make the problem worse. She said this moisturizer is very light and skin tends to respond to it very well; younger skin especially shows signs of this because most other moisturizers weigh on the skin, resulting oftentimes in that &#x27;shine&#x27; from excess product throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Unless the weather is ridiculously dry and cold, you won&#x27;t need something stronger or thicker. You can spray it on your fingers and pat it on, or just spray it however many times daily. Plus, it smells very nice (but it doesn&#x27;t last -- my boyfriend now uses it and this is a plus for him). The atomizer is a must, otherwise the liquid will be nearly drained from the bottle in its journey to your face, down your hands and arms.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I read about it in some magazine and tried it. I would like to see it available in a &#x27;large size&#x27;.  I bought several small spray bottles and have them in different parts of the house and office.  Very refreshing too on hot days.</li>
    <li> Giving this just 3 stars because I did not receive what I ordered.  I ordered the rose water with glycerin with atomizer but I received just the plain rose water and no atomizer.  I do still like the product and will keep it but now I have to try and find an atomizer/sprayer attachment for the bottle as what I ordered didn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
    <li> Just absolutely love this &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;  Had some before but did not remember where I got it....so of course, I tried Amazon - and there it was.Exactly as I wanted and I believe it was delivered in 4 or 5 days....fast...but I don&#x27;t remember exactly</li>
    <li> This product is very refreshing on the skin, I also have very dry skin around my hairline that can get flaky, for now it seems to help my issue as well.  I mostly use this to set my make up as I like the dewy look on my skin.  I love the smell, it does not make look greasy.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and leaves my skin soft with no irritation.  I live in a very dry, harsh climate and I&#x27;m hoping that it helps keep my skin less dry and patchy.</li>
    <li> I took a leap of faith and ordered this product blindly, and I&#x27;m in love. I use this as part of my daily skincare routine, as a sort of toner for my skin. I cleanse my face, pat dry, and spray the rosewater &amp; glycerin all over my face, put a few drops of jojoba oil (my moisturizer of choice) onto my fingers and rub it into my damp skin. The rosewater allows me to distribute the oil easily and evenly without tugging my skin. I love the smell, and my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react badly to this. When my bottle runs out I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for about 2 1/2 months and I&#x27;m about halfway through the bottle. Definitely worth the money and the price doesn&#x27;t make me want to cry, either!</li>
    <li> A dear friend suggested using Heritage Rosewater with Glycerin and I am delighted with the results.  A squirt here and another squirt there and before you know your skin looks terrific and you feel the difference.  At least that is what took place after a few days of use.  Then Judy said, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s mine.  Get your own.&amp;#34;  Given what it does for my skin, I am happy and if I look a little better, those poor persons I encounter can at least say, &#x27;Smooth.&#x27;  Heritage sells a simple forumla made up of ingredients that just work well for us.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 3 weeks ago, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I use it all the time, multiple time throughout the day since it is so dry here in the Winter. I use it right out of the shower whilst still damp. Then I spritz a bit on my hair and face. It smells SOOO good! And the moisturizing properties are wonderful. It&#x27;s also very convenient that it comes in a spray bottle. I apply it to my face along with my regular moisturizer that I routinely use, and it makes my skin so soft and supple. I spray it on my damp hair, and have not had to use any hair products to keep my wavy hair from frizzing and has stopped fly away hair. My hair used to look like I was just electrocuted with all my hair kind of floating around my head, and I never wanted to touch anything metal, or turn on light switches for fear of being zapped from static electricity, lol. The scent reminds me of Dove soap, or Nivea lotion. It&#x27;s smells really good without being cloying and strong.</li>
    <li> I have been using rosewater with glycerin from my skincare for many many years. It&#x27;s a simple way for your skin to look smooth hydrated and clear. My grandmother started me on rosewater with glycerin at a very young age. This product does what it is supposed to do and I&#x27;m very very pleased.</li>
    <li> I spritz this in the morning after washing my face, then apply my light day cream. My skin feels dewy all day. Highly recommended for dry, mature skin.</li>
    <li> Not quite in synch with all the raves - but I&#x27;ll agree it is pleasant and refreshing. You cannot go without moisturizer with this product. It&#x27;s mostly rose WATER....so it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> This is awesome nice for my skin and hair. Just love it, forgot how nice this product is used a long long time ago, will not stop ever again.</li>
    <li> This smells so great and fresh.  I still have a small bottle of this from about 5 yrs ago and it doesn&#x27;t have much scent left.  I use this to pray on my face for a nice pick me up.  Smells nice in the hair as well!</li>
    <li> Smells ok, but did not see any noticeable difference after applying make-up. Used it as a finishing matte...maybe it is good for something else but I did not notice a fresh  look.</li>
    <li> I use this item to mix for hair growth and manageability</li>
    <li> Love, love. Love. Great product and wonderful value</li>
    <li> No body lotion here. This is all I use on my body and it feels great. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Love it - my face is glowing!</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my daily skin care routine and love it. Has great soothing and hydrating properties for sensitive skin.  Would give this review 5 stars, but am taking off two  because I received the product without the atomizer, and, although I have prime, it got to me almost a week after ordering! Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product that I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This Rosewater and Glycerin spray has literally changed my skin!  I use it on my face as my toner and on my legs after I shave.  Sometimes I use it in place of lotion and spray it all over (although in the desert I can&#x27;t always get away with that and need lotion too).  The smell is beautiful and natural.  I would recommend this to anyone and I do!  If you&#x27;re on the fence, definitely get it!</li>
    <li> This product smells good and feels great on my skin.  I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great as a light spray on moisturizer. I even put it in my hair (lightly) to tame frizz. Smells healthy &amp; glorious.</li>
    <li> Rosewater &amp; glycerin toner smells so good.  I use it in the middle of the day to hydrate my skin. I have oily but dehydrated skin, so this product helps refreshing my skin between washes.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely like roses and is nice and light weight. I use it to freshen my face throughout the day and in a solution as a toner.</li>
    <li> I love this. I have sensitive skin and have been looking for something different because Cetaphil makes my skin too oily. Have been using it for a month and it&#x27;s perfect, I use it after the shower, to set my makeup...and a few times throughout the day with a smaller spray bottle I bought for my bag, if I feel I need it. It&#x27;s refreshing and smells beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is great for dry inflamed eyes. Just hold eyes open and spray. This is better than any eyedrops, the exception being drops containing hyaluronic acid from Germany and the UK, happily available from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love rosewater. I was recommended by an esthetician to try glycerin for my dry skin. So, I thought this would be great for my sensitive, rosewater loving skin. I was wrong. The concentration of glycerin leaves a tacky/sticky feeling that lasts and my skin has not responded well. I may order the plain rosewater to dilute this, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it full strength. It does smell wonderful though!</li>
    <li> Thank you for shipping to fast, I love the smell of this and it feels great on my skin. I def. will purchase again. God Bless :)</li>
    <li> Great products, used for many years. I use plain Rosewater in winter, w/glycerin in summer. I keep multi bottles on hand. Great price, quality and delivery.</li>
    <li> Use daily all day long, great for all ages just be careful don&#x27;t to get directly in eye as may cause irrigation but absolutely love this stuff</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as my friend led me to believe, but it smells good and feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> So refreshing, so good!!! Reminds me of home and the fullers earth and rosewater masks we used every week. The spray bottle is a wonderful idea. I keep one in my bag to spray on my face on hot days.</li>
    <li> leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated without being heavy, greasy, or wet. absorbs quickly, the scent is lovely and doesn&#x27;t linger (which is a good thing for me). i use this to prep my skin for my powder/mineral foundation, and i also spritz it after application to set my makeup and keep it from looking powdery. i love it!</li>
    <li> loooove!!! way cheaper than fix plus and does the same thing</li>
    <li> Love this product and have used it for 6 years. Keeps the skin feeling hydrated.</li>
    <li> This water smells amazing. It&#x27;s very refreshing. I&#x27;m not sure it did anything to enhance my hair but the smell was uplifting</li>
    <li> Very nice light smell. It&#x27;s very moisturizing w/o making my skin feel oily</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell whether it really helps my facial skin but it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot but wish fragrance would last longer.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. Not &amp;#34;oh it&#x27;s a bit dry&amp;#34;. More like chunks of skin fall of my face. It&#x27;s bad. Very bad. Lately I became aggressive trying to combat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found a face wash (burts bees sensitive) and a mask (burts bees intensive hydration mask) that was helping a lot, but still. Some flaky nose action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is healing it. Well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the rosewater AND the glycerin. If you have dey skin make sure ir has glycerin in it. Glycerin is a humectant. Ir draws moisture TO your face and works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I discoverEd this product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer is also a big plus!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipment. Thanks!! 5 stars*****</li>
    <li> Purchased from Whole Foods BUT this is the best rosewater/glycerin toner I&#x27;ve used. I was a fan of the Burts Bees version for years, poured some on a cotton ball and could see how well it cleaned out my pores. However, this brand is by far superior! It moisturizes my skin much more the other brand. I like the versatility as well, how I can spray it on a cotton ball or directly onto my skin. Very refreshing and cleansing.</li>
    <li> Love how it moistens my skin and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Like WholisticMom (below), I, too, have spent thousands of dollars in facial care products. For a good chunk of my teen years I suffered from acne, and I still have problem skin. I have eczema, but also have combination skin. These conditions plus extreme NYC weather (muggy summers and harsh winters, plus extreme cooling and heating from the office) make for difficult-to-manage cutis. I&#x27;ve been using this spray for months, and it&#x27;s fantastic. I literally spray it on my face right after cleansing. I also use it after I&#x27;ve applied makeup. It smells delicious and leaves my skin feeling fresh all day! Some people suggest that moisturizer be applied after, but I never have with this product. I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did not purchase this product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have combo skin that tends to be dry in winter. I wash my face in the morning then spritz my face with the rose water and glycerin and it&#x27;s just enough moisture for my skin. Then I am ready to apply my makeup! It&#x27;s amazing-- not too oily or greasy and the perfect amount of moisture to my sensitive skin! Love it! And the smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> A very fine rosewater. I didn&#x27;t purposefully order the one with glycerin in it - it makes it much sweeter to the taste compared to the plain rosewater from this company. It is good however for using on the skin because the glycerin adds a certain thickness to the rose water, allowing to stick and absorb on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the spray bottle of rosewater and glycerin.........I spray it on my face after washing prior to using face cream and on my hair when I braid it and need a bit of moisture to get waves in my hair. I believe it is a good skin softener and of course the fragrance or roses is heavenly.</li>
    <li> This has a nice, light rose scent and feels wonderful spritzed on face and the backs of hands.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find other uses as we go along here, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, and makes your lips so and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater and glycerin water. It&#x27;s soothing and moisturizing. I use it in the morning after I wash my face and at night. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all.</li>
    <li> I used this product on hair and it keeps it moisturized and soft</li>
    <li> I love these flower waters.  So far I&#x27;ve only used the Rose and Rosewater with Glycerin.  I will eventually try them all.</li>
    <li> This works good for refreshing your face</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin moist and dewy. I spritz it on to set my makeup, and use it as a light anytime moisturizer. It&#x27;s not as hydrating as a night cream, but keeps my skin fresh throughout the day. The fragrance is pretty light-- I don&#x27;t notice it once the spray soaks into my skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this...i received only the rose water, not the rose water glycerin with the spray bottle. can reuse old one so not a big deal but i paid for the other type. i&#x27;d like a refund for the extra i paid.</li>
    <li> This review is about the product&#x27;s packaging rather than the rosewater itself - it does NOT come with an atomizer as advertised, but just a simple screw top.  Pretty much defeats the purpose I think.  Why buy a product to spray on your face when you can&#x27;t spray it on your face? I know that there are other uses for rosewater, but if you want an sprayable version don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin feels and looks amazing. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For starters, these are pure ingredients.  Nothing artificial.  It&#x27;s a great finish to your makeup.  Spray lightly, and your &#x27;face&#x27; will stay looking good all day. After you&#x27;ve finished your nightly facial cleansing routine, spray.  Spray anytime you or your skin needs a pick-me-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you don&#x27;t have time to do your hair, spray it and your style will refresh and your hair will smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you&#x27;re interested in learning more about this and other Heritage products, check out the ARE on Route 60 in Virginia Beach, VA.  It&#x27;s a great place.</li>
    <li> Amazingly refreshing toner/moisturizer!! I have very sensitive skin and have no problem using this several times a day. As another reviewer said, it really does give your skin a slight glow and makes skin feel rejuvenated. I like to apply it in the mornings, about 20 minutes before applying make-up to refresh and moisturize my face and then throughout the day if my skin is feeling dry. The smell is divine and not over-powering. I&#x27;ve noticed since using this product that my skin is less dry in general and I don&#x27;t need to moisturize quite as much. I have a feeling this bottle will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for hydrating my very dry facial skin. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it now, and I love the divine rose fragrance! It makes my morning and evening regimen so much more pleasant. I also use this to help my hair curl after blow drying. I have naturally curly hair that isn&#x27;t so curly now that I am older. I can spritz this on and scrunch my hair some and it gives it more curl and it looks less dry and split on the ends. Great product!  And did I mention I LOVE the divine rose fragrance?</li>
    <li> I use this after cleaning my face and applying the heritage rosewater toner. I love how it brightens up my skin and gives it a fresh feel. I heard glycerin is great for setting your makeup. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet it but can&#x27;t wait to see what happens.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance.  Smell doesn&#x27;t last long unfortuntaely.</li>
    <li> Love this.  It has made a bid difference in the appearance of my skin</li>
    <li> Really good , I love it</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works great as a moisturizing facial mist, hair refresher or makeup setter. Love this product!</li>
