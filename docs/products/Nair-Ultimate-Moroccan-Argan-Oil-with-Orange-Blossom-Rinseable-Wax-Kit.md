      <li>and I must say this was an awesome experience.  </li>
      <li>product is great!</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions, and this stuff works amazing!!!</li>
      <li>over&amp;#34; because this is the best thing that ever happened to me!!!</li>
      <li>The wax has a very pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>i heated it according to the instructions and was VERY pleased with the application!</li>
      <li>As for the wax job I&#x27;d say it does really great.</li>
      <li>The hair removal was really great</li>
      <li>If anybody has a good tip, what product to use to replace my beloved honey formula I use to.. please let me know!</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t work, do not buy!&lt;br /&gt;The most wonderful property of wax is its solubility in water.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First I loved it, the smell is great and the wax itself is easier to apply.</li>
      <li>I used to use the Nair Milk &amp; Honey Roll on Wax - loved it, but couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
      <li>Just do a really good once-over when you get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>The roller is good for about 2/3 of the product.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent, if you know how to use it, you can wax your body really fast!  </li>
      <li>The mango acai berry smelled lovely!</li>
      <li>( box label recommended 3).I am so glad I tested there because it felt as if my skin on my underarm Pitt were on fire!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used the Milk Honey roll on wax, but couldn&#x27;t find it in the store so reverted to this kind.</li>
      <li>The directions say to wash the area with warm, soapy water.</li>
      <li>The wax itself is effective.</li>
      <li>so, i cringed and opted to buy sally hanson&#x27;s warm wax kit.</li>
      <li>Warm in microwave, knead bottle, roll on, apply strip and pull off.</li>
      <li>Glided on nicely.</li>
      <li>Then I found this one at target and really liked it.</li>
      <li>YEAH RIGHT!!!</li>
      <li>Then to top off the madness, the wax does not rinse from your own body.</li>
      <li>The directions said  to use warm soapy water to clean up - ha!  </li>
      <li>on which makes it easy to use, effective, what else do you need from a wax roll?</li>
      <li>My skin I use baby oil or any kind of oil to get the stickiness off and it works perfectly fine</li>
      <li>This wax is just OK.</li>
      <li>best thing about this product though, is the speed and ease of application and waxing and its ability to take out really short hair.  </li>
      <li>I have used Nair milk and honey microwaveable roll on wax for years and love it.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>I have used the Nair Roll On product for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>So a product that works on &amp;#34;extremely short hair&amp;#34; sounds like the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this wax.  </li>
      <li>Love the &#x27;milk and honey&#x27; one.</li>
      <li>After not being able to find my trust roll on spa clay, I purchased this-</li>
      <li>It is helpful to remove the roller from the applicator for better access.  </li>
      <li>Follow the instructions, with one important exception!  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Most of us aren&#x27;t pros.  </li>
      <li>they should have dont a LOT more work on this..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for those last minute touch ups and no salon in sight.</li>
      <li>I thought, okay, maybe I just need to get used to this, so</li>
      <li>Then on top of all that, I could not remove the wax from anything; the roller, strips, my skin, my fingernails,etc.</li>
      <li>The Nair honey one was way better.</li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t find them in store, I hope I&#x27;ll still be able to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have used the milk and honey roll on wax and my favorite the Brazilian spa clay version..</li>
      <li>Wish they included more strips.</li>
      <li>However, it does a better job at removing the hair.</li>
      <li>I did my best not to leave any residue on my legs, but what remained came off almost completely with a baby oil rub followed by a quick scrub with a washcloth and soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good replacement, but I&#x27;d choose the clay one first if I had a choice between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>hair great, better than the spa clay roll on.&lt;br /&gt;Removes short hair a lot better</li>
      <li>Nothing is ever as easy as it appears in commercials, and nothing ever works as well as advertised.</li>
      <li>It was easy to heat the wax and apply it.  </li>
      <li>bought this product in my local store, but it&#x27;s great to know Amazon sells it too as Amazon&#x27;s price is better.</li>
      <li>The wax does not melt as well and therefore does not roll on as easily.  </li>
      <li>and the application were easy</li>
      <li>and then I clean the top with an alcohol swab</li>
      <li>The excess wax easily washed off with water.  </li>
      <li>I just threw the strips out and don&#x27;t bother trying to clean the roller top of the wax bottle.</li>
      <li>It was so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>So easy and convenience to use.</li>
      <li>Easy breezy.</li>
      <li>I found that while damp, those spots- which appear beige in color- could be scraped off fairly easily with a fingernail.</li>
      <li>It was so easy.</li>
      <li>Because this wax that &amp;#34;washes off easily with soap and  water does anything</li>
      <li>This product claims the wax, roller, and strips are easily cleaned with lukewarm water and soap.</li>
      <li>I started to not like it because the orange blossom was just too strong for me.</li>
      <li>At first, the smell was nice</li>
      <li>it removed hair with ease and it washed off of my legs just fine...</li>
      <li>It was fine.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge skeptic when it comes to hair removal.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this.</li>
      <li>Just beware of the \\&quot;easy clean up\\&quot; process.</li>
      <li>it went on smoothly and evenly</li>
      <li>I would have given it 5 stars, but the clean up process is not as easy it says.</li>
      <li>Warm soapy water makes the wax product very sticky, you can&#x27;t get it off your fingers, face, roller or cloths.  </li>
      <li>There a far superior waxes out there for you buck.</li>
      <li>I have used many wax&#x27;s and this one is easy to use, not messy, and I love the results</li>
      <li>Overall, good hair removal but too strong of a scent</li>
      <li>The kit is easy to use, and actually works fairly well at removing hair.</li>
      <li>When I went to purchase, the original product had been replaced with this one.  </li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t come clean at all, and the roller is still coated in a layer of gunk.</li>
      <li>Its a snap to clean.</li>
      <li>The clean up was a nightmare as soap and water did not work when trying to clean up.  </li>
      <li>The roller gummed up and would not rinse clean.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get the roller head clean.  </li>
      <li>but then it came time to clean the strips and the roller head.</li>
      <li>I also had no problem getting the cloth strips clean</li>
      <li>However, clean up was a DISASTER.</li>
      <li>It really does leave skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clean off like the old wax, you&#x27;ll want to use either really warm water or just jump in the shower to clean up.</li>
      <li>I felt like I was becoming a real pro!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used Nair products in the past and have never had any sort of sensitivity issues.I initially bought this product for bikini line hair removal. I started off using under my left arm just in case ! My hair there was coarse so I left the product on for about 5 min. ( box label recommended 3).I am so glad I tested there because it felt as if my skin on my underarm Pitt were on fire! Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t go straight for my intended area! It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as regularnair but its a close race!</li>
    <li> Agree with other reviews that roller/strips are hard to clean (will try rubbing alcohol tip) but personally find it removes hair far better than any other over-the-counter wax I&#x27;ve tried, so will keep using it. It really does leave skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from amazon, but I got it from my local pharmacy after them not having the original one that I use, the Nair  Brazilian Spa Clay which is my absolute favorite!  I was in  need of a wax and decided to try this since argan oil is in just about everything these days.  At first, the smell was nice but then it became overpowering.  I started to not like it because the orange blossom was just too strong for me. The hair removal was really great but there was a lot of wax residue left on my legs. Along with that, the wax was really stringy and spewed out from the roller when applied, which I didn&#x27;t like. I found the consistency was a lot thinner than the Nair Brazilian Spa Clay.  After finishing my application, i went to wash off the strips and my legs and the wax residue beaded up into white grainy balls, which I didn&#x27;t like. This was after the fact that the box says rinsable.  The wax strips had the same issue and I just ended up throwing them away because I couldn&#x27;t be bothered with them which was such a waste considering when I use the Nair Brazilian Spa Clay I am able to save the strips for a 2, 3 and 4th reapplication after letting them dry.  Overall, good hair removal but too strong of a scent and the product doesn&#x27;t meet up to do what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I guess they&#x27;ve discontinued the nair peach melon sugar wax or something, because i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! so, i cringed and opted to buy sally hanson&#x27;s warm wax kit. it sucked so i returned it, got my money back and purchased this roll on thing instead. i heated it according to the instructions and was VERY pleased with the application! it went on smoothly and evenly, it waxed off extremely well! I WAS SOOOO HAPPY! it removed hair with ease and it washed off of my legs just fine... but then it came time to clean the strips and the roller head. i followed the instructions and tried and tried relentlessly for about 20 minutes AFTER soaking them in hot water. finally, i gave up and threw away the strips and the roller head. i&#x27;m going to return the box to the store and get my money back yet again. i&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the Milk Honey roll on wax, but couldn&#x27;t find it in the store so reverted to this kind. HATE IT!  It&#x27;s much harder to remove the wax strips... it almost hardens too fast? And then trying to rip the strip off... you can imagine.  Clean-up is what made me hate this product though.  It doesn&#x27;t melt away like the sugar wax does.  It only hardens, and flakes off on little balls.  It sticks everywhere!  I was afraid to get my drains clogged with the wax, so I ended up just throwing all of the strips away.  I couldn&#x27;t even get the roller head clean.  I will be throwing this product away and never buying again.  A waste of money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why the ratings for this product are low. I loved it! My only complaint is that the wax clean is not as easy as they say it is. I just threw the strips out and don&#x27;t bother trying to clean the roller top of the wax bottle. As for the wax job I&#x27;d say it does really great. It grips even the tiny little hairs. (Hurts like crazy) but hey I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nasty thing. I love the other roll ons but this &amp;#34;aragan oil&amp;#34; is awful! Sticky and doesn&#x27;t come off! Will never buy it again!</li>
    <li> The roll on applicator worked fine, but the wax itself was the worst I ever used.  The clean up was a nightmare as soap and water did not work when trying to clean up.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the &#x27;milk and honey&#x27; one. This one doesn&#x27;t work, do not buy!&lt;br /&gt;The most wonderful property of wax is its solubility in water. Its a snap to clean. This one is not water soluble. They added something to this wax that makes it insoluble in water.&lt;br /&gt;I had a horrible time while using this wax and after the first use, it is unusable as it cannot be cleaned. The wax clumps up on the roller when washed with water.&lt;br /&gt;I took mine back to the store.</li>
    <li> I have used many wax&#x27;s and this one is easy to use, not messy, and I love the results</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find my usual Brazilian Spa Clay or Honey Milk roll on at my closest stores so I bought that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I loved it, the smell is great and the wax itself is easier to apply. Seemed to remove more hair than the other roll ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then… I had a hard time rinsing the excess wax (with warm water, body scrub, wash clothes)… I still have wax spots on my body (yeah, I decided to post this review right away because it&#x27;s such a disappointment). I also tried to rinse the reusable cloth strips but I couldn&#x27;t remove the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other roll ons were SO easy to rinse. If I can&#x27;t find them in store, I hope I&#x27;ll still be able to find them on Amazon. I just ordered some!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people are complaining about this formula because it&#x27;s hard to remove, and it&#x27;s true. The residue it leaves behind is very difficult to get off, compared to the previous formulas. However, it does a better job at removing the hair. Only downside is that it hardens too quick so you have to keep reheating it a few times. With the previous formula I was having a ton of issues with the wax; it just wouldn&#x27;t remove all the hair, I would pull the waxing strip and the wax would be stuck to my skin, and that was painful. I didn&#x27;t have those types of issues a couple years ago, and for some reason the last two packages I bought I hated it. Then I found this one at target and really liked it. The scent is very pleasant and aside from the residue being difficult to get rid of afterwarda, I think it is better quality than the previous kind.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews for Nair Milk and Honey wax I decided to buy it.  When I got to my local drug store, they only had this product, the Moroccan Argan Oil Wax kit.  I thought, &amp;#34;Why not? It should work the same, right?&amp;#34; WRONG! It was easy to heat the wax and apply it.  The problem was there was not enough strips included and the wax didn&#x27;t wash off the strips completely as it said in the instructions.  It got stuck under my finger nails from trying to scrub to wax off the &amp;#34;reusable&amp;#34; strips and it left my legs and hands feeling sticky even after showering.  I should have held out for the Milk and Honey version!</li>
    <li> The Nair honey one was way better. Same concept as this one but the wax did not rinse off these strips like the milk and honey one. My hands are also sticky and it was hard to get the residual wax off my legs. Had to toss all the strips . ugh :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years. I love it, it lasts longer and is much more comfortable long term than shaving. When I went to find my usual Nair Naturally Smooth Melon Sugar Wax I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I came back several times, but eventually gave in and bought the Moroccan Argan Oil wax....I hate it. It didn&#x27;t come out nicely, it pulled uncomfortably and applied unevenly. I thought, okay, maybe I just need to get used to this, so I finished waxing. It was a nightmare. Worst waxing experience ever, including my first time, which was pretty bad since I had no idea what I was doing. It was messy, REALLY difficult to clean up, and I ended up just throwing away all of the &amp;#34;Easy to Clean&amp;#34; cloth strips away after soaking them in warm water, then hot and soapy water, and then scalding water. They didn&#x27;t come clean at all, and the roller is still coated in a layer of gunk. Needless to say, I haven&#x27;t touched the stuff since. It wasn&#x27;t worth the mess and time for me. It&#x27;s really too bad, because I haven&#x27;t been able to find my Naturally Smooth Peach Melon Sugar Wax since, which was incredible and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone. I hope they haven&#x27;t replaced it with this, but I worry that may be the case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for those last minute touch ups and no salon in sight. Definitely will purchase again. Love this product.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews on here, I feel like something must be wrong with me because I just got done telling my husband to &amp;#34;move over&amp;#34; because this is the best thing that ever happened to me!!! hahaha  I love this wax.  It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried an over the counter roll on wax.  It was so easy to use.  I did my upper leg, lower leg and my bikini line.  It was the easiest &#x27;at home&#x27; wax I&#x27;ve ever done.  I got a lot on my shirt and it came off after soaking it in soapy dish liquid for 10 minutes.  I also had no problem getting the cloth strips clean (although truthfully if you have a lot of hair you could use this entire bottle in one wax and then just throw everything out).  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Have to agree with the other reviewers.  This product is NOT rinseable with water the way the other Nair roll-on wax products are.  Everything that made the spa clay easy to use made this &amp;#34;moroccan argan oil&amp;#34; a disaster because it is formulated completely differently.  The strips could not be re-used.  The sink and tub ended up covered with hard wax nodules that I could not remove by fingernails much less &amp;#34;soap and water&amp;#34;.  The product may be partially dissolvable, but the rosin component survived alcohol, petroleum jelly, and bathroom bleach though somewhere along the way these components and 3M scouring pads did eventually work.</li>
    <li> It would have been quicker to shave.  I say this because the next day I had stubble that I wouldn&#x27;t have had if I had shaved.  I followed directions and did everything properly.  Strips did not wash clean with hot soapy water and the wax residue also did not wash right off my legs.  First time I have attempted waxing and I will not do it again - at least not with this product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The wax has a very pleasant smell. The new formula seems to be a stronger wax than the old versions of Nair in white round tubs, this could be a positive aspect if one intends to remove thick hair only.&lt;br /&gt;- The wax strips are much stronger and have a better grip than the old paper ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-  The roller is good for about 2/3 of the product. It becomes increasingly hard to roll out the rest of the product, even after reheating to make the wax more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;- The new and improved wax formula from Nair is much harder to wash off than the old one that could easily be rinsed with a simple shower. This could pose a problem if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;- The strips leave patches of a white residue, even after shower and scrub, that has to be wiped off with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Message to Nair: Please bring back the old tub of wax product from Nair.</li>
    <li> Imediatly after I pulled the strip off, the wax left my skin bruised and bleeding. There was strips of my skin left in the wax once I was done. It removes hair but it removes skin too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement since I couldnt find my usual Nair spa clay roll on wax...It&#x27;s a good replacement, but I&#x27;d choose the clay one first if I had a choice between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair great, better than the spa clay roll on.&lt;br /&gt;Removes short hair a lot better tha  the spa clay roll on.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Not painful (it&#x27;s still waxing but it&#x27;s very gentle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not rinse off strips, but for $10 it&#x27;s not a bad one-use wax kit.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a long time to wash off skin.&lt;br /&gt;Does not maintain temperature well or consistently.</li>
    <li> This wax is just OK. If you put it on too thick it will stick to your leg, too thin and it won&#x27;t grab your hair. There a far superior waxes out there for you buck. The roller is also very hard to clean. I just left the wax on it and heated the wax a little longer so it would roll again. DO NOT USE ON BIKINI AREA!!!!! This wax is far too harsh for the lady bits. I prefer a hard wax. I also noticed the wax oozes out the sides of the roller a bit.</li>
    <li> This is the worst ever. I have used the milk and honey roll on wax and my favorite the Brazilian spa clay version..I could not find either and after reading &#x27;easily rinses off&#x27; on the box, I figured it was the same. It&#x27;s not, stay away unless you like the feeling of wax stuck to your skin. Nair needs to throw this wax out, like I did, and keep the others, that actually have good reviews, on store shelves</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nair products for years, mainly because the roll on applicator is so easy to use. It took the first roll jn the microwave to realize that this is nothing like its predecessors.  First you&#x27;ll want to heat it up a bit longer than before. I was pushing 30-35 seconds at least to get it as hot as I needed it. This stuff works fast. Where I would do 2 or 3 passes before took 1. There wasn&#x27;t a problem with residue since it was hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clean off like the old wax, you&#x27;ll want to use either really warm water or just jump in the shower to clean up. It seems like it turns into oil as you wipe it off.</li>
    <li> First things, first, the wax did remove hair -- that&#x27;s where it earned its two stars. Glided on nicely. Yay, for that. However, clean up was a DISASTER. This kit is not rinsable, not reusable as it&#x27;s being marketed. Soap and water does not remove all the residual wax on skin. I was only able to clean up my skin by smoothing on some sweet almond oil. Also, the wax never fully came off the strips despite intense scrubbing and multiple soakings. But, more importantly, it especially didn&#x27;t even come close to coming off the applicator top which is why I say this kit is not reusable. I could do with having to purchase new strips, but now I can&#x27;t even use the wax again because the applicator top has semi-soft, semi-hard, goopy/crusty consistency left over wax all over it. It isn&#x27;t even remotely salvageable. Back to the drawing board Nair.</li>
    <li> Unmitigated crap. This is the single worst product I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used &#x27;em all. You can&#x27;t tell how much is in the bottle, it cools down really quickly, they give you a whole 10 strips to wax with, (which are not re-usable, by the way, as this horrible stuff won&#x27;t come off them), the roller doesn&#x27;t apply wax evenly, the wax is ridiculously sticky and IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT RINSE OFF WITH SOAP AND WATER! Such a mess. Terrible, terrible product. Don&#x27;t buy this. Unless you have a penchant for self abuse, in which case, I would recommend flagellation. Easier, less messy and more effective.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nair Roll On product for years and love it.  It is easy to use and easy to clean up.  When I went to purchase, the original product had been replaced with this one.  I was skeptical but purchased it.  The wax took much longer than the recommended 25 seconds to heat.  When I stripped it off, it was painful and seemed very harsh.  Once completed, I washed my hands, but the product would not come off of my fingernail polish.  I took a shower to remove the wax from my arms and instead of melting away, it had to be rolled up into little waxy pieces.  I soaked the strips and applicated in warm soapy water as directed and have the same problem.  I have been scrubbing the applicator with a toothbrush, but I doubt it will ever come clean enough to be re-used.  I see that Amazon sells the sugar based wax, so I&#x27;m throwing this product away and will be ordering the other roll on wax.</li>
    <li> This product works passably well to remove hair. So, it deserves three stars for doing its job. However, as others have said, the major problem is that while they use the word &amp;#34;Rinseable&amp;#34; on the packaging, it&#x27;s a huge lie. The first time I used it, I scrubbed my legs at least five times before the wax finally came off. They were not large swaths of wax either, just the remnants that are usually left at the edge when you are done. Every time I thought I had it all off, I&#x27;d find another spot on my leg sticking to my jeans while I was walking. Annoying to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today when I used it a second time, I thouroughly scrubbed with soap and a loofah in the shower afterwards and did a quick shave to catch any errant hairs. However, when I dried off I found at least seven spots where wax had continued to cling on. I found that while damp, those spots- which appear beige in color- could be scraped off fairly easily with a fingernail. Don&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s dry to find out if you missed any spots! It&#x27;s impossible to remove when dry and will stick uncomfortably to clothing. Just do a really good once-over when you get out of the shower. Then use a bit of coconut oil to sooth your skin. It works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upshot: It gets the hair off pretty well (even shortish hairs) so I&#x27;d recommend it for that. But do not believe what the package says about it being rinseable. It&#x27;s a load of bs.</li>
    <li> It was fine. The wax does cool quickly, but it&#x27;s no big deal to microwave it for 5 seconds. I believe when they say the strips are reusable they mean for a single use, multiple passes. I used almost the whole bottle and 5 strips to do my entire legs. Once the strip was too covered in wax I threw it away. I did my best not to leave any residue on my legs, but what remained came off almost completely with a baby oil rub followed by a quick scrub with a washcloth and soap. Finished with aloe and I can get by a few more weeks until my next professional appointment.</li>
    <li> So easy and convenience to use. the wax removes all hair quickly with little pain.</li>
    <li> For some reason it is hard to find stores carrying the Brazilian Clay or Honey Milk roll-on wax, so I bought this instead.  I recommend that you heat it a little longer than it calls for because it almost came out clumpy and I had to squeeze the bottle while applying the wax.  The smell is fine, and it did a typical job after I adjusted the heat time.&lt;br /&gt;The WORST part is removing excess wax.  With the Clay or Honey Milk if you make a mistake, or have some wax that doesn&#x27;t remove with the strip, you can use a rag with hot water for a quick clean up, but not with this stuff.  After finishing my legs, I had to soak my legs to get excess wax off.</li>
    <li> I really want to know the R&amp;D team behind this product, that worked on this and thought, &amp;#34;ok, this product is ready to go on the shelves!&amp;#34; YEAH RIGHT!!! they should have dont a LOT more work on this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This product claims the wax, roller, and strips are easily cleaned with lukewarm water and soap. NO. Just no. I tried lukewarm, hot, cold, with soap, without soap, THIS WAX DOES NOT COME OFF. I&#x27;m sitting here with a sticky bikini area 2 hours later.  The strips are in the washing machine; Im hoping that will get the wax off, because it didn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;simply rinse off&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The product does not apply evenly. It also tugs uncomfortably at the skin and hair. I heated it per the instructions, and also found I had to keep reheating it SEVERAL times. I understand wax cools eventually, but I was walking to the microwave every five minutes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It hurts. Really bad. I&#x27;ve waxed before, and it was not as painful as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The product claims to come with 10 strips, and I only got 6. Did anyone else experience this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not a user-friendly product. I wish I could give it 0 stars...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think twice about purchasing this new product, because I use their honey formula for years and I trust the company. However, this product is a JOKE! Smells weird, not effective and water (nor everything else I tried) DOES NOT REMOVE this product! I had to throw away my waxing papers, the plastic bin (I was using to clean my papers) and also my shower get covered with this crap.. :( My legs were sticky for days, I couldn&#x27;t remove this product! I wish to have my money back, but from now on, I&#x27;m not purchasing anything else from Nair. If anybody has a good tip, what product to use to replace my beloved honey formula I use to.. please let me know! Thank you for reading!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but I decided to try this product anyway. I was pleasantly surprised.  This is my first time waxing and I must say this was an awesome experience.  It was so easy. Warm in microwave, knead bottle, roll on, apply strip and pull off. Easy breezy. This is my new go to for waxing. No more $50 salon treatments.</li>
    <li> I may not wax often but this product was absolutely terrible! From the moment I opened it I knew it would be messy. I took off the cap and the wax stretched so much it got all over my counter. Thinking it&#x27;s going to come off with soap and water I didn&#x27;t stress much. Well it took some elbow grease to get the wax off the counter. Next I started to roll it on (after heating it) and it came out very uneven. Every strip I did only had a few hairs and I was so irritated by the product because it wasnt getting rid of the hair i had to do spots over and over eventually I had to stop. I felt as if I was on fire for a few hours afterwards! I really hope the redness and swelling go down soon. Then on top of all that, I could not remove the wax from anything; the roller, strips, my skin, my fingernails,etc. I ended up throwing it out and will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of the old Nair wax that had the peach and melon extract.  The excess wax easily washed off with water.  I felt like I was becoming a real pro!  After running out, I went to every store I could think of, but could not find a new jar.  It seemed like this Moroccan Argan Oil had replaced them all.  So I figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  The roll on wax feature IS SILLY.  Why?  Because this wax that &amp;#34;washes off easily with soap and  water does anything but!  The wax itself is effective. (hence the 3 stars) But every time I&#x27;m showering after I wax I find myself saying, &amp;#34;I curse you Nair!&amp;#34;  The excess will not wash off!  That&#x27;s pretty much what happens with the roll on piece also.  I could not remove 100% of the excess so I gave up.  Reusable cloth strips?  Yeah Nair, that&#x27;s exactly what I want to do.  Soak the hair I just pulled off my body in a cup or sink, and then take a 25 minute shower angrily scrubbing off wax.  And THEN get out of the shower and scrub the excess hair that has not separated from the strip.  This is not a short process.  What I&#x27;m doing now (until the bottle is gone) is heat up the wax and put it into the old wax jar, and use one of those wooden (popsicle stick) applicators.  You have to consider the consumer Nair.  Most of us aren&#x27;t pros.  The old wax that rinsed away EASILY with water was terrific!</li>
    <li> While applying wax, the roller pulls hair. The reusable wax strips could not be cleaned and I have wax residue on my legs still days later. I will not purchase this product again and do not recommend it. So frustrated.</li>
    <li> I have never had such a debacle with a beauty product. I suspect it was tested in the lab by rolling it a single time, on a single patch. That&#x27;s exactly how far I got before problems started multiplying faster than fleas on a mangy dog. The roller gummed up and would not rinse clean. As a result, I could only manage an uneven job. Once the residue on my legs cooled, I could not get it off. Oh well, I thought to myself, it&#x27;ll come off in the shower. Nope. Scrubbed again. Nope. And again. Nope. Tried rubbing alcohol. Nope. The following day, desperate as I was sticking to everything (including in the more private places) and my legs looked like I had contracted the plague, I removed the now fuzzy residue with pure acetone. Meanwhile...I put the strips in a bowl of water to soak in hot soapy water (I could hear the wax laughing when I tried to simply rinse it away). I&#x27;m sure the reader is shocked to learn the strips remained thoroughly coated. I do know a little bit of the wax begrudgingly lifted off since I managed to spill some of the water onto my floor...then the cat walked through it. Cue the acetone (for the floor, not the cat - that&#x27;s another tale). Sadly, I had stocked up on the product and had four nicely packaged purgatories to throw away. Days later, still with the pain of chemical burns in my armpits, I tried to express my displeasure to Nair via their website but it was impenetrable as last year&#x27;s fruitcake - unless I wanted to give them every piece of my personal information short of whether I harbor lint in my bellybutton.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot to remove all the hair. Comes up on the first try. You need soap, water, and a shower puff to remove it in the shower. This has cut down my ankle to bikini line wax time to 20 minutes b/c the quality of the was is so efficient. Usually takes me an hour with other stuff. Wish they included more strips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not water soluble, so have a body lotion close by, cause you&#x27;ll need it, I believe the results that you get using this wax is more long-lasting compare to other Nair waxes, it&#x27;s a roll-on which makes it easy to use, effective, what else do you need from a wax roll? It&#x27;s a bit expensive though!</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t waxed my legs in years (and now i remember why!)  I&#x27;m probably not the target audience for this product in that case, but there&#x27;s a reason why salons and professionals exist to take on this messy job!!  I agree with all the other reviews re &#x27;clean up&#x27; with this kit... it&#x27;s a total pain and v messy.  The wax really does not come off the strips sufficiently to the point you would want to use them again.  With some of them i could still even see the hairs attached!  eurgh!  The heat up and the application were easy but as with all waxing, you have to move quick, so probably need to re-heat quickly for 5 seconds a handful of times during the whole process.  And of course, you&#x27;re then left with spotty red, kinda itchy legs for a little bit.  Unfortunately i ditched the whole kit after one attempt and went back to my razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on walmart, bcz they are no longer carry NAIR SUGAR WAX (THIS WAS EXCELLENT!!!!!!!) , so I jut got this mindlessly....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS HORRIBLE!  THIS IS NOT REMOVING MAY HAIR AT ALL!!&lt;br /&gt;and like other reviewer, IT IS SO STICKY. ALSO, THE WAX LEAK FROM ROLLER AND BOX!!&lt;br /&gt;I kept the box and the plastic package, and stored. Then I found out later the wax is dripping at the bottom of box and making mess in my drawer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have more than half, but I am going to through away. I bought Sally&#x27;s traditional wax and I know this will do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to get real here! (So you men who like to think women are naturally hairless and that we never have bodily functions - you might want to look away!) I&#x27;m a huge skeptic when it comes to hair removal. Nothing is ever as easy as it appears in commercials, and nothing ever works as well as advertised. This stuff...I can&#x27;t even! Ladies, you all know what its like having to grow your hair out so its long enough for traditional wax. You feel like a gorilla and can&#x27;t wear anything that will expose your hairy legs for at least a week (sometimes longer!) So a product that works on &amp;#34;extremely short hair&amp;#34; sounds like the perfect solution. I&#x27;ve tried others in the past but all you get is that ripping feeling with maybe two hairs removed, and the rest still stubbornly stuck in your leg (now covered in wax that will take 10 minutes of exfoliating with some mineral oil to remove - and you&#x27;ll still be left with the stubble). I thought I would at least give this a try. Not only does it ACTUALLY remove the short hair (and I mean ALL of it) but it barely hurt, and it smells like heaven. Did I mention its a ROLL ON applicator? No messing dipping sticks and strings of wax across the bathroom counter or floor. AND, I kid you not, it really does wash off with soap and water. I didn&#x27;t even have to scrub! As soon as the water hit it, it turned opaque and came right off. I will never use another product again. This is seriously the best thing I have ever come across. And honestly, I&#x27;m a little shocked its from Nair. Their wax has never really worked for me in the past, and the stuff that&#x27;s supposed to melt your hair always smelled like rotten eggs and burned my skin in the past. But I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this. You HAVE to try it. Anyone giving a negative review is crazy. Follow the instructions, and this stuff works amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Nair milk and honey microwaveable roll on wax for years and love it. My CVS was out of it, so I bought this Nair with Argan Oil which looked like the exact same product but with Argan oil. NO!!!!!! It does not rinse off the skin, you have to pry it off like hard wax. You also can&#x27;t re-use the strips by rinsing them off like you can with Nair milk and honey roll on wax. Like another reviewer, I have white wax patches all over my arms and face now, even after showering and rubbing down with olive oil. Also I hate the strong smell, but that&#x27;s a matter of taste. Use it like you would hard wax, i.e., in very small strips and make sure to get every little bit off with the strip because it won&#x27;t wash off.</li>
    <li> this one leaves a resideue behind even after washing. difficult to take it off. they should bring the old one back in the market. Espcially the box one, that was perfect...roll stretches the bikino line area, not easy to use there.  i loved the one in a regular box,</li>
    <li> ****This review was written by my daughter***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great! I have very hairy legs and arms and this product worked tremendously. It removed just about every single hair! :) After warming it up for 15 seconds, it rolls on very smoothly, then apply the strip along the direction of the hair growth and pull it off in the opposite direction of hair growth. Voila. It left my skin looking and feeling smooth. Also, this container was empty after my first use. I was able to complete both of my legs and one lower arm. I would be upset that this product didn&#x27;t last an entire body session, but like I said I am very hairy so I am still pleased with how far it did go. I would have given it 5 stars, but the clean up process is not as easy it says. The directions say to wash the area with warm, soapy water. I did that ... like a gazillion times! It was somewhat easier to come off my hands, but it is no easy task trying to rinse this product from your nails. So, if you just got your nails done or simply don&#x27;t want to endure the hassle of trying to rid your nails of this sticky goo, I would advise that you use gloves. Yes, sounds like extra work, but it will save you loads of time ... and paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to others. Just beware of the \\&quot;easy clean up\\&quot; process.</li>
    <li> After not being able to find my trust roll on spa clay, I purchased this- and I am not happy. Let me explain each star I docked:&lt;br /&gt;- 1 star for the scent. The mango acai berry smelled lovely! This does not. Personally, the orange blossom reminds me of household cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 star for changing the bottle from clear to opaque. The length of microwave time depends on how much is in the bottle and now you have to uncap it and look inside to figure out how full it is.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 star for being marketed as washable. 2 hot soapy showers could not get the residue off my skin. It stuck to the inside of my undies. If you have a hot date, give yourself at least 3 buffer days.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 star for the &amp;#34;reusable&amp;#34; cloth strips. I used enough water to fill Shamu&#x27;s pool and the hair/wax would not come off. It would not come off the roll-on bottle cap either. The instructions claimed that 10 minutes of soaking would be sufficient. Lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and I want to know how Nair thought it would be acceptable to misrepresent a product as much as it did. Did it remove hair? Definitely! But so did their previous product, which was actually washable and worked just as well at a lower price.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST product. I have trouble getting out for appointments with having to hire sitters for my kids, so I tried this at home kit (that I purchased at a local pharmacy). I was doing a brazilian, which I have been having done professionally for 10+ years. Its not the pain thats an issue for me, its the having to go over the same spots over and over and over again and having the wax not stick. Then I ran out of strips like 1/4 way through which is totally useless. They are not reusable. I soaked and scrubbed them but the paper actually starts to disintegrate. Then to top off the madness, the wax does not rinse from your own body. I will still have to go get this done professionally and I&#x27;m sticky...awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a great product I bought it recently after returning the near Brazilian clay because it  wasn&#x27;t strong enough and it was leaving my hair still in place.  This one said to add that it was a salon strength which is stronger than the Brazilian Clay so I gave it a chance and I absolutely love it it is stickier but it definitely gets the work done there&#x27;s not one here that didn&#x27;t come out.  As for the cleanup it&#x27;s a breeze because all I do is I let it cool down in the upright position and then I clean the top with an alcohol swab and I put back the tab and close it.  My skin I use baby oil or any kind of oil to get the stickiness off and it works perfectly fine honestly it&#x27;s a great product and not be turned off by the negative reviews you just have to know how to use it</li>
    <li> The kit is easy to use, and actually works fairly well at removing hair. I used it on my legs and it&#x27;s gentle enough. I had been using an electric epilator for years but it hasn&#x27;t been working properly so I figured I&#x27;d try the home wax kit. The problem is that it&#x27;s actually messy. The wax bottle gets sticky on the outside and doesn&#x27;t rinse well, which also wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal, if it weren&#x27;t for the strips! They do NOT rinse at all, I tried soaking them twice, with different soaps, even a laundry soap (which you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be really good at removing stuff) but nothing happened. Instead, it left my sink a mess and sticky. Those wax strips aren&#x27;t reusable at all, which was the reason I bought this product vs. a different one. The next issue, is there isn&#x27;t enough strips to do a whole leg. I only did half leg cause I don&#x27;t have much hair past my knee and it&#x27;s blonde. What would I have done if I needed the whole leg? Also to rinse it off my legs I had to scrub off. So now I have about half a bottle and no strips. If you are buying this, be aware that while it works, it&#x27;s a one time use only.</li>
    <li> This is the worst formula ever! It does not clean up at all off of the strips or applicator head, it just creates a gummy mess. You have to throw away the half that is left along with the strips. It does an OK job of removing hair but does not easily clean off of your skin, it leaves it sticky.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Nair Milk &amp; Honey Roll on Wax - loved it, but couldn&#x27;t find it. So, I tried the Argan Oil. The wax does not melt as well and therefore does not roll on as easily.  The directions said  to use warm soapy water to clean up - ha!  Warm soapy water makes the wax product very sticky, you can&#x27;t get it off your fingers, face, roller or cloths.  I&#x27;m going to throw this away as soon as I&#x27;m done typing and  can unstick my fingers!  What a mess and I finally tried Goo-gone which did a fairly good job of starting to remove the wax from the roller, but then started to somewhat melt the roller.  I give up!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, if you know how to use it, you can wax your body really fast!  Follow the instructions, with one important exception!  Most reviewers complained about the clean up and this is where you want to depart from the instructions.  To clean your skin of wax residue and to wash the reusable wax removal strips, DO NOT USE HOT WATER.  Again DO NOT USE HOT WATER. The hot water causes a reaction to occur in the wax, which turns it into non rinsable  gooey mess that can be only cleaned with alcohol, nail polish remover, or other non-polar solvents (fast orange for grease cleanup used by car mechanics will work also).  So to clean up with water, use only lukewarm water and soap and rub off the wax of your skin, strips, and applicator. It is helpful to remove the roller from the applicator for better access.  It is a little bit more work than using sugar based waxes as the wax is not fully soluble in water, but it will come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product though, is the speed and ease of application and waxing and its ability to take out really short hair.  I apply this wax over large areas all at once, while the wax has the right temperature, then apply the strips and remove.  You can use the same strip to remove wax over 3 or 4 areas.  Even on sensitive and delicate areas on your face and in bikini regions, this product works exceptionally well with very little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product in my local store, but it&#x27;s great to know Amazon sells it too as Amazon&#x27;s price is better.</li>
