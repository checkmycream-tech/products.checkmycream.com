    <li> It was very pretty and looked just as advertised, but it didn&#x27;t fit!</li>
    <li> I loved the look, I loved the size, and the delivery was sooner than expected. I&#x27;m hat I didn&#x27;t like was when it broke in 5 days. Not even the clasp, but the chain itself. For the price, I would have been happy if it lasted me 5 months. But, 5 days us not good enough.</li>

    <li> I am happy with my anklet. It is small enough to fit around my ankle. I had ordered two other anklets from Amazon , but , gave them away because they were too long! Anklets should have sizes to order from. All ankles are not the same size !0</li>
