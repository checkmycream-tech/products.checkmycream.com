<li> There is no substitute for The Wet brush, none!</li>
<li> We have tried at least 4 other brushes and no one sells these locally</li>
<li> My curly headed little one has sensory issues, and brushing her hair was a nightmare until I found the wet brush.</li>

<li> I have extremely thick, medium length hair and this brush got through my crazy bed head with very minimal effort.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s crazy because i wanted this brush so bad for wet hair in the shower.</li>
<li> I used to hate brushing my hair.</li>
<li> I was shocked!!</li>

    <li> Your mileage may vary, but for my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair this works like a charm. My hairdresser recommended this brush and I was skeptical, but it really works great. Now it takes maybe three minutes to detangle her hair instead of 15-20.</li>
    <li> I love this brush I have a tender head and my hair easily knots. This brush glides through without hurting my head or pulling my hair. I also love the animal print!</li>
    <li> It really does detangle and brushes softly so not to pull you hair out when it is wet or dry. I used to hate brushing my hair. Now I dont mind at all and the tiny version of this brush is perfect for car or handbag.</li>

    <li> Amazing brush!  Works really well with long hair.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice brush, it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve been looking for. I liked it so much in fact I had to order one for my twin sister. And she loves it to</li>
    <li> I recommend these brushes all the time.  I actually opened my mouth to recommend these to my stylist, and then he pulled one out himself to detangle my hair.  They&#x27;re that good!  My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  I have every bathroom stocked with these.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC brush! I have long hair, not quite to my waist, that tangles easily. This brush goes through easily, gets rid of tangles painlessly. So happy with brush I bought one for my daughters and granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Best hair brush ever! My daughers and me cannot live without a wet brush. Recommend for EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this purchase. I have fine hair that is very long (hip length) and washing and brushing is always a headache... Literally. This brush had my hair perfectly combed in 1/2 the time it normally takes. I was shocked!! LOVE is an understatement. I will order travel brushes too :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s crazy because i wanted this brush so bad for wet hair in the shower. It just wasn&#x27;t hardcore enough for my transitioning from relaxed to natural curly hair. I rather use my conair velvet touch all purpose brush because it&#x27;s so strong and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  We have &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; in our home now.  The are great for those with thick long hair.</li>
    <li> The print on my brush was not the same as those posted here, but I  not even made because of how well this product works. I have extremely thick, medium length hair and this brush got through my crazy bed head with very minimal effort. I was a bit skeptical before using it, but am a true believer now.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush bought 1 for the whole family!</li>

    <li> My curly headed little one has sensory issues, and brushing her hair was a nightmare until I found the wet brush. This brush is so amazing that I even use it on my fine straight hair.  This is one item we don&#x27;t leave home without.</li>
    <li> There is no substitute for The Wet brush, none! I have a 4 year old who has naturally curly hair and it is long and gets tangled so easy ( not to mention fun additives like yogurt which I hear are good for your skin and hair but that&#x27;s not how hers gets there lol). We have tried at least 4 other brushes and no one sells these locally so I now have 4 of them. I admit I bought the animal print one for myself but we got the neon green so it didn&#x27;t get lost ( our first black one keeps getting eaten by our furniture which is dark brown ). I have 5 humans, 3 of which are kids, and 5 animals in a 2800 sq foot house and it is amazing how fast a brush can go missing, especially when there are dolls who need their hair brushed lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair which it is very fine BUT there is a ton of it. For my wedding it took over 120 bobby pins for an updo. I get wicked knots underneath and a regular brush with soft bristles doesn&#x27;t penetrate. A vent brush hurts like all bajeezus so when we found these it was heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one likes to hear a child cry, especially because it is time to brush their hair. Run, don&#x27;t walk, to buy one of these and don&#x27;t be fooled by similar brushes they are not the same. I cannot figure out why because the bristles don&#x27;t look special but they very much are!!!!!!</li>
