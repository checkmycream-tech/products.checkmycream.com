      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, and have to resist using it all the time.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>, she was a lovely woman</li>
      <li>I also love sitting in the sun, swimming and being outdoors.  </li>
      <li>I love the shampoo but cannot stomach the smell.</li>
      <li>whenever i used it i always apply a thicker more moisturizing conditioner on top of the shimmer lights.</li>
      <li>I love how it turns my bathwater purple.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a nasty smell, in fact it was probably considered a very nice scent at one time, but the association with old lady is rather disconcerting for those of us who slippinginto Grandma age.</li>
      <li>and I attribute the great color and soft texture to this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Not one to really buy these sort of products online, but the price was good.</li>
      <li>As the gray grew out I discovered it yellowed and looked dingy easily.  </li>
      <li>Another thing is the smell is REALLY strong.</li>
      <li>This has a strong scent that I didn&#x27;t care for.  </li>
      <li>i love my hair color more now after using this than right after i colored it..</li>
      <li>this shampoo will help you avoid looking yellow highlights makes them look a beautiful silver color</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m perfectly fine with that.</li>
      <li>The Shimmer Lights combo gives me shine and body for my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>As a rule I am fine with Clairol products.</li>
      <li>products work just fine for dyed and naturally light hair, but there is almost no effect on henna treated hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
      <li>I very much enjoy this Product.</li>
      <li>It added some light purple tinting to my hair.</li>
      <li>Problem is getting a comb or brush through it smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It also does not give you the silky smooth hair after conditioning, but I don&#x27;t know if it is suppose to.</li>
      <li>Works great and definitely takes out the yellow/brassiness.</li>
      <li>This product smells like a cheap dollar store lavender soap.</li>
      <li>great for white hair silver hair and gray hair makes it shine all makes hair stronger</li>
      <li>which was good, but the white was blending in more with the steel gray.</li>
      <li>Nowadays I mostly use this as a way to strip my hair before I dye it some new funky color, which is kind of a testament to how drying the shampoo really is.</li>
      <li>I will say that I am not the biggest fan of the way it smells, but I have got complements on how bright me blonde looks.</li>
      <li>but i love the results to much to stop using.</li>
      <li>Lesson learned...just because it says Clairol doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s best for me.  </li>
      <li>After some more trial and error, I have found that this works best if used every other wash, or even just every third wash.</li>
      <li>I feel like this product works great; especially the first couple of times that I used it right after my color treatment.</li>
      <li>smells awesome, and always brightens up my ash blonde to almost white 😛</li>
      <li>Always super delivery.</li>
      <li>This shampoo definitely took the red and copper colors out of my blond hair, which was great!</li>
      <li>I love the color of blond hair is tinged with flashes kept harriers, is a good alternative for hair color mantega same as the first day for much longer</li>
      <li>I was happy after I used the shampoo and conditioner because it does really take the golden hue out of blonde hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for toning down brassiness.</li>
      <li>when I got out I saw that my lightest blonde highlights were very, very purple!!!!</li>
      <li>Smells great and makes my silver and grey really shine.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo/conditioner for blondes so far!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo definitely took the red and copper colors out of my blond hair, which was great! Made it look much more natural. Yet it also kind of made the blonds not as bright. Still looked so much better then before though.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t very thick and didn&#x27;t condition well... But since you should only use it once a week its not so bad.</li>
    <li> I get my hair foiled but I always feel like it starts turning yellow a few weeks later especially after I work out. This completely takes the yellow out! It helps keep your hair white blonde so you don&#x27;t have to get it done as much!</li>
    <li> One of THE best hair products for anyone with salt &amp; pepper and / or white hair!!&lt;br /&gt;Best, bar none!!</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s ability to make my blonde hair brighter, but be careful because if you leave it on for more than 2 mins it slightly tints your hair blue. If you&#x27;re using this make sure you follow the shimmer lights conditioner, with a white/clear conditioner you love. The conditioner in this set doesn&#x27;t really do much of a good job. So hair gets left feeling rough.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have blonde hair and want to tone down brassiness. It also smells good and leaves your hair full of body.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Shimmer Lights shampoo and the Conditioner.  I have shoulder length color treated hair that I am growing out to its natural \\&quot;salt &amp; pepper\\&quot; look.  I had been using L&#x27;Oreal Sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, which left my hair tangle free.  I got the Shimmer Lights to tone down brassiness, which it does to some extent.  Problem is getting a comb or brush through it smoothly.  I note there are Sulfates in the shampoo, not the conditioner, but my hair is not adequately conditioned/tangle free with the Shimmer Lights products.</li>
    <li> I have dyed blonde hair with bleached highlights. Because my natural color has red tones, dying it blonde results in a strawberry blonde color, and my bleached highlights turn brassy after a few weeks. This product works great for these issues.  My highlights look bright and the brassiness is gone, and my overall color is toned down as well. I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thyroid issues made coloring my hair a joke so I gave up 2 years ago and decided to grow out the gray.  As the gray grew out I discovered it yellowed and looked dingy easily.  I remembered the bluing products of yester year and went hunting for something- anything that would help.  These products work wonders!!!  My gray looks soft and silver not dingy at all.  Going with your gray in your 50&#x27;s takes courage- this product really helps to make a difference.  I have actually had people stop me in stores and parking lots to compliment my hair something new and exciting for me!</li>
    <li> This product smells like a cheap dollar store lavender soap. It dried out my hair so I needed to use a leave in conditioner along with this.&lt;br /&gt;With that said the product did do it&#x27;s job. My hair no longer has the awful Barbie doll yellow and nasty brassiness.</li>
    <li> Product seems to tone down brassiness, but the smell is awful and it lingers after a shower. It smells like an old lady&#x27;s perm. Yuck!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended that I use \\&quot;purple shampoo\\&quot; to help tone my blond, going white, hair. When I priced the professional shampoo there at the beauty shop it was $25 for 8oz, a little high for my pocket book. When I asked for a cheaper solution she recommended this product. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now (twice a week) and it seems to be doing the job. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great and definitely takes out the yellow/brassiness. Only flaw is it is a little drying on my hair. I used shampoo, conditioner , then my own conditioning treatment- which worked better.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner had a very medicinal smell to them.  The shampoo did not lather well and the conditioner did not leave my hair soft and sleek.  Also, the blue color stayed on my hands.  Lesson learned...just because it says Clairol doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s best for me.  And it was too expensive.  I&#x27;ll stay with Suave.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Just learn how to apply and use of before throwing it on</li>
    <li> I would not order this again..  Your hair is greasy after one day.  And the odor in my hair makes me nauseated.  I have to rinse and rinse.</li>
    <li> i use this once a week to brighten my highlights back up.  It keeps my highlights looking great between treatments.</li>
    <li> This product did wonders to tone out the brassiness left behind by drug store box color (blonde).  I&#x27;ve also used it after professional color to keep my blonde color bright.  It smells absolutely wonderful and leaves your hair smelling fresh even after day 2.</li>
    <li> I love the color of blond hair is tinged with flashes kept harriers, is a good alternative for hair color mantega same as the first day for much longer</li>
    <li> Truly I didn&#x27;t notice any change to the grey in my hair so I gave these products to my husband.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping it would brighten up my hair which has turned quite white. New England water tends to be hard and can make white and grey hair take on a yellowish tone. This product has masked some of the yellowish tinge, but also has made my hair look much more grey and dingy than white. I am not sure if it is the way I am using the product but I have been rather disappointed in the results I have had.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it keeps my white blonde hair white blonde. The shampoo is super-great. I love how it turns my bathwater purple. But the conditioner is a beast. It doesn&#x27;t really condition as well as I&#x27;d like it to, and it stains my white shower curtain. I have to be extra careful when applying. My hairstylist thankfully told me that I should be okay just using the shampoo. So I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t buy the bundle and just go for the shampoo bottle on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo/conditioner for blondes so far! It is great for my highlights, whenever I used it my highlights are whiter and briter. It also smells awesome-- wheniever i used it people ask me about my hair and say it smells great. The only con is that the conditioner could be a little more \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot;-- whenever i used it i always apply a thicker more moisturizing conditioner on top of the shimmer lights.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dark brown so any type of blonde i dye it goes brassy after the first couple of washes.. so when i dyed my dark brown hair dark ash blonde with champagne highlights throughout i was determined to keep the brass out. After the first wash with this shampoo and conditioner i saw a slight but positive difference. i only left it on for 2 minutes the first time because of other reviews claiming it gave there hair a blue-purple tint. so i was a little fearful to leave on the full 5 minutes plus the 2-3 minutes the conditioner says. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and i love it! its cut alot of the brass out of my hair giving me a very subtle natural looking ash tint to my hair..i love my hair color more now after using this than right after i colored it.. the reason i held back on giving it 5 stars is because the smell is AWFUL!! a VERY strong dollar store perfume smell. which bothers my allergies for a few hours after using it each time but i love the results to much to stop using.</li>
    <li> I was told by my Hairdresser to get this product for my White Hair.  I like it but probably will try others when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 60 days now and it has made my blonde highlights bright, but was unable to take the iron out of my hair and It has also made my hair very dry. Did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Recently had my salt and pepper hair frosted and there was too much yellow, so I ordered this to tone it down. The shampoo just stinks, really stinks. I only used a small amount and it does lather well, but even after I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed, the smell was still there. I opened the conditioner hoping it would smell better but it didn&#x27;t and I didn&#x27;t even try it. And it did not tone down the yellow in my hair either so I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for toning down brassiness. My hair is naturally light brown and highlighted blonde. The sun and time between appts. results in reddish streaks. I leave the shampoo on for about 2-3 min. before rinsing. The duo shampoo/conditioner is a great deal! It can be drying but I deep-condition to offset that.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with it leaving  a purple hue on my hair.</li>
    <li> Makes blonde hair really shiny</li>
    <li> This is my second order. I love this product. Makes my gray hair shinier. Both orders were very prompt. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I wanted it to do: tone my brassy hair. If you leave it on for too long it will turn your hair purple, as it is color depositing. It will leave purple spots all over your shower, but these do not stain. My only complaint is that it is not very moisturizing; my hair is chemically processed and therefore dry and damaged and I need a good conditioner. What I do now is wash with the shampoo (1x a week) and mix the conditioner with Redken&#x27;s Heavy Cream.</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy this Product. I tend to dye my hair blonde a lot of the time. I dye it a Dark Ash Blonde Color like 90% of the time I dye my hair. It really helps maintain the Ash tones in my hair. If you leave it on too long you do get a Silver/Blue/Purple tint in your hair. I noticed the tones are more subtle the darker your hair is, and since most of the time I&#x27;m at a Dark Blonde these tones don&#x27;t really show. So I&#x27;m perfectly fine with that. Another thing is the smell is REALLY strong. Smells like Grandma&#x27;s perfume. It does tend to mess with my allergies (it makes me sneeze like crazy in the shower). But overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do if you follow the instructions. Experiment with it to find how long you should leave it on and how often you should use it. Everybody&#x27;s hair is different so different procedures are to be taken. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;Condition&amp;#34; But that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m using this set for. I use my own Conditioner afterwards. I&#x27;ve heard people mix the Conditioner with another one. We&#x27;re all different. But hey This does a good job at toning down the brassiness in hair. I probably would recommend this product to Anybody wanting to buy Purple Shampoo to town down brassiness. The price is really great for both too. each bottle runs about $13 after taxes so you&#x27;d be paying like $24+ For both so the price is really nice!</li>
    <li> Used once or twice a week this product is great.  Takes the yellow out of silver hair which is particularly helpful in the summer when you are in and out of a chlorinated pool.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the brassiness of my bad dye job but then again that could just be time. However, if you have ethnic hair like mine you best bet is to just use the conditioner. The shampoo REALLY dried my hair out to the point that I thought I had changed my texture for ever.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product works great; especially the first couple of times that I used it right after my color treatment. However, after that, it didn&#x27;t seem to have the same effect. Oh well; all in all I think it was worth the money. Once I week, I still use it to keep my blonde looking less brassy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was great for my platinum dyed hair. It kept it looking blonde and kept the yellow/brassy color out! a must have for platinum blondes !!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner combo works amazingly to restore the blonde in my hair. It brightened my color to make it like new again. The smell is not good though so I use a separate conditioner after.</li>
    <li> GREAT, MY GRAY HAIR AND BEARD NEVER LOOKED BETTER.  THANK-YOU</li>
    <li> if you have blonde hair, this is a must!! never be without it</li>
    <li> Those work like a charm! You don&#x27;t necessarily need the shampoo. One or the other works. I usually put the conditioner on and leave it on for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This works so well with my gray hair.  I love the shine that it adds to my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I began going gray in my mid 30&#x27;s and now, in my early 60&#x27;s, my hair is pure white.  I also love sitting in the sun, swimming and being outdoors.  White and silver hair does not do well in the sun, with pool salts or chlorine and general smog/dirt in the air. The hair has a propensity of tuning yellow or mustard/blond and become straw like in texture.  Blue shampoo removes the yellowing.  The issue is whihc shampoo; there are about a dozen on the market that are worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Clairol product has some benefits that I feel are better than others.  It is really purpulish/blue and the deeper the color, the better the effect.  It also leaves the hair in very good condition (using the conditioner), silky and soft. I do blow dry my hair daily and I attribute the great color and soft texture to this shampoo.  You cannot use it everyday and when you do use it, be sure not to leave it on too long (more than 5 min), or you will have a slight blue highlight to your hair (which does go away in a few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this is the best product on the market for people with silver/white hair who wish to avoid, or get rid of, yellowing hair.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo but cannot stomach the smell. There is no way I would buy this again which is a shame because as I said the shampoo is good.  Keeps highlights brilliant and your hair does look great. The smell lingers after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;Please Clairol, change the smell !!!!</li>
    <li> this shampoo will help you avoid looking yellow highlights makes them look a beautiful silver color</li>
    <li> I have white and silver hair and one day, after using this for about 2 months, one of my cooworkers saw me in the sunlight and asked me why my hair was blue. THAT was embarrassing!!</li>
    <li> My ombre was looking very brassy after getting it done, I used this product and saw a difference after one wash!&lt;br /&gt;I only gave four stars because this product is VERY runny out of the bottle. It got absolutely everywhere.</li>
    <li> Both shampoo and conditioner are violet hair toners. And this is the reason they work. They don&#x27;t remove the yellow tint but cover hair with a thin layer of violet colour, which makes hair look less yellowish. Because both products are toners it is important to follow the instructions and leave them on the hair for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the overall result, although my nails were toned during the process (not that bad thing, as they look a bit whiter and bluish tint washed out in 1 day). I don&#x27;t like the consistence of these products, especially the conditioner: it&#x27;s too liquid.&lt;br /&gt;These products work just fine for dyed and naturally light hair, but there is almost no effect on henna treated hair.</li>
    <li> great for white hair silver hair and gray hair makes it shine all makes hair stronger</li>
    <li> I started going gray when I was 14.  Colored my hair for years &amp; when I turned 45 I gave that up.  Grew out my naturally silver hair &amp; wanted to make it  -*S*H*I*N*E*-  This product does that!  I only use it once or twice a week.  I also rotate a very deep conditioner  because my hair is still thick and it needs more conditioning than is available in this set.</li>
    <li> Use daily-great shine!</li>
    <li> Shimmer Lights is pretty awful. It does tone down the brassiness but it smells like Raid.. so if you want to smell like roach killer this is definitely the smell for you-- I&#x27;m a short girl and my boyfriend is a tall dude so I really care what my hair smells like and this is not a man-impressing smell. Also, it deposits so much color on your hair that you actually can&#x27;t even comb through it.. so my hair is dry and tangled and it got to the point where i didn&#x27;t even want to wash my hair because of what it was doing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have colored my hair since i was in high school so a good 10 years and I have used almost all color protect hair products under the sun, this one is by far my least favorite product ever!</li>
    <li> After the first wash you can certainly see a difference, but you need to be sure to follow the directions exactly. After the first wash I still had some brassiness showing through, so I used it the following day too. That was a mistake. It really dulled down my hair and made my golden blond locks appear a darker blond with zero shine. Not only that, but if used back-to-back like this, it will really weigh down your hair. After some more trial and error, I have found that this works best if used every other wash, or even just every third wash. No matter how I used it though, my hair still appeared to be brassy - not as brassy as before, but brassy.The shampoo and conditioner leave your hair feeling a little rough while it&#x27;s still wet, and the conditioner does not aid in detangling like most conditioners do. As you start to dry your hair you begin to feel the softness you would expect from a duo like this. Overall I would recommend this product for blondes that do not have gold in their hair, for blondes that have more of an ashy appearance, and for blondes with minimal brass in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have golden blonde hair like me, this is what I have found to work: Use John Frieda Go Blonder Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 4 times a week, the other 3 times a week alternate in this purple shampoo. I have found that to be as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> I was happy after I used the shampoo and conditioner because it does really take the golden hue out of blonde hair. The drawbacks are that the smell is strong and it does leave hair a little tangled but nothing a little leave in conditioner cant help. I do recommend this product for its hue correction</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like how it stains shower</li>
    <li> the best hair product for gray hair</li>
    <li> This products really works on helping get rid of the yellow tones in my hair. The only reason I gave it a four is because I personally don&#x27;t like the smell of it but otherwise it was fast shipping and i&#x27;ll defiantly be buying it again when i run out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but it does help a little bit with brassy brown hair. (I know it&#x27;s for blonde and silver, but it also works for brown!) Downsides...it does smell pretty strongly of old lady, and it&#x27;s a bit drying, even the conditioner. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel much like conditioner actually; it&#x27;s more runny than creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing. Overall not a bad product. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the expense, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting a lot compliments.</li>
    <li> It is really good! I was pleasantly surprised.made my hair almost platinum and took out almost all of the left behind blonde dye.</li>
    <li> I like Shimmering Lights by Clairol, but I wish it smelled a little better. They are not sold in the big box stores, but at local beauty supply stores and here on Amazon. The latter has the best prices, of course.</li>
    <li> As a rule I am fine with Clairol products. These two are very disappointing. I agree that the conditioner does nothing. It just makes a mess and leaves my dry hair drier. What is the worst is that both products smell like very cheap \\&quot;lavender\\&quot; soap. And you can&#x27;t get the smell out. It stayed in my hair for days. The scent was so bad it made my eyes water and I sneezed like crazy. I finally just washed them both out with Herbal Essence Hydralicious, and then put in John Frieda shampoo and conditioner for blonde hair. I was hoping that the Clairol for Tinted Hair would tone down the bad dye job left from the nightmare L&#x27;Oreal Feria Ombre experience I had. I used these several times in hopes they would help. I put up with the cheap, old-lady \\&quot;lavender\\&quot; soap smell just in hopes that the purple would tone the red down a bit. Waste of time. I finally had waited 4 weeks since the dye job distaster with Feria, so overdyed with Garnier Light Ash Blonde 91, and that helped more. I still have red so may order the Fudge Purple. I only ordered these because the Fudge Purple takes so long to get here and I needed something right away. I should have bought the Fudge Purple and just had a bit more patience. You get what you pay for. I would not recommend these unless you have no allergies or chemical sensitivities; and if you don&#x27;t care if your conditioner makes your hair feel like dry straw hay.</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews complaining about the smell and should&#x27;ve heeded them. It was a horrible chemical smell and very strong. I actually did try the shampoo and conditioner once and did not notice any particular difference over my regular products, aside from the smell. I won&#x27;t be using them again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo I like very much but, the rinse is watery in consistency and doesn&#x27;t work well on grey hair.</li>
    <li> I recommend that blondes use this once a week (twice MAX) to keep out the brassiness that plague us. Keeps blonde hair nice and &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, how I like it. Warning - overuse and your hair will be purple! I love the smell, and have to resist using it all the time. Also, a great price.</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo.  The conditioner is a little weak.</li>
    <li> It had been highly recommended for white hair - it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> does wonders for grey hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo dyed my lightest highlights purple!!! I wanted to get rid of some brassiness at my roots, and it says on the bottle that for extra lift, leave it on for up to 5 minutes in the shower, so I did....when I got out I saw that my lightest blonde highlights were very, very purple!!!! I immediately got back in the shower and shampooed with my regular shampoo 3 or 4 times and that took some of it out, but some of them are still purple! Also, it did not help the brassiness at my roots at all! Now I still have orangey roots and some weird purple streaks. If you use this to lift highlights, do NOT let it sit in your hair!</li>
    <li> smells awesome, and always brightens up my ash blonde to almost white 😛 can tend to dry hair out a little tho so I mix just a little bit of hair whip but pureology (also smells amazing and helps extend color) when I condition my hair. Comes out feeling oh so soft!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this stuff LEGIT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;I did a terrible dyejob, my hair was a really brassy orangishblonde. So then I was an idiot and tried to DIY a toner to bring out different hues(food coloring &amp; vinegar). That was ANOTHER fail, it ended up pink. So finally I bought this and I&#x27;m back to my usual blonde bombshell self. It works wonders, seriously! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> My hair is frosted since it was neither brown or gray.  The Shimmer Lights combo gives me shine and body for my fine hair.  Plus, people tell me how good my hair smells.</li>
    <li> Lovvvvvve this shampoo and conditioner! I can definitely tell the difference in my highlights when using it.  Yes, it is very drying.  You can get around this by 1) Mixing it with your regular shampoo and conditioner 2) Not using it every day 3) not using both products the same day.  I like to mix it with a regular color-safe shampoo and conditioner about every other day.  I also use a leave-in conditioner afterwards.  Honestly though, the brightening aspect trumps the dryness, at least to me.</li>
    <li> I got this on the suggestion of my hairdresser.  I lighten my natural color and it can start looking harsh after being in the sun for long periods of time.  My daughter has highlights which can start looking a bit brassy over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how he suggested using these products, which is a bit different from the directions on the packaging.  Wet hair, lather and leave the shampoo on for five minutes.  Rinse, then wash with a color-sensitive shampoo, because while this is great for color, it&#x27;s not great for cleansing the scalp.  Then use the conditioner, also for five minutes.  It makes for a long shower but it only needs to be done once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you - the products are purple and get all over everything in the shower.</li>
    <li> I tried this last year after letting my gray hair grow out for the past year.  First off, like many others, I can&#x27;t get past the sickening, perfume smell.  Also, I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefit to the look or feel of my hair.  The conditioner is a joke, very thin consistency.  So after a year of trying it off and on again, I can&#x27;t get past the smell or lack of any positive results, so in the garbage it goes and I&#x27;ll stick with my softening shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t See Anything When I used This Product, my hair still the same</li>
    <li> Greatest care for silver hair ever. Always super delivery.</li>
    <li> this works fantastically except for the persistently pungent floral smell.</li>
    <li> As a toner, the conditioner does its job. However it doesn&#x27;t seem to condition well at all. The shampoo is very strong-smelling, actually the smell of both the shampoo and the conditioner is intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavily perfumed, I&#x27;d describe it as a very chemical/floral scent or an extremely \\&quot;old-school grandmother\\&quot; smell. (No offense to any grandmothers out there!) That being said, this product does help with toning out yellow/brassy shades in blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you leave the conditioner on for a few minutes you can really see the toning effect, however the formula of both the shampoo and the conditioner is very runny and hard to apply evenly. (Plus, the smell!) I find that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel particularly clean after using the shampoo(and that terrible scent lingers on my hair forever afterwards). And it doesn&#x27;t feel especially conditioned after using the conditioner. But, it DOES tone out brassiness. So at least there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(But, oh god, THE SMELL).</li>
    <li> I have only used this product twice so far, but it does good things for my hair already. I have not noticed a change in color, whiter white or purple tinge as some folks reported. But, my hair feels soft and is very shiny. Since I have very dry, dull hair, this important to me.&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight scent to the shampoo and conditioner, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant at all. It does not smell medicinal or like a permanent solution to me. The color, deep cobalt blue, did surprise me though. Be prepared for a very strong color in the product itself. I plan to use the shampoo and conditioner to see what happens after continued use. I expect good things. *S*</li>
    <li> Took all the yellow out of my hair. It&#x27;s fabulous. You might have to leave it for a little while the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my silver and grey really shine.</li>
    <li> This product definitely changed the tone of my blond highlights and I&#x27;m really happy with how bright they are now. The problem I have is that this product is extremely drying and the conditioner is awful. It doesn&#x27;t really nourish  my hair so I&#x27;ve been using another conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this shampoo improved my hair color or condition at all.  This has a strong scent that I didn&#x27;t care for.  The purple product can get onto surfaces and towels but washes right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave lathers so much better.</li>
    <li> This product dried out my hair alot. But, it helped bring the ashiness back into the blonde. It was a bit weird because it took a day or two for it to get darker. My hair got alot lighter from being in the sun all summer. To get your hair a darker ash blonde with this product, leave it on DRY hair for an hour. Then rinse it out. As recommended by my stylist.</li>
    <li> I will say that I am not the biggest fan of the way it smells, but I have got complements on how bright me blonde looks. It also does not give you the silky smooth hair after conditioning, but I don&#x27;t know if it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser and I are absolutely amazed at the shine and softness that my hair now has after using these products. I am enjoying the look that my gray hair now has.&lt;br /&gt;Martha</li>
    <li> Loreal Paris colorist secrets..I couldn&#x27;t use this product..I am allergic to regular die..and I was not able to return the item so I lost my money..I am not happy</li>
    <li> Doing the job I wanted.</li>
    <li> I personally loved this product. It made my bleach blonde look very shiny, my hair was soft, and I actually really like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner do indeed brighten white and gray hair while toning down yellow  overtones. I was aware that both the shampoo and conditioner are a vivid violet but was  a bit startled that I was standing in a pool of violet water. good news- no staining of the tub or my feet.  Both the shampoo and conditioner have a consistency that ranges toward the thicker rather than thinner side.</li>
    <li> The two bottles shampoo and conditioner are perfet set, do the job that I expect every body loves my gray hair</li>
    <li> Shampoo good, conditioner a little watery.</li>
    <li> Not one to really buy these sort of products online, but the price was good. My wife is the primary user and prefers this CLAIROL product over other brands.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of cleansing, adding shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to darken the hair.  Could do with a bit less bluing!</li>
    <li> Although this does what it says by brightening blonde hair- it left my hair very dry and brittle feeling.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have dark, steel gray hair, streaked with bands of silver white. I rather like my gray hair when the white streaks are actually white, so I&#x27;ve used generic versions of Clairol \\&quot;Shimmer Lights\\&quot; for several years. This month, I decided to pay a few extra dollars, try the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; and save myself a trip to the beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Shimmer Lights\\&quot; along with all of the other \\&quot;toner\\&quot; shampoos I&#x27;ve tried did what it said it would do. It added some light purple tinting to my hair. Normally, the tinting makes my white streaks look whiter. However, \\&quot;Shimmer Lights\\&quot; did quite a bit of tinting with one application. My white hair actually looked darker than normal after using it. No yellowing visible anymore, which was good, but the white was blending in more with the steel gray. I don&#x27;t mind the \\&quot;look\\&quot;, the hair looks more uniform now, and I suspect the dramatic white streaks will be back again after a few washings. I&#x27;m just mentioning the heavier tinting for women that want to avoid actually darkening their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers have complained that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition. I suspect what they really mean is that \\&quot;Shimmer Lights\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t moisturize. It is a very light, non-oily conditioner. My hair isn&#x27;t particularly dry, so it worked well enough for me. My hair dried out smooth and was easy to comb, which is really all I need from a conditioner. People with dry hair might prefer a thicker, moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one real complaint, in common with a lot of other reviewers. \\&quot;Shimmer Lights\\&quot; smells like my Grandmother&#x27;s perfume. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it, a heavy, old-fashioned rose scent, with some musk, perhaps patchouli. My grandmother had sachet packets in her closets that made all her linens smell just like this shampoo. It&#x27;s not a nasty smell, in fact it was probably considered a very nice scent at one time, but the association with old lady is rather disconcerting for those of us who slippinginto Grandma age. I wouldn&#x27;t mind looking like my Grandma, she was a lovely woman and I&#x27;ll be fortunate to age as gracefully as she aged, but I&#x27;d really rather not smell like her!</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal with shimmer lights. It does do what it says as toning down brasiness in hair (it also helps maintain purple hair if you have purple hair like I did for a while) My only complaints are the shampoo is very drying and way more harsh on my hair than my usual shampoos (which is terrifying when you have bleached hair), and that the conditioner barely conditions. Not to mention it has this smell that I don&#x27;t love but don&#x27;t hate... I just kind of tolerate it. Nowadays I mostly use this as a way to strip my hair before I dye it some new funky color, which is kind of a testament to how drying the shampoo really is.</li>
    <li> This due works well and takes out brassy tones for blonde hair, however, the smell is absolutely too strong. It actually gives me a headache so I HATE using it!</li>
