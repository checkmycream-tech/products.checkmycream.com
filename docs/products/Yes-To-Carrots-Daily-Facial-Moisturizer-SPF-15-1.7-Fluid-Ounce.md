      <li>/&gt;Please do your own research before you decide.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice consistency.</li>
      <li>To products, but the smell is very strong...</li>
      <li>RP is one of the best antioxidants found naturally in skin.</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s very important to me.</li>
      <li>it is very surprising that Yes To made a sunscreen under the Yes To Carrots line since carrots naturally contain vitamin A.</li>
      <li>I have not found better for the price.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this lotion.</li>
      <li>Love the Yes</li>
      <li>Might be better for non-powder-makeup wearers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to put the sunscreen to the test, but I love how it feels going on and how it feels throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I got a MUCH better rate here.</li>
      <li>Despite not liking the smell I have continued to purchase it for the safe SPF and the nice light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use about 1/3 then use the Yes to Carrots Tomatoes to moisturize if my skin needs something more to moisturize.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly zinc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, not greasy.</li>
      <li>Better to have some SPF than none at all,</li>
      <li>I usually love yes to but this time idk I&#x27;m just not living this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Probably not so good for people with dry skin, but if you have oily or combination skin its great</li>
      <li>Smells pretty good</li>
      <li>It is a light facial moisturizer and so happy to see that it has SPF in it!</li>
      <li>I think this is true for most moisturizers with some sort of SPF protection.</li>
      <li>Finally, others have mentioned a very light, pleasant lotion fragrance, which I noticed as well, but after it goes on it has a strong mildew odor.</li>
      <li>put on my mineral powder after applying the moisturizer and it felt and looked fine.  </li>
      <li>I have used BB Cream after using this lotion and it was fine, but no powder with a make up brush.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin, but this moisturizer is light and doesn&#x27;t make me feel</li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t any kind of smell to this.</li>
      <li>I wanted a cheap moisturizer that also had SPF in it.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, and it goes on smooth, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>They do have a fragrance free version, which I didn&#x27;t realize.</li>
      <li>It is a bit easy to just pump and get a lot out, so don&#x27;t give yourself the full pump.</li>
      <li>: If you like feeling that your skin has a protective layer and don&#x27;t mind the slightly-coated feeling, this is a great natural product at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my skin feeling light and clean and not like I just put an spf moisturizer in.</li>
      <li>My skin absorbed the product well and it has a pleasant scent while leaving my skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many drug store products over the years, and by far this has been my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs fast and feels very light under my makeup.  </li>
      <li>Yes To produces generally good products; this moisturizer is a BIG exception.</li>
      <li>Good for daily use, but not for exposure to the sun.</li>
      <li>I use this on days when I am not going to be in full sun.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance-free but has its own mild, natural scent - not offensive at all.</li>
      <li>I really love this moisturizer with SPF because I am running in and out of the house all the time, often into some pretty intense sun.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great moisturizer for summer - substantial but not too heavy.</li>
      <li>My grandgirls  use this and love the way it helps to keep their complexions dewy looking and soft.  </li>
      <li>So far... I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>never use \\&quot;one full pump\\&quot; on products that comes with pumps because they always give out too much, so that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.  </li>
      <li>I even reapplied 10 minutes later with more and it still absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a very mild lotion type smell that completely goes away after a minute.</li>
      <li>I like the Yes to brand in general, because they are mostly natural, but still work, feel nice, and have a nice scent (with so many other natural products I feel like I&#x27;m compromising on feel and scent).</li>
      <li>That is why most antiaging and acne products that contain these ingredients stress to only use them during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would reapply every 3 or 4 hours depending on how hot it was.</li>
      <li>and my skin stays moisturized, smooth, and clear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to see how this moisturizer effects my skin in the hot summer months of Texas</li>
      <li>To Carrots line and was interested in trying it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer!!</li>
      <li>As a sunscreen it is ok but it should not be called a daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am excited to keep using this moisturizer daily and as a powerful night moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this mostly natural  moisturizer and the morning after it arrived</li>
      <li>but so far I am very satisfied and I will continue using it for a long time.</li>
      <li>If I plan on being outside for more than an hour I put on a real sunblock.</li>
      <li>I like how lightweight it is and the ingredient list is pretty pure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for preventing premature aging, hyper pigmentation, acne, acne scars, and has various other benefits.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too much, if you use the entire amount in one \\&quot;pump\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>This was a real hit with them.</li>
      <li>It does not cause me to break-out, and after about an hour I can&#x27;t really tell I put anything on.</li>
      <li>If I do a very generous amount then I can spread it with no problem but the.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
      <li>it is very beneficial and does not cause skin cancer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a house rabbit, and when I learned that cosmetic companies do animal testing on their products, I immediately began looking for alternatives for cruelty free facial moisturizers that didn&#x27;t break the bank (broke student here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>liked the actual moisturizer from my last bottle I finished.</li>
      <li>Just wish there were more options without fragrance and other &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients that were in this price range.</li>
      <li>I have used one full bottle of the product you see on their picture (the daily spf 15 moisturizer).</li>
      <li>That is no guarantee that older formulations aren&#x27;t still out there, but you should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It definitely absorbs better than regular sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I did not realize this product&#x27;s main purpose is sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It looks super white on my face!</li>
      <li>I am mildly prone to breakouts and this has worked well for me for the last year.  </li>
      <li>They make the skin very sensitive to the sun and actually increase the chances of developing cancer tremendously.</li>
      <li>and I had no negative side effects.</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on, I definitely put on too much.</li>
      <li>As for the smell, I don&#x27;t think it resembles urine like someone else said, and my bf has not complained.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is for the product only. This moisturizer was Ineffective for me &amp; my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I did not realize this product&#x27;s main purpose is sunscreen. It&#x27;s mostly zinc. As a sunscreen it is ok but it should not be called a daily moisturizer. The scent is so so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been through a couple of moisturizers. I have combination skin-oily to dry. I live in Texas and the sun shines all year round. This winter my face was pretty dry and I was getting some minor break-outs. I started using this product every day and my face doesn&#x27;t break out and my skin stays moisturized, smooth, and clear. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. There really isn&#x27;t any kind of smell to this. It has a very mild lotion type smell that completely goes away after a minute. This product only improved my skin and I had no negative side effects. I&#x27;ll have to see how this moisturizer effects my skin in the hot summer months of Texas but so far I am very satisfied and I will continue using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Pros: Paraben, SLS-free. SPF with natural ingredients. Fragrance-free but has its own mild, natural scent - not offensive at all. Gender-neutral packaging and scent, in my opinion.  Cons: It&#x27;s easy to use too much, if you use the entire amount in one \\&quot;pump\\&quot;. You will feel like you are wearing a coating of shortening. Start with a SMALL amount and add more if needed. Even after waiting 5-10 minutes and then applying mineral powder makeup, I felt the moisturizer stayed on top of my skin instead of absorbing in, which made my makeup brush on too thickly in some areas.  Overall: If you like feeling that your skin has a protective layer and don&#x27;t mind the slightly-coated feeling, this is a great natural product at a very reasonable price. Might be better for non-powder-makeup wearers. If, like me, you prefer to feel that your skin is \\&quot;naked\\&quot;, you might want to try Juice Beauty products.</li>
    <li> So far... I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin on my face; it&#x27;s so dry that after I shower, it feels tight unless I moisturize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use \\&quot;one full pump\\&quot; on products that comes with pumps because they always give out too much, so that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.  My skin absorbed the product well and it has a pleasant scent while leaving my skin hydrated and soft.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have grease on my face or anything.  I even reapplied 10 minutes later with more and it still absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on my mineral powder after applying the moisturizer and it felt and looked fine.  I couldn&#x27;t feel anything weighing down on my face and I couldn&#x27;t see speckles of the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well it will protect against the sun though- it has a SPF of 15 but I live at 9,100 feet.  Better to have some SPF than none at all, I guess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for people with a dry face.</li>
    <li> My rating has nothing to do with the actual product-I never opened it. I use the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep site and thought that this was rated a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;, so I bought it. After I got the product, I scanned the barcode with my app from them and found it is a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;, so I returned it. Just wish there were more options without fragrance and other &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients that were in this price range.</li>
    <li> I first bought this a little over a year ago after having an allergic reaction to Derma e products. My face had broken out in a horrible rash, then dried up and flaked. Ick! I needed to find a cream with SPF that would also moisturize and not irritate my skin. This has worked perfectly and no allergic reaction! I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd bottle today.</li>
    <li> Overall this is not an especially horrible daily sunscreen moisturizer. It does leave a rather white coat but goes away after it fully absorbs and is a little greasy just like most other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major factor that discontinued my use was that it contains Retinyl Palmitate, which is a vitamin A derivative. It&#x27;s great for preventing premature aging, hyper pigmentation, acne, acne scars, and has various other benefits. However, vitamin A derivitives such as retinol, retinoids, and retinyls are not meant for daytime use. They make the skin very sensitive to the sun and actually increase the chances of developing cancer tremendously. That is why most antiaging and acne products that contain these ingredients stress to only use them during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is very surprising that Yes To made a sunscreen under the Yes To Carrots line since carrots naturally contain vitamin A. The sunscreen idea could have been implemented in the other Yes To lines like the blueberries and cucumbers and it would have been great and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not recommended at all, and I actually ended up returning it because I wouldn&#x27;t want to give someone else the product not because the product itself is awful, but because of the overall health concerns associated with the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency. Easier to apply. I like that the company is eco-friendly. That&#x27;s very important to me. There&#x27;s no fragrance which is good for me. I don&#x27;t like products to have a smell.</li>
    <li> If you truly have dry skin, skip this product.  I put two layers on my face and my skin still feels tight.  I was hoping for a miracle moisturizer but all I got was another dud.  I would say this is for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin.  People who have dry, flaky skin keep searching....</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this mostly natural  moisturizer and the morning after it arrived I happily applied it before rushing off to work. All day at work I kept smelling a disturbing odor. To my dismay, I realized the smell was coming from my face. My face smelled like one of my grandma&#x27;s old dish towels. Eau de rotten vegetables. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer with SPF because I am running in and out of the house all the time, often into some pretty intense sun. Only wish it were a little stronger SPF. The Yes to Blueberries with SPF 30 (I think) has an ingredient am allergic to.</li>
    <li> I just read some negative reviews regarding the ill-supported claims about the retinyl palmitate (RP) in this product and felt compelled to defend my favorite DAYTIME sunscreen. RP is one of the best antioxidants found naturally in skin. There was an article by the FDA in 2010 about RP and tumor growth that turned out to be poorly researched. So as long as RP is well formulated and stable (as in Yes To) it is very beneficial and does not cause skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Please do your own research before you decide.&lt;br /&gt;SOURCES:&lt;br /&gt;Toxicology and Industrial Health, May 2006, pages 181-191&lt;br /&gt;Photochemistry and Photobiology, November-December 2010, pages 1,390-1,396).</li>
    <li> I kid you not. My face is so dry, this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t get soaked in and my face feel immediately dry. It keeps it moisturized and soft. I tried this once on a whim and I will never go back.</li>
    <li> My grandgirls  use this and love the way it helps to keep their complexions dewy looking and soft.  This was a real hit with them.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling light and clean and not like I just put an spf moisturizer in. However, I deducted 1 star because of the smell! I hate the way it smells!</li>
    <li> A few reviews commented on retinyl palmitate - that must be from an older formulation because the moisturizer I received did not include it. That is no guarantee that older formulations aren&#x27;t still out there, but you should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizer for summer - substantial but not too heavy. Minus one star for the fragrance. It&#x27;s an artificial fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t even smell good. They do have a fragrance free version, which I didn&#x27;t realize. I will purchase that next time. Despite not liking the smell I have continued to purchase it for the safe SPF and the nice light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated to add: this product sells in my local target for almost $18. I got a MUCH better rate here.</li>
    <li> Great product, but greasy, so not good for oily skin. Works well for dry skin.</li>
    <li> i have sensitive skin, no breakouts. Probably not so good for people with dry skin, but if you have oily or combination skin its great</li>
    <li> I wanted a cheap moisturizer that also had SPF in it. This is a low SPF, but I tend to tan, not burn, so I was just looking for a little bit of sun protection for short sun exposure. If I plan on being outside for more than an hour I put on a real sunblock. The first time I put it on, I definitely put on too much. If you find you do this, putting the extra on your neck tends to work well. Even without putting it on too thick, you can still feel it on. I think this is true for most moisturizers with some sort of SPF protection. It definitely absorbs better than regular sunscreen. I do not put make-up over it, so I cannot say anything about how well it might work with that. It does not cause me to break-out, and after about an hour I can&#x27;t really tell I put anything on. It does have a slight fragrance, but it is not really noticeable after a few minutes, and I do not find it unpleasant. Overall, I do like this product and plan to continue to use it. I have not found better for the price. Bonus that it is not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> I use this on days when I am not going to be in full sun.  I like how lightweight it is and the ingredient list is pretty pure.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this lotion. I have heard of the Yes To Carrots line and was interested in trying it. I found this lotion at Tuesday Morning on sale for only $5.99 and decided to give it a shot. WOW! My skin is in heaven and feels so revitalizes. I would recommend this product to people with dry/normal skin as it instantly hydrates.  I can see people with oily skin having issues with the potency of this product. I am excited to keep using this moisturizer daily and as a powerful night moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I have a deep brown complexion and suffer from hyper-pigmentation. I would usually use an acne moisturizer, but this moisturizers and protects my skin! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. I have used other SPF moisturizers in the past, none coated my face like this one. save your money</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer but if I rub my eyes even 12 hours later it makes them burn like crazy. No other moisturizers have affected me like this and I&#x27;ve tested this one multiple days with the same effect.</li>
    <li> Love the Yes To products, but the smell is very strong...&lt;br /&gt;Takes over any  other scent.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months and my skin has a nice glow!</li>
    <li> Despite the vegetable-based marketing, this product is not as natural as it seems. It contains a host of chemicals, including retinyl palimate, which may cause or accelerate the growth of skin cancers. Chemical complaints aside, it never seems to absorb in to my skin, and stays a little sticky all day. Worst of all, it does absolutely nothing to moisturize. My cheeks are so dry after just a few weeks that they actually burn, and my T-zone is producing oil on overtime to compensate. Yes To produces generally good products; this moisturizer is a BIG exception. Try Yes To Blueberries instead.</li>
    <li> I have used one full bottle of the product you see on their picture (the daily spf 15 moisturizer). However when I placed my order, they delivered a Nourishing spf 15 sun screen type of daily cream. It made my skin so white looking b/c of the sunscreen not blending in properly. :( had to return it. Talk to amazon chat people before placing an order. Or buy from drugstore.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the actual moisturizer from my last bottle I finished. Just dont trust buying it from this link.</li>
    <li> About half way through this bottle and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen AT ALL. Its a natural product I believe and it is works with my very sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a daily moisturizer if I am going to go outside at all. But if I&#x27;m going to spend a whole day outside in the sun, this wouldn&#x27;t be enough. you&#x27;d probably want to add an spf 30 to forehead, nose, cheek apples, chin and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can even use this around my delicate eye area and my skin always looks and feels healthy and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t even use the Eucerin for sensitive skin because it dries out my face and irritates skin badly around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes to Carrots is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I think my skin must be drier than other reviewers because I do not find this to be oily at all.  I&#x27;ve tried many drug store products over the years, and by far this has been my favorite.  I put it on about 5 minutes after I get out of the shower and then 5 minutes later I apply my mineral make up. I also apply again at night after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> This product has become a regular in my make-up kit because of Yes to Carrot&#x27;s reputation.  The product is non-greasy and works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> They need to make a fragrance-free version of this product.  I can&#x27;t stand the current urine-like odor.  It&#x27;s not strong, but it is offensive none the less.  My wife likes the ingredients, but the smell is killing me.</li>
    <li> Not oily at all. I work outdoors for long hours and would use this as my sunscreen. I would reapply every 3 or 4 hours depending on how hot it was. It&#x27;s nice and light, not greasy. Smells pretty good and you won&#x27;t be putting a bunch of chemicals on your face like a lot of other spf lotions contain</li>
    <li> My skin is on the dry side, and I like this compared to the Yes To Carrots Cucumber SPF. This one is thinner and applies (in my opinion) easier that way to the skin. You do need to rub it in, but I don&#x27;t feel it leaves a residue on my skin, now that being said, I don&#x27;t try to apply make up on my face after either. I have used BB Cream after using this lotion and it was fine, but no powder with a make up brush. As for the smell, I don&#x27;t think it resembles urine like someone else said, and my bf has not complained. It is a bit easy to just pump and get a lot out, so don&#x27;t give yourself the full pump. I use about 1/3 then use the Yes to Carrots Tomatoes to moisturize if my skin needs something more to moisturize. This I strictly use for the SPF.</li>
    <li> The smell that other reviewers have complained about doesn&#x27;t bother me.  However, it does leave a white chaulky film on my skin.  I have extremely dry skin.  I have been looking for a good moisturizer without parabens but I guess this isn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
    <li> If you like girlfriend with soft faces, get this for her.  Seriously, it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells good and makes her happy, so what is not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, all upside!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love this product. Makes for chalky white pasty finish and caused breakouts on my acne-prone face. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a house rabbit, and when I learned that cosmetic companies do animal testing on their products, I immediately began looking for alternatives for cruelty free facial moisturizers that didn&#x27;t break the bank (broke student here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I bought and tried out the product, I was amazed! It is a light facial moisturizer and so happy to see that it has SPF in it! I&#x27;m going to be a forever user!</li>
    <li> Convenient size and dispensing.  Only moisturizer that I have found to not irritate my eyes.  Not greasy.  I am mildly prone to breakouts and this has worked well for me for the last year.  I like the heavier night time version as well.</li>
    <li> Total waste of hard earned money. Loads of disappoinment, deception, and a waste of time and energy on yes products that offer little to the consumer if that!</li>
    <li> The store was out of Burt&#x27;s Bees so I bought this instead. I didn&#x27;t realize until I got home and opened the box it has a pump with no way to get at the inside of the container. I find that packaging wasteful. The pump itself also wastes a lot of product. Pump it once and enough for 12 people comes out. Even a very thin coat made my face very shiny, and it feels heavy on the skin like it is not sinking in. Finally, others have mentioned a very light, pleasant lotion fragrance, which I noticed as well, but after it goes on it has a strong mildew odor. That for me was the deal breaker. My hands stink after applying it, and my eyes are burning.</li>
    <li> I like this product as a facial moisturizer AND face protector....with the sunscreen!!  I highly recommend this moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> This is a great, lightweight, smooth moisturizer. I&#x27;ve yet to put the sunscreen to the test, but I love how it feels going on and how it feels throughout the day. I have oily skin, but this moisturizer is light and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/22/13 - was out in the sun running errands and was sunburnt within the hour. This didn&#x27;t offer me any protection. Good for daily use, but not for exposure to the sun. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I usually love yes to but this time idk I&#x27;m just not living this moisturizer. It becomes dry almost immediately and is too hard to spread on my face. If I do a very generous amount then I can spread it with no problem but the. It looks super white on my face!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo by Yes, and the smell is divine!  I bought this to use as my daily sunscreen, but it is a bit sticky on my face, so I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a daily moisturizer that contained sunscreen, and was a natural product (no parabens or phthalates). I like the Yes to brand in general, because they are mostly natural, but still work, feel nice, and have a nice scent (with so many other natural products I feel like I&#x27;m compromising on feel and scent). My skin is oily, so I find this moisturizer a bit heavy - but it&#x27;s perfect for winter. In the summer I wear something lighter, but this is great for winter.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Like it because of the sunscreen component. I also use the Yes to Tomatos as my nightly mositurizer. Somewhat difficult to smooth on and can leave a white film but I put on right after washing off cleanser when skin is still damp and it works great.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A NON-GREASY/NON-OILY MOISTURIZER THAT KEEPS MY SKIN LUBRICATED IN A WINTER DESERT DRY CLIMATE. I LIKE THE DISPENSER BOTTLE TOO.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because it has SPF and is paraben-free.  I absolutely love it!  I have combination skin, and it goes on smooth, not greasy.  It absorbs fast and feels very light under my makeup.  I wear it every day.</li>
