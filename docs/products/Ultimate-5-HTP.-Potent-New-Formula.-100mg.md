      <li>I need to order more.  </li>
      <li>It also helps you sleep better and</li>
      <li>I sleep better and seem to stay on an even keel.</li>
      <li>Most definately feel better on these.</li>
      <li>Better sleep and mood</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product and I have tried a few and this by far makes me feel the best- very quickly!  </li>
      <li>I found 5HTP which I knew was good as a sleep aid, but wasn&#x27;t aware of the appetite control effect.</li>
      <li>But that is better than having a full breakdown!</li>
      <li>Plus the manufacturer is super nice.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I also have a greatly increased feeling of contentment, well-being and stress release.</li>
      <li>Now I am able to relax, enjoy life.</li>
      <li>I found them easy to swallow and did not experience stomach upset, though I always take 5-HTP with food.</li>
      <li>I know that nothing gets rid of the habitual snacking, but getting rid of the strong craving part helps.</li>
      <li>Absolutely high quality, zest products are my new best friend, thank you</li>
      <li>but my quality of sleep as well!&lt;br /&gt;I have been on anti-depressants or mood-stabilizers for many years, and I can honestly say this natural supplement does a better job of stabilizing my mood and alleviating stress and anxiety..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I started taking a capsule of 5 HTP every night, before bed, I have been waking up feeling amazing and ready to take on the day!</li>
      <li>, it was fine, bt I had some stomach issues with it.  </li>
      <li>And I was glad to have received the item so quickly.</li>
      <li>This awesome little pill will help provide relief from symptoms of anxiety and depression and it also supports restful sleep.  </li>
      <li>I had no stomach issues with this, no wild jitters, no beneficient &#x27;buddha-like starring&#x27;--just a very pleasant calm.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Increasing the level of serotonin can make a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found a formula that actually fulfills it&#x27;s promise!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let me start with boy do I know quite a few people that can use this in their life. This is a daily supplement that will help boost your mood.  This awesome little pill will help provide relief from symptoms of anxiety and depression and it also supports restful sleep.  This pill can start helping you in the first day you start taking it.&lt;br /&gt;  This review showed up at just the right time for me.  I am quitting smoking again.  Anyone who has ever gone through this journey knows how hard it can be.  You have the wonderful cravings and mood swings.  The mood swings is always the hardest part for my family.  I don’t get mean but I do get moody and I get really stupid.  Please don’t take that in a bad way what I mean is I just don’t think straight I will forgot how to do something that I do every day.  I started taking this pill and I can say it has helped.  I don’t feel the mood swings at all, and my family has even noticed a difference.  Hubby says my mood this time is so much better than last time.  He is no longer afraid to approach me for simple questions.&lt;br /&gt;  This is a very easy pill to take it is not a horse pill so taking 2 pills is very easy.  I keep it next to my morning drink so I remember every day.  Even if I did not remember I am sure hubby would track me down and give me my two pills for the day.lol  No matter what you are going through or if it’s just everyday life these can really make a difference in your life.  I would recommend them to everyone</li>
    <li> Helps with sleep.  Trust me, anything that helps get the rest I need I love.</li>
    <li> I have taken several different brands and forms of 5-htp but this one has made me a believer! I am FINALLY sleeping through the night and I wake up feeling rested rather than the usual sensation that I&#x27;ve been in a wrestling match all night long. I highly recommend this specific 5-htp!</li>
    <li> Not getting enough sleep can make me really irritable, and sort of depressed. Serotonin is one of the things that affects your sleep. It also affects appetite (which explains why I eat so much more when I&#x27;m feeling bad), and your mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increasing the level of serotonin can make a huge difference. These capsules do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t had any side effects, and they are easy to swallow.</li>
    <li> I loved this 5-HTP!  It is free of the ingredients that I am allergic to.  It also curbs my appetite and gives me a zest for life.</li>
    <li> I have not experienced any weight loss and have even gained 4 pounds. I haven&#x27;t changed the way I eat, bu I am a clean eater. I am exercising every day. The reason I&#x27;m leaving 5 stars is because the customer service is exceptional.</li>
    <li> Tried it for a week, it upset my stomach, I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Great product. Prompt delivery. I use for sleep. I never wake up groggy anymore.</li>
    <li> I actually haven&#x27;t felt this good since I was in my early 20&#x27;s.  It was well noticeable too as myself and others noticed a difference right away.  My husband the next day asked if I was taking my prescription anti-anxiety medication again.  He knowing I took myself off them, was shocked that I was back to a more positive and calm personality almost overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://www.aluckyladybug.com/2014/12/5-htp-natural-mood-support-review.html#Wks35SqcKx1kP8F0.99</li>
    <li> First, note that these are not 200mg caps - they&#x27;re 100mg.  Read the label carefully.  Second, didn&#x27;t appreciate the company calling me to market their product. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was sent 5 HTP to give my honest review to for my blog, GlamRIver.  I&#x27;ve been taking 5 HTP to help me sleep but I have also been reaping the other great benefits that 5 HTP has.  Some of those benefits are: enhanced mood, anxiety relief and it has even helped with my appetite control.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend 5 HTP if you are having trouble sleeping, feeling a little depressed, anxious or even if you just want to boost your overall sense of well being.  You could also take 5 HTP just to help with appetite control which in turn could help you loose weight!  I take my 5 HTP by Natural Zest about 45 minutes before bedtime with a full glass of water.</li>
    <li> 5 HTP Natural mood support was a recent thing I tried for mood support for a review. I was very happy and surprised with the results. After a week of taking it I felt great like all the weight had been taken off my shoulders and I go do my day to day activities. For those suffering from not being happy or always stressed this will really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes. All reviews are 100% my own opinion</li>
    <li> Was in desperate search for a natural product to keep from having to take prescription meds....after searching all over Amazon, I stumbled across this product...it did &amp;#34;even me out&amp;#34; and made me feel mellow. I take it before bedtime.  Each person is different, but it is worth a try.  Try it to see how you like it, I did, and I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> This supplement is marvelous.  I am always very careful about supplements because I do not want to take something that makes me feel like I am going to come out of my skin or bounce off the walls like a nut-job.  Happy is fine...manic..I cannot handle..I am bouncy enough.  &#x27;Natural Mood Support&#x27; is a bit vague, since a &#x27;natural mood&#x27; is a very subjective description and &#x27;natural&#x27; isn&#x27;t necessarily positive!  I have taken St. John&#x27;s Wort before, it was fine, bt I had some stomach issues with it.  I had no stomach issues with this, no wild jitters, no beneficient &#x27;buddha-like starring&#x27;--just a very pleasant calm.  A bit hard to describe.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> works well.  takes the edge off.  not addictive.  great compliment to any medication you take as well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I fall asleep within 10 mins of it dissolving!</li>
    <li> I have not used these as of this review but my wife has and she says she can tell a difference in the way she feels as she has more energy.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter and myself and seen an improvement to our moods and appetite.</li>
    <li> Finally something to help my man sleep!  Will definitely keep ordering!</li>
    <li> A perpetually angry old cogger like me doesn&#x27;t stop gritting his teeth too often; I&#x27;ve stopped gritting and started praying ..</li>
    <li> I received it about a month ago and started taking the recommended dose of two capsules a day and feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I always have had trouble falling asleep and then staying asleep. For the past couple weeks, I have been averaging about 8 hours of sound sleep per night. I have a Weight Watchers activity monitor that also monitors my sleep and that is how I know. Plus, I have been feeling really good during the day and have more energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also recently got back on the weight loss bandwagon, and don’t feel as hungry since starting the natural zest 5HTP. Of course, it will have different results for different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://plumcrazyaboutcoupons.com/natural-zest-5htp/</li>
    <li> I order the product couple of months ago, because of the good reviews. Great to know there is something herbal that helps anxiety, stress, controls appetite! As long as I was taking it it does what it promises, and one more thing is that helped me to reduce the cigarettes I am smoking per day!</li>
    <li> Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking Natural Zest for about 3 weeks now. Before taking it I was a very unhappy person with Bad Mood Swings. Now I am able to relax, enjoy life. Thank you and God Bless.</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered 200 mg</li>
    <li> Best 5 HTP ive used yet!  No gastro. Symptoms from 100 mg which is incredible for me!!! Better sleep and mood</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking another brand of 5-HTP for about a year now and found that it greatly helped with my depression. That being said, each person&#x27;s body is different and you will only experience mood improvement if your depression is linked to serotonin and if your body synthesizes more serotonin due to the increased presence of 5-hydroxytrytophan. Not every brain works the same way so this may not help you, but it is worth the investment to try it for a few months before you turn to harsher drugs (e.g., SSRIs). For me, this raised the &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34;, so to speak, with my moods. I didn&#x27;t feel super happy, but I often felt far less despair and numbness. That is actually the way these things are supposed to work. They&#x27;re not pep pills, they&#x27;re supposed to just help you feel more &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34; For me, this worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are capsules that are not too big or too small. I found them easy to swallow and did not experience stomach upset, though I always take 5-HTP with food. The bottle says this product is produced in the U.S. and is free of Peak X. I didn&#x27;t know what Peak X was until I tried this product, but it apparently was a component in a Japanese-made tryptophan supplement that created sometimes fatal and incurable neurological damage. So, it is certainly good to know that this formulation is safe in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this relates to the price (at the time of this review). It&#x27;s impossible for me to analyze the quality of a supplement compared to any other similarly safe supplement, but this is a one-month supply for $15. My former supplement provides a 75-day supply for $23, sometimes less depending on whether I can get it on sale at Costco. This supplement, which I do find quite effective, costs a bit more, but I think the gel capsule is likely easier on the stomach so it is well worth considering if you have stomach issues with tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for my assessment.</li>
    <li> Products works as it claims.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and have finished the bottle!</li>
    <li> Helpful supplement.  I was researching something to help with my food cravings, and it was recommended that 5-HTP would help (because it promotes serotonin).  This definitely does help, as it reduced the intensity of the cravings.  I know that nothing gets rid of the habitual snacking, but getting rid of the strong craving part helps.</li>
    <li> Most definately feel better on these. I sleep better and seem to stay on an even keel.</li>
    <li> great product, great price! :)</li>
    <li> Incredible product, made me easier to live with.</li>
    <li> Absolutely high quality, zest products are my new best friend, thank you</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have energy all day long. Never feel like I&#x27;m going to crash at any point. Haven&#x27;t had any side effect like most products. No heart flutters, no shaky feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t make me sick. :) will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking two capsules of this supplement every night for about 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve been waking up feeling more energized and in a generally better mood overall. 5-HTP is the precursor to seratonin, the &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; neurotransmitter. Taking 5-HTP supplements to increase serotonin may help in reducing depression, improving sleep, controlling migraines and even losing weight .... its been working for me so far!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago.  I received it in exchange for an honest review on my blog.  After a couple of days of taking these I hadn&#x27;t really  noticed a change in my energy levels.  I didn&#x27;t feel shaky or have a rapid heart beat like I do when I take medications that increase energy.  I noticed one afternoon that I had cleaned my entire house without taking a break.  That was when I realized that the 5HTP was actually working.  I started to pay closer attention to how I was feeling and noticed that I was also falling asleep easier at night. I think that the change wasn&#x27;t as noticeable to me because I don&#x27;t feel like I am taking an energy supplement or any medication, I just feel good.  I feel well rested and have energy again.  It&#x27;s great!  I take a couple of medications daily and I love that this is all natural and doesn&#x27;t interact (I checked with my pharmacist to be extra safe before taking it). I was diagnosed with fibro (still being tested) and I have even seen an improvement in my pain since starting it. I am so glad that I tried this supplement and plan to continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I began taking this supplement two weeks ago.  I definitely feel I have been sleeping better the last couple of days.  I feel more rested, which makes my morning that much brighter.  I see the supplements fixing my mood morning issue.</li>
    <li> If, like me, you&#x27;ve battled with depression, you’ll understand my relief when I finally found a product that actually helped lift the fog and make me feel normal for the first time in years. I’d recommend this if you are sick of the merry-go-round of prescription drugs and want to try something else. I also found that it helped me sleep better too. This one’s definitely a winner in my books.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really need mood improvement. I was looking for help to avoid comfort foods. I got it. I don&#x27;t crave the junk food anymore.</li>
    <li> 5-HTP is a all-natural supplement that boosts your Serotonin levels, enhances your mood and relieves symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. It also helps you sleep better and a side benefit- its an appetite suppressant!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review and have been taking it for about 3 weeks now. I have noticed a huge improvement in not only my mood- but my quality of sleep as well!&lt;br /&gt;I have been on anti-depressants or mood-stabilizers for many years, and I can honestly say this natural supplement does a better job of stabilizing my mood and alleviating stress and anxiety.. Any time I can go natural is a bonus for me!&lt;br /&gt;As far as the appetite suppressant benefit- I have noticed I am not as hungry as normal and don&#x27;t have the tendency to snack all day..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an all natural supplement that can help with mood, weight loss, anxiety, or depression</li>
    <li> The idea of how great i feel is just unexplainable. I feel so much weight off my shoulders i feel great! anxiety is down.. Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for that &amp;#34;magic elixir&amp;#34; to lose weight. I&#x27;ve gone to &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; doctors and tried almost every prescription available and, bought countless numbers of bottles of the latest &amp;#34;miracle pill&amp;#34;. I did have some success in the past with prescription pills, but quickly regained the weight. After a period of time I noted no matter what I tried didn&#x27;t work because I actually felt hungry AFTER I took the pill.  In the past, when I gained those extra pounds I would get back on the bandwagon to lose them and have no problem with controlling my food consumption during the day. HOWEVER, I ate uncontrollably at night (after 9:00 pm) - sometimes consuming more calories then I did all day long. I did some research and discovered there IS a condition called &amp;#34;Night Eating Syndrome&amp;#34; which is psychological in nature and has absolutely nothing to do with self-control, sadly though most doctors, including my psychiatrist don&#x27;t have a clue about how to address this issue. So, I did continued research and discovered that this condition is generally caused by stress/anxiety. I was on an anti-anxiety med but needed to discontinue use because of a side effect. However, it didn&#x27;t work with regard to my eating because of the class of the drug. So, I went looking for a way to tackle this condition. BINGO - I found 5HTP which I knew was good as a sleep aid, but wasn&#x27;t aware of the appetite control effect. The difference between 5HTP and all the other &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; pills out there is that it is a natural stress reliever which, as I mentioned, is the underlying cause of Night Eating Syndrome. I might mention here that I am a STRESS eater - so hearing this was sweet music to my ears. So, I purchased a bottle immediately from CVS (didn&#x27;t even want to wait for delivery). Immediately, I found myself less stressed and noted that I can actually get through the night without over-indulging. I can finally stick to my diet! The recommended dosage forweight control is 50 mg. three times a day. I take mine mid-morning, mid-afternoon and about 8:00 at night. I actually have more energy when I need it, yet can relax enough at night in order to get a good night&#x27;s sleep. I do not go to bed any earlier than I did before (11:00 pm) because I do not feel that &amp;#34;drowsy&amp;#34; feeling you feel when taking a sleep aid, I&#x27;m just RELAXED. I wake up clear headed and ready to &amp;#34;attack&amp;#34; my day. I attribute this to the dosage I am on - 50 mgs three times a day.  I might add that I purchase only those brands that have no other ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have not finish the bottle, but I must say it curbs your appetite very well. Did nothing for mood</li>
    <li> I need to order more.  These are the best.  I tried others and they don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I got these pills for my fiance&#x27;. I noticed that since he has started taking them that his mood and overall sense of wellbeing has improved. He is getting more relaxed and restful sleep that makes him less irritable, which makes for better days. He just takes 2 capsules daily as recommended, which is simple. Would recommend this product looking for a natural supplement to boost mood and help with sleeplessness due to anxiety. Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> Amazing product...i feel much. Better after using it for 10 days</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! While it usually helps with my daytime crying be it depression or hormones right now it is only warding off the tears. But that is better than having a full breakdown! I think I have ordered it like 6x.  Will keep taking it rather than a handful of pharmaceuticals!!!</li>
    <li> Might as well take a placebo. This product does absolutely nothing!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve taken one a day for the past 30 days and I&#x27;ve never had so much energy. I seriously sleep like a baby and wake up feeling as if I&#x27;m 20 again. I&#x27;m 52 :) I&#x27;ve suffered from bouts of anxiety for about 20 years. After only a few days of taking this product I noticed a remarkable difference in my moods and each day it just gets better.  I sincerely wish I had found this sooner. I love , love , love this product.</li>
    <li> Looking for a natural way to control anxiety, and so far so good! Aids in restful sleep, too!</li>
    <li> This seems to be helping with my PMS related insomnia, and mood swings.</li>
    <li> Took one with breakfast, and one with dinner. After about 9 days, I&#x27;d lost an entire clothing size! I started taking a third pill at bedtime and am now getting some of the best deep sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take 250 mgs of time-release niacin, which I understand works in conjunction with 5-HTP. I do not understand why there are over 500 mgs of calcium in this product. I have not seen any research that says it&#x27;s needed for effectiveness/absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This supplement has changed my life. I bought it only for the assistance with fat loss. I was pleasantly surprised that I also have a greatly increased feeling of contentment, well-being and stress release.</li>
    <li> So far I have taken this product with food and without food. Both times only one capsule. I have vomited every time and felt nauseous all day. After reading all these reviews I had high hopes that I would be able to use these to help with post partum depression and slowly transition from my prescribed anti-depressants. No, I did not use these and the anti-depressants simultaneously. I would skip a dose in order to try out the 5-HTP. Am I taking them wrong somehow? Anyway, they make me incredibly sick to my stomach and I don&#x27;t think I will be using anymore.</li>
    <li> I am skeptical of something like this.  I have to say though that not only did I start feeling better--mood lifted and more energy--with these pills, but they also got me optimistically through a very rough thing last month.  I&#x27;ve had no adverse side effects.  In fact, I have stopped taking some other RA meds because my inflammation seems better most days  I been taking this for over three months, so I have given it a good try.  I can&#x27;t say what your reaction will be, but if you are desperate to try something to feel better I can say that this may be what you are looking for to help you.  I know I am glad that I took a chance with it.  Plus the manufacturer is super nice.  They email you, and they answer emails that you send to them.  That is very unusual in the current business climate.</li>
    <li> The first time I dealt with Anxiety was when my best friend was dying from cancer. I prayed for my friend, but I had no control over the cancer. He finally died, after years of suffering. The next time I dealt with anxiety was on a long flight to the Philippines. I woke up in the middle of flight, thinking the plane was going to crash. My mood has been up and down for awhile. I looked into medicine, but most said the medicines had a worse affect than the anxiety. I was lucky enough to try this product for free. I don&#x27;t see any studies about how the product has a bad affect on people. This (in itself) can give me anxiety. I tried the product and it does make me feel more relaxed. This is important to me because my sleep habits ( for years) have been horrible. Next time I go to the Philippines, I will bring a bottle of this with me, so I can enjoy my trip, instead of trying to make it through my trip. I don&#x27;t know why I deal with anxiety, but it is good to know I have something that will help me, without harming me. I like how this company has more information about their product on Amazon. It gives you a little more faith in the product itself.</li>
    <li> I get migraines. It is no secret to any one who knows me. I have had them since I was a kid and some days are just completely ruined by the pain and nausea that I experience with them. I have triggers.. some times. Sometimes they are completely random.. so it is really hard to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have taken 5HTP off and on for prevention and it works! This is a great formula. I had no side effects at all and was very satIsified!</li>
    <li> I love the 5 HTP.  I can&#x27;t believe how much better I feel when I take it.  I sleep better, have more energy, and a better all over attitude.</li>
    <li> Great product, but please take with food.  I have an iron stomach usually and I had severe nausea when taking these on an empty stomach.</li>
    <li> Works great. Take a couple hours before bed for restful sleep. Decreases appetite in the morning. Feeling less stressed with more sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha G</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I have tried a few and this by far makes me feel the best- very quickly!  Try it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and I am sleeping better at night as well. Happy I made the purchase!</li>
    <li> In the span of roughly 2 weeks , I&#x27;ve found that the 5 HTP supplement I&lt;br /&gt;ordered from Natural Zest has been beneficial in helping me with my&lt;br /&gt;mood. It&#x27;s a great companion to my doctor-prescribed meds. Without going&lt;br /&gt;into details, the seller and I communicated with one another and I&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product and the company. They are a&lt;br /&gt;family business and care about their customers.</li>
    <li> We use this along with Carlson Laboratories - Elite Omega 3 Gems Fish Oil to maintain high performance nervous system function an regeneration.  These work really well when we take them according to the recommended dosages at the recommended time of evening.  One caution is to not take too many 5-HTP pills, as they can trigger the overproduction of melatonin, which we notice in our home when we occasionally wake up feeling a little *too* meditative and calm.  We&#x27;ll definitely purchase these again.  We use them with teenagers and adults only.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see the 200 mg option. And I was glad to have received the item so quickly. However, when I opened the product I was disappointed to find that there were a lot of the capsules that had almost nothing in them or were only 1/2 of the way full. And there was a lot of powder in the bottles. Since I fill capsules with my own herbal blends I know it is not hard to make sure that every capsule is full. Also I ordered 2 bottles and after combining all the capsules into one bottle, that one bottle was only half full. I would suggest that you either get smaller bottles for the number of capsules or increase the quantity in each bottle. For example, say, 1 bottle of 180 capsules for $42. I would rather pay that than get 3 bottles at $14 each that are almost empty.</li>
    <li> Loved this! It really is a great way to help boost energy and I would definitely recommend to anybody!</li>
    <li> Definitely reordering!</li>
    <li> not much if anything for me</li>
    <li> Natural Zest offers an amazing all natural supplement that has really helped me escape the yawns. We all know when we are tired what normally happens, right? We get grumpy, snippy, and other adjectives that we can’t write down because we are family friendly! ;) At least this is what happens to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started taking a capsule of 5 HTP every night, before bed, I have been waking up feeling amazing and ready to take on the day! I have very restful sleep, even on nights when my daughter wakes me up during the middle of the night here and there. I have also come to understand that my mood is much improved, according to my family anyways. This may be due to the serotonin enhancer in 5 HTP. Serotonin is a chemical in our body that makes us feel happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who couldn’t use better sleep and more happiness in their life? I mean, seriously! It also has really helped me as someone who suffers from anxiety issues. I feel calmer about things that may arise during the day and capable of taking care of these popups. I am able to focus better on the task at hand and do not feel the need to get side tracked. Natural Zest has found a great product for all of us busy moms and hard working adults!</li>
    <li> I have used 5htp for over a year now. I find it helps regulate my sleep cycles and I feel more rested in the morning.  My sister recently started taking 5HTP.  I typically take it in chewable or powder form but she prefers tablets. I found Natural Zest&#x27;s product and ordered it for her. She absolutely loves it. She said she feels it is more effects than the &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34; brand she had previously. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> 5 HTP is one of the very few things I can take with all of my medications.  I&#x27;m so happy I found a formula that actually fulfills it&#x27;s promise!  I take one capsule in the morning with my morning medications and one in the evening with my evening medications.  Note that I&#x27;m not looking for a weight loss miracle, just sometime to help even out my appetite, although any weight loss is obviously a welcomed bonus</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, however I&#x27;ve been researching more about it online and will try it again. Affects will also depend on how much you take as you can take 1-3 pills per day.</li>
    <li> Good product, excellent customer service.</li>
