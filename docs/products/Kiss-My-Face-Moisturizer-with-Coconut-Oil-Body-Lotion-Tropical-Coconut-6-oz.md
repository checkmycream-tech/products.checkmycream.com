      <li>Price is right, smell is nice.  </li>

      <li>it smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s a thick lotion.</li>
      <li>Those of us that are a bit older and more</li>
      <li>it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The first time I used it, it burned by skin so painfully that I had to wash it off. I tried it the next day and it felt better, so I assumed that my skin got used to it. Today is day 6 of me using it and... my skin is coming off in white flakes, especially around the eyes. I double checked and it doesn&#x27;t say anywhere that I&#x27;m not supposed to use it around my eyes. Anyway... my eyelids are dry, flaky, and wrinkly (and everything was fine just a week ago). I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and never reacted to anything like this, so this is really bad for me. I&#x27;ll keep it to use on my feet.</li>
    <li> This isnt organic. Has a few organic ingredients but thats about it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the ingredients, love the price. Best bang for my buck!</li>
    <li> I use this primarily as a facial moisturizer and I love it.  It is gentle enough that it does&#x27;t cause be to break out but thick enough that I feel like it is actually moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this and it works fairly well, but complaints about smell. The scent is not very coconut and stinks.</li>
    <li> smells beautiful and really works on my skin.</li>
    <li> terrible it made me breakout and my face turned red and I&#x27;m not allergic to any ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> i love it. it smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s a thick lotion. it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff been using it for months. Does not clog pores. No more blackheads!</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face Coconut Moisturizer has a nice scent to it. It&#x27;s not very strong of coconut although I can smell it when I put it on. It does have a rice or barley smell to it too that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;m pregnant and wanted to use a natural moisturizer. As far as how it works, I think it&#x27;s a light moisturizer. It&#x27;s not greasy or too watery.</li>
    <li> I needed something light for my face, and this is perfect! And the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Has kept my skin from getting flaky this winter, and no breakouts either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who has very dry (though nearly perfect) skin.  She can apply mass amounts of any moisturizer to her skin without fear of breakouts.  However, she has trouble finding products that work well through the end of the day.  That is, until I bought her Kiss My Face Coconut as a small birthday present.  I bought it simply because of the name, but was thrilled with how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Coconut scent is delicious but light.  Her face stays moisturized all day (8-10 hours).  It doesn&#x27;t take copious amounts to affect her skin.  Based on the results I believe this is a wonderful product for the price and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I was initially turned off by the strong coconut smell, but I got used to it. It smells very soothing to me. Now that winter is coming, I&#x27;ve been using this to combat dryness. It works great! Very moisturizing and not greasy at all unless you put on too much.</li>
    <li> This was definitely not what I was expecting. From the reviews and the name of the product (Kiss My FACE Coconut MOISTURIZER), I was expecting a facial moisturizer. Sadly, unless I&#x27;m wrong, what&#x27;s in the bottle is just body lotion. It seems to be a fine lotion, but... I didn&#x27;t think I was buying a body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Since it seem like a lot of people are buying this as a facial moisturizer, I will leave a review for its performance as that: As a facial moisturizer, it absorbed okay, but I didn&#x27;t feel like my face was ant less dry after I put it on. However, putting on more didn&#x27;t solve that problem. It made me a bit greasy and it just didn&#x27;t feel good. Something odd that I noticed when I put it on was that it made my face (for lack of a better word) burn a bit. It wasn&#x27;t so much painful as warm feeling and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like coconuts, but I personally like the smell. It reminds me of a tea I drink.&lt;br /&gt;As a lotion, it&#x27;s all right. Nothing much to say about it. It absorbs fine and doesn&#x27;t make me feel itchy like many other lotions have, but it&#x27;s nothing special; I don&#x27;t feel much softer after I put it on.</li>
    <li> I like it it keep my mackeup on all day but I would like it to be a bit more moisture</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 24 year old daughter -- trying to get her to moisturize at an early age.  It doesn&#x27;t sting her skin and she likes the smell.  Non-greasy.  I suggest it for younger women.  Those of us that are a bit older and more wrinkle prone, I would go with the heavier guns, like Dermologica.</li>
    <li> Price is right, smell is nice.  Mine leaked all over the counter.  I just didn&#x27;t care for it and it tended to be sticky on me.</li>
    <li> I received this product today. I had never ordered this brand of cream before. I found it interesting how, here on Amazon.com, certain ingredients were omitted from the list. I don&#x27;t feel that is professional especially for those who may have skin allergies.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for something gluten free and it fits the bill.  The scent is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell, absorbs easily and is all natural. What more could you ask for? Well, I think it could be a bit thicker/richer for use in dry areas like elbows, knees, hands and feet. With that said, this is great as an all-over body moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I love the texture, smell and the way it makes my skin feel. It works really well for shaving (though that is not its intended purpose) because it gently lathers when mixed with water</li>
    <li> This lotion smells nice, but it&#x27;s very watery. Like, it drips out of the bottle when you open it. I&#x27;m not into that, and ended up giving it to my sister.</li>
    <li> I have to start by saying that I didn&#x27;t not like the smell of it when I first received it. Maybe I have gotten used to the smell because it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. I have oily skin, and this product hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy. So far I am really liking all the Kiss My Face products.</li>
    <li> Made my face very greasy. It&#x27;s def not for me. But everyone has diff skin so I&#x27;ll just have to keep searching. Smells good :)</li>
    <li> I often use coconut oil on my skin but it doesn&#x27;t work so well under makeup so I bought this product based on reviews. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and takes a minute to dissolve into the skin but it is great for dry skin and it&#x27;s very inexpensive. Aside from sunscreen, it&#x27;s all I need to use for moist youthful skin. You may not like it if you don&#x27;t like a thicker cream...but to me it feels like a protectant.</li>
    <li> This is great moisturizer!  It has a nice texture - not too thick, not too thin.  It goes on smooth and is not oily.  It smells like you are at the beach!  It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I am heading off back to grad school, so I thought I would cut corners and try to find a facial moisturizer that would be less pricey that the normal stuff I purchase.  This however, did not do my skin any good.  I usually have typically clear skin, however with 3 days of usage it brought me back to my middle-school acne days and caused deep, cystic acne.  I will perhaps use this as a body lotion, but it will not be coming anywhere near my face.  Disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this product for my face but after two days I stopped using it. It stung a little when i would apply it to my face. I would recommend using it more as an body lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this on my face. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s meant to be a facial moisturizer, but it soaks in well and does not leave any greasy residue. Great for the drying winter weather.</li>
    <li> It stung my face; using it on hands and arms, but not great there either.</li>
    <li> Felt like my face was burning</li>
    <li> II have this by my side all winter.  One tube at bedside, one in my desk at work.  Works like a champ but has a nice light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for your hands.</li>
    <li> This smells divine and is emollient without being sticky--a big plus for a hand cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
    <li> I have been very choosey with my hand lotions, since I have very sensitive skin - but I have to say that I love this product. The scent is subtle coconut - not over-powering like some lotions can be (example: most Victoria Secret lotions). The lotion does not leave a oily or sticky feeling on my hands, soaks into the skin quite nicely (probably the best part for me). I tend to get very dry, cracked hands when the cold weather hits, and this was perfect for me; my hands have not been this moisturized, smooth, and/or soft in a while. I will be re-buying this product when I&#x27;m out. I was recommended to by this product from Amazon&#x27;s Editor&#x27;s Picks, and decided to go for it (since I&#x27;m always trying to find the right lotion for me... I think I did). Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands regularly during the flu season, so this product has helped keep my hands silky smooth. A great product to stash in your office drawer or around the house.</li>
    <li> Feels good on the hands, and smells nice and not too strong a fragrance.  Absorbs quickly into the skin, so easy to use at work.</li>
    <li> I need a great moisturizer in the wintertime because my hands get so dry. This is perfect because not only does it keep my hands soft, it smells like a trip to the beach!</li>
    <li> Love the coconut smell and the consistency of the lotion- big fan! A great treat on these winter days where you need a moisturizer and a reminder of the tropics.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this moisturizer. My skin always feels soft after using it, and healthy, too - it&#x27;s not too heavy, but it&#x27;s not too greasy or runny, either. Great scent, and it always makes me feel better to see that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Well, it wasn&#x27;t literally smashing. I thought it was really great, though. Ideal texture-not too greasy, not too runny-and an even better smell! I don&#x27;t even like coconuts but I enjoyed the smell of this lotion. Again, an ideal balance. It made me smell nice and fresh but wasn&#x27;t overpowering. THANK you for finally getting it right!  xoxo</li>
    <li> I love it! I have very dry skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it to help me through the winter. It goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells amazing. It isn&#x27;t too strong smelling like other lotions but has the perfect scent.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes like it obviously should! It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, the tube is a great size! (Like... I didn&#x27;t get duped and receive an uber small one. It was a great size) It smelled like normal coconut smelling products do and it didn&#x27;t irritate my face!&lt;br /&gt;This makes me happy since I have an allergy to some facial products, usually those which contain benzoil peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer! I like the fact that my face never gets oily during the day. I don&#x27;t really have oily skin, just usually my nose would get oily during the day when I used other moisturizers; not anymore. I found it on Amazon when I read a woman&#x27;s review on some other moisturizer. She said she would go back to her coconut water which is what this contains. The reviews for this were positive so I ordered it and I will continue to do so from now on. To me it is that good. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It smells delicious, I love the smell, the texture is perfect , it does not feel sticky on your face, but at the same time feels like hydrates . I love it and recommend it a lot!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It smell nice and made my skin feel hydrated. Did not cake in and feel like a film one face.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer.  It goes on silky smooth and is not in the least bit greasy.  The smell of coconut is light, refreshing and not overpowering like many other brands out there.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like this and it has a very pleasant scent!</li>
    <li> It feels a little bit greasy when putting it on, but it does absorb well into your skin. I thought since the product is called &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34; it was specifically designed to be a face lotion, but it&#x27;s an all over lotion. The bottle is bigger than I thought it would be. I was looking for a good natural face moisturizer and I&#x27;m not sure this one has won me over quite yet.</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face with super hydrating coconut moisturizer is so refreshing and smells delicious. I love how it immediately is absorbed in my skin and is not slimy. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach while at the office!</li>
    <li> So I just needed something that would hydrate my face again after buying some face scrub that dried it out really badly so I ordered this. I&#x27;m SOOO impressed with this! After the first use, my skin looked visibly healthier and hydrated for the entire day, but it&#x27;s not oily like I was afraid it would be. It arrived in 3 days as well, which is also awesome. Seriously a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feeling smooth and helps with redness and evenness of skin.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes fairly well and I really like the coconut smell.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! And it&#x27;s vegan and for sensitive skin types :)</li>
    <li> I bought this originally as a face lotion but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out. It burns on sensitive facial skin, and if it&#x27;s applied on a damp face after a shower it just sits on the surface and doesn&#x27;t sink in, leaving an oily film on your face. However, it does make a great body lotion on less sensitive areas like arms, legs, &amp; chest. The coconut scent is also very nice.</li>
    <li> The smell sucks and it&#x27;s not compatible with my skin. It broke me out.</li>
    <li> my favorite lotion, smells so good</li>
    <li> This product says it can be used all over, but it was way to greasy for my face. I love their other product, but would not recommend this as anything other than hand or body lotion. Overall I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really wonderful smelling. Love the way my skin feels after. I&#x27;m addicted. I love how environmentally friendly they are!</li>
    <li> My wife advised me this is almost perfect very good for the price... she may buy another when this is finished...</li>
    <li> Disappointing. The &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; goes on &amp; my face looks drier after I apply it than it did prior to application. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again &amp; don&#x27;t recommend it but I will say that I have very dry skin so maybe its designed for someone with oiler complexion?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. It burns when I apply it, it smells funky, and it feels like putting lotion on your face. The constancy is very watery, so when the lotion is faced in its standing position it just go all over the place. I didn&#x27;t miss this product when it disappeared on my counter.</li>
    <li> it works well and makes my face soft, but its too watery for me and a pain to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> The wonderful thing about this moisturizer is that a little bit goes a LONG way! It&#x27;s incredibly smooth and leaves your skin feeling soft for hours after you use it. I have it at my desk and find myself unconsciously applying throughout the work day. The scent is refreshing and beachy, too! It might be my favorite Kiss My Face scent.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works well, and isn&#x27;t overly feminine. My mom likes their lavender flavor as well.  I highly recommend it...</li>
    <li> I personally suffer from very dry and flaky skin, which just worsens during the winter time. But this lotion has been the answer to my prayers, getting me through my daily dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and they just don&#x27;t seem to do the trick. But Kiss my face has really gone above and beyond. It goes on smooth and light and I only need to apply it once in the morning for all day moisture. Also the delightful coconut smell is an added bonus. I definitely recommend this, especially if you suffer from dry skin.</li>
    <li> This smells SO good! Great consistency, very moisturizing. Originally because of the brand name, I thought it was just a facial lotion, but it is for everywhere.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I have psoriasis and i have seen an improvement. I dont love the smell. I wanna say sun tan lotion. But its not overpowering. My skin is soft and the redness and scales are going away and has reduced tge redness on my face from my SD. It is a little heavy. But if you rub it really well it lightens up after an hour. Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great! I&#x27;ve gotten addicted to it ever since I got it. I keep it by my desk at work and use it a few times each day. It&#x27;s got a great texture, smells great and is especially useful in the winter time. I&#x27;m definitely going to tell my friends to pick it up.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my skin soft and clear. Will get more. Not greasy smooth great smelling feels like I am at the beach</li>
    <li> Decided to try it based on others&#x27; reviews and absolutely love it. Hard to resist anything coconut. Great texture and subtle scent. Problem is the dogs love it too, and want to lick lick lick (NOT). Will definitely be reordering when needed. Got my sister hooked on it, too.</li>
    <li> Do not use on your face if you have sensitive skin. I never considered my skin as sensitive, but this stuff BURNS and STINGS my face. That being said, if I had read the reviews I would have known that. The smell is heavenly so I use it as a body moisturizer and I love it.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my face feel great! It moisturizes my winter-dry skin without making it feel oily or causing breakouts.  My only complaint is that while the smell is nice, it has a fake sort of a fake coconut odor.  I would definitely purchase other items from this line as well to give them a try.</li>
