      <li>I love Paul Mitchell Awapuhi and the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream rinse.  </li>
      <li>It can leave my fine hair feeling thinner sometimes, but it&#x27;s a good tradeoff for shine, softness and powerful detangling.</li>
      <li>My hair is more manageable , shiny ans smooth</li>
      <li>This shampoo/conditioning system is truly the only product line that works for my hair, and it works amazing!</li>
      <li>bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the Paul Mitchell to be superior to other product lines when it comes to the keratin line, but try for yourself and see.</li>
      <li>and she steered me toward the right products.</li>
      <li>Started using after first Brazilian Blowout, since it was recommended by Stylist.  </li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo for dry hair ,especially if your hair is curly or wavy.</li>

      <li>This conditioner leaves my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>i have a very frizzy and curly hair.</li>
      <li>although I don&#x27;t like the scent nearly as much as this one, it seems to be much kinder to my hair,</li>
      <li>I really needed conditioner though, so I said screw it and used it.</li>
      <li>I am very cautious now when I buy products from amazon.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product for my thin hair that keeps it soft and silky smooth without looking oily!  </li>
      <li>Works great on my long, thick hair.</li>
      <li>It really really repairs any damage you may have had, and if you have had the brazillian blowout like I have, it keeps your hair sily smoothe like in the salon with no other product needed!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells as fantastic as other reviews said.</li>
      <li>I really like the shampoo, and the smell of the conditioner, but it still tends to leave my hair pretty dry for a conditioner that is supposed to be moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It is light and does not weigh down your hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse 33.8 oz.  </li>
      <li>More or less just a detangler and not worth the premium salon price IMO</li>
      <li>This particular bottle of Wild Ginger Keratin has been watered down and does not have the consistence I&#x27;ve come to know from Paul Mitchell.  </li>
      <li>As a side note, I naturally have difficult hair: fine but frizzy textured and TONS of it.</li>

<li> This cream rinse goes a long way.</li>
<li> It is too thin to condition dry hair and is mostly useful as what it says - an old-fashioned cream rinse like women used in the 60s.</li>

    <li> My Hair is very long and I have lots of hair.  This conditioner leaves my hair super soft and manageable. Plus it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for people with colored hair for sure.</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic, from the smell to how great it makes your hair feel.  If you&#x27;ve never used a ketatin product before, this is the one to start with! It really really repairs any damage you may have had, and if you have had the brazillian blowout like I have, it keeps your hair sily smoothe like in the salon with no other product needed! I&#x27;ve found the Paul Mitchell to be superior to other product lines when it comes to the keratin line, but try for yourself and see.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works excellent on my blonde highlighted hair. It can leave my fine hair feeling thinner sometimes, but it&#x27;s a good tradeoff for shine, softness and powerful detangling.</li>
    <li> i have a very frizzy and curly hair. This trash did not do anything for my hair at all!!!! took 70$ for shipping! do not buy at all</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair that has never caused me any trouble.  It got out any tangles but my hairdresser wondered if the keratin was causing my hair to be quite dried out.  I have switched to M and although I don&#x27;t like the scent nearly as much as this one, it seems to be much kinder to my hair,</li>
    <li> Love this product not sticky at all</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for dry hair ,especially if your hair is curly or wavy. I live in Arizona and my hair was  impossible to deal with after I moved here. I found a hairdresser that has also curly hair and she steered me toward the right products.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling stuff to finish off your hair - after using the Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo of course.  My hair smells so good afterwards!</li>
    <li> I have one of the top rated hair stylists in my state, in fact I just had my hair done today.

    <li> Works well, smells great!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse 33.8 oz.  I know this product well and have been using it for over a year.  This particular bottle of Wild Ginger Keratin has been watered down and does not have the consistence I&#x27;ve come to know from Paul Mitchell.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Was just what I was promised.  Did a good job packaging it.  Came on time.  I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great on my long, thick hair. Detangles immediately and leaves my hair feeling super soft. I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten the condense cream rinse and it&#x27;s great...I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real deal. It hardly works on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a big Paul Mitchell fan.  I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this product.  I have very long hair.  I didn&#x27;t feel that this did well as a detangler for me.  It did help with my dry coarse hair.  I don&#x27;t think it smells as fantastic as other reviews said.</li>
    <li> love this, smells nice, works well...would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;great product. and I cant think of nine more words. ya</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for my thin hair that keeps it soft and silky smooth without looking oily!  Best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I love this cream rinse.  Started using after first Brazilian Blowout, since it was recommended by Stylist.  The product has a delicious scent, works great and though I have not straightened hair in over 6 months, I will continue to use this keratin infused product.</li>
    <li> My hair is more manageable , shiny ans smooth</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo, and the smell of the conditioner, but it still tends to leave my hair pretty dry for a conditioner that is supposed to be moisturizing.</li>
    <li> When the bottle came it was a mess. The pump was attached and the conditioner leaked. Then I read the warning on the bottle and it says \\&quot;if this bottle is not bought at a salon it might be fake\\&quot;. I really needed conditioner though, so I said screw it and used it. I do think the actual conditioner was tampered with. I am very cautious now when I buy products from amazon. I don&#x27;t think they check their sellers for fraud.</li>
    <li> Has done wonders for my hair which was getting dry and straw like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. It is too thin to condition dry hair and is mostly useful as what it says - an old-fashioned cream rinse like women used in the 60s. More or less just a detangler and not worth the premium salon price IMO</li>
    <li> I like this product, and you just have to use a small amount for a good result.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it, and he likes it for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
