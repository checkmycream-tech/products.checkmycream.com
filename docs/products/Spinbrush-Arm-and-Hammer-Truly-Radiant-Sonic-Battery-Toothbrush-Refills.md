<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fair price for a good product. Perfect fit and it&#x27;s nice to have fresh cleaning bristles. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It cleans your teeth good!</li>
    <li> Purchased over $30.00 worth of refills for my spinbrush and they don&#x27;t fit. Had no idea there are different models of spinbrush! Can&#x27;t even use them! Now what???</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush and these replacement heads.</li>
    <li> For some reason these are hard to get. Thank you Amazon.com for making it easy!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find in stores. I really like having the subscription option.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed travelling with  my Spinbrush and was so happy that Amazon had replacement heads!</li>
    <li> These little babies are inexpensive and highly effective. It&#x27;s really nice that you can get two of them in one package!</li>
    <li> great price on this product. very powerful brush keeps my teeth very clean and fresh, sqeeqee clean too. thanks guys...</li>
    <li> It is so good. I have buy a spinbrush teeth-brush in Walmart.But when I need to change my brush, I just can not find one that is for spinbrush . So I search it on amazon and find it. The shipment is so quickly and I can use the new brush tonight.</li>
    <li> My dad had a hard time finding replacements. Glad I found them here.</li>
    <li> I cannot find these locally. I love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Spinbrush for over ten years. The brushes are perfect they seem to last longer than a regular tooth brush and maybe its because the bruching techniques are different. I have not had a problem them yet and I will continue to use them until they are discontinued.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best for my sonic toothbrush</li>
    <li> finally found what i wanted. No retail  stores carried them. Would lovr to buy any with bristles other than soft.</li>
    <li> They are better than the original brushes. They lay a lot longer than the original brushes. The price is a whole lot less</li>
    <li> Good quality, but a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Just the brushes needed, these are difficult to find in my area.</li>
    <li> I bought numerous replacement heads at various stores and none fit ;( so I just looked on here and boom there they were. Awesome! I love the rubber brushes on the sides too, great for between teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Works good, and when the blue bristles wear down, it&#x27;s time to order new ones.  I just ordered my first set of replacements for me and my husband...</li>
    <li> Product is as described</li>
    <li> I like that the same head fits my sonic rechargeable and my husbands battery operated sonic. Great deal and cheaper than in the store. I highly recommend the sonic toothbrushes...</li>
    <li> These work great! This replacement head is very hard to find!</li>
    <li> I love my SONIC but had the hardest time finding the right heads. These are it. if you pull off your spinbrush head and it is just a metal tongue, these are for you.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. For the money, I find it hard to believe that there is a more expensive product that can clean teeth and stimulate gums better than this one.</li>
    <li> Pretty self explanatory, it&#x27;s made for the spinbrush. It works and does the job. Price-wise, it was the lowest I could find online at the time.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to find these replacement heads in retail stores, but Amazon carries literally everything. Even though this product is difficult to find, Amazon still has it at a great price. The heads work perfectly and I have no complaints and I will buy this product again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought the toothbrush since I have braces on and I love it. My orthodontists says that I am the patient with the cleanest teeth that he has. I would normally buy these at a local store but I would end up paying 9.99 plus tax- until I found out about the Amazon recurring program. Can&#x27;t complain: 7.31 and free shipping. Excellent product at a much better price.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. The refill is the same as the one that came with the spinbrush proclean sonic. The brush could last a little longer but it is not very expensive so it evens out.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush and the replacement heads make it really easy to replace when needed.  You also get a little color code when the brush needs to be replaced.  Really like that!</li>
    <li> Bought toothbrushes only to discover none of my local stores actually carry these heads.  Why sell the brush if you don&#x27;t carry the head??  Any way, I&#x27;m glad I found a way to get replacement heads.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good product, well priced, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The Spinbrush does a good job cleaning teeth, but I seem to wear these out after about 2-3 weeks use.  I think it&#x27;s time to start checking out some of the higher end electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I love my Spinbrush ProClean Sonic toothbrush and this was the only place I was able to get my replacement heads.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that these replacements work well in the right toothbrush, however they did not fit the older style Spinbrush that I have. I will give the seller credit in that I did not have a problem in returning this item.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that this type of spinbrush does not manufacture the &#x27;rotating head&#x27; (you have to go with Sonic brands for that).  Why can&#x27;t we get it together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are products that were once available in major outlets taken off shelves?  Forcing us to search online, which can be a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arm &amp; Hammer:  please come up with a spin brush that requires mounting on the metal rod (and also has a rotating head on top)</li>
    <li> Works great. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I purchased the spinbrush at target and I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement brushes in any Los Angeles county stores.  thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> My son loves this tooth brush and we could not find these heads anywhere.  No walmart carries them any more. They sell the whole thing but not the brushes. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works great. Cheaper than buying at the store.</li>
    <li> The Sonic Power Brushes are amazing. I will never go back to using a manual tooth brush again. I really like that the brush heads has color change bristles that let you know when it&#x27;s time to chance heads again.The Arm &amp; Hammer Sonic Brush keep my teeth feeling just like I walked out of the dentist after a cleaning. The brush heads are easy off and on.  I also Love the convince of ordering from Amazon for Fast home  delivery. No more getting in the car, driving to the pharmacy, looking for a parking place , Walking for miles on end only to find they have rearranged the isles and you have to ask someone, Standing in the check out line, finding your car and fighting the traffic on the way home.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended i  try a sonicare tooth brush to help my gums.  Because of the cost I tried the crest sonic tooth brush.  At my next appointment 4 months later my gums and teeth had a dramatic improvement.</li>
    <li> No disappointments.  Fits the device we have. I appreciate the prices.&lt;br /&gt;Sonic is the way to go.  Spinbrush keeps teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for a few weeks.  Now it is loosing bristles and is coming loose. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the best!  These replacement heads are really hard to find so I was happy when I found them on here for a good price.</li>
    <li> Finally, an affordable electric toothbrush that really works.</li>
    <li> I bought the electric toothbrush for my husband and it has been very hard finding new heads in the stores. Great to have found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Amazon was the only place I could find these tips.  Glad I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new toothbrush.  They work great, just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid this product is not as advertised. I bought this based on the text saying it can fit any spinbrush but the truth is it simply cannot fit my spinbrush. I realized this too late and could not return in time. Suggestion is to check with seller to confirm product type before purchasing.</li>
    <li> This may be god&#x27;s gift to tooth brushers, but this &amp;#34;Spinbrush&amp;#34; does not fit into typical or older model Spinbrushes, which I discovered to my mild dismay.  Partially my ignorance perhaps, but make sure you have a &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; Spinbrush before buying this sucker.</li>
    <li> these are nice interchangeable heads for my toothbrush. As i said about the toothbrush, it leaves my teeth clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love the brush. I can never find the replacements in store</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these replaceable heads in stores anymore, they are absolete now that the new spinbrushes are out. This head fits my spinbrush sonic which is all i need. AMAZON rocks!</li>
    <li> and these heads are available on subscribe &amp; save so 1 package every 6 months is perfect. I always have a new one ready to go when my calendar reminder pops so that I can change it and move on to other things on my to-do list.</li>
    <li> spinbrush truly radiant soft brushheads don&#x27;t fit the spinbrush truly radiant brush. costs $8.00 to return the heads. bad deal all around.</li>
    <li> Let the rating speak.</li>
    <li> I learned to like power toothbrushes relatively late in light, and these are the hard-to-find replacement heads for my favorite brush.  Fits fine, works fine, and doesn&#x27;t have those stupid slits in the back of the head and stem that always dribble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New models aren&#x27;t always better.  If you like this one, grab the replacement heads while you can.</li>
    <li> these sonic toothbrush tops are really great and use pulse movements to take plaque and other items off your teeth easier and faster. good product</li>
    <li> Would not accept return even though it did not fit on toothbrush as described.</li>
    <li> I was always buying the wrong replacement head, and never did find a system to let me know when to replace.  I have these on automatic replenishment and every 90 days I have a new toothbrush, regular as clockwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spinbrush works for our family, and everything I *don&#x27;t* have to remember is a plus in my book.</li>
    <li> The bristles tend to fall out pretty easily</li>
    <li> Replacement for my son&#x27;s toothbrush. Perfect fit!</li>
    <li> these are the replacements for the proclean sonic. ermmm..there&#x27;s really nothing else to say. go ahead and buy them, they will fit ;]</li>
    <li> Using these inexpensive refills has saved me big money with the periodontist. I had depths of 5,6,and 7 on probing my gums, now it&#x27;s down to 2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s after using this for a year (replacing every three months). One thing I was told is not to move the brush like a normal toothbrush, just hold it in place for a count of ten, then move to another area,  and the sonic will break up the plaque. Also, angle it a little up or down towards the gum line. That two minutes using this toothbrush, and once a day using [[ASIN:B003O34OL6 Reach Gentle Gum Care Fluoride Mint Floss, 50 yd.  (Pack of 6)]] and [[ASIN:B0002AHY6Q Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W]](yeah, the reviews are wrong of this waterflosser, it&#x27;s very good ) your teeth and gums  will do great.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush. My teeth feel so clean. So much better than the battery spin brush that barely work. Thank you- No more batteries!! The timer is a life saver! A must-have staple!! new a travel one now.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price. The bristle are soft &amp; they work well for brushing. No need to buy an expensive brand.</li>
    <li> fit and works as expected.</li>
    <li> These are the best we have tried and we have tried several types and brands. The problem is finding replacement heads though.</li>
    <li> Best of all the Spinbrush Sonic line brushes... the revolutions are amazing.. don&#x27;t need the high end model at all..</li>
    <li> Work really well and the two pack was great</li>
    <li> Love them but received the wrong brush with recurring order</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a very timely manner and was exactly as advertised.  I was so happy to finally locate the correct Replacement Heads!  I bought the Spinbrush at a local Retailer and have tried finding the Replacement Heads in several stores but without success.  I really liked the Brush as it cleans very well so was happy to find them online.</li>
    <li> As many others have mentioned, these replacement heads can be rather difficult to find. In my case, the only local retailer where I found them was charging nearly twice the price of Amazon. I&#x27;m used to the brick-and-mortar stores being somewhat more expensive, but not by that large a margin. If you have a Spinbrush Pro Sonic (a toothbrush I highly, recommend by the way) these are the replacement heads for you. I like that you can tell when it&#x27;s time to replace the head (they call it \\&quot;Color-Wear\\&quot;). The health of my gums and the thoroughness of the plaque removal with this head was even noticed by my dentist last week.</li>
    <li> They are just what I needed; however, I thought they were a bit pricey, but it beat buying another whole assembly!</li>
    <li> Received on time as described!  So happy to even find as I can no longer find in any stores near me and truly didn&#x27;t want to buy a new electronic toothbrush as I love this one</li>
    <li> Hah, even Church &amp; Dwight (Arm &amp; Hammer Parent Co.) recommended coming here for SONIC replacement heads.  Guess they don&#x27;t really care that their Sales &amp; Marketing Departments have really dropped the ball getting these into retailers&#x27; stores!&lt;br /&gt;Call them at 1-800-833-9532 and let them know your frustration with this.</li>
    <li> Saving money is always good, this is the way to go, I have a tough time finding the SONIC heads in our stores, was just about to give up and try another electric toothbrush but now I don&#x27;t have to!</li>
    <li> i have so many toothbrushes!  guess it&#x27;s because i avoid dentists, and love a clean-feeling mouth.  this brush is the best, and i am delighted to find refills.  will be getting more!</li>
    <li> Just as expected, just make sure you pick the correct replacement brush.  I used the blow-up feature to zoom in to make sure the brush was compatible with my toothbrush.  You would be surprised at the number of brushes that look alike.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush will vibrate all the gunk off your teeth.  This was a very good value to replace the brush.</li>
    <li> I have a Spinbrush ProClean Sonic Toothbrush which I really like.  I just needed to buy some replacement heads, but they no longer have them at Walmart.  I found these on Amazon.com and I had no problems with the company that was selling them.  I received my order in great condition.</li>
    <li> Keeps my healthy gum-teeth routine going without having to scout out local drug store shelves hoping sonic is in stock. I have been using battery-operated brushes for about four years and would never go back to manual.</li>
    <li> Product was direct replacement and works great.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the replacement head for the spinbrush sonic</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, couldn&#x27;t find this model in any store!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Hard to find  these replacements in retail stores.  Good price and value</li>
    <li> It did not fit my model spinbrush. Did not make it clear that the brush has different connectors and how to insure it fits.</li>
    <li> Good product. need to get another for stock.</li>
    <li> These original manufactorer made heads are the only ones that can be used as far as I know so can&#x27;t compare.  I have used nothing but Sonic Spin since they came on the market!  I love &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> works fine,just took too long to ship to me.</li>
    <li> Love these and the red toothbrushes we fit them into . .  Hey- Arm &amp; Hammer &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; KEEP THE RED ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES ! They are better than the new models you have out now.</li>
    <li> For some reason all of the stores in my area (Walmart, Target, supermarkets, drug stores) stopped carrying replacement heads for the Sonic version of the Spinbrush.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon sells these, although only being able to buy these as an add-on item was annoying.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  Quality of an expensive toothbrush with out the cost.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know there were different heads for the same spin brush. Now, I have these heads and they don&#x27;t fit on my spin brush. Great waste of 8 dollars.</li>
    <li> Spinbrush ProClean Sonic Replacement Heads, 2 Heads. I had looked high and low for these replacement heads for my Sonic toothbrush and finally found them here.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say? If you have one of these, you need the replacement heads if you intend to keep on using it. We do, and re trying to decide if it is worth it to upgrade to a non-battery powered toothbrush. At first I thought the whole idea was ridiculous, but I must admit that my teeth feel cleaner, and I&#x27;ve had zero cavities since using the thing, so apparently my childhood-formed technique wasn&#x27;t as good as this is!</li>
    <li> I purchased these to replace the brushes on my wife&#x27;s and my Spinbrush ProClean Sonic toothbrushes. I can&#x27;t find them locally anymore. I was glad to find them here.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the replacement heads for a while. They arrived&lt;br /&gt;on time and is just what I need. So happy to have them.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good too.</li>
    <li> This does not fit a Spinbrush.  At first it was a mystery.  The front of package indicated it was for Spinbrush replacement heads. Finally on the back of the package I saw tiny print at the bottom, &amp;#34;Does not fit traditional Spinbrushes.&amp;#34;  No where does the package indicate it&#x27;s for some special kind of Spinbrush.</li>
    <li> would reamend to all friends no don&#x27;t have any more to saygood by&lt;br /&gt;that  is all now good by no</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using the Sonic brush for several years now!  Every visit the dentist gives the same comment, \\&quot;I wish all my patients had teeth as good as yours.  There is almost no plaque buildup.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is getting hard to find these in the store, but I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> LOOK OUT.  This is not compatible with any Spinbrush ProClean toothbrush except the Sonic.  Sonic is not just another name like Whitening or Clean, it is an incompatible technology.  Product description has no mention.  Many listings don&#x27;t distinguish.  Fault to Amazon, some other sellers, and Arm &amp; Hammer.  Wasted $10 and time to learn this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the auto plan with this, every 6 months i get them and pay zero shipping!</li>
    <li> Love my Spinbrush Sonic but cannot find replacement heads anywhere. I need to stock up on more if it is discontinued. It works great.</li>
    <li> Work great, just as they should. Replace every 3 months at most.  They have wear indicators (color will change) but I often replace them when they start spaying outward a little, often before the 3 month period.  My dentist recommended a sonic toothbrush so I went for the cheapest sonic I could get.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the product, but I returned them because I ended up ordering the wrong heads.  I used to have this brand of toothbrush, but now I have another brand and I didn&#x27;t remember that when I ordered replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Works as designed.  Nice packaging to keep my second head in until I am ready to use it.</li>
    <li> replacements are easy to use and do with my brush.  love it</li>
    <li> I have had my Spinbrush Sonic for over a year.  My teeth have certainly seen an improvement at my six month cleanings.  This toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning my teeth and is much less expensive than the Phillips Sonic brushes.  It is also nice that Sprinbrush offers both battery operated and plug in rechargeable options.  Everyone in my family has this toothbrush in one of these two options.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue with these toothbrushes is how hard it is to find the refillable heads for them.  Where I live, they became no longer available at Wal-Mart.  So I went to Walgreens.  Imagine my shock when I noticed that they were almost $13 there!  While in Walgreens, I debated whether I should buy them or not, I thought I would go check and see if they had them on Amazon.  Of course, Amazon had them and they were not quite $9, more like what they used to be at Wal-Mart.  So I ordered some with the Add-On program.  Since I have Prime, they shipped in two days.  I can wait two days for toothbrush heads easily.&lt;br /&gt;Another win for Amazon.  They have the hard to find product at a cheaper price.  The two day shipping was, of course, on time.  And who doesn&#x27;t love shopping from their sofa?</li>
    <li> Easy to use replacement heads.  Why they are so hard to find in the stores??  I stocked up here at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> This was substituted for the Spinbrush head I have been getting for the last year.  I don&#x27;t know why.  The connector is different, and I didn&#x27;t realize it before I tore the wrappings off.  I will be dropping my subscription because the correct Spinbrush head is now available at Walmart, where it was not before.  Spinbrush is a terrific product (ask my dentist), but you have to have the right brush to make it effective.</li>
    <li> I love my Spinbrush ProClean Sonic toothbrush! The problem was that I could not find replacement brushes at any store. The only place I could get them was thru Amazon</li>
    <li> I have purchased complete replacement toothbrushes because you can&#x27;t find the heads in any of our local stores.  OF COURSE Amazon carries it!  :)  They were perfect and will save us money over the long haul.  As for the toothbrush  -I&#x27;ve been getting comments about whitening my teeth.  I haven&#x27;t outside of toothpaste, but clearly this brush is rockin the cleanin!</li>
    <li> Glad it was available on-line.  Thought it would be a little less pricey but none the less I love the product.</li>
    <li> I love using my Sonic Spinbrush!  Combined with the Optic White toothpaste from Colgate, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist daily.</li>
    <li> The Sonic Replcement Spin Brush heads We bought are high quality and just as good as the original heads we had. Our order arrived exactly on the day we were told.  I was so pleased that I placed a second order.</li>
    <li> Unable to find these in store where we originally purchased the Spinbrush toothbrush...thank goodness for Amazon because now we can order them.  They fit...it is a very good toothbrush for the price and the price of these was very affordable.</li>
    <li> This is the replacement for the rechargeable toothbrush that you can&#x27;t find in any store!</li>
    <li> exactly what i needed for my toothbrush! i didn&#x27;t know the bristle hardness but they are soft and it is the real deal, not a fake brand.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with prompt service and the product is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> good choise good item</li>
    <li> The only place that has them. No other store has them.</li>
    <li> Great price. Works really well. Leaves teeth feeling great. Perfect replacement. they stop selling these in stores, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the brush. Glad I found thses. now I don&#x27;t have to buy a new brush.</li>
    <li> Gets my teeth clean with a minimum of brushing.  Rarely causes the gums to bleed even when used aggressively and I brush twice every day.</li>
    <li> Cleans your teeth better than regular toothbrush</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush and replacement heads</li>
    <li> replaces my supply.  They work well.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find these tooth brush heads. They work very well.</li>
    <li> Another one of those items that is constantly changing in style just enough to make finding replacement heads difficult if not impossible - or so I thought after several unsuccessful attempts at buying locally.  On line ordering did the trick, easily, timely and from the comfort of my office chair.  Thank you - it was exactly what I was looking for, wanted and ordered.</li>
    <li> good product at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> These do fit my brush and work as expected</li>
    <li> I tried to find this replacement at many of the stores here and unable to find them. I bought the toothbrush about a yr ago. It is a great product</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding the right replacement heads for my Spinbrush. I knew what they looked like but I figured any Spinbrush replacement head would fit but I was wrong. I had to look up the information on the Spinbrush website to find out that it is not compatible with any other heads. Thanks to Amazon, I have a subscription to this item so I can I have my replacements when I need them</li>
    <li> the exact replacement heads i needed</li>
    <li> Really nice...I had a hard time finding them at the drugstores.</li>
    <li> works as promised.  About the same price as Walmart</li>
    <li> I love my Spinbrush Sonic.  My teeth feel very clean after I use it.  It is tough to find replacement heads in the stores around here, so being able to order them is very nice.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush.  I like it better than the 100 dollar oral B my dental technician urged on me.  For some reason the replacement heads are difficult, strike that, impossible to find in stores.  Stock up!</li>
    <li> I have searched for these replacement brushes with no success until I checked Amazon!  Found the correct ones easily at a much better price then similar ones in the local stores.  In 5 minutes I located the correct ones, ordered them and received 2 days later at no charge!  Will look at Amazon before going to stores next time I need something!</li>
    <li> Great price for the replacement heads.  That&#x27;s all I have to say but for some reason Amazon wants a short story.</li>
    <li> Unable to fit my spin brush so I was a little disappointed. Luckily it is not my primary battery operated toothbrush .</li>
    <li> works.  nice to have fresh ones</li>
    <li> I had this toothbrush but was unsure where to get replacement heads. This is a great price for replacement heads that will allow me to continue using this spin brush.</li>
    <li> Only place I found the brushes...and at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find the replacement heads anywhere.  Bought what was supposed to be replacement heads at Walmart where i originally purchased the unit but they didn&#x27;t fit.  So I tried this and it&#x27;s wonderful!  My teeth feel so clean.  I got an A+ at my last checkup and I have been having gum problems the past year or so....first time in my life.</li>
    <li> Like most, I checked so many stores for these and couldn&#x27;t find them so thanks a lot!! And the price was right!</li>
    <li> the items fit my toothbrush perfectly and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love these heads for my toothbrush,  had looked for these and was so glad to have found them here. I think they really work nice and would recommend to others, will order more when I need them, they hold up nicely and make my teeth feel good and I also get good reports from my Dentist.</li>
    <li> So happy to get replacement heads for my toothbrush.  They are exactly what I wanted. They were delivered right on time as stated.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you</li>
    <li> The toothbrush I purchased these replacement heads for is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned and used.  Between the way the brushes are set and the sonic power, it really gets my teeth clean.  Too bad I cannot find these in the store where I bought the toothbrush. Thanks, Amazon for having so many things I cannot find any where else and I love Prime to get it here fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of two Spin Brushes and replacement heads from Sam&#x27;s Club, but needed additional replacement heads.  Sam&#x27;s Club hasn&#x27;t had them so I purchased two packs of two replacement heads from Amazon thinking a Spin Brush is a Spin Brush.  I was surprised to find that they didn&#x27;t fit and noticed in the fine print on the back of the package that these replacement heads do not fit a classic Spin Brush.  It&#x27;s not obvious to consumers what is a classic brush and a non-classic brush.  Amazon is awesome and I feel terrible having to return these items due to Arm and Hammer&#x27;s poor decisions on names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a seach on what appears to be a model number on my brush heads (DD2240G2), but not even Google knew what that was.  I also found Amazon returning results for Crest Spin Brushes too.  Terrible branding and confusion for consumers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found this item.&lt;br /&gt;Now I stocked up for a while.</li>
    <li> These are only compatible with the SONIC Spinbrush, not the normal Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had a subscription to regularly get refills for my NORMAL Spinbrush, I&#x27;m rather annoyed that Amazon substituted an incompatible product when they apparently decided to stop carrying regular Spinbrush refills.</li>
    <li> Does what it says... Just took forever to arrive</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, thanks!</li>
    <li> I received the order the following day.  It works as expected.  I should have spent more time picking a brush labeled &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; instead of the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; default one.  I&#x27;ll pay more attention at my next order in 3 months.  At that time i&#x27;ll try to buy replacements for the hole year!</li>
    <li> Nothing too fancy about these replacment heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a high review because:&lt;br /&gt;-  They aren&#x27;t a generic replacement (brand name is best)&lt;br /&gt;- They are cheaper than buying them from the store&lt;br /&gt;- They work just as good as the original head that came with the sonic brush.</li>
    <li> I looked and looked for this item in the stores and couldn&#x27;t find it, so I was happy to be able to order this&lt;br /&gt;online!</li>
    <li> ive used this toothbrush and these for about 2 years now and i dont see myself switching anytime soon :)</li>
    <li> I ordered the brushes but they don&#x27;t fit my Spinbrush. This is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Be aware of which Spinbrush version you&#x27;re using. I bought this pack thinking it worked with my Spinbrush and they didn&#x27;t fit. My mistake, but easy to make.</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  Great product.  Gets teeth nice and clean.  Glad to find it on the internet, hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon. I bought the toothbrush at Wal-Mart but found out they don&#x27;t sell the replacement heads. I was pleased and the price was great.</li>
    <li> My complain is not of the  product itself, is more of the selled, I bough these brush heads for a Spinbrush and gues what they are not compatible.</li>
    <li> I had a very difficult time locating replacement heads for this toothbrush, even at the store from which I purchased it.  I was very happy to see that they were available through Amazon.  It was the most convenient place to acquire them and with the automatic monthly delivery service, it is even easier than going to a store down the street.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Spinbrush tooth brush since it was put on the market and I think its the best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever had (I&#x27;m 70 yrs. old so I&#x27;ve had lots). So I just keep on buying replacement heads, such as these and it keeps on ticking. Bottom line is, they keep me smiling (pardon the pun), so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Love this product/replacement heads, but after I ordered it (thinking I was getting a deal), I found it for half price in the store.</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard for an electric toothbrush with no holes in the head, because the ones with holes tend to grow mildew unless you clean them out often (check one; it&#x27;s disgusting). This type works quite well. I&#x27;m on my second replacement head, and I don&#x27;t intend to buy a different kind of toothbrush anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brushes ever I use these all the time, if your looking for a great toothbrush that really clean your teeth, this is it!!</li>
    <li> If you have yourself a ProClean Sonic clean toothbrush, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already realizing the clean sensation that you have after using it. I enjoy this product and it was put to good use. Unfortunately, at 8-10 dollars an order, it&#x27;s quite expensive. It was received quickly, but again, the biggest downside is the price.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I had to order these online because no store in my vacinity carries these items.  Product is perfect and comparably priced to what you might expect to see at Rite Aid or CVS if they had such an item.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised and works great.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> good choise good item</li>
    <li> Would be great if they offered soft bristles!</li>
    <li> What is there to write about toothbrush replacement heads? These are great and offer a quality product at a good price!</li>
    <li> My kids use these heads for their battery powered toothbrushes and I can&#x27;t find one thing to complain about-they work great and subscribe and save makes it easy to remember when to change the heads!!</li>
    <li> just what I wanted that was not in our local stores</li>
    <li> Very hard to find. Glad to get them .Very good spin brush design.I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> very nice item . you will not regret buying it .</li>
    <li> They were what I needed. I was having trouble locating the proper heads for my brush.the price was good and they were delivered fast. I  am glad I found th and set up the subscription. Good deal!!!!!</li>
    <li> Clean teeth are important.  these help make that happen.  No issues</li>
    <li> I had been using the old brush too long and when I put the new one on....gave me a cleaner feel!</li>
    <li> Only place that we can find replacements for our toothbrushes!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re replacement heads for a cordless toothbrush, what can you say about them? They do the job that they are intended for and I&#x27;ll order them again as long as the motor in the toothbrush works.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are very hard to find at the local retail stores anymore.  These clean my teeth very well and last a long time.  I change the brush head every 6 months on my toothbrush, and yeah I know, that sounds gross.  The blue tips change white when you&#x27;re supposed to change them, but they last much longer.  It is soft and hits all the hard to reach places.  I go to my dentist every six months and still do not have any cavities and I don&#x27;t floss. Highly recommend this if it fits your model toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good replacement and prompt service</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this one yet but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re just as good as the other ones. :-)</li>
    <li> This suckes,  it did not fit my toothbrush.  Now Amazon wants me to buy it again.  STOP SUGGESTING THINGS I DON&#x27;T WANT.  AHHHHHH</li>
    <li> Purchased refills because this is the best cleaning tooth brush I have ever had. Would highly recommend this product. Excellent</li>
    <li> Have no problems with this product.  Works exactly the way it is supposed to work.  Cleans teeth really well. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not able to find these in stores anymore and glad that Amazon has them. Item is as described and fits Sonic toothbrush seamlessly. If you are struggling to put these on, you have the wrong refills. Love that the bristles fade to help remind you to change them.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely better than regular toothbrushes and I like it better than the Oral B Sonicare brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great option for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
    <li> I buy these on amazon as it is hard to find the correct brushes in walmart. I love these and they work great. Bought the brush set for my whole family so these are great refills and the price is good too.</li>
    <li> These are just what we were looking for but couldn&#x27;t find at our local stores. The price was also much less than that of the stores when they had carried this product. We will purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I love the toothbrush that these fit on. Since using the Spinbrush ProClean Sonic I have had virtually on plaque or tartar on my visits to my dentist. I also use the toothbrush on my gums.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t locate these in the stores I shopped. I am glad I can get them here.</li>
    <li> The brush head cleans real well.  My teeth always feel real clean when I use this, have tried other brushes but like this one best.</li>
    <li> Completely Satisfied. On time. No issues at all.</li>
    <li> Fit the toothbrush that I had.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> It was the exact replacement head I was looking for and could not find in any  other outlet.</li>
    <li> Have been so happy to find these heads for my sonic toothbrush! The toothbrush works so well that I feel like I have come out of the dentist every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I  love it that it tells you when it should be replaced and lasts a long time. Just can&#x27;t find them in the stores right now.</li>
    <li> This was not the style I had ordered. When looking at the return policy, this item was not returnable. So basically I lost out on $10.00 for replacement heads that do NOT fit my brush.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this item. It arrived in good shape however they do not fit the Spinbrush Pro Recharge Battery Powered Toothbrush so, I had to return.</li>
    <li> Not much I can say.  Product is exactly what it says, and fits my 3 year old Pro Clean just fine.</li>
    <li> Loved the price on the refills, a lot less expensive than in the store.&lt;br /&gt;works perfectly on the spin brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a spin brush that actually sprins good using batteries, but also cleans.  I used to use the crest spin brushes but they went down hill changing the motor speed and bristles were far too soft which didn&#x27;t last,  The cost of the replacement brushes exceeded the cost of buying an entire new spin brush, so I switched and decided to try Sonic.  I was extremely surprised at the motor speed and the brushes were great.  I would highly recommend to anybody who doesn&#x27;t like the former Crest sprin brush Pro etc. and since they changed the brushes, this is a far better option.  Finding the replacement brushes are difficult unless you purchase online as Walmart didn&#x27;t carry.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see these replacement heads after my local stores stopped carrying them.  I love my sonic toothbrush and this will allow me to continue using it until I replace it with one of the big boys.</li>
    <li> Liked them will order more</li>
    <li> I always had a hard time searching for the right replacement heads in the stores (and spent $25 buying the wrong heads), but this was much easier and more efficient.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! They were so hard to find in a store, but I know where to get them now!  Thanks !</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Can&#x27;t buy them locally.</li>
    <li> We couldn&#x27;t find these replacement heads anywhere &amp; my husband did NOT want to change his toothbrush so these were a life saver.  Pretty pricey, but worth it to him.</li>
    <li> Came as stated and quickly.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Had to order these as they are not carried in local stores. Probably a name confusion because the Spinbrush name is being used for 2 different type heads. Electric toothbrushes are proven to improve oral health. They build up my gumline (which the hygienist now measures at each visit) and remove some of the stain from tea and coffee.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find and my Walmart carries the toothbrush but not the refills. I&#x27;ve checked several stores in my area, but live in a rural community. Glad I could find them online!</li>
    <li> FOUND IT!!!  Hard to find locally as brush is an older model.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to find PERFECT replacement heads here.  They are the EXACT fit for the brush and are EXACTLY as described. Can be ordered as addon to save money...but worth the extra expense if this is all you need to purchase at the time.</li>
    <li> these are the best heads for brushing, they work well and last a bit longer than the others.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase. The bristles were extremely soft and didn&#x27;t feel like the bristles that come with the toothbrush. I also had to force it on, it wouldn&#x27;t go on easily like it should. Also, when I changed the head, it messed up my whole tooth brush. It wouldn&#x27;t vibrate anymore, just for a couple seconds then I would stop, even though it was charged. I had to buy a whole new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> 100% as advertised and of excellent quality and price. Also unique in my small world, as I could not find replacement heads for my Spinbrush at any other toothbrush or general product supplier online or in store.</li>
    <li> Glad I could find the product at Amazon after not being able to find it at local stores. Fits my toothbrush and works well.</li>
    <li> these are the soft bristle ones for the sonic proclean sprinbrush. i generally go to the store and get my refills but was always forgetting so i just ordered them here and got them in a few days. does the job best toothbrush yet. encourages me to brush longer. amazon not much cheaper than the store though.</li>
    <li> After looking and looking for the right replacement brush heads, I finally found them!</li>
    <li> The Product came when promised and it was the right product but the package was opened on the back where the replacement heads are at. im not sure if it was before they sent it or if it happened in shipping. But my biggest issue is that the package as well ans the paper work reeked of smoke and being that there tooth brush heads that is pretty disgusting. i will not be purchasing anything from this company again and not sure i can make my self put these in my mouth</li>
    <li> Great product! Always cleans well.</li>
    <li> Does not fit regular Spinbrush</li>
    <li> Did not fit my spinbrush &amp; too much hassle to return</li>
    <li> GREAT ,  MY TEETH ARE HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Works as described. Great prices and convenience.</li>
    <li> incredibly effective and better than any other brush, etc. that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> excellent right heads for my spinbrush. delivery was super fast</li>
    <li> Really like my Spinbrush Sonic.  I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive brands so can&#x27;t offer a comparison, but this brush&lt;br /&gt;cleans my teeth quickly and well.</li>
    <li> These are great replacements for this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The new brush head was better than the one that came originally with the toothbrush and was easy to put on.  I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Tough to find in grocery stores and this style brush is by far the most effective for cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. Amazon is the only place I can get refill heads. I will probably do the automatic refill to assure I don&#x27;t run out, ever.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my toothbrush, though I do wish the replaceable heads lasted longer.</li>
    <li> The money is in the replacements! This is a good brush for my Spinbrush electric toothbrush, but seems highly priced for such a simple product. Yet, it&#x27;s competitive on Amazon and lower than many other stores. Marketing today is so often about selling the main product at a low price and then charging a small fortune for keeping it supplied You see this in printers, of course. And in razors and electric toothbrushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But--I have to live with it. This replacement brush seems to be the right texture and strength for me. Feels invigorating to have those little spinners massaging my gums. But they don&#x27;t always get all the food particles out. So I also often use flossing, or at least a dental toothpick.</li>
    <li> love this brush hard to find refills</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time locating the Sonic Spin Brush replacement heads. Glad I found it on Amazon. Fit perfectly on the hand held part. Packaging was sealed from manufacturer. Pleasure to clean those pearly whites so thoroughly.  I would give it 5 stars but it is just a tooth brush after all. LOL</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as expected. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great replacement head.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to get this replacement head. I have looked everywhere to no avail. I love that it cleans better than the previous brand I was using. It gets to all the nooks and corners. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this Spinbrush ProClelan Sonic Replacement  Heads all of the time.  I wouldn&#x27;t any other/</li>
    <li> The brushes were exactly what I needed but they were sent to my billing address not my mailing address</li>
    <li> I prefer the sweeping toothbrush over the rotary.  Only problem is that you can&#x27;t find replacement heads in stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I had been unable to find replacement brushes for my Sonic Spinbrush; however, these work perfectly.  In fact, I feel like they do a better job of cleaning my teeth than the original brush.</li>
    <li> Thank you I love it. It is awesome work!</li>
    <li> 09-01-14. Good idea bad design.  The heads fall off.  there is no positive locking mechanism as in the older  PRO version. It slows down and stops when pressure is applied, as one would normally do when brushing teeth.  I and my family have used Spinbrush Pro for years and were delighted with them.  We switched because amazon.com  stopped carrying them and only offered the SONIC version.  So we invested in new brushes and extra heads.  Bad idea and we wasted our money.  I&#x27;ll search for the older Spinbrush Pro models and try to find them again.  I do not recommend this Spinbrush ProClean Sonic system.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this particular item yet, but I&#x27;m sure they are as good as what I have now. Hope the manufacturer will not discontinue making it.</li>
    <li> As advertised and a good price.</li>
    <li> Its a replacement head for a toothbrush.  Ahhh, ya, it worked.  Yes!</li>
    <li> This product is not available at major retailers.  Also, the actual brush has disappeared from the shelves and mine are beginning to fail.</li>
    <li> ... WHEN IT DOESN&#x27;T &#x27;SPIN&#x27;?  Back and forth is NOT spin, it&#x27;s oscillating!  I know why they call it a &#x27;spin&#x27; brush, they CAN&#x27;T SPELL &#x27;OSCILLATE&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I forget to change my toothbrush and then have trouble finding the correct refill at the store. With auto delivery I have an automatic reminder to change the brush when the refills arrive and I always have the correct refill handy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral B Pulsar disposable toothbrush that is very similar to the Spinbrush Sonic. The downside to the Pulsar is you couldn&#x27;t replace the battery. Otherwise it was a great toothbrush. Most importantly you could get a medium stiffness bristle on it which made a huge difference in its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is sounds like a buzzer and it is significantly heavier and bulkier, but those are minor issues. The Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Sonic only has one type of toothbrush head available for it, and it is a soft bristle. They need to make a medium bristle for it, then it would be a 5 star item.</li>
    <li> good replacement. workings perfect.</li>
    <li> I love my spinbrush and I cant find these refllls anymore just thankful that amazon has them and I dont have to buy another toothbrush.</li>
    <li> great product - can&#x27;t find in stores anywhere</li>
    <li> Works but they are soft.</li>
    <li> Love the full head brush. Doesn&#x27;t hit my teeth when brushing.</li>
    <li> This is the original brush head design for my A&amp;H Spinbrush ProClean Sonic.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t available in local pharmacies or stores near me. I see the cheaper replacement heads--the ones that are half this design, half round spinning brush like those made by Braun. They&#x27;re not as good, and they wear out faster.&lt;br /&gt;So this isn&#x27;t a rave review. I&#x27;m just grateful Amazon still offers this brush design, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> It has some holes where bacteria easily accumulated and started to grow real nasty and easily.</li>
