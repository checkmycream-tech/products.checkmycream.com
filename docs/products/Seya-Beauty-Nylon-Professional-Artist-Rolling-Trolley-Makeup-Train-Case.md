<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As a busy make up artist, I needed something reliable and sturdy. I&#x27;m blown away by how much space I have for all my gear including all my airbrush equipment.  I love that the drawers come out and that the compartments for my brushes come out and can also be folded up.  Great buy, and amazon even delivered it a day early!!!</li>
    <li> I am a MUA and I do not do just traditional makeup, I do special effects as well so when I would go on set I would have to bring so many bags, makeup organizers, etc. This fits ALL my makeup and I LOVE how I can put my brushes in the top inside and remove it! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because when I read straps I thought it would have straps on the back so I could carry it like a backpack, which might sound stupid but my case is sooo heavy and I get so nervous just having it on regular straps, carrying it up a flight of steps (put there are also handles). Another modification that would be awesome is if the wheels would be the 360! Other than that if you are thinking about getting this and you are contemplating the price, buy it, its worth it! Also you see how it is in two parts? Well the bottom of the top part attaches to the bottom part and there are a lot of reinforcements with the buckles and the drawers are deep and you can stack!! I have this, my makeup chair and lights and I am all set to go for a job! &amp;#60;3 the case and it didn&#x27;t take me long to get it, it was like Christmas getting it!!</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist and this is like the 4th rolling makeup case i have, but definetely the very best. Its quality is amazing, it is steady and you can fit a lot of things in here. I also have my hair tools wich a carry on the smaller top case, and can leave it at home when dont need it. It dosnt get dirty (and if it does, its really easy to clean) and the straps are really strong. absolutely love this case!</li>
    <li> I am a professional make up artist and go on location to quite a few places for work.  I finally outgrew my old make up train and decided to go with this one! I am a guy and wanted one that suited my personal style! It is JUST what I wanted! Simple, clean, and FULL of storage space.  I am really happy that I have options now for all my make up and equipment.  I am kinda unorganized and I feel this will help me stay on top of my work! Plus it will save me time instead of digging around looking for stuff!! It looks pretty sturdy, I just got it so I will let you know how things go.  But I am really happy and I would definitely suggest this to someone that has a lot of make up.  I know I do and I am always buying more things for my clients.  This is perfect.  And I love how it has 2 cases and I can take what I need if I don&#x27;t need all my make up for a job.</li>
    <li> I like it. Sturdy rolling cart.</li>
    <li> its amazing , lots of space for everything , im a freelance makeup artist and this is just what i need to carry all my things with me :) it is worth the price ..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my travel kit!  everything is organized and stays that way while traveling with my freelance clients</li>
    <li> Love this bag fits all my hair and makeup</li>
    <li> A facepaints dream storage! Super fast shipment and I love this back.</li>
    <li> I purchased as a gift for a family member.  She loved the gift and that the two parts were both sturdy.  She also loved the fact that that they could be taken on board airplanes.</li>
    <li> Very durable, good quality, and has so much storage. It&#x27;s great if you want to compartmentalize your equipment. Also is very portable</li>
    <li> Recieved with one clamp damaged</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a lighter bag , since I am a new MUA and had a very heavy clunky bag before this . This is very solid , lightweight , and well organized . I love everything about it .  It is well made and great construction . Every MUA needs a bag like this , I have seen bags that are similar , but not as organized , well worth the price tag .</li>
    <li> I love this so much, i use this everytime I travel to do makeup up.&lt;br /&gt;it hold everything, all my makeup product in place.  there are many sections/litle draws to separate different kind of products.&lt;br /&gt;it is very heavy!&lt;br /&gt;I only use the bottom part. The top part is too heavy for me to carrying around.</li>
    <li> Enchanted and in love with my new makeup organizer. It is super comfortable and easy to carry. I am very happy</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my friend as a birthday gift. She is a freelance makeup artist and she absolutely loves it! She says it&#x27;s the best one she has had so far.</li>
    <li> Great buy! I do nails as a hobby and have A LOT of supplies that I was storing in boxes and bags. I was very skeptical about purchasing a cosmetic train case because all of the reviews I looked up on many other products were bad; low quality, not durable, easily broken, etc. Believe me when I say I looked through a lot of cases! When I purchased this case, it came in a timely manner, and it was better than I expected. It holds all of my supplies and keeps me well organized. The material that it&#x27;s made of is promising too. Even though it&#x27;s considered a soft case, it seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time. The only soft thing about it is the exterior materials really, other than that it&#x27;s very durable. If I can figure out how to put a picture on here I sure will!</li>
    <li> It actuality was a gift for my son, but it is very nice and he will put it to good use, He really loved it, it is just what he needed for all his hair supplies for school, he really likes that it has drawers and it comes apart with shoulder straps, it does seem pretty sturdy and easy to pull around.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this carryall! I am a makeup artist at a popular cosmetics counter, and this bag is AMAZING when I go to freelance jobs! It&#x27;s like I can bring the whole makeup counter with me! It is extremely durable and I love the fact that the top case can unhook, and you can just use that for smaller jobs. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating was because of the weight by itself, and with a full case of makeup, it&#x27;s even more heavy. All I can say is thank goodness it rolls! :D</li>
    <li> This is the best, most durable, well put together trolley for cosmetics that I have found.  Its not too big and I absolutely love it!  I purchased it for my professional job, but I am thinking that I should purchase another for my personal use!</li>
    <li> Great for organizing all my makeup in removable trays , it can be  sepated into 2 bags is very sturdy . I feel it looks professional,and  easier than hard cases. To carry around</li>
    <li> Love it! By far best rolling makeup case I&#x27;ve owned! Like it better than the hard case! Plenty of room! Great quality. Love that the drawers have a lock safety feature and they can be pulled out and put on the artist table I&#x27;m working off of. Holds all my pallets and foundation magazines.. Durable, easily cleaned! Get it! If you&#x27;re a MUA! Might not be good at all for flying. Otherwise a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> Absolute perfect. As a pro makeup artist I have a TON OF STUFF!!!  This holds everything and is super well organized!</li>
    <li> Not much specific detail is made about this Train Case so I&#x27;ll make my review as thorough as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My background:&lt;br /&gt;I am a freelance makeup artist for many years and just finished my year long cosmetology course, which provided a flimsy train case for hair, a small makeup bag and a small kit for nails. I had intentions on doing traveling beauty services when thinking about what items I should invest in. I&#x27;m big on researching a product for a long time before committing to purchasing an item - the more expensive, the more I sit on it before buying. That being said it took me a year before buying this train case and I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and I am satisfied with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Train Case:&lt;br /&gt;I knew I needed something big enough to carry all my products, as I was tired of carrying separate luggage/bag and then forgetting several items plus I&#x27;m a huge organization freak. This case is huge - made of nylon exterior while interior are made of plastic/metal material. The top case is detachable by clips and came with a detachable shoulder strap - which sits really comfortably. Inside it had a folding-out tier that opens to a deep storage, the backing had a velcro brush case with plastic covering. The bottom, lower case had the rolling wheelies, inside it had a deep storage as well but not as deep as the top case, same velcro brush case in the backing, 8 pull-out plastic drawers, a mesh zippered pocket in the inner flap and two mesh pockets on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only downfall with this item is that It is fairly heavy, and even heavier with products in. But I was able to pull the train case by the handle over sidewalks plenty of times and it has not broke or become loose. Wheels still work great, and it has kept my items dry in the rain and prevented it from melting while sitting in a hot car trunk. So although it is surprisingly heavy, it is durable and that&#x27;s what I purchased it for. Clean up is really easy on this. I actually have had no stains, tears or rips on the outside or inside. Taken it to events, had it in the car - still looks brand new and that&#x27;s with DAILY usage for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage:&lt;br /&gt;I used the top case to fit all my hair items and the larger bottom one for my makeup and nail kits that were all needed for school. Storage wise - it&#x27;s best intentions are made for makeup artists. I was able to fit all my hair products reasonably but it was tight spacing but definitely doable. For visual purposes, the top case I was able to fit a large blow dryer, 3 capes, 6-8 brushes, and curling wands while the pull out tier hold onto combs, clips and my sheers. It definitely would work better spread out amongst both cases but it made it easier to separate my hair from makeup items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom case -  The deep top storage I used mainly to hold my palettes and brushes, also hand manikins and larger items not able to fit into the drawers (for hair, it can hold the blow dryer and hair tools but the space is more limited then the top case). The drawers I used for smaller items, you can definitely add drawer separators in them as it is fairly lengthy and you can pull the entire drawer out easily - for reference you can even fit a 2 PRO z-palette or 3 MAC palettes in the drawers length wise with room to spare. The inside mesh pocket I use to carry my face charts and magazines (for clients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If using for on-site jobs as both a hair/makeup artist - be select on the sizes of items you bring. You can fit so much in compacted/travel sizes as oppose to full, especially tools. But using it for one specialty (makeup or hair) there is definitely plenty of space regardless of size.</li>
    <li> Just received this for Mother&#x27;s Day and I love all the different compartments and individual slots. Very durable case and the detachable case will come in handy as well.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist with over 30 years of experience - started at 15  - I have had many bags, train kits in my day but this is by far the best.  I almost do not want to share this how great this case is - but I will - tons of room, easy to use, professional and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I love this make up case. It makes traveling with my kit a hell of a lot easier. Its big, but needed.</li>
    <li> very durable...Im always on the go in NY NJ and PA....packs everything</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. Made very well. It is just what she was looking for to be mobile for her business.</li>
    <li> I just got mine in and I am so happy with this purchase! I was kind of skeptical on the quality of it, before ordering! So worth the money! Sturdy, holds all my crap and keeps it all organized! As a traveling makeup artist, this is perfect! It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver in and out of my car. I can see this train case lasting a long time compared to those other cheaply made \\&quot;metal\\&quot; train cases.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PURCHASE! It is a great buy and is very sturdy!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am a traveling nail tech I was In love at first but not so much anymore the thing is completely falling apart the zippers broke the stitching came a loose within a year of purchasing it I&#x27;m so disappointed when I bought it it was over $300 I will not buy from this company ever again</li>
    <li> I just Love it. Better quality than the pic can show. Tons of room. Looks great and easy to clean</li>
    <li> This tote has been super effective.  All products fit in big tote very well.  The little drawers pull out if needed.  Ample space for everything you can think of.  Rolls very nice.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Exactly what I needed for on location jobs!!  Would buy again. I highly recommend. This is the best one out there</li>
    <li> Great purchase... All draws and hardware work perfectly. Fits all makeup and haircare products for freelance jobs. Highly reccommend .</li>
    <li> Came right away, exactly as portrayed and holds more stuff than I expected. Easy to carry around!!</li>
    <li> It is absolutely wonderful. Ample of space.  Really like the sturdiness and wheels.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this! I am a professional face and body painter and I have moved all of my airbrush supplies into the top section, my face paints into the top of the bottom section and my standard special FX and glitters into the drawers. For 8 years I have been toting around 2 bags and a silver face painting kit. It ALL fit in the case PLUS my 8 airbrushes, manifold and 18 paints! I just wish everywhere has ramps and elevators now because if it wasn&#x27;t for the wheels I&#x27;ve made it too heavy to lift...</li>
    <li> I love it. Is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The handles on the drawers started detattching from the drawer. Do not over load the the top compartment on the bottom care it will cause the topper of the drawers to sink down and causing it to have a hard time opening.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case. I am a hairstylist and makeup artist and tend to be completely unorganized. This case has helped my scattered brain become less stressed. The drawers come completely out so I use one at my station at the salon and the other in the case. Organizing clips, combs, brushes and bobby pins are so easy. The top part I use for all my makeup supplies. I&#x27;m seriously considering purchasing another to carry my cutting, coloring and keratin system in...I&#x27;ve never felt more mobile. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this because I am a traveling make-up artist, and needed something mobile! I must say, it fit all my product comfortably! I couldn&#x27;t honestly ask more from this.  It fits all of my brushes, and I can even pack my airbrush machine in there comfortably. When I finish a job, all I have to do is zip it up and buckle it together and I am good to go! SAVES SO MUCH TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would order again :)</li>
    <li> I love this item! It has everything I need included! Thank you for this great product!</li>
    <li> The bar isn&#x27;t tall enough. I&#x27;m a tall guy and..yeah, the handle/bar needs to be taller, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great Product...Has made her life as a MUA much easier</li>
    <li> This is really good case!&lt;br /&gt;A lot better than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive but super good!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend .</li>
    <li> drawers are small but pretty sure it will work</li>
    <li> From what I saw from the first half, the bag was great quality. I just didn&#x27;t recieve the bottom part! That was supposed to be the most functional part. Highly irritated with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Seems to be well made and I am so happy to have my bridal hair and makeup things together.  It is easy to roll and my only wish is that the smaller unit was a bit bigger to hold more items.</li>
    <li> Great bags! I&#x27;m not a professional but I am an addict. I have a lot of makeup and I travel for work so with this I&#x27;m happy to have my collection with me and keep it organized.</li>
    <li> I have several pieces from this  collection and I am very satisfied with every purchase. I love the idea of the dual compartment. I travel quite a bit and do not like to pack my shoes in the same compartment as my clothes. Nice size for overnight and for carry-on. Would be nice if there was a small duffle to match!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup case. I am a professional makeup artist and its perfect for traveling all your items in one kit.</li>
    <li> I found this product perfect to be honest. It fits a lot, easy to wash, handles a lot of pressure. I use it everyday and I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I ordered this kit.  Its perfect and I received both pieces.  (I read another review that said they didn&#x27;t get a part). anyways.  I love it.  I do freelance make-up and this was perfect.  I use the small kit as my hair kit.  It fits all my curling irons and flat irons. brushes, and products.  The right side tray for some reason catches the side and wont close unless i pull it out while i close it.  but i think thats just cause its so new.  it smells weird too.  the only two downfalls.  So minor. the bottom kit is great. I put palettes on top and keep everything else in designated drawers.  I love that the drawers come out and can be placed on station or removed for larger items like airbrush compressor.  this item by itself is very light.  I love it.  you should get one and let it air out outside or spray it.  It smells like weird plastic.  otherwise im in love!!</li>
    <li> This is the answer to my nightmares as a professional makeup artist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more struggling to tote 2 bags, a brush roll and a cramped caboodle (it was truly ridiculous, but I couldn&#x27;t even find a tackle box large enough!) I thought that the drawers in this would be too small for my vast eyeshadow collection, far less for fitting the blushes, pigments, eyeliners and lip products. But they ALL fit and I&#x27;m sold on the durability of the entire product (excellent, weatherproof material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case on top, I keep all of my gems and eyelashes for Carnival/Eyelash jobs. While the case below hold all of my makeup collection. Say goodbye to your disorganisation woes!</li>
    <li> Amazing case, great quality. Wasn&#x27;t dissapointed at all. I am a Makeup Artist in training and have a lot to carry around so this is the perfect case to have since it is so spacious and useful. I am always very cautious about ordering items online because sometimes the items are different than what described or cheap quality, but this case is awesome and really good quality, it also looks very professional and is efficient. You are making a good investment in this case and it is worth the price. It is a little heavy but it is sturdy and you know it will last, and it&#x27;s not overbearing. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My husband is a makeup artist and hair stylist.  I bought this for him for Christmas.  He loves it.  It has so many compartments even a tissue dispenser pocket.  And the fact that it stacks and rolls on wheels is great when you are working on location.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how professional and sturdy this is. It looks amazing in person, not cheap at all and everything about it is worth the money. The top, smaller bag drawers stick a bit, and the bottom drawers can be tricky. I like how the bottom drawers lock and there is plenty of room for an ever growing kit. Absolutely fantastic buy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this make up case because I had out grown my old train case for location make up jobs. This is able to carry all of my make up and then some. Great for organizing large collections. I do have to be careful about how much I put in, so the weight doesn&#x27;t get too heavy. But I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Perfect for the beginner and or pro makeup artist. Love the drawers. They latch shut so they don&#x27;t just open. Love both bags. Rolls perfectly. Great size. Have room for all my makeup for my gigs. Only con: the zippers. You have to tug a little to unzip &amp; zip. Thats the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. No biggie for now but I can see this maybe wearing sooner than later. Great item for the price. Definitely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I love this to travel with my makeup when doing weddings and special occasion makeup but it&#x27;s a little on the heavy side. But it&#x27;s heavy duty and keeps everything safe!!</li>
    <li> Talk about a sturdy bag, the drawers are a good size - same quality as the plastic drawers you buy for home. Yes bag is a little heavy but that&#x27;s a good thing, it does not tip over at all. Able to fit all of my permanent makeup supplies perfectly. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> amazing product. If you are a makeup artist do not delay in buying this case. It has changed everything for me! Amazing storage, organized, beautiful, top notch quality! Thank  you! 24 years experience and finally I have found the best!</li>
    <li> This is my first professional makeup trolley and I am very happy with it!  There is a ton of room and I love the little drawers!</li>
    <li> I love this case. I upgraded from a carryon suitcase and I feel like this is my little makeup house. Its easy to lift as well. I love all the drawers and that it all black!  The only thing I wish was the top was deeper so I can fit my airbrush! But still I love it and I can&#x27;t live without it even though I only had it for a week. I never write user reviews but i just had to  because it is sooooo worth it!!</li>
    <li> This bag is the TRUTH... It allows me to pack everything I need and more into this functional, sturdy and high quality bad.  It was well worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the most useful makeup case ever. Price was good too if you compare to the smaller ones and way better built.</li>
    <li> I love this case.  I’ve been using the case for a little over two months now.  I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist, but I love makeup, I have a lot of it and enjoy it.  I transport my makeup from place to place and work with women who need a little coaching when it comes to techniques, etc.  This case makes it easy to store, organize and transport my makeup and hair tools.  The case is easy to clean and the handle and wheels are sturdy.  I love all the drawers!  The drawers were what drew me to this item...I love having a place for everything.  This was definitely a good investment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newly licensed Cosmetologist with so much to carry.  I&#x27;m starting to travel alot and need to carry more items with me.  These cases are wonderfully made and very efficient.  It holds 12 pull out trays to store all your loose supplies; which everyone knows we&#x27;re always collecting.  The only thing is that I didn&#x27;t receive a warranty for this item but Im enjoying this product very much!</li>
    <li> Love it! Isn&#x27;t as lightweight as I expected but it does the job</li>
    <li> This case is huge!! I have 3 sets of brushes ( aprox 60 total) 15 different foundations, 11 eyeshadow palettes , 5 mascaras, 5 bronzers, 6 blushes, 10 pigment shadows, a bottle of brush cleaner, brush belt, towels to take w/ me to wipe off brushes when working, 20+ lipstick and 10+ lip gloss... Oh and 4 shades of setting powder and there&#x27;s still room for more!!!! Plus I have the little things like makeup wipes, blending sponges , etc. I couldn&#x27;t believe how I was able to fit it all in here and have it all so well organized. If you working on a client and don&#x27;t want to bend over to get into the drawers; they&#x27;re removable! 5 stars! A+! Sturdy wheel base and handle for rolling case. Every makeup artist should own 1 ( or 2)  or just for the enthusiasts who has a lot of makeup.</li>
    <li> Not much to say ....this case is awesome I love it very well made n sturdy this is your best bet all you traveling nailtechs... makeup artist....cosmetologists awesome traincase I am sure with care you will get years of usage!</li>
    <li> It is so easy to use and the second small case is perfect for hair or smaller gigs. I highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Very upset.&lt;br /&gt;I just got this case and its already broken.&lt;br /&gt;the zipper is broken and the flap is hanging down.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is loose, and the wheels feel they are falling apart also.&lt;br /&gt;Im a professional Makeup Artist and i loved this case for the first 3 weeks but now its just falling apart.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and looks good</li>
    <li> I love it but If the wheels break is there any way I can change them?</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, holds more than I thought! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I Love this case! Brilliant:-D I travel extensivly on location. This is far better than any case out there. If its been made I&#x27;ve owned it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the case on time and it was well packed when it arrived and it is exactly what I needed. Thank you, you&#x27;ve made a very weary artist happy.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> This was larger than expected. Has so much room! I travel around a lot for weddings and events and this has even a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> Im in love with this makeup bag!!! Omg its a must for any makeup artist. The best makeup case i have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I was so pleasently surprised when I got my new makeup case. The wheels are fabulous the drawers are great straps and zippers work wonders its just wonderful. One of my drawers does stick - but other than that it really is PERFECTION. They really took time and thought about all the details with this makeup case and that has made my professional life so much easier!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as she was starting her makeup artist business ( [...] for anyone interested ) and she is in absolute LOVE with this.  It holds everything she&#x27;s got ( and then some ), rolls smoothly, isn&#x27;t too heavy and has held up.    We purchased one before this that looked a lot \\&quot;prettier\\&quot; but was damaged upon shipping and it was obvious that the quality of work just wasn&#x27;t there.  While this one isn&#x27;t flashy it gets the job done and will be with you for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been doing professional makeup for years and I have been taking my time with purchasing a trolly case because I wanted to make sure that I had one that would fit me, be sturdy and last for a long time... I have lots of makeup artist friends and their cases cost twice as much as aren&#x27;t as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Now, although I have just bought this, I feel like it will last for quite some time because of the material and design... there are a couple flaws that I have found but nothing to get upset about just yet...&lt;br /&gt;the top box has hinged racks that can be pulled out away from each other... when I&#x27;m pulling them out to open the plastic racks it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s when I am trying to put them back when the left one gets stuck. I have to pull the outside of the box to put the rack back into place so I can close the lid.&lt;br /&gt;On the bottom box the front zipper flap doesn&#x27;t like to zip up all the way once it passes the drawers because the box becomes a tad larger at the top which causes tension in the material that is trying to be zipped up... I am afraid that the zippers might break if forced too many times so I tend to leave just the top of them open. The plastic drawers are somewhat &amp;#34;chinsy&amp;#34; and seem like the locking piece may break on them over time but again, for now I&#x27;m being gentle with them... the drawers, openings and compartments are perfect for traveling and I am pleased. I hope that it lasts because I do truly enjoy this one...</li>
    <li> Love this case! It&#x27;s very portable and so simple to use. Organizes my makeup tools so makeup applications are a breeze.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and received my bag and I just fell in love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was able to put all my makeup in this bag and I still have room left for more, &amp;#34;so I guess that means a trip to to a cosmetic store for more supplies&amp;#34; :-). Makeup artist or any one who just needs a great bag please order this ASAP. You wont be disappointed.</li>
