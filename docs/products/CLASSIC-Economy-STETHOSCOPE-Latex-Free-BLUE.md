    <li> This works great and the price was excellent!  My kids love it too!  I might have to get another one!</li>
    <li> Well, got this to hear the to be born baby&#x27;s heartbeat.... My wife is in her 29th week... and all medical sites say that the baby&#x27;s heart beat can be heard with a stethoscope, but this one doesnt let us hear anything. If you are buying for the same purpose, please look at something else. Our heartbeats are heard just fine though...</li>
    <li> Standard stethscope.  Works ok.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast, got it in like 3 days. The product is okay, got what i payed for. All in all, i&#x27;m pretty satisfied :)</li>

    <li> I gave it to my grandchildren and my daughter reported they have used it with enjoyment and alacrity on every organism with a heart that can immobilized long enough to use the device. They have several dogs and cats, not to mention the other humans in their home. Grandpa got a rah rah and that is always satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Hansford</li>
    <li> ! P E R F E C T for grandkiddo to learn auscultation on all of her &amp;#62; &amp;#62; &amp;#62; animals !  lub - dub / lub dub and gurgle - gurgle and &amp;#34;take a deeeep breath; HOLD it&amp;#34; !  She loves it !</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift. They work well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in the blue it states and shows.&lt;br /&gt;I rushed delivered it for school. (can&#x27;t attend without one.)&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I get a black one and ask for the correct order, I was told I couldn&#x27;t use the product even if it was a swap out. I definitely wasn&#x27;t missing school because I had the wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;After some haggling and a piece of my mind, the company agreed to ship a new one to me and allowed me to keep the wrong one as well...&lt;br /&gt;Today I received the blue one. A dark navy blue one...&lt;br /&gt;This will be the 3rd shipment of the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing in nearly every way.&lt;br /&gt;And honestly only rate the product itself with at best a 3 star.&lt;br /&gt;You can hear absolutely everything external with these. Good for in school. But for the professional... NO!</li>
    <li> works ok if you remember to cover the hole while trying to listen, my toddler loves it.</li>
    <li> SUPER GARBAGE.  I&#x27;m not expecting a Littman or professional quality stethoscope, by the way.  I have significant medical experience, and actually one steth. I use is actually really cheap, but it works well.  I&#x27;m getting these for students of a class.... but when I tried to use one, it was HORRIBLE.  Very muffled heart sounds -- don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, this company is now asking me to PAY FOR SHIPPING ($10.18)-- even though when I bought them it was with &amp;#34;free shipping.&amp;#34;  This is in ADDITION TO THE 15% RESTOCKING FEE.  How they can retroactively ask for shipping is beyond me.  Whoever runs this company, I hate them!  I&#x27;m contacting amazon, and I&#x27;ll update this review as to the conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these stethoscopes and both work very well. I bought for my twin daughters who are almost 3. They really enjoy them.</li>
    <li> Great economy stethoscope for what I was using it for. my students loved it and it served as a great tool for practice for them and saved them lots of money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Granddaughter and it works great for her.  She&#x27;s 3 1/2 years old and I get a check up every time I visit.</li>
    <li> Good price...  And it works too.  It was even cheaper than the toy type ones.  It is light but made well.  I recommend it for whatever reason you might need a stethoscope!</li>
    <li> Awful product, very poorly made, looks more like a toddler toy, I also did not get the colors I ordered which would have been ok if there was a note in the package saying they were all out, but nothing.</li>
    <li> These were good for the price, I got them bc my almost 3yr old son is obsessed with anything doctor and he had a little toy set from playschool brand, and theres was great for kids but my son tore theres apart, and I wanted him to be able to still be our little doctor lol. The price was great and it was good quality, but bc it was a kid playing with it, the &amp;#34;speaker&amp;#34; (the part that goes to the chest), got dented and it wasnt on really secure so it gor ripped off pretty easily, but it does pop right back on! I would deffinetly recommend this for people who will use it lightly. It also fit my (almost) 3yr old and I very comfortably.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Ear buds not comfortable and it isn&#x27;t very clear sounding, but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought a new stethoscope for vet tech school but it was so heavy and uncomfortable to have around my neck that I had to find something else. It&#x27;s no fancy name brand, but it works great, is light and comfortable.</li>
