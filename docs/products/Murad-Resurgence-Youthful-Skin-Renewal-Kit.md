<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this stuff so far, clean and hydrating... think I see some improvement.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> The wife has been using it for a month or So, she says it feels on on to hard on the Face, I&#x27;ve seen A Diffference,</li>
    <li> those are samples, so tiny for $40.00 too much</li>
    <li> it was just ok for me</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while. The eye cream is a sample size and though you don&#x27;t need much it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I do notice less puffiness with the eye cream and I like  that. I also like the facial wash. I have normal skin with a sometimes oily T zone and this doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry. I use it both in the morning and evening. I have not used the other two products yet because I have some I am finishing up, but will come back when I do and write on those. I have a pretty extensive facial care regimen in the morning and evening and I like to try different products to see how they work for me. I know this is meant to be a step 1-4 product, but I have chosen to use each individually.</li>
    <li> Great buy thank you so much love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, my face has never felt so soft and moisturized. I can&#x27;t do without it!! I bought the bigger sizes after I tried the kit. My face had gotten so dry since  I had hit my 40s, now it feels like it did in my 20s! Love it</li>
    <li> Very Happy with my purchase.  Thank you!  Highly recommend this item as it&#x27;s a perfect way to try all the products</li>
    <li> I really love this Murad Resurgence kit.  I have only been using it for about one week and can already feel a difference in my skin. I have a few breakouts but I am not sure if it is from this product.</li>
    <li> just  wonderful product  !! this is the one!</li>
    <li> This an expensive trial kit. It states 96% of users will experience firmer skin in just 4 weeks. This kit will not last 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> expensive, smells bad, doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been fairly average... occasional dryness in the winter, maybe a little oilier in summer, a few blemishes from time to time, but that&#x27;s about it. The skin on my face was clear enough that I didn&#x27;t typically wear any foundation or powder. I ordered Murad Resurgence because I&#x27;m seeing deeper lines on my face and starting to experience some hormonal changes. I had seen the commercials, and hoped this would help me look a little more youthful for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey? Yes.. but you get what you pay for, right? After using the washing and moisturizing regimen for a week or so, I started getting breakouts... a little alarming because even as a teenager I didn&#x27;t really break out much.  But because I&#x27;d heard that any time you change skin-care products, you may experience changes as your skin adjusts to new ingredients, I didn&#x27;t get too alarmed at first. But after a month, my face was a disaster... very literally dozens of giant, red bumps that hurt (some with a burning sensation), whiteheads everywhere. It actually spread to the sides of my neck and was so embarrassing I was avoiding social situations. Murad says &amp;#34;youthful skin&amp;#34;.. but this is not at all what I had in mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called their 800 number, I was apologized to repeatedly, and told that they do see reactions in people whose skin is &amp;#34;oily or acne-prone, or sensitive&amp;#34; (...BTW, my skin is none of those) due to its ingredients. I was asked if I had followed the instructions (YES, quite precisely). I was then told that if only I&#x27;d talked to the right rep, they would have &amp;#34;informed to me&amp;#34; that there can be reactions. She then went on to say that &amp;#34;as us women, we can be aging five different ways all at once&amp;#34;, said maybe I should have tried a different product line, and proceeded into a sales pitch. NOOOO thanks. And no refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m nursing my damaged skin back to health with Cetaphil and have resorted to wearing cover up and mineral powder for camouflage. At some point, I&#x27;ll go back to over-the-counter Olay Regenerist. I would not recommend this product to anyone... If you try this product and your skin takes a turn for the worse, my best advice would be to stop immediately... don&#x27;t count on it getting better.</li>
    <li> I used it before and I&#x27;m going back to it because it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I have auto immune disease that affects my skin and cannot use many skin products.</li>
    <li> The items are in such tiny containers and would not last a month</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. After a couple of uses you will see a big difference in your skins&#x27; appearance. Great!</li>
    <li> This product is not what is cracked up to be.  I used this product over a month, and really do not&lt;br /&gt;see any change in my skin.  I probably would not buy this problem again.  It is advertised on TV as the&lt;br /&gt;best product, in my opinion it is not.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be travel size, but I guess for the price I should have known.  But it doesn&#x27;t matter… I love this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Thank you!!  :-).</li>
    <li> It is a great product, it made a big difference in my skin I highly recommend it, I have been using it for 4 months</li>
    <li> I have used Murad in the past. It&#x27;s a wonderful skin care line. I purchased from Authentic Skin Care, their prices are good, shipping was very quick. Will use them again when more product is needed.</li>
    <li> Great product. This set is perfect to see if I like it enough to purchase full size tubes. Thank you</li>
    <li> good, seems to improve my skin slightly but no BIG changes.</li>
    <li> I see some results in this 57 year old,sun damage face. It make your skin feel so soft. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Good products. Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I am in my 30&#x27;s with hormonal breakout. I do still have to alternate these products with an acne cleanser and moisturizer or I will break out.</li>
    <li> All it did was give me pimples, I never had pimples in my life not even as a teenager. would never buy again</li>
    <li> wondefull product, great results, leaves your ski&lt;br /&gt;n radient. People cant believe Im 59 They say I look like Im in my 40&#x27;s . I use nothing but Murad skin care.</li>
    <li> all excited about this product when i ordered it, when i got it oh my god the face wash smells so bad let this was sitting so long in the store. total waste of money.</li>
    <li> not for my skin, had a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> Big fat waste of money. Did nothing for me other than make my skin red &amp; irritated. I was really disappointed because it worked great for a friend. Not at all for me</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t happy with this...will buy it in ulta from now on. I believe this was a knock off as I had never had a reaction to this product before and this was the first time I purchased outside of the store.</li>
    <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  I have a hard time paying for this product, but when I gather up the money, this is what I buy.  I have very sensitive skin and dry all over.  This product causes my skin to look moist and younger looking.  I have also noticed wrinkles are not so easy to see anymore.  Please ask Dr. Murad to lower the price some!  Thank you again.</li>
    <li> This does help moisturize and has a very faint scent.  Works well except the eye cream made my eye lids itchy.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely amazing for a youthful look! It is by far my favorite skin product! Recommend it for everyone at any age!</li>
    <li> The only downside is I wish the cleanser was larger, since I use this the most.  Great for your skin.  I am a former esthetician, and this is one of the best products on the market.  Also purchasing from Amazon was less expensive that the cosmetic store I frequent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m being complimented on how my skin glows and has a more youthful appearance.  Good kit for travel which is why it was purchased.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was the same size as on the infomercial.  My fault for not looking more closely at the details, but overall disappointed for the size products I received.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would,.</li>
    <li> Even though these are small sizes, the product last for a long time.  Made my skin glowing and soft, the eye cream works well too.</li>
    <li> wish the tubes were a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Tried the kit, did not see any noticeable results.  The products actually made my skin feel drier.</li>
    <li> what a waste of money; tried to return after giving it enough time to work only to discover there&#x27;s a time limit on returns by this seller so i CAN&#x27;T return it!  product did NOTHING it claims.  don&#x27;t waste your money!  i&#x27;ve tried TONS of products; i&#x27;m almost 51 &amp; have terrible bags under my eyes (along with dark circles)...use AVON&#x27;s (yes...i said AVON)  Anew Clinical Eye Lift Pro Dual Eye System (order it on Amazon...it&#x27;s a LOT less expensive than purchasing from a &#x27;lady&#x27;).  i&#x27;ve only used it am/pm for TWO DAYS and i&#x27;m SHOCKED at how much better my eyes are already looking!  i&#x27;m SO impressed with this AVON product i&#x27;ve got my AMAZON cart filled with their Clinical Pro Line Eraser Treatment, Clinical Pro Line Eraser Eye Treatment, Clinical Resurfacing Expert Smoothing Fluid, and Clinical Advanced Wrinkle Corrector (all in the Anew line).  I was given a sample of the Pro Line Eraser Treatment; have used it am/pm for a couple of days, too...my overall skin is looking younger/fresher, and it&#x27;s attacking my wrinkles.  MURAD is NOT worth your time or money.  I&#x27;da NEVER THOT to try AVON...but i&#x27;m SO GLAD i did!</li>
    <li> Do not buy if you have sensitive skin. Made my skin super dry!</li>
    <li> Have been using Murad for several years</li>
    <li> No sizes of the bottles posted in ad. I paid $50 for 4 bottles the size of my pinky finger...not happy :(</li>
    <li> does nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this.  It&#x27;s a simple regimen, and that&#x27;s what I need.  I use it with a spin brush to help with exfoliation.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in wrinkles, but I immediately noticed a change in skin tone, which I&#x27;m very pleased with.  I had some redness and uneven tone changes due to aging, which have decreased dramatically.</li>
    <li> This items was delivered within 3 days I&#x27;m impressed with the results my skin is clearing and appears firmer the eye cream is a definite repurchase item for me</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. I don&#x27;t know if I possibly received a counterfeit like other reviewers claim? In either case, I noticed it had an odor that seemed a bit off for a face cream. It definitely wasn&#x27;t pleasant. Unfortunately, it caused some deep blemishes. I continued with the product for several weeks to see if it would clear with no resolve. The under eye cream did work very well which is why I am giving this product 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and saw reviews for Murad&#x27;s product. Everyone seemed happy with their results so I bought the Resurgence system to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the cleansing system (cleanser, anti-aging cream and moisturizer). My face felt nice and well conditioned. I think there needs to be an exfoliant included as well but it IS a sampler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disappointment lies with the dark circle cream. 4 weeks of using the product as directed and no change at all. Sort of bummed about that but I kind of expected it to not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my daily and nightly regimen will include a new concoction for dark circles. Witch Hazel soaks for 20 minutes followed with Preparation H dabbled on and resting on the dark circles as I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, no more Murad  I&#x27;m going back to Old School Remedies.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, glad I didn&#x27;t get caught up in the auto reorder.  I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> My skin is glowing , my acne has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;And my lines are minimized .&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like was the eye cream , I could not see any improvement .</li>
    <li> Great Buy -- Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> This is only a TRIAL size, and VERY over priced.  The box even has \\&quot;suggested price $45\\&quot; They are charging much more!  I haven&#x27;t even tried the product yet, but, I will NEVER order from this company again!</li>
    <li> I may be jumping the &#x27;gun&#x27; writing a review on this product after just one day of use but I actually noticed a difference right away! Now I know these sizes are small but that&#x27;s what I expected for such a low price. But the small sizes are just what I needed since I didn&#x27;t want to invest in the full sizes right away because I didn&#x27;t know if they would be worth it or not. Well, I have to say, I definitely will be ordering the full sizes once these trial sizes are gone. You only need a small amount of each so these sizes are perfect although I&#x27;m sure they will be gone in about 3 weeks. I did read other reviews stating the sizes should be bigger but to be honest, they are perfect for someone who knows very little about these products and just wants to try them out for a short time. I am looking forward to seeing more positive results after a few weeks of use. My skin looks younger and at the age of 47, definitely makes my fine lines less noticeable. My eyes actually look less puffy and more youthful as well! I&#x27;ll keep you posted on my results after further use!!</li>
    <li> Now grant it, I just got the product, and all I did is wash my face with the cleanser and put the night cream on.  Even with just cleanser, I felt the difference in my skin, and yes, I know this is way too soon to brag about it, but it feels great.  Then I put the night cream on, love it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is a trail package, but I yes it will last a month, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 46, soon to be 47, so surely if what this promises, &amp;#34;hormonal skin&amp;#34; this is exactly where I am at.  But I must say, so far, this is the best product that I have put on my skin in a long time. Most of the stuff I have used has either been Loreal, which I must say, never been too impressed with, and the other is from Whole Foods, but so far, this feels awesome on my skin....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will come in and give an update...  But so far, was well worth the price....</li>
    <li> The product is excellent.  I was a little disappointed in the the size of the individual products in the kit.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Great price and does what it says for your face!! Recommend to all ladies to try!! Great soothing lotion to go along with it.</li>
    <li> Definitely can see a change in my skin, but not too impressed with the eye cream.</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect for traveling. Will purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s with really dry skin. I tried this product hoping for results that were positive. Did not get any.</li>
    <li> I like the murad resurgence line alot but it is a bit pricey for me at the moment.</li>
    <li> iTS GIVING ME BLEMISHES. NEVER HAD THEM SO NOT SURE ITS RIGHT FOR ME!</li>
    <li> The product is okay, but the light green color of the text is unreadable. Very annoying..</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my face feel.  I do notice when I skip days in using it.  I get complimented on my skin now.  This container is a small &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; but it does last a few weeks if used correctly.</li>
    <li> Great real Murad products!</li>
    <li> Really did reduce lines around my eyes within a week or two.  The cleanser and night cream lasted close to two months even though I was using them every day; the others lasted about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Products work well together. Could be a little bit bigger in size. But still love it.</li>
    <li> Have been using these products ever since Lange&#x60; went out of business over 15 years ago and love the results.  Exact same item I bought from a beauty store at half the price.</li>
    <li> Best product ever...Just enough and I order when I want.</li>
    <li> Still in the box.  Have other products to finish before trying this.  Daughter said it was too harsh for her skin.</li>
    <li> I tried step 1, 2 and 3 one night and woke up the next day with small red patches all over my face, dry skin and sun spots much darker than usual. That might be a reaction to the glycolic acid in the Serum. Hard to tell, as there were no ingredient listings on the tubes I got...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for me. Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> There is hardly any product in this kit and you really cannot use it enough to tell if it works.</li>
    <li> Ok, first off, yes, these are trial size and great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Obagi products before and they were AMAZING, with that being said.  I&#x27;d compare Murad resurgence to Obagi.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, my skin feels great.  You&#x27;ll notice the dead skin slough off, so don&#x27;t be alarmed thinking it&#x27;s dry skin.  Obagi did the same thing, but 10 times worse!  So getting throug the first 15 days or so of the dry skin flaking off is part of the &amp;#34;Resurgence&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 50, and I&#x27;ve seen my skin  greatly improve just in this past week. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or itchy or oily, and it doesn&#x27;t burn (unless you accidentaly get it in your eyes) I can&#x27;t wait to order the full sizes.</li>
    <li> It helped a lot with smoothing my neck and facial skin except I was really hoping for better results around my eyes, still crows feet. but overall I liked it.</li>
    <li> I had watched the commercial on the television and it had so much hype...I was disappointed in the amount that was shipped...I thought it was supposed to last a month...Probably won&#x27;t order again...</li>
    <li> I havent seen any difference.in fact meaningful beauty does more than this.im going back to cindy.sorry i wasted my $.</li>
    <li> The cleaner was to strong for my skin, which I was kinda disappointed about. My face started to burn just after 1 use. So I stop putting it and the other steps all over my face. What I did do was continue to use the other steps just around my eyes and I&#x27;m happy with the results Im getting. But I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The Murad product line is exceptional.  It really works for my older skin!  This sampler pack is perfect to get started.  I just wish it had the day time moisturizer instead of the night time but I use it during the day anyway.</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference at all in my skin don&#x27;t bother. the tubes are small and does not work for me</li>
    <li> This product made my face break out like crazy!  It is not labeled non-comedogenic, and obviously it does clog pores!  I really liked the Murad hydrating toner so I thought I would try the cleanser kit. What a huge waste of money, and it took a month to get my skin back under control.  I will never buy Murad cleansing products again!</li>
    <li> the product is ok but it comes in the smallest size available and do not think the price is worth it. I would try something different next time.</li>
    <li> Products came fast! I didn&#x27;t realize it was a trail pack but still well worth the money! Already see a huge difference and will be buying full size once these are empty.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I started using this product about a month ago and I can definitely see a difference in skin tone, texture, softness and the appearance of lines are starting to diminish. Very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have several products to try in this Murad line.  I like all of them.  It&#x27;s a great price for all of the products.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money or the time trying it. I used this for over a month, no change. I deal with uneven skin tone for the most part. I sent it back, received a full refund. I purchased Olay Microdermabrasion kit and after the 1st try, I LOVED it. Went on to purchase the day/night/eye cream and also the exfoliating face wash. Very, very happy with the results. My face has never felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> Though there have been glowing reviews about the youthful appearance this product is supposed to give, I found it heavy and my sensitive skin had so many breakouts, I discarded it before I used half of it. If you have sensitive skin, beware.</li>
    <li> All of Dr. Murad products are very good. It does what it says and even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only dislike, is that it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> Saw Joan London talking about this stuff on T.V.,but it was to pricey,so found it on Amazon way cheaper,and they don&#x27;t force you to auto pay (you know where you get a shipment once a month weather you need it or not) it didnt&#x27; work as fast as Joan claimed but after a week I could def. see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Really saw a difference in my skin in a short time</li>
    <li> I have tried many products but this gave me instant results. very</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 and my skin was looking old and tired.  This product is just wonderful and my skin has a glow again.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it.  One of the best products I have ever had on my skin.  Feels nourishing, goes on smooth and my skin is happy.  Which makes me happy ...</li>
    <li> Very effective, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Been using Steps 1&amp; 2 for two weeks.  The only thing I had a resurgence of with this product is acne!  53yo and my face is covered with it.  This sometimes happens when I try new products, but Step #1 seems to be just a thick lotion and it&#x27;s clogging my pores.  Step #2 contains alcohol, as evidenced by the stinging upon application, then ensuing redness.  How is alcohol in any way good for aging skin?  I&#x27;m going back to Murad Clarifying Cleanser (which BTW you can get cheaper on eBay).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! will never use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;JT</li>
    <li> I will purchase again. I expected it to work faster</li>
    <li> For the price, I guess I expected a larger supply.  I have sensitive skin, and have noticed that the brow cream really irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stay with my previous product.</li>
    <li> Just started using so not much to report yet. So far I love these products. The moisturizer feels great and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance that bothers me. We&#x27;ll see how it goes...</li>
    <li> Everything as described</li>
    <li> I have been using the cleanser and like it very much.  So I thought I would try the serum, night and eye creams.  While the cleanser is very good for both hydration and exfoliation, the other products are too drying for my skin type for everyday use.  I will use them at times when I feel my skin needs a less emollient product but I will continue to rely on my usual regimen on a daily basis.  Murad makes very good, pure products.  I do recommend them according to skin type,</li>
    <li> Decided to change my skincare routine &amp; I absolutely LOVE it! My skin feels so much softer and smoother. I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and my skin has started to change. I was starting to have breakouts along my jaw line. Since starting these products, I haven&#x27;t had any issues. My skin looks great and I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m not using as much concealer as I have been. Will definitely continue using these products.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully</li>
    <li> I love Murad. I started using it three months ago. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I started using this and within a week noticed that my skin felt tighter and it seemed that there was always a film of wax on it.  After 2 weeks I noticed a lot of my pores filling up with something and my face breaking out.  I am pretty sure that there is some sort of wax substance in this product.  I stopped using it after 3 weeks.  I have great skin I just wanted to use this to prevent wrinkles and to help with the ones I have.  I am now dealing with small pimple like spots on my forehead and cheeks.  Hopefully it will all go away soon.  I am giving it 3 stars because I also know that like all products it also depends on the persons skin type.  Also the amount of product is very little so for $40 you are not getting alot.. Almost like a hotel soap and shampoo set.</li>
