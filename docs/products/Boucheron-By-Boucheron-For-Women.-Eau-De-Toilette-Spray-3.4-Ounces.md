    <li> This is a BIG fragrance with lot-o-note. It&#x27;s well-rounded, well-blended and full of depth &amp; character. A classic-type of perfume for a classy lady. It&#x27;s on the sweet side due to all the white florals. Very nice if you like that kind of thing. I prefer my orientals spicier, so not my thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boucheron is a high quality perfume. If you like Elizabeth Taylor frags and are ready to step it up a notch, put this on your test list. Just my 2 cents.</li>

    <li> This product that I received does NOT smell like the Bucheron I&#x27;ve been getting in the department store.  I&#x27;m not sure it is real.</li>
