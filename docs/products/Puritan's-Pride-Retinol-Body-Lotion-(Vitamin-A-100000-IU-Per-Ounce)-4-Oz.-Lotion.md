    <li> It goes on very dry. It is not moisturizing at all.</li>
    <li> This vitamin A, Retinol cream for the body is the best I have tried untill now. I have tried products from the most fine and expansive brands on the market and did not come across one that eareses fine lines on the whole body from the very firts use. It is even better than the thicker one in the jar, from the same house. A will defenetly continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> OK ... lotion. The bottle is really small. When I ordered a bottle of body lotion, I thought it would be a lot bigger than what I got.  This bottle would only last a week with daily use. Also the retinol is not good quality.  I ordred something else on amazon which was less costly. quadruple the zize and a better quality of Retinol.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Small container though.</li>
    <li> This was a nice size for travel or sampling. Light, and moisturizing ,with no stickiness or leftover film. I do believe it made a difference in the look of my dry skin. Glad I tried this one.</li>
    <li> Lotion absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> This lotion has made a difference in my skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy or pore clogging, and the skin on my face feels more taut and radiant.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I will order again did not see any real change? Probably stick with the RX Retinol. Also smaller bottle than expected.</li>
    <li> I just received this it came ups I ordered 3 bottles they are small 2 of the bottles somehow got unscrewed and the packing bubble was popped. Other than that I like the cream it works I&#x27;ll order more</li>
    <li> I purchases this to try and fade some stretch marks on my stomach from the Birth of my children.Who are way older now Any way I read in a magazine that this would be good to use but may work faster for newer stretch marks and longer on older ones.So  far I&#x27;m noticing them becoming lighter so for that reason I will keep buying .The price and size is reasonable in my oppinion . Could have paid  a substantial amount  more for top of the line retinol  but this is fine for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t care for smell but worked great on the skin</li>
    <li> This is my new fav, it&#x27;s light, not greasy, and a little goes a long way, cause the bottle is small!</li>
    <li> Tiny bottle and I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product works great after a couple weeks I noticed a improvement.I use it once a day I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have now gone through several bottles of this and really see no difference. Feels nice going on, but I was hoping for more of a difference in skin quality.</li>
    <li> I ONLY NOTICED MINOR BENEFITS FROM THIS PRODUCT. MAYBE IF THERE WAS MORE THAN 4oz THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER REACTION. WHY IS THERE SO LITTLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT?</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week.  I may decide on a 5-star rating when I have finished this bottle if I continue to notice improvement in my arms and chest area.</li>
    <li> Small amount of cream for money. No evidence of any redness to skin after wearing it at night such as with my facial retinol. Won&#x27;t buy again. Doubt it works</li>
    <li> Love this product...makes my skin feel very smooth and it came very quickly.</li>
    <li> I like the way fill and make your skin every smooth and came on time when i order thank you amazon</li>
