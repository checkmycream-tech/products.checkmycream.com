      <li>I recently purchased a second, but the first one is going strong.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
      <li>Decent build but not great, good blades,</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell only Wahl has the longer combs for clipping your hair (up to 2&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see rust, let alone so soon.</li>
      <li>So far I have cut my hair twice and my kids hair a couple of times.</li>
      <li>Tried to fixed it by redusing power - but in this case it doesn&#x27;t cut in proper way.</li>
      <li>The blade was not sharp enough.</li>

    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but looks like it has everything you would want in a clipper set.  Nice case for it all.</li>
    <li> Bonita y efficient. The price is the best. It comes in a pretty nice case to protect it and storage</li>
    <li> From the moment I opened the box and plugged it in, this razor did not work properly. It rattles instead of buzzes and will not cut hair.</li>
    <li> Very good and cutting my family&#x27;s hair with great precision. i love it. i used to use razor blades foe a tier finish before i bought the clipped but now i realize iy ers a waste of time and money for the clipped can do the job perfectly well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve run through 2 other clippers from different companies.  I like this one though.  It&#x27;s basic with no frills.  Not very stylish (who cares?).  The combs are quite a bit more flimsy than my old Andis, and they dont hold onto the clipper as well either.  However, this is made up for by the selection of combs that Wahl has.  As far as I can tell only Wahl has the longer combs for clipping your hair (up to 2&amp;#34;).  It&#x27;s as good as any other clipper out there I think.  Just make sure to oil the blades.  Comes with a good selection of combs and a good case. A year later and it&#x27;s still running strong.</li>
    <li> This is a solid design that has lasted decades. I recently purchased a second, but the first one is going strong.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my wife to cut my hair.  It was priced right. Great product.  I would recommend it for home use to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried to use it but it&#x27;s very loud. Tried to fixed it by redusing power - but in this case it doesn&#x27;t cut in proper way. On original power noise is so high. I&#x27;m using adapter 120v/50HZ for Europe, but I do not think that this is the reason.</li>
    <li> I take good care of my clippers, my previous set lasted over 7 years. The third time using these I noticed rust had already formed on the blades. I&#x27;ve never had this before on my conair clippers. I always cleaned the blades after use and applies the oil included in the kit. I&#x27;m surprised to see rust, let alone so soon. Aside from the rust, I was very impressed with the cut and the power of motor.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair every four to six weeks.  He likes it very short and the clipper set I had was wearing out, so I went shopping.  This is a name I trust, so I got the kit.  Does a great job!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe you can get this great product for this price. We will always be loyal to Wahl. Their products are quality and last forever.</li>
    <li> Decent build but not great, good blades, great price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for casual user. They sacrificed build a little to get good blades and lots of guide. A good trade off in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Awful! I wish I can return it! Never again will I purchase this item again , you get what you pay.</li>
    <li> Seller delivered product in a timely fashion and in great quality.  These Wahl clippers are a trustworthy and long lasting brand!</li>
    <li> The blade was not sharp enough. It has a cheap feel. Do not trust reviews, because they are misleading. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t buy yet, I&#x27;m plan it , but let me tell you a long story.&lt;br /&gt;I have it for 22 years, cutting my hair every 3 month or so, keeping it oiled every time I finish and still cutting and working.&lt;br /&gt;Some one know I cut myself my hair and gave to me as a present in Christmas a Remington machine and for 2 years haven&#x27;t use it and one day I tried and that machine could not cut a hair from me, and my wife use it for dogs and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I think like Wahl there is nothing good. I tested for 22 years,so I planning to buy again this model.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The product worked great on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending money to cut my hair every month so I decided to purchase this hair cutting kit. So far I have cut my hair twice and my kids hair a couple of times. It works perfect to this point. Nothing wrong with it. It seems to be very well put together and cuts very nicely. If something ever happens to this kit I would buy another....that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
    <li> excellent article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the quality mu and the timely delivery&lt;br /&gt;excellent article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the quality mu and the timely delivery</li>
    <li> we had a problem with this razor my son cut his head with this razor and so he won&#x27;t use it any more.  He even had the adjustment on it, so it did not do well for us.</li>
