<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. It one takes a little drop to smooth under your eyes. So far the lines around my eyes are disappearing. I was told it would start in 14 days,I&#x27;m starting to see results after using it for 5 days. Love it and am very impressed. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Received the product as stated. Need to have a chance to use the product for a time to determine results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for four weeks, twice a day, and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my wrinkles or fine lines. I guess no product can work for everyone!</li>
    <li> I could not see any improvement in my skin.  It didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin either.  I would not buy this again.  I am over seventy.  It may do very well on a much younger person.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel, silky without feeling greasy. Only downfall is I wish the packaging contained more of the product itself.</li>
    <li> just okay...nothing special</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! I definitely noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s complexion after using this product. I feel like my skin is clearer and more evenly toned after using this. Also on a side note I got a lovely email from the company&#x27;s owner asking how I liked the product. I thought that was so nice and unusual, excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> “Great firming capability!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m being cautiously optimistic but this product seems to be working....I&#x27;m going to order it again to see how it progresses...</li>
    <li> This is a really SUPER product.  I was skeptical but after a week of using it I saw my whole face change.  The first  bottle lasted at least 2 months.  I use it in the morning and use my regular moisturizer over it before makeup.  Just ordered my second bottle.  My face no longer has that &amp;#34;tree trunk&amp;#34; look.  It is very affordable and makes me feel like a million bucks.  Try it!!!  I wear a lot less make up now.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for just over two weeks so far so good. I would recommend this product, don&#x27;t hesitate to try it. I am looking forward to trying some of Naturefuls&#x27; other products.</li>
    <li> Have only used it for a few days, but the product seems to be consistent quality with other such products I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> it did not work for me</li>
    <li> My face has never felt better -the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared and I love this -- a great size and a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this because as I have gotten older I have noticed a big difference in my skin, especially the neck area.  After using this I can see a HUGE difference.  I washed my face as normal, applied the Hyaluronic Serum , then applied my regular moisturizer.  I received this as a promotion for free, for my honest opinion.  I have only used it a couple times and I am already seeing results.  I also noticed that it has a nice , light silky feeling to it.  You will not be disappointed in this!</li>
    <li> I specifically gave this review a month to see what it would do instead of a review after a day or two.  It does feel like an instant face lift like it states.  I have deeper lines around my eyes and I have noticed after using Hyaluronic Acid Serum, they are barely there. I wish now that I would of taken a before and after picture.  Face feels like it is glowing and very well balanced with moisture and radiance. I do know that Free Radicals are very bad for you and this will help remove the damage done by them.  I used twice a day (morning and night) and then used a moisturizer as normal.  Continuing on using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free but this is my honest and unbiased opinion!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This left my face feeling nice and smooth.

It is never too early...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> Nice product .  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Lo he estado usando por 2 semanas todas las noches y me gusta como me deja la piel. Mi piel se siente mas suave y radiante</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I am going to purchase this for my sister inlaw as part of a new mom care package for her baby shower. I am also using reviva labs rose water facial spray and shea moisture camomil  baby lotion for my face. I am seeing a significant Chang in my skin elasticity.  I will use this product for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Seems to work a little.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. My skin felt so smooth and soft after using this. I let my mother use some and she fell in love as well. I would recommend this serum to anyone looking for healthier and smoother, younger looking skin. It&#x27;s well worth the money you pay for it!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It has brighten my skin. I can feel my skin is so soft, smooth and non greasy after use. I am usually afraid to try new products and this product has surprised me. I got to try and give my honest opinion. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I am a one week user and my comments are limited. I like the feel; I only use two drops for my entire face; my skin feels smooth and taut. I need to know the amount/percentage of Vit C and hyaluronic acid and have written to customer service requesting that information. It is important because I use several products and don&#x27;t want to overlap.</li>
    <li> I feel this working on my skin the minute I put it on.  In the few days (7), that I have been using it, I am already seeing a little more firmness.  I am going to purchase a second bottle, because 30 days isn&#x27;t a test for a truly good anti-aging face serum.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use 2xs a day after washing my face. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I DON;T THINK THIS PRODUCT IS ANY BETTER THAN ONE I COULD BUY FOR LESS OTC.</li>
    <li> Really like this product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it looked like it had good reviews.  I just didn&#x27;t read the reviews until AFTER I ordered.  I saw a lot of these were good, from people who got a free trial, and I thought uh oh, well too late now.  I have only been using it one week so I will have to see how it does on wrinkle repair but WOW!  Just one week and my face is sooo smooth and tight.  Love the feel of it!! It&#x27;s not greasy or pore clogging and I use it with a collagen filler daily moisturizer.If it feels this good after a week, I can&#x27;t wait for a month.</li>
    <li> I have used another product for decades but it has started burning my face n neck so I bought this.  I really like the way it makes my skin feel.  Its very soothing, not greasy but helps my skin feel hydrated.  Make sure your face is clean n damp before putting on.  I&#x27;ve used this a couple of months n my lines are smoothing out.  I&#x27;m not expecting it to erase decades but to slow the development of new wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The smell bothers me.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling non greasy, nonsticky, soft and smooth!! Love the smell. It&#x27;s never too early to try and stop the anti aging process. I received this product in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> love this serum! goes on nice and smooth and smells great! i like how it absorbs quickly and my skin is not left oily. it has been a few days now and my fine lines look smoother and overall look younger and smoother! also some of my sun spots have started to fade. so glad i had the opportunity to test for free for review.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. it is amazing</li>
    <li> I have wanted to use hyaluronic acid for a long time, and I take vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;internally so I was glad to try this product. I have only used it for a month so&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will make my skin look younger yet. I use it morning and&lt;br /&gt;when I remember night too.</li>
    <li> Very light and not oily ..so far im liking this product</li>
</ol>
