      <li>I think this is a good choose.</li>
      <li>This product has some really good ingredients in there which are supposed to work good</li>
      <li>Still, nothing clears blackheads from my nose and no product works as good as this.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job sucking excess oil out of my skin for days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good mask...take the time to let it dry completely and you&#x27;ll get a nice refreshing, tightening of the skin.  Seems slightly pricey for the amount you get however a little bit goes a very long way, you don&#x27;t need to glop in thickly over your face, just spread thinly and evenly is all you need and it should go far.</li>
    <li> This is the messiest and most runny product I have ever used. It feels gritty and awful on my skin. It splatters everywhere when putting it on and taking it off. I was very disappointed when I purchased this because I read good things about it, but experienced a different story.</li>
    <li> Really does work, it feels great going on (if a little grainy) and weekly use doesn&#x27;t at all dry my skin. Has helped clean up my T-zone, helps the look of pores and the breakout issues I was having have all but stopped.</li>
    <li> Some people have said there face has been left dry after using this. I can contribute to that statement, but only because I Used too much the first time. Also, even when it did slightly dry it out, I just added some crappy face lotion to my face, and in the morning I woke up with a baby&#x27;s ass on my face, so SOFT. I will be using this as my face wash twice a week.. My acne has started going away, along with my blemishes. Maybe it&#x27;s just a product for me that works so great, but give it a try for yourself.. This is only 13 bucks and for me the results have been amazing. Maybe they could be the same for you, give this stuff a try!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why more guys  have not  used this product. I personally have very oily skin and leave it on for 45 minutes before washing it off. From before I apply it to my face to the time I step out of the shower I can visibly see how much this product reduces redness and clears spots on my face. I have loved this product so much that I have bought more of Kyoku&#x27;s products and would highly recommend this brand as a whole to anyone who has tried other products but have been unsatisfied with the results. Kyoku is a product for men and it shows in the performance of every product I have tried so far from smell to texture and performance. Hands down five stars.s</li>
    <li> -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know this product contains artificial ingredients that are likely to cause a major breakout on your face. This product is not all-natural.  It smells like a cheap air freshener and makes me sneeze. One of the ingredients is \\&quot;Fragrance.\\&quot;  Also the facial cleanser is colored bright blue, another chemical artificial ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any expert esthetician will tell you that different people respond to the same chemical ingredients differently.  My facial skin type is NORMAL. Never oily and never dry. I do not have any pimples or bumps or blemishes. And I never did before using this product.  My face was smooth, and I use facial cleanser and a weekly masque only to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Bad Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using [[ASIN:B003040T0Y Kyoku for Men Daily Facial Cleanser, 3.4 Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B002ZSW7OC Kyoku for Men Lava Masque, 5 Ounce]], I have pimples all over my face. I will never use Kyoku products again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Recommendation for You:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal facial skin, you should only put all-natural ingredients on your face. I&#x27;ve had good results with all Kiss My Face skin care products, such as [[ASIN:B001FB5H60 Kiss My Face Organic Clean for a Day Creamy Face Cleanser, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware - Just because it is expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t ruin your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> Works great and helps to keep facial oil down.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way so go easy when applying. Product does have a stronger scent than expected but isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Product did have a burning sensation once applied but was minor and had not affect on my skin. Product itself was amazing! skin feels way software and smoother and def see a reduction in oil. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This product has some strong chemicals in it, too. I woke up with a rash on my face the day after. I had to see a doctor who advised me to throw it away. Don&#x27;t use if you have any skin sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Great masque! I love the scent and the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love how it makes my skin look! It makes my skin matte and takes the shine right out! Sucks up those oils without drying out your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing it off your face couldnt be easier! It also works as an exfoliant when washing it off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it sparingly! you dont have to glob it on your face. Use a finger or 2 and spread it around thinly covering your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Since my initial purchase I have purchased 2 more! 1 as a present for someone and one to keep on hand!!</li>
    <li> Bought a jar and it was great. Bought two more jars and they were a hard ball of clay. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Dries up quickly and works pretty well. Face feels fresh. But you need to rinse thoroughly because simple wash will leave a whitish residue.</li>
    <li> After several weeks of use my face cleared and pimple free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in the past to use as an occasional mask. I don&#x27;t use it all that frequently because I don&#x27;t like to use it when people are around (you look ridiculous). I used up my supply in about a year so I just bought another tub. I really like how it feels when you first put it on, it almost seems as though you can feel the gunk getting pulled out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I&#x27;ll use this after doing a cardio day at the gym to open my pores. When I get home I&#x27;ll wash my face with an oil free cleanser (from Khiels, I can get the name if you&#x27;re interested). I&#x27;ve found that the best results come after leaving the mask on for half an hour, washing my face in the sink (I haven&#x27;t had any issues with clogging like some people report with a clay based mask), and then jumping in the shower to get the rest of the residue off. Generally I&#x27;ll use a Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strip on my nose after words to finish my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product and haven&#x27;t seen a need to try any other masks. After using this one my face feels freshened and cleared from a lot of the gunk i&#x27;m exposed to every day living in a city.</li>
    <li> This is ok. Burns for a few seconds than dries rather quickly. Didn&#x27;t really help me with blackheads but it was worth a shot. And it smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> This product is really great . To start with i have an oily skin. I I dint have any regime except washing my face twice daily ;) . I started noticing dead, dull skin which looked like scaly and enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;so my wife suggested to use some face products. I did some online search as a normal geek and found this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say it as amazing beauce its simple to apply, takes max 15 mins for the entire process and results are seen immedeately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after my first use i noticed my shink was brighter and fresh . i noticed the second day that my forehead skin looked renewed. After the second and third use the difference was evident. my skin looked younger, pores lesser .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another best part is it takes off all the black heads on you nose if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a great product and worthy every penny !!! .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, fast results and free from harsh chemicals. smells great.  My wife started hitting on me again ;) lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my face, from being too oily, to being too dry and everything in between(I have REALLY sensitive skin). I started using kyoku products about a year ago after my face broke out really bad and it has improved so much. The lava masque was about $30 the first time I bought it, the fact it&#x27;s this cheap(I got it for around $13) is a steal. Buy this with the moisturizer, and use the moisturizer after a pat dry. Makes your skin feel pretty smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT, I repeat, do NOT use after shaving. It causes an irritating sensation. Shave on a day you won&#x27;t use the masque and you&#x27;ll save yourself a lot of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the current price, I would buy a few more to stock up, I do use every 2-3 days and it&#x27;s a great product for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this masque off and on for 3-4 years.&lt;br /&gt;For my part, it&#x27;s one of the best men&#x27;s products available.</li>
    <li> Best Masque around, I feel good, clear, and healthy!</li>
    <li> A perfect face cleaner. Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. I will be looking for more of their products in the future.</li>
    <li> Doesnt feel like it&#x27;ll over dry out my skin when I use it. Skin texture feels a lot smoother (after the whole exfoliate, cleanser, mask) session. I use it twice a week for maintenance and it seems to work pretty well to get all the gunk out.</li>
    <li> This is the first face masque I&#x27;ve tried so  I cannot compare with others.  It feels great afterwards though!  Fast shipping and arrival as well.</li>
    <li> Very good product but it does dry up fairly quick.</li>
    <li> After you use this mask your skin does feel pretty good.  Prior to purchasing I did read other&#x27;s reviews.  I do have to admit that it does not stop your skin from being oily during the day as some claim.  I actually have oily skin and despite the quality of this product it does not prevent me from having to wipe/wash my face several times a day.  If it did it would be a miracle product and would be deserving of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> One of the better masks out there it is really good I use it two times a week but it&#x27;s not extremely great I would buy it again but I am more willing to try others first</li>
    <li> To me this is almost more of a scrub them it is a mask. It has the consistency of wet sand yet it dries really nice and I guess it functions as a mask pretty well then again and I&#x27;m not looking for too much out of a product like this. I like it I&#x27;m just not sure if I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Loved the Lava mask! Just wish it was more than 5 oz. for the price!</li>
    <li> I already did a reviwe about how displease I am in receiving a tampered product where half of the lava mask was scooped out before I received it. I&#x27;m adding this review because I can attach a photo, which I wasnt able to do the 1st time. I have yet to try it out as a result and will post a review on that in the future. Will change the star rating if something is done about this unpleasant experience. I Also took a picture to show the damage done as soon as I opened it.</li>
    <li> You can honestly FEEL it working as you put it on. It&#x27;s probably best to use it right after a hot shower, but wow it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Love the tingling bite of this mask.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes to my skin while using it. It felt nice, but nothing changed for me.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product, I used it after showering in the sink. Well, I&#x27;ve changed my routine, I clean up in the shower, towel off, put this stuff on my face. Which I can feel it working, totally, chill for some minutes, then hop back it the shower, rinse this off my face. I know that I&#x27;ll buy this product again, this is the first, and most likely only masque product that I&#x27;ll ever use. Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I have only used the product 2 times now because i think weekly use is the best for my skin type which is a little on the oily side but extremely sensitive to products...i did as directed and I loved it my face was tight clean and felt renewed. I would recommend getting a facial lotion because this def draws out all the oil dirt and even a little moisture so to balance that out as is good regimen anyway use a good lotion! I would highly suggest to friends and family and would buy it gain when im done</li>
    <li> A handy mask that works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have tried several face masks and this is the first I have re-ordered. This does not &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; in your pores and leaves your face feeling smooth and bright. I use 2x a week and get compliments all of the time. Best if used with a nice face-wash and moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> this is a lovely men face masque at the great price&lt;br /&gt;keep it up</li>
    <li> I really love this masque, my favourite one EVER!! Whenever I use it my face gets a lot whiter, brighter, cleaner &amp; it makes it feel and look really nice too!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Truly does help control oil and blemishes.</li>
    <li> This stuff really seems to work to even out my complexion. The effects don&#x27;t really last all that long; I usually look about the same after a couple days. I have noticed fewer breakouts since I&#x27;ve started using it, so maybe it also helps keep skin clear in between uses. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t seen it so much for my face other than lighten up my skin</li>
    <li> Love this mask as a spot treatment. I&#x27;d fry my face trying to use it all over for more than 8 seconds (I have sensitive baby skin), but this made blemishes disappear overnight.</li>
    <li> It will definitely take care of the oil that is on your face but you have to let it stay longer than the 15 minutes that are recommended. I leave it on my face for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried quite a few masks so far, including icelandic glacial mud, Proactiv Sulfur mask, and the glamglow masks. While I think the glamglow masks have the best feeling afterwards, the Kyoku mask has the most immediate effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty large pores but they all disappear for about 1-2 days after use of the Kyoku mask, and it leaves my skin tight and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t seem to draw oils out like the other mud masks (glamglow, glacial mud) so perhaps it simply has a different utility. That being said, combined use of this with glamGlow is amazing and my skin has never been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kyoku mask has great immediate effects so I definitely recommend it if you want your face looking extra good for an event and you only have a few hours or a day to prepare.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product since it contained volcanic mud,its actually worth the price if you leave it on for longer than the 5-10 recommended id say for around 15-20 min you can actually see whats on your face and simply wash off,i would recommend this product with pore strips,right after its use all that was hidden will pop so strips will finish the job.</li>
    <li> this face mask is awesome. I&#x27;m seeing the best results after I razor shave, since your pores are already opened, the mask does more of a job. If you use after shaving, make sure to wash the shaving cream off lol and rinse with warm/hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use this 3 times a week. MWF. Cannot wait to try their other products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen, dont be scared to take of your skin!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My face feels and looks great after using it.</li>
    <li> did not work for me and sadly I got 2</li>
    <li> I just recieved the package. The lotion old control one was looking good but the lava masque was not. It looks old. Some how the liquid leaks out and wet part of the box. I opened and had a look in side, i can see the separation of the liqid and solid.  I was little bit dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I decided to check out this product after seeing a very positive editors review in GQ.  I&#x27;m no newb to the luxury grooming segment, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Kyoku&#x27;s facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once weekly before bed, and it works wonders.  Application can be a bit tricky, but I find that if you put it on right after you wash your face and it&#x27;s still damp, it&#x27;s easy to apply.  I also let it sit on a little longer than the recommended 5-10 minutes.  About a minute after putting this on your face you can literally feel the mud &amp;#34;soaking&amp;#34; up the dirt, oil, and general gunk from your skin.  To wash off, I find it&#x27;s best to jump in the shower, as trying to wash this off any other way I&#x27;m sure would prove to be difficult.  I always apply a moisturizer after washing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw noticeable results after my first use.  My face looked cleaner, more vibrant and felt &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.  For any guy looking to up their grooming game, this is a must add product to your regime, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con of this product though is that after getting about 2/3 through the jar, the product begins to harden from the amount of times it&#x27;s been opened.  To counteract this you can put a splash of water in there.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because is good product that can help the skin a lot. i&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and there is positive changes in the skin.</li>
    <li> A fantastic, slightly exfoliating mud masque that warms as you first put it on and then dries into a fine, greyish white mask. Skin was very smooth after using. Love this product. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes...it burns. Oh yea, make sure you always make sure the lid is screwed on tightly and there are no pieces of masque goo in the ridges of the lid or it will be dryer then granny.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly.  I got it for my boyfriend and he loves the way our makes his face feel. Wonderful smell and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I found that it speeds up the processes of clearing up those lingering post-blemish marks.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lady, but this is the best clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used. You can feel it work and it&#x27;s more effective than my red or green clays.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very astringent. It has stopped small bleeds from cuts after shaving.</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily skin and my skin looks great after using this mask. LIke other people suggest I leave it on for 15 min and can see and feel noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Its a great product . It lifts stubborn black heads right out</li>
    <li> I love this product.. you can feel it burning after putting it on...my skin is smoother after about 2 weeks of using it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have sensitive oily skin and apply this twice per week the day after a shave. The moment I put it on I can feel the fires of Hell rising up from the earth through a dark and clouded mountain and pouring lava into my pores. It digs deep, burns away all the crap beneath the surface, and leaves my face clean and amazingly smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T USE IT RIGHT AFTER SHAVING. Ouch. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I loved, love, and still am in Love with this product! Works as expected and even better! I use it once a week and its lasting awhile but probably will buy another one coming up</li>
    <li> Works well after shaving. Noticeably reduces oil and makes  skin visibly clearer. By far the best mask I have used thus far and the price is very good too. Kyoku overall seems to make excellent products. I have used both their scrub and facial moisturizer and think highly of both of them. I&#x27;d estimate this jar should last several months using it twice a week and I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> In your 40&#x27;s trying to reverse time. It&#x27;s doing it for me. Get the exfoliater, cream and facial mask. Look younger in a week. Won&#x27;t do miracles, but if you look good and want improvement this could be what your looking for.</li>
    <li> Works great to get rid of pimples and blackheads on my forehead and nose. Is a little thick so I usually have to mix it up in my hand with some water.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Feels great, cleans your skin and does not dry it out. I have normal skin, so I was somewhat concerned about some of the reviews. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works OK - don&#x27;t see any significant results.</li>
    <li> I used this after I got out of the shower, and after using the Kyoku exfoliating facial scrub. When I removed this mask I was astounded because I literally had tiny stringy blackheads coming out of all my pores; somehow this product had brought them to the surface. This is coming from someone who already exfoliates and cleanses every day.  I used a pore strip when I saw this but it did not seem to grab anything, maybe because the softer parts of the blackhead were exposed, rather than the harder darker part. I exfoliated again with a different scrub after all of this and it seemed to scrub most of everything off. Overall my skin looks better, but In some respects looks worse in parts because now impurities are closer to the surface without actually coming all the way out of the skin. This will probably improve with continued use, but next time I am going to apply the mask first and then exfoliate. I think I will see better results this way, and I will update.</li>
    <li> Go with the other reviews.  Keep it on longer than directed.  It felt good on the skin.  My whole family is using it.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this Lava Masque. It is highly rated on Amazon and across the internet as a whole. I think that this lava masque definitely works for some people, unfortunately, I am not one of those individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Greek skin (typically a bit oilier than most, especially on my forehead), and wanted to find a mask I could use 1x per week to help unclog pores, decrease oil production, and increase the glow / feel of my skin. After using this product a few times, I noticed that it produced a lot of small skin colored bumps (similar to hives or sometime of allergic reaction). These eventually went away on their own after approximately 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally drawn into this product as it appears to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but after reading some of the active ingredients, I&#x27;m not entirely sure that that&#x27;s in fact the case. This product without a doubt works well for some people based on the countless raving reviews, but like any skin care product, what works for some may not work well for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this product again and recommend that anyone looking to purchase this masque take a look at the active ingredients list to see if there are any chemicals / ingredients present that may cause a harsh reaction with your skin like the one I had.</li>
    <li> Idk if it&#x27;s making a difference. I&#x27;m not using it often.</li>
    <li> It burns at the first 2 minutes, then the burn goes away leaves you with refreshing scent and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Just 4 hours later my skin feels itching and shows redness and small red bumps. I don&#x27;t know why, maybe it&#x27;s because I have eczema and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Kyoku products smell amazing. I used this product for almost 2 monhts, roughly once a week. My face feels refreshing afterwards! My only gripe is price. I toggle between Kyoku Lava Masque and Queen Helene&#x27;s mint julipe mask (which costs less than $5 for) and I find that they are both excellent products. So I will opt for the cheaper of the two when i run out of reviewed product!</li>
    <li> Good experience! This is my second time buying this. Purchased</li>
    <li> It was nice and seemed to help, but it also leaked during shipping and got all over the rest of my order.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, feels fresh after every wash with skin looking great and smooth. recommended this for every men out there</li>
    <li> Tried my wife&#x27;s scrubs in the past (at her request) but this one feels great without smelling like a woman.  Love these mens products from Kyoku.</li>
    <li> What. Is. This. Goo?!  So. Wrong. So. Thick. So. Gooey. So. Non-spreadable. So. Gross.  So. Viscous.  So. Not. Right.  So. Not. Worth. Buying.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Great Seller.Fast Shipping A++++</li>
    <li> I always wondered if a product is as good as the reviews you read, and this one is. It really makes your skin feel like it never felt before and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> You can feel the mask working as soon as you put it on. I&#x27;ve tried several different maskes from several different brands but this hands down works the best. Buy this crap and get to smearing it all over your face asap.</li>
    <li> This stuff was so effective at pulling the oil out of my skin it kind of caught me off guard.  I went into it thinking that maybe after several uses I might notice some effect but this is far from the case.  Shrinks pores, mattes skin immediately.</li>
    <li> I have unique skin because I have very dry areas and also some very oily areas.  I have been using this once a week for a month and it has worked well.  My skin has evened out and no blemishes.  It has a small &amp;#34;lava&amp;#34; smell so you won&#x27;t smell like fruit or perfumer after you use this.  If you put this on 10 minutes before you shower, it will easily come off while in the shower.</li>
    <li> My skin feels like a marshmallow and looks vibrant after using this product.</li>
    <li> good I think this is a good choose. but I think if have same sale is really good.&lt;br /&gt;good good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old guy with large pores on my nose and forehead, both prime areas for breakouts that happen pretty often. I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different products (Anthony for men, Clearasil, Neutrogena, proactive, etc), but this is the first to really do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a week and supplement with &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJTH8G/ref&#x3D;as_li_ss_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000VJTH8G&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;gs025-20\\&quot;&gt;Anthony Logistics for Men Algae Facial Cleanser, 8 oz.&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;#60;img src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t&#x3D;gs025-20&amp;l&#x3D;as2&amp;o&#x3D;1&amp;a&#x3D;B000VJTH8G&amp;#34; width&#x3D;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; height&#x3D;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; border&#x3D;&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; alt&#x3D;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; style&#x3D;&amp;#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&amp;#34; &amp;#62; as a daily face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more than half way done with it, but my skin is now getting compliments. My pores are smaller, I rarely see a pimple, and those stubborn black heads have disappeared. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful mask for men. From the first time I put it on, I could feel it at work. After rinsing it off my face, my wife could tell my skin was healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a facial mask for men, then I think this is it. I know I won&#x27;t look for another product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling like its pulled tight over your face.</li>
    <li> Really men, I&#x27;m 50ish and those of you who are in the same age bracket will understand when I say, it just takes longer to present yourself.  So whatever your rhythm of life happens to be, at the end of the day, we want to look put together. This product is so easy and I use 2x week.  I usually apply it before I shower.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do and this method, for me of course, does not really take any more time from my day...&lt;br /&gt;10 min before my shower I&#x27;ll wash my face to have a dirt-free face.&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply Kyoku for Men Lava Masque.  Follow directions on product.  (You will know it is working because things get tighter and you may feel the sting of the extracting properties of the lava mask - all good.  Just relax, the sting goes away in less than a minute.)&lt;br /&gt;THEN, when the mask has dried, your good to get into the shower.  The warm water from your shower rinses the product off your face – leaving it squeaky clean and invigorated.  You can now get on with your day!&lt;br /&gt;I encourage all men who are poking around looking for that one product, this could be the one.  Don’t take my review as an absolute, please check it out yourself.  I think you will agree that we have all spent $19 on dumber things in the name of vanity.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> i was looking for a male specific mud mask and stumbled onto this. for only $14 why not. its a thick white mud that does not require mixing with anything. just give it a good shake before opening the container . spreads like plaster. you get an initial burn that goes down to a bit more then a tinkle and then it feels like your face goes slightly numb.  you definitely feel it working. i never had much acne but i get little break outs here and there. nothing really noticeable . since using this its kept that to a minimal. after washing it your skin feels tight and clean. it does what it claims so i like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spend lots and lots of money trial and erroring face masks I&#x27;ve gotten from boutique stores, Sephora, and even Asian beauty websites...suffice to say that this product makes my face feels better than pretty much anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might sting a little especially if your pores are open (like after a run), but after washing off my complexion looks and feels so much better. I can&#x27;t say for sure how beneficial this product is in the long run, but the instant gratification (and smell!) is great. Like the review headline says, I&#x27;ve been stealing this from my boyfriend and am going to buy my own after my current mask runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and will continue to use it.  Regular use will change your skins complexion for the better.  Don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re washing your face with proactive.  Wash your face with soap or a light skin cleanser .  It  could irritate your face otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is regarding the physical estate of the product, not the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited, but as I unscrewed the lid, the protective film of the container was opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the impression that someone took the container out its black box, unscrewed the lid, pulled the film off, put the lid back on, put the container back in the black box, and then they packaged it and sent it out for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give a five stars on the shipping because it got to my house super fast, but I give none on the handling, because they did more then handling, they opened the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t appreciate when people do that in the store and I don&#x27;t appreciate it now.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best masque out there in the market. My face is alot clearer and smoother after using this great product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Face feels amazing after this stuff</li>
    <li> I highly suggest this product to any guys out there looking to improve their skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but i can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic.  I have an oil pit for a face. I&#x27;m in my 40s and have the face of a teenager!  I haven&#x27;t stopped puberty yet, and now that I am on testosterone therapy the faucet is really on.  This is a great product.  Leaves my face very tight and smooth.  Oil free. No odor at all and easy to use. Follow this up with other Kyoku products as needed.  I use the eye duke and pore reducer.  Takes years off immediately.  Bravo !!</li>
    <li> Gave my husband an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> Wow that&#x27;s what I can use to describe this product. Great for oily skin. Saw the effect the same day he used it and hes still using it. the only thing is that when u stop (for a week) you get oily face back .</li>
    <li> So far so good.  You can clearly see a difference after just one use.  I will definitely use this twice a week with the Koyoku exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Incredible product! Definitely made the purchase worthwhile with excellent service and delivery.</li>
    <li> Use weekly, definitely feel a difference after each use.</li>
    <li> Use it on a dry face after washing your face with a cleanser at night. Recommend applying it for 15 to 30 minutes instead of instructed 5 to 10 minutes. Does not dry or aggravate inflammations on your face. Slowly but surely reduces pores. I personally use it every other day and don&#x27;t see any problem with it.</li>
    <li> As someone that has suffered from serious skin problems throughout my early years, I can honestly say this is the best facial mask I have ever used. Prone to acne, my skin can be finnicky when it comes to applying creams and masks, however, the Kyoku Lava Masque is without a doubt the most gentle yet cleansing and toning product I have encountered. Ordered on a whim, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it&#x27;s refreshing scent, toning quality, and remarkable cleansing ability. My skin feels refreshed and brand new after using it! I will be a loyal Kyoku customer in the future, and am currently debating on trying their under eye cream for men as well. :D</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had too many masques in the past to compare this with, but I love it anyway. My face looks and feels much cleaner, less oily, and younger after each use. Plus it&#x27;s made from lava, which is clearly awesome. Will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who&#x27;s on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> Liked it what it offers with the price.</li>
    <li> From the scent and texture to the firm pull as it dries this stuff is great.  After just a couple of uses my skins oil seems much more controlled and my skin just feels better.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Works! My hubby is picky and has bad acne problems and oily skin. Nothing seems to work on him. He used this once. Left it on for an hour. No more oily face for up to 42 hours. And his black heads seemed to be less visible. Nice product. May get him the every day wash one.</li>
    <li> as a guy.... putting this stuff on..... my roommate points at me ... laughs... and tries to post videos of me to his various social media outlets...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but now... I have the better looking skin and as a result... more chicks.. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it REALLY relaxes you and takes tension away from your face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks KYOKU you guys are awesome!</li>
    <li> This mask is great! I use it before bed once or twice a week for a &amp;#34;Treat Myself&amp;#34; night. Takes away the oil and residue from the day and leaves me feeling refreshed. Make sure to moisturize after as it takes most of the oil away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I put it on, I grabbed a glob and left my face caked with mud. Take a tiny amount and apply to damp face. See how much spreads and go back for more. First timer mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One weird thing. Over the months, the can has a weird sticky goo on the bottom almost like a thicker clear honey sort of feeling. I can&#x27;t figure out what it is for the life of me. It only turned up after I bought this. Not sure what it is, so minus one star.</li>
    <li> Im a huge fan of Kyoku products.  I have given 5 stars to every one of their products.  But for some reason once you open this and it gets exposed to air, it doesn&#x27;t work the greatest the first time.  So although I am a big fan of all their other products this is one I would say to skip.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that seems to really improve the health and appearance of skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m holding off for now as my product seems to me more clay like than other reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a week for 2 weeks and just barely noticed a small collection of liquid that needs to me mixed into the product before applying. I will update my review within the next month or so as that is when the intended effects should become apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve mixed the product well before every application (with the bottom of my beard comb), applied generously to a clean face, and left on for 15-20 minutes before showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My skin feels smoother and tighter after each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Follow all of these tips (all found within the reviews below) especially the one about avoiding use after physical activity!!! Your pores will be wide open and the tingling will turn into a deep burn! I read this, got curious like a foolish baboon and soon felt the fires of hell unleashed upon my face.</li>
    <li> really good stuff. Very cooling effect on your skin and smells good. I&#x27;ve used others and i like this one more because it&#x27;s got exfoliating beads in it, and it is good for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I got the idea to use this from GQ magazine and I have to say I agree with everyone else.  It is an amazing face mask.  I&#x27;ve noticed a large overall improvement in my face.  The mask, for me, wasn&#x27;t very hard to put on and tingled slightly.  I would say leave the mask on for about 15min because it fully hardens when you leave it on a little longer.  Washing it off can be a complete pain in the ass though.</li>
    <li> Rather than seeing immediate improvement in my skin the first time I used it, this mask made it better over a period of time. The effects are subtle but gradual -- I notice that my skin is smoother skin and that I have an overall better complexion. It&#x27;s not a cure for acne or anything, but it helps. Using the mask also feels good too, in a mental-health/therapeutic kind of way.</li>
    <li> Once you try it, you will love it. Your skin feels great. Just have to get over feeling like a woman with a mask on.</li>
    <li> not worth the money at all, over priced item , and over hyped, really really bad investment and im very into my skin espically my face, didn&#x27;t smell good, and was 5 -6 more times expensive than better products</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it would be, but a good product if you have time to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my fifties with super oily skin, large pores, bumps, acne, and lots o&#x27; blackheads...otherwise know as seborrhea. I&#x27;ve used a lot of facial masks over the years to keep pores clean and small. None of the masks I&#x27;ve tried worked as well as this one for me. This one actually gets the crud out of the pores and shrinks the pore size. And, while expensive, you need very little of this product to cover your face. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is more like an acid on your face than a clay masque. If you like burning, get this, though I really doubt it&#x27;s that good for your skin.  If you DO like burning, why not just get a chemical peel instead?</li>
    <li> It felt good at first, but after a couple months in the cabinet it completely harden and when I wet it with water to try and use it again it just crumbled.</li>
    <li> Awesome price, great product</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  He is a chef and with the heat and cooking oils in the kitchen, his face gets pretty beaten up.  The very first time he used the lava masque, his skin was visibly smoother.  Well worth the money.  Like my aunt says &amp;#34;you pay, you get&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time this past Friday. All black heads and dead skin came out after my first use. Obviously once I start using this more it will make such a big impact. I will definitely recommend this ! I left it on for about 15-20 minutes. Its hard to take off so i took a shower. Put a moisturizer face lotion afterwards because it will leave your skin a little dry.</li>
    <li> Feels good, smells good, works good.</li>
    <li> Great - we both use this - smooth and works well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite impressed with thus masque.  I use a small amount and it seems to apply fairly evenly.  After about 10 mins, I rinse my face. There&#x27;s a noticeable difference in the overall condition of my skin.  Can&#x27;t describe the scent, but it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
    <li> me and my brother both use this product and absolutely love it, after using it your face feels refreshed, tight and very clean.  I recommend to everyone looking for a good mask.</li>
    <li> I had never tried this brand before but I am addicted to this masque.  Probably the best product I have come across in a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this in summer of 2013 and still use it! Put it on about once a week and it smooths everything out on your face. Thick product</li>
    <li> I love this masque. I&#x27;ve never used one before this, but I now have no reason to look. I love the way it makes my face feel and it washes off very easily.</li>
    <li> Very effective stuff.</li>
    <li> First off, why is my name under allan? -.- damn amazon. Anyways, great product. My skin is less oily and feels refreshed. Only wish I got the moisturizer to follow it up. The scent isn&#x27;t so strong. Washing it off was fairly easy, except a little got in my eyes, and I thought I had a vision of Pompeii. Bottom line, buy it if you don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin (some reviews have reported irritation). Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> Face felt cleaner and refreshed, good product</li>
    <li> was a little uncomfortable at first to use a masque but i like it. doesn&#x27;t smell or fell extremely feminine. doesnt take to long to get hard (twss)and comes off easily in shower. however, for the actual cleansing i dont have anything to compare it to so....</li>
    <li> My complexion seems to have improved since I started using this.  I use it about 2-3 times per week, for 25 minutes or so each time.  It washes off easily and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  I have sensitive skin, but this product hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation.</li>
    <li> The product is very expensive, and it works ok. You have to be very careful,that you close the container tightly or it will dry up.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this is an excellent masque that exfoliates. Instructions say to use for 10 minutes, I use for 15-20 minutes. Quality product.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this doing anything from my skin, but boy does if feel good when it&#x27;s on there so it must be doing something.  Easy to wash off, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> First time trying this product and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have always looked for something like this because my face is really oily.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased threw amazon because the kyoku website was sold out same price so got it, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Reduces pore size, visibly improves skin&#x27;s look and feel.  Works great, smells even better.  Wish I had known about this product a long time ago. Have sensitive skin, so it does burn a little when first applied but no adverse affects other than the initial tingling.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This has got to be one of the most effective facial products I have ever bought. I apply it on the shower and let it sit for around 15 or 20 minutes before thoroughly washing it off. You can instantly see a difference when you remove the mask and the clean feeling it gives lasts for days. I use it once or twice a week depending on what my face is exposed to throughout the week.</li>
    <li> Its really cleans your face.</li>
    <li> For how much this product costs it is not worth it! The product does produce a tingly feeling once put on so it feels as if it is working, but applying it is frustrating!! The fact that none of the other reviewers left a comment about how hard it is to apply this mask leaves me to wonder if they actually used the product or if I just got a bad batch. As you are applying the mask the cream instantly turns into a puddy like substance so after two seconds if you touch the spot you just applied to your face it rubs the cream right off. It is nearly impossible to spread the mask evenly on your face because of this problem. The mask did leave my face feeling smooth afterwards but for the price I can get the same benefits from store bought facial products...</li>
    <li> On time and great product......</li>
    <li> This masque is awesome! It also lasts a very long time, one 5 ounce case should last 6-12 months depending on the amount used. You only need about 2 dime-size dots per use to cover the whole face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels incredibly revived after using this product for 10-15 minutes and rinsing in cool water. I recommend using the Kyoku daily facial scrub before and the Kyoku facial moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the Kyoku masque a little too much.  I did it a couple of times a week.  That&#x27;s how great this feels.  It really rejuvenates your skin and clears your pores.  It does not dry out your skin, rather it leaves it feeling moisturized.  It has just enough grit to exfoliate your skin when washed off and gives it a bit of a manly feel.  I&#x27;d say leave it on longer than recommended for the full effect - maybe 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 3 times so far, about once a week. I have moderately oily skin and this Lava Masque works well with my skin type. My skin feels smooth and oil free after I use it. Like everyone else I recommend you keep it on at least 15 minutes. No complaints other than the price..haha.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have had many bad nights after using masks that did not do what they were supposed to, but this was not one of them. After rinsing the mask off you can visibly see a clearer face. This is by far the best mask that I have ever used and I would recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Kyoku Men&#x27;s Lava Masque is a product that actually does what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product which rates always having a back-up jar on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this masque a few time and I do like it. It leaves my skin feeling pretty soft and refreshed. For some reason, though, it&#x27;s reeeeeaaaaally hard to get it off my face. No matter how much water I used and how I wipe and scrub, there always seem to be bits of white film that are eeeexxxtttraaa hard to get off. Am I leaving it on too long? Not long enough? Hmmm....I don&#x27;t know. I may update my rating after a few more uses....</li>
    <li> great stuff but don&#x27;t use it if you have sensitive skin. Also this product isn&#x27;t for wimps. It stings like a b**** on your face. I shouldn&#x27;t be complaining this stuff works great go get it.</li>
    <li> Works great on adult blackheads especially around the nose.  I use it daily and it is keeping my pores clean!  Only thing that could make it better is to get rid of the fragrance.  I rather have fewer non essential artificial ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin look awesome!</li>
    <li> great working Masque, can feel it working a bit as you let it set in and dry then wash out during my shower. Feel clean all day.</li>
    <li> Pulls the dirt out of my pores.</li>
    <li> recommended by my friends</li>
    <li> Been using it for 2 weeks and im impressed with skin its smoother and lightend, I recommend this product if you want a clear look.</li>
    <li> Nothing screams LIKE A MAN more than a nice lava mask.  I felt particularly tough when my 15lb dog ran away from me when I emerged from my bathroom wearing this as a face mask.  Heads up to anyone buying this, it works really well, but it isn&#x27;t a face wash (as I thought it was) it is more like the green goopy masks you seen women wearing in movies.  I still recommend it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty well, but its pretty expensive and was only half way filled!</li>
    <li> Best thing I have found. I had very dry flakey skin. This has made me have a refreshing feeling and no longer dry and flakey.</li>
    <li> Product arrived opened, dried, flaky...</li>
    <li> Wow, worked very well.  Skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Made an impulse buy after seeing this in GQ magazine and its one of the best skin care products I&#x27;ve ever used. Face feels soft and smooth for days after using. It sucks up all excess oil.</li>
    <li> Bad ingredients, bad for the face. Made my skin worse.</li>
    <li> feels like heavenly poop on my face that smells good. my face is really soft after using it. i would only apply a few times a week at the most though cuz it will make your face really dry out if you use it daily.</li>
    <li> Now that I have gotten older I have started to pay attention to how I&#x27;m aging. I decided that I would spend this year trying to look a bit younger and see how it works out. Since I am starting from zero I do expect some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after a review in GQ. Having never used a face mask before it was amusing to my wife and kids but it was cool. I did notice my pores looking smaller. And smaller pores make you look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare it to other masks because I have never wore one but it was easy to survive. I do recommend you keep it on longer than the 5 minutes they say. I keep mine on longer and like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the results I saw the first time didn&#x27;t come back. Maybe it was because the change was so dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you informed.</li>
    <li> This masks is almost like a clay mask. It has made an improvement in diminishing my acne. Anyone who is looking for a mask that doesn&#x27;t dry skin should purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MASK- all I need to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little grainy in texture, but this is a mild abrasive to rid your skin of dead cells and such, leaving the mask to do it&#x27;s work underneath. So I get the feeling that it buffs the skin and then goes to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on a good 20-30 minutes, shower and rinse it off. Sometimes I leave it at that, but most times I will follow up with a moisturizer or balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face glows afterward &amp; especially the next morning!</li>
    <li> I swear this product is like magic!!! I will be ordering more and telling everyone i know about it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product does a great job; I use it every few weeks in between using the Kyoku facial scrub. Do make sure your skin is really damp otherwise the product will not spread smoothly.</li>
    <li> You can feel it working as soon as you put it on. After weeks if use you really notice the difference.</li>
    <li> This was as good as I thought it would be.  Recommended by Mens Health but it makes your skin feel so clean. I use it 2-3 times per week. I really really like it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, and I don&#x27;t even have a particularly oily (on the surface) face. However I do have a bit of excess oil in the pores themselves. This product essentially draws that oil out of your face which you should then wipe off. It&#x27;s not acne, or liquid oil, it&#x27;s just the stuff that everyone has in their pores. When you have too much it builds up and can turn into a black head/acne if it gets infected. It&#x27;s a pretty obvious improvement in my case and my pores definitely look smaller (the actual pore doesn&#x27;t change, but it is no longer \\&quot;stretched\\&quot; to maximum capacity with oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly a good portion why I enjoy this product is that it makes my face feel amazing afterward. Extraordinarily smooth and \\&quot;cool\\&quot;. It is a bit expensive for what essentially amounts to some volcanic ash and salt, but hey, if it works well it works well (and it lasts a while too).</li>
    <li> It does work.  I learned towards the end using this jar up that if you get your face wet with hot water and your hands a little bit (don&#x27;t dry them before reaching for this), then you&#x27;ll spread out the mask a lot more easily across your face and the jar will end up lasting a lot longer.  Unfortunately as I said, I didn&#x27;t do this til I barely had any left and I wasted a lot of the masque because of it. Lesson:  don&#x27;t dry your hands before you put this on.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, this was an impulse buy after seeing it in GQ. Yet, I can&#x27;t speak to this product enough. It&#x27;s awesome. You use it, and you will feel a noticeable difference in your skin. It&#x27;s different than any Nuetrogena or other chemical product to clean skin, your skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or irritated afterwards. Having struggled with forehead blemishes for so long and trying what seemed like endless \\&quot;solutions\\&quot; this is by far one of the only things I&#x27;ve found to work.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my face refreshed and brightened.  I would recommend to anybody.  I&#x27;ve had over a month and love the results.</li>
    <li> First time using this product. I like it though, after 2 weeks of using twice weekly, my skin feels firmer and cleaner. I would recommend to anyone wanted to try this type of product out.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very smooth and fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> I use it once to twice a week. Nice little tingle and my face feels smooth and refreshed. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I use several KYOKU products and this is my favorite. The mask is perfect for cleaning out pores and tightening wrinkles. I can actually see a noticeable difference after each use.    The mask itself needs to be stirred before using because it tends to separate from the water but if you mix it properly, it goes on smoothly. Once the mask is applied, it will dry in about 10 minutes. At that point, it crumbles off and you can rinse your face. Minoring tingling occurs during use but it feels refreshing. It leaves the face a little dry so I follow this mask with the KYOKU daily facial moisturizer.      INGREDIENTS:  Water, Kaolin, Sorbitol, Titanium Dioxide, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Calcium Carbonate, Pumice, Tropiaca Starch, Hydroxypropylmethyl Cellulose, Sea Salt, hydrolyzed Algin &amp; Zinc Sulfate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Gylcol Ethlhexylglycerin, Hexylene Gylcol, Fragrance, DMDM Hydantoin, Iron Oxide Black, Mica, Methyclchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.      I would HIGHLY recommend at least trying this product if you are looking at different face masks. This is one of the best and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it anywhere else!</li>
    <li> Your skin will thank you for buying and using this product. I use magic pads before applying this product, to make sure my skin is clean. You may feel a slight burning/tingling sensation after applying this product but this will subside after a few moments as it begins to dry. I leave this product on my face and neck for about 30 minutes, if it&#x27;s dry and start to flake, it&#x27;s time to wash it off. I recommend getting a facial brush to apply this product, it ensures even coverage and prevents you from using too much, not to mention it&#x27;s easier and cleaner than using your bare hands.</li>
    <li> I like this product so far. It feels good with a slight tingling sensation which makes you believe that this product is working and I hope it does. I use a retinol serum after using this product and my face feels fresh and smooth in the morning. This product has some really good ingredients in there which are supposed to work good so let&#x27;s see how good this is.</li>
    <li> Once a week set aside 10 minutes to give your skin some much needed TLC this is my favorite masque so far and much more affective than my home made attempts with coffee grinds and egg whites. The masque removes dead skin, promotes cellular regeneration, unclogs even fine pores while reducing and evening out oily to dry areas which unless you where touched by god yes you have both on one face most of the time. Looking good is not only a smart thing professionally and health wise it shows in your confidence and self worth you carry yourself in a better way if you know you have put a bit of effort in and since now days we are all held to a higher standard of beauty than our dads and grand dads don&#x27;t try to ask them for advice on it. The days of bars of soap being enough for men are gone along with prejudicial marriage and race riots so do your girl/ guy a favor and try half as hard as she/ he does or less</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about paying this much for a male face mask product, but the other reviews convinced me it was worth trying.  I have had moderate to severe acne for ten years now (it is much better now than when I was a teenager).  Using this product twice a week for 10-15 minutes at a time has removed so much oil from my face and made my skin feel much smoother than I can even remember.  All of the little bumps that used to form seem to have disappeared, and the large ones are disappearing as well.  This product has helped clear up my face, prevented new breakouts, and it makes my face feel so cleansed.  It is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great for reducing pore sizes!</li>
    <li> The sensation is very odd - warms up, slightly tingly, but after using as directed, I definitely had cleaner, smoother skin. Not sure about leaving it longer than as directed though, as other reviewers mentioned - may have side effects?</li>
    <li> Washing this off feels like it makes your face cleaner, but I am not sure it is any better than other face washing products out there. Once the mud dries, it is also quite difficult to remove. Overall, it is a decent product, but in my opinion, not quite worth the price.</li>
    <li> Prior to trying this I had never used a face mask.  I chose this brand after surfing around and realizing that I didn&#x27;t know what I was looking at/for. I used this product once or twice a week and noticed improvement after a couple of uses.  Be sure you apply to your skin while still damp to avoid problems spreading it around. I usually left in on for about 30 minutes and then washed of with warm water while gently scrubbing in circles. Follow up with a moisturizer and your face will feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better looking skin, smaller pores, great fresh feeling afterwards. Would both purchase again and recommend. Decinitely worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> What can I say? My face can be quite oily &amp; this takes care of that! I love it.</li>
    <li> YOu can feel it ,just use one time. so good,&lt;br /&gt;maybe a little painful ,but do not worry, it is ok.</li>
    <li> Fantastic masque - it has a cooling effect that is amazing. I wish it dried a little differently - it can get really flaky if you leave it on for &amp;#62;10 minutes, which I do (and recommend). At the price, this is a great product (and I&#x27;m a dermatologist!).</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing !! Buy it now it will not disappoint me skin will look flawless</li>
    <li> Only need to use twice a week, easy to use, and it does what it says. Depending on your skin type add or subtract time from how long you leave it on your face.</li>
    <li> Love this masque because of how good your skin feels after using it. I recommend leaving it on for about 20 to 30 minutes, and only using a fingertip amount. I use it weekly and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin feeling amazing.. Love the tingly feeling on my face... Great immediate results after I use it... However it is weird to apply.. Like you&#x27;re really applying volcanic mud to your face...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd batch, this along with the daily face wash and scrub have left my face looking and feeling amazing!</li>
    <li> Tighten ups the face a good amount at night. When you shake it up it gets into the crevices of the lid and tub, irritating but I just whipped off and put back in tub. A little goes a long way. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a great masque. It goes on smoothly, spreads evenly. It really does heat up my skin, but never irritatingly so. It was hard to tell the effect at first, but then I started noticing dead skin &amp;#34;sloughing&amp;#34; off my face. My skin was evenly toned - especially after repeated use (weekly). The only downside is that it will really dry my skin - nothing a moisturizer can&#x27;t take care of though.</li>
    <li> Bought the entire Kyoku line but this is definitely my favorite product. It does everything the product States and makes your skin glow. I do recommend mixing the contents with a stick (like a waxing stick, to avoid contamination from your hands) because the liquid dose separate from the clay. If you apply the mask while it is separated it is hard to put on and it seems to dry out before it has had time to work properly.</li>
    <li> I just really don&#x27;t like it that much.  Why, maybe because I seem to break out a little after using it.  I do like the smell and the thought of using it, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Average product for an average price. Not a miracle product by any means.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice per week for a few weeks now and I can tell that my overall complexion is so much clearer than it has been.  I haven&#x27;t been getting nearly as many breakouts.  Skin looks fresh and clear.</li>
    <li> I gave it five stars because overall it feels great to use it and my face feels smoother/better. Unfortunately when it arrived the lid was cracked and it seemed like it was slightly opened, but luckily Amazon took care of this issue and gave great customer service.</li>
    <li> I have been using clay masks for a while since Im kind of old.  I switched from Zinh to Anthony, and I thought Anthony was the best.  I was wrong!  Kyoku is the best.  Anthony masks are orange and stain everything.  Kyoku is white and washes off easily.  The lava really improves the mask as well.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on the face and provides a tingling sensation that tells you something is happening.  The jury is still out as to any real effects of skin rejuevination.</li>
    <li> Kyoku Rocks!  Love how smooth my face is after a good lava mask by Kyoku!</li>
    <li> I am surprised there is not more reviews for this product. This is the best mask I have ever used before. It really makes a difference in how my face looks and feels. My pores are visibly smaller and over all my skin looks fantastic. It also smells amazing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that pulls all of the blackheads out of my nose.  I am visibly cleaner after using it (once a week).  I shower every day and use Cetaphil and Nivea for Men Face Cleaner every day as well.  Still, nothing clears blackheads from my nose and no product works as good as this.  Throw it on your face for 15 min and you can truly feel it at work.  Probably 20+ applications per bottle in here making a good value as well</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it actually works but it smells good</li>
    <li> This masque is excellent and your skin will be noticeably better after just the first use. Like others have mentioned it seems to help to leave it on a bit longer than kyoku recommends. I usually go about fifteen minutes but have gone as high as 30. It helps to clean off if you&#x27;re in the shower as it is a bit more difficult to remove, and tends to leave a little residue on the face so it&#x27;s not a bad idea to follow with a toner. This does reduce pore size as well as soften the skin and even out skin tone. I love this product, even my mom uses it and likes it...even though it&#x27;s &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! This product is amazing, it reduces dark marks and acne appearance. The only down side is I can only use the product twice a week because it does dry your skin a little. I will definitely buy another!</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was pretty skeptical going in. I&#x27;ve tried many different facial products that haven&#x27;t really &amp;#34;proven themselves,&amp;#34; i.e not lived up to expectations. The majority of products out there, to me, simply don&#x27;t really do all that they&#x27;re advertised to do. That wasn&#x27;t the case with this (I bought two Kyoku products--this, and the pore reducing serum. I would not recommend the pore reducing serum because I do not believed it really worked, i.e no noticeable difference). It&#x27;s not going to change your life by any means, but I definitely noticed my face is clearer the next day after using this product. The product goes on very even, and you don&#x27;t really need a lot to spread over your face (I see it lasting a long time). It burns slightly when putting it on, but not a bad burn. It&#x27;s reminiscent of the old adage &amp;#34;if it burns, it&#x27;s working.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the most important things that I look for in a review is if the customer liked the product, and if they&#x27;d be willing to buy it again. I most definitely liked the product, and I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Cleans face, leaves a smooth clear face afterwards. Good product.</li>
    <li> I use this 1 or 2 times a week and this stuff really works great! I had awful acne as a teen and have minimal scaring and this stuff helps reduce appearance while eliminating blackheads and redness!&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, after purchasing I found this stuff to be on alot of mens best face masks lists (GQ,OUT) so there has to be something to it!</li>
    <li> As a male, using this kind of stuff is kind of a weird thing. Though once you get past the feeling of &amp;#34;why am I doing this, I&#x27;m not a chick.&amp;#34; you really have to admire how awesome this stuff is. I suffer from off and on acne, even in my mid-20&#x27;s I get pimples. Using this once or twice a week helps solve that problem really well, as well as make your skin feel really nice in general. It&#x27;s easy to put on, and mostly easy to rinse off.</li>
    <li> A bit dry going on, but if your face is wet, it works well.</li>
    <li> African American here, so it here is my review for people like me. It felt good applying for the first time. The burning sensation psychologically (at least) means that its working. 2nd application (after 1 week) does not burn as much but face you can see the skin look cleaner and smoother. The jury is still out on this product but so far so good. PS: Make sure to get rid of the gunk around the ridges for the screw cap otherwise it will be difficult to open for next use.</li>
    <li> So far so good, applies and rinses well, no complaints</li>
    <li> high quality product like one you would find in a salon.  Just like I was going to get a professional facial</li>
    <li> First mask I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make me break out. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> smells really good and works well. Definitely a good buy. I will purchase again once I run out. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!. Starts to tighten/harden in a few minutes. Rinses easily. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and use this mask once a week although I could probably use it more often. Has a nice smell and a little bit goes a long ways. This jar will last forever using once or twice a week. Very easy to wash off unlike some masks I have used. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Best feeling I had on my face since popcorn butter!</li>
    <li> Be careful if you have sensitive because this stuff really made my face burn and I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than a minute. Maybe it was fragrances that made my face burn, oh well wish I could have used it more.</li>
    <li> I bought this based upon a recommendation in an article. It seems to do a pretty good job - I&#x27;ve used it once a week for the last few weeks and have noticed that my skin is less oily. i will probably buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best masques I&#x27;ve ever used.  I like how my face looks and feels after using this.</li>
    <li> First off, just swallow the fact that this mask is expensive. Almost $30 dollars for a face mask that your not even sure that works!? I have oily skin and I&#x27;ve used several differing products in order to control the breakouts, the whiteheads, blackheads, and just all around shiny look. When I received this Kyoku for Men I washed my face before hand and applied a good layer all over my face and neck area. Like other reviewers said previously, you don&#x27;t need much but just be careful when opening the jar as I don&#x27;t believe they have a protective film covering the &amp;#34;lava&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s prone to spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit for 30 minutes and washed it off. It&#x27;s a bit cakey, so you&#x27;ll spend some time making sure your face is completely rinsed properly. After drying off I noticed that my face did feel a bit refreshed, less shiny, and just soothing to the touch. Afterwards I applied face lotion and was good to go. I said I&#x27;ll apply the mask in a few days again to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t just in my head imagining how well it worked. So after a few days without reapplying as yet for the second time, I had noticed that my face was in fact less shiny and appeared to just be a bit healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing the routine again, I have to admit that this product just works! Combine this with a good face wash and lotion and your mug will thank you much for it and so will the ladies! I will look more into Kyoku products for my facial regimen as I&#x27;m quite impressed.</li>
    <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon, but rather the actual Kyoku website. It&#x27;s abut 4 dollars more, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting a knockoff. After reading some reviews for other Kyoku products on Amazon about knockoffs, I figured it was worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product. It makes your skin feel great and less oily. I always wash my face (not in the shower) with a mild soap, and then immediately afterwards use the masque. MAKE SURE that you shake it well before you use it.</li>
    <li> love this stuff..it&#x27;s pricey, but it only requires a small amount to apply each time</li>
    <li> Probably the only face product from this line that was just okay. It didn&#x27;t break me out like all the other products in the line but it does dry your skin out and clogs pores. Literally, I have to use a face scrub to clear pores after this mask. I washed it off after 10 minutes like it says and it was visible that there was mask stuck in the larger pores as well as the small ones.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pricy but just a finger tip of it will cover my whole face. A little goes a long ways. Does a good job sucking excess oil out of my skin for days. Skin feels clean and soft after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it about once a week and leave it on for about a half hour. When rubbing it on your face it turns from runny to a putty consistency and feels warm on your skin. I have to dab it around my face before rubbing it in to keep it from clumping up. If you do that it goes on fine.</li>
    <li> Love it! This stuff works! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and holy cap it works!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Help clear my acne.</li>
    <li> I like it and I use it often. Makes my skin feel refreshed, clean, and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great face mask i think it works well and makes skin soft</li>
    <li> This stuff i awesome!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Messy but good, it defenetly improves our skin.</li>
    <li> Good exfoliant takes just a very little to cover entire face.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff. I slather it on and lay naked on the floor pretending I was a victim of the Pompeii volcano eruption. What you know about that?</li>
    <li> I use a lot of facial beauty products and I thought this mask smelt pretty nice. After you apply it, it has a nice pasty and crisp feeling when you leave it on for 5-10 mins. It leaves your face smooth and dry once you remove it too. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> First of all the box was gross and sticky and when I opened the product it seemed as if it was already opened, then I used the product and it made my face feel extremely cool kind of like I put toothpaste all over my face. The product didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. My overall experience with this product was horrible, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> very great quality, and easy to use for men.&lt;br /&gt;just need 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quick delivery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a little vacation for your face. Feels nice and smells nice. I use it twice a week and love it. Just make sure your face is damp before you apply it or it clumps up instead of spreading out smoothly. I think I&#x27;ll be ordering this over and over.</li>
    <li> this is the best product I have found for my face. I would recommend and I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> So I received this product in not the best packaging. Upon inspection it was found that the top was broken. For anyone who has used a product like this before you know how important proper storage is so as to not dry it out. I contacted Amazon and they fully refunded my money because they were out of stock. Since then I have ordered from Kyokus site and the masque is wonderful. You can definitely tell a difference from your first use. I was using Mensciensce before this and it s like night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Great masque and wonderful customer service from Amazon as always.</li>
    <li> Ive only tried this twice and it feels kind of weird at first but after waiting for about 15 minutes ( the box says five - ten minutes) but i think the extra five minutes helps a lot. After using the masque, I usually clear my skin with a white head remover to go over some white heads that I didn&#x27;t see before.</li>
    <li> I like how this is not real lava, even though it is called lava. Real lava would be too effective in exfoliating.</li>
