      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous rich red, great for whenever I need that 1930s</li>
      <li>It is easy to remove at night with J&amp;J gel baby oil.</li>
      <li>But it is so easy to re-apply I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>The colour stays but definitely not the sheen needed to enhance my beautiful lips.</li>
      <li>Fell in love with this shade a year ago, now can rarely find it in stock in the store.</li>
      <li>or you can use a light hand</li>
      <li>Not too bright red not too burgundy.</li>
      <li>The color is true to the image shown.</li>
      <li>Deep gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>It stays on all day, and does not dry out, I love it!</li>
      <li>Very pretty color but dries to the skin on your lips then rolls off.</li>
      <li>Trying on this new color (for me) and I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
      <li>the color is lovely, stays on all day and fells soft to the lips.  </li>
      <li>The right color</li>
      <li>would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me</li>
      <li>Anyway thank you very much.</li>
      <li>This is a very rich and gorgeous dark red color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a rather pale girl with bright red hair and it looked absolutely stunning.</li>
      <li>Looks good against my pale skin.</li>
      <li>I use MAC&#x27;s Brick lipliner underneath and then apply a very thin coat of superb Sangria on top of it and the color lasts the entire day.</li>
      <li>I love the color and it does stay on a long time as stated by Revlon.</li>
      <li>Happy enough with it to hunt it down on the internet.</li>
      <li>More pink than burgundy as it appears in the tube.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
      <li>I am a real estate broker and I don&#x27;t like to re-apply my face during the daytime...</li>
      <li>It really stays almost all day.</li>
      <li>Only here in amazon that I find it and it is so cheap.  </li>
      <li>It stays on very well and has shimmer highlights in it as well as a bit of brown .</li>
      <li>Nice deep red color.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect red for anyone who has a medium skin complexion (I am mixed with Black and Asian).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like to keep applying lipstick.</li>
      <li>It does leave a lipstick mark on the glasses and cups that cannot be completely removed by the dishwasher, but pre-wash it with dish detergent and a gentle rub will remove the stain.</li>
      <li>normal wear - about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>It was never my thing, but I wanted to try the red lips trend right now.</li>
      <li>I am new to lipstick.</li>
      <li>I use this sparingly after applying a lip moisturizer and it gives a natural color that lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about it is that it once it dries on your lips it feels like chalk.</li>
      <li>Be sure to keep the color on the outside of your lips and let them dry, or you&#x27;ll get it on your teeth and while it doesn&#x27;t stain your teeth, it&#x27;s a bit harder to get off than your normal lipstick.</li>
      <li>It fades just as quickly as your $2 stuff down at the drugstore.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry out my lips, and after applying early in the morning lasts way into the night.  </li>
      <li>The color will stay if you are careful not to let too much grease touches your lips.</li>
      <li>Thanks to amazon&#x27;s prime add-on program, I got this lipstick for less than a dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On top of a base foundation, this lipstick holds true to the name.  </li>

<li> On top of a base foundation, this lipstick holds true to the name.  </li>
<li> It last a long time.</li>
<li> this is not a vibrant red but a muted deep red/bronze color.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have been looking for this item for a very long time now.</li>
<li> Also leaves lips feeling dry and cracked.</li>
<li> /&gt;It does leave your lips feeling dry, you will need a gloss over it</li>
<li> I have a lot of blue tones to my skin, so I often have trouble finding a shade of red lipstick that doesn&#x27;t end up looking raspberry on me.</li>
<li> I use this almost every day the colour is rich and it stays on for at least 3-4 hours (not all day) at least not on me.</li>
<li> Overusing it can dry out the lips a bit, but not as much as other &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> Sometimes I wear lip balm and then apply, and other times I don&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> Btw I ordered 2 again with my other account.</li>
<li> Wears a decent amount of time during the day, usually reapply it at least once.</li>
<li> Only reapplied once in the late afternoon.</li>
<li> I put a thin coat on in the mornings around 7 a.m., put some gloss over it (Moxie by Bare Essentials!)</li>
<li> the color is not available anymore.</li>
<li> I usually mix a bronze gloss with it.</li>
<li> Not worth what is paid unfortunately.</li>
<li> Stays in place throughout eating and even a little sweating (i was dancing like crazy).</li>
<li> I like experimenting with it as a base and trying different glosses for the finish.</li>
<li> but I am very disappointed that the gloss (shine) doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive stuff and nothin matches up.  </li>
<li> Sorry!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this lipstick. It stay on ALL day and does not smear. It is easy to remove at night with J&amp;J gel baby oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup freak, especially lipstick.  Revlon ColorStay is the best stuff I can find if you like all-day wear that doesn&#x27;t chap your lips. I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive stuff and nothin matches up.  I put a thin coat on in the mornings around 7 a.m., put some gloss over it (Moxie by Bare Essentials!) and at 3:00 it&#x27;s still there!  Even after coffee and lunch.  I have about 8 tubes of this stuff in all kinds of shades. I like experimenting with it as a base and trying different glosses for the finish. Thank you Revlon!</li>
    <li> Nice deep red color. Lasts throughout the day. Can be drying throughout the day, but some lip balm solved the trick. Shipped promptly and with care.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lipstick for years and can&#x27;t explains how much I love this product! It save my time from day to day and only need to be apply only 1 time per day and u all set to go. What a great deal I found on here as well.</li>
    <li> I receive compliments from women and salacious looks from men anytime I wear this color. I use MAC&#x27;s Brick lipliner underneath and then apply a very thin coat of superb Sangria on top of it and the color lasts the entire day. This is the perfect red for anyone who has a medium skin complexion (I am mixed with Black and Asian).</li>
    <li> The right color and if one adds a glossy finish, it looks stunning.  Lasts for about 3/4  hours. I usually mix a bronze gloss with it.</li>
    <li> The colour is o so beautiful but I am very disappointed that the gloss (shine) doesn&#x27;t last. The applicator is not as soft as I expected. The colour stays but definitely not the sheen needed to enhance my beautiful lips. Sorry!</li>
    <li> This is the longest lasting lipstick I have ever found. No brand comes close.</li>
    <li> dear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me and I want to be a client I have you to&lt;br /&gt;And I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
    <li> This is a very rich and gorgeous dark red color. I love it! It&#x27;s my new favorite. And it lasts forever. You can eat meals and it won&#x27;t fade. Be sure to keep the color on the outside of your lips and let them dry, or you&#x27;ll get it on your teeth and while it doesn&#x27;t stain your teeth, it&#x27;s a bit harder to get off than your normal lipstick.</li>
    <li> On top of a base foundation, this lipstick holds true to the name.  It is a nice finish.  It last a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day the colour is rich and it stays on for at least 3-4 hours (not all day) at least not on me. But it is so easy to re-apply I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> It fades just as quickly as your $2 stuff down at the drugstore.  Also leaves lips feeling dry and cracked.</li>
    <li> Good product EXCEPT it doesn&#x27;t stay all day.&lt;br /&gt;I would say with eating, drinking, normal wear - about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;And this is not a vibrant red but a muted deep red/bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking Malificent...it is not.&lt;br /&gt;But it is a GOOD product overall.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your lips feeling dry, you will need a gloss over it so heads up.</li>
    <li> the color is lovely, stays on all day and fells soft to the lips.  is my favor lipstick, I would not change a thing</li>
    <li> Stays on all day while I am at work even thru lunch and coffee...love it</li>
    <li> More pink than burgundy as it appears in the tube.  I wouldn&#x27;t get this color again, but I love this line of (discontinued) lipstick. It really stays almost all day.</li>
    <li> I am new to lipstick. It was never my thing, but I wanted to try the red lips trend right now. I tried 5 different shades &amp; couldn&#x27;t find a shade not too fire red or orange for my skin. This color is just perfect for what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Not too bright red not too burgundy. Deep gorgeous color.</li>
    <li> This is a great lipstick with amazing &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.  It does not dry out my lips, and after applying early in the morning lasts way into the night.  I actually have to use baby oil on a cotton swab to remove at night.  Sometimes I wear lip balm and then apply, and other times I don&#x27;t.  No difference.  Buying on Amazon saves me money and I no shipping fees with prime!  Woohoo!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color.  It stays on very well and has shimmer highlights in it as well as a bit of brown .</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly after applying a lip moisturizer and it gives a natural color that lasts for hours. The color will stay if you are careful not to let too much grease touches your lips. It does leave a lipstick mark on the glasses and cups that cannot be completely removed by the dishwasher, but pre-wash it with dish detergent and a gentle rub will remove the stain.</li>
    <li> Been buying it for about a year now.I love this color. I like that I can put this on at 6:30 in the morning, eat lunch  and its still on at 6:30 in the evening when I get home. It stays on great (unless I eat something really greasy). I used to get off work at 5 and go to my next job from 6 to 10 p.m. and I never needed to &#x27;touch up&#x27;.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone who wears lipstick all the time. It stays on for the most part, all day. Only reapplied once in the late afternoon.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal! I love revlon colorstay! The color is true to the image shown. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Thanks to amazon&#x27;s prime add-on program, I got this lipstick for less than a dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s plus 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus 2 - I love this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative - dries out your lips.</li>
    <li> Trying on this new color (for me) and I love it. Been using this Brand/type of lipstick when I bought it by accident and cannot imagine switching again. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color but dries to the skin on your lips then rolls off. Not worth what is paid unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this shade a year ago, now can rarely find it in stock in the store. Not too red, hint of bronze. Looks good against my pale skin. Wears a decent amount of time during the day, usually reapply it at least once. Overusing it can dry out the lips a bit, but not as much as other &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; brands I&#x27;ve tried. Happy enough with it to hunt it down on the internet.</li>
    <li> ...but delighted that I can find it on Amazon! This colour is a deep red with gold flecks in it...and you can apply it so it&#x27;s opaque and deep or you can use a light hand so it looks like a stain.  I am a real estate broker and I don&#x27;t like to re-apply my face during the daytime...and this line of lipcolour is perfect for me.  So glad I&#x27;ve been able to order from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of blue tones to my skin, so I often have trouble finding a shade of red lipstick that doesn&#x27;t end up looking raspberry on me. This color does not. It&#x27;s a gorgeous rich red, great for whenever I need that 1930s movie star look. Of course, being a Colorstay, it lasts and lasts without staining teacups or people I kiss, and without drying out my lips. I&#x27;m glad to have found it!</li>
    <li> This color stays on forever, and is nice and bright which is nice. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about it is that it once it dries on your lips it feels like chalk. So you must keep it moist</li>
    <li> seems inconsistent in color</li>
    <li> This Liquid Lipstick is absolutely gorgeous! I&#x27;m a rather pale girl with bright red hair and it looked absolutely stunning. Stays in place throughout eating and even a little sweating (i was dancing like crazy). Would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I can not find this product in the stores any more I am glad that I found it here and way cheaper!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this item for a very long time now. Even in revlon shops the color is not available anymore. Only here in amazon that I find it and it is so cheap.  I am just wondering if revlon will this continue this already. Anyway thank you very much. Btw I ordered 2 again with my other account. Thanks.</li>
    <li> So glad I was able to find this lipstick again! It stays on all day, and does not dry out, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the color and it does stay on a long time as stated by Revlon.</li>
    <li> I have a bunch of these colors. They stay on forever! I highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like to keep applying lipstick.</li>
