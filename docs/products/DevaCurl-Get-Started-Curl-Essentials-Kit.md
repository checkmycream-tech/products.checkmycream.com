      <li>starter pack, though, is a great way to try out the products and see if you like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>for the quality of the products, the clips are really great, and the conditioner &amp; poo are both great quality, but make sure you know how to use them...</li>
      <li>My curls have never looked so good.  </li>
      <li>My curly hair has never looked so good.  </li>
      <li>but all in all it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>It smells great and its nice and light.</li>
      <li>I had tried it at her house and liked the results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice size for scrunching hair.</li>
      <li>the shampoo leaves your clean but hydrated pleased with everything else great products.</li>
      <li>Love deva curl by far the best product for curly hair.</li>
      <li>It is just okay.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much better.</li>
      <li>plus you get some free clips and the towl!)..</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t any better then suave which is a dollar.</li>
      <li>I got so many complements on my hair</li>
      <li>The curls are more defined and softer.  </li>
      <li>You will love the product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the gel yet, but love the shampoo and conditioner as well as the towel that comes with it.</li>
      <li>It was just okay.</li>
      <li>More like Lysol.</li>
      <li>The no poo and conditioner makes my hair so much more curly and the curls are well defined.  </li>
      <li>I love the towel included as well.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I rarely use the clips.</li>
      <li>and these didn&#x27;t honestly didn&#x27;t do much to help make my hair feel healthy..</li>
      <li>so strong that as soon as I slit the plastic I could smell.</li>
      <li>And in any case, the days of strong fragrances are over.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing, but you don&#x27;t use as much of it.</li>
      <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve come to find that the glycerin in them creates frizz on my fine, 2C waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>starter kit is a great deal; you get both the shampoo and conditioner, four clips, the microfiber towel and the ultra hold gel (which I don&#x27;t actually use: I prefer the light hold).</li>
      <li>I would like to go sulfate free, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a silicone free styling product that works for me.</li>
      <li>I liked this product so much that I have ordered the 32oz of the one condition and arc angel.</li>
      <li>Great product, will definitely repurchase!</li>
      <li>My curls look as good as the ringlets I had at two years old.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also comes with the new Deva Clips, which I love!  </li>
      <li>I just learned about the Curly Girl concept from a friend and was so excited, I ordered the book and this starter pack.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with my hair!</li>
      <li>So I purchased Deva Curl for the first time in this little &#x27;kit&#x27;..for the record, this kit is of great value for the price!</li>
      <li>It smells like Mr. Clean and not in a clean fresh smell way.</li>
      <li>but I think that both the poo &amp; conditioner are great quality and will probably work well if you know what youre doing...and another thing, my hair Is EXTREMELY damaged and dry/thin/brittle</li>
      <li>I have had many friends comment on how my hair looks so different and so healthy.  </li>
      <li>The very first time I used no poo, my scalp cleared and has been that way ever since.  </li>
      <li>Most people are very sensitive these days, myself included but this fragrance you just can&#x27;t hide.</li>
      <li>the &#x27;deva towel&#x27; is very soft, but when I even so as touched the thing to my hair, I got all sorts of little white fuzzies in my hair lol, so it was kind of shedding, so beware of that...other than that, great quality product..best of luck to any one that tries this!!:)</li>
      <li>The little towel is OK, but you can use your own towel.  </li>
      <li>These products got me started on the road to healthy natural waves.</li>
      <li>I gave this to my niece as a present because she has great, natural curly hair</li>
      <li>the whole no lathering thing was a foreign concept to me lol)..</li>
      <li>I have 2C-3A very fine blonde hair.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re about twice the size of the regular clips, and give me great lift at the roots of my hair, where I tend to fall flat.  </li>
      <li>I followed the directions and I never got the pretty curls</li>
      <li>I like jessicurls low lather shampoo better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal for the price, and lets you try a few products at once before commiting.</li>
      <li>From reading up on the naturally curly website, it seems that my tightly closed cuticle does not like protein and most silicone free products rely on protein instead.</li>
      <li>it made my hair feel super soft and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I have been using them for only 2 days so far, but they have made such a remarkable difference.</li>
      <li>Sometimes they make my hair look nice for about an hour, then it turns into a frizzy mess.</li>
      <li>My girls have very curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>I was literally ready to just cut it all off.  </li>
      <li>I actually really like the smell of the products</li>
      <li>It would be so much easier to just stick with the people</li>
      <li>like I said, it isn&#x27;t because these aren&#x27;t good products or anything, they are, but if you have extremely damaged hair, then I cant promise you that these will be enough to repair your hair...</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with my purchase and bottles were bigger than expected for the price!</li>
      <li>but yeah, anyway, if you don&#x27;t really have bad damage to your hair, then these will probably work excellent for you!!</li>
      <li>I wondered why my hair wasn&#x27;t particularly liking the duo, but then it hit me..</li>
      <li>You get the main products you need and a couple bonuses for the price of one product from the salon.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I am new to products for curly hair and but I already use and like the gel</li>
      <li>wife loves it, can&#x27;t live without it..</li>
      <li>I have used so many curl products in the past BUT</li>
      <li>BUT IT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY.</li>
      <li>hesitate, it&#x27;s worth every single penny!</li>
      <li>and they leave my hair really soft.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I also had problems with the back of my scalp breaking out with scabs (too much info, I know)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These products are great. This is the perfect package. You get the main products you need and a couple bonuses for the price of one product from the salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva products since I discovered the Curly Girl method of no silicones or sulfates about two years ago.  I actually really like the smell of the products and they leave my hair really soft.  That being said, I&#x27;ve come to find that the glycerin in them creates frizz on my fine, 2C waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This starter pack, though, is a great way to try out the products and see if you like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with the new Deva Clips, which I love!  They&#x27;re about twice the size of the regular clips, and give me great lift at the roots of my hair, where I tend to fall flat.  If you go to the Deva website, you can also find some picture tutorials of how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deva makes some really nice products, and they helped me embrace my waves!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found yet for my botticelli curls. I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil-based products, shea-based products, traditional shampoos and conditioners...and this stuff blows them all out of the water. My curls are soft, healthy and manageable, and I think it&#x27;s making my hair the way my hair was mean to be. Plus it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This starter kit is a great deal; you get both the shampoo and conditioner, four clips, the microfiber towel and the ultra hold gel (which I don&#x27;t actually use: I prefer the light hold). If you want to start DevaCurl&#x27;s system, this is a great way to get into it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Having curly hair is a chore, but Deva Curl has made it manageable.  My curls have never looked so good.  This product is amazing and only a person with curly hair can tell you how difficult it is to manage and maintain.  In the past I have tried a plethora of products and nothing has worked.  DevaCurl does not try out your hair, the No-Poo cleanses your hair miraculously.  I am in awe of this product.</li>
    <li> I have medium-length thick curly hair, and for the most part, my curls are rarely defined and always frizzy, and just an overall hot mess. I decided to give these products a try after receiving several recommendations for them. I absolutely love them and am so happy with the results! I have been using them for only 2 days so far, but they have made such a remarkable difference. My curls are all bouncy and shiny (and happy-looking, if such a thing!) The smell is a little extra flowery, which is something I don&#x27;t usually go for, but it&#x27;s not that bothersome and with the results I&#x27;m getting, I can easily overlook! I haven&#x27;t used the gel yet, but love the shampoo and conditioner as well as the towel that comes with it. Great product, will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I was one bad hair day away from making a very bad decision. I was literally ready to just cut it all off.  My curls were dry, frizzy and uneven. I couldn&#x27;t stand them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this product happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my curls are bouncy, shiny and BEAUTIFUL. This is the closest thing to a miracle in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate, it&#x27;s worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> I have crazy curly hair so I decided to try this it is no different then any other curly hair product. The no poo shampoo like stuff left my hair dry and frizzy just like normal shampoos and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t any better then suave which is a dollar. The anti frizz gel doesn&#x27;t work I prefer my frizz ez it&#x27;s much better. All in all I was disappointed</li>
    <li> I read the Curly Girl book and decided to embrace my waves and curls after over 40 years of blow drying. These products got me started on the road to healthy natural waves. I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with my hair!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my niece as a present because she has great, natural curly hair and this is a perfect sample size.&lt;br /&gt;It allows you to use each product before purchasing the larger sizes.  Turns out, she loves it too!</li>
    <li> It helped with the defenition of my curls but not the volume, I was a little disappointed in that but all in all it&#x27;s a good product. Will continue to use</li>
    <li> loved this, great if you want to try these products. really expensive on their own. did not care for the clips i wish they were alligator clips. the towel i use everyday but too expensive when a shirt does the same job. the shampoo leaves your clean but hydrated pleased with everything else great products.</li>
    <li> This Was Actually a gift, so Im not rating it.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner but not impressed with the gel.  The gel has very little hold!!!  Curls feel great with the use of shampoo and conditioner!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have 2C-3A very fine blonde hair. I would like to go sulfate free, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a silicone free styling product that works for me. I like the shampoo and conditioner. They seem to work wonders, but none of the Deva Curl styling products work for me. Sometimes they make my hair look nice for about an hour, then it turns into a frizzy mess. I think the issue is protein. From reading up on the naturally curly website, it seems that my tightly closed cuticle does not like protein and most silicone free products rely on protein instead. I have even had a cut and style from a Deva Curl trained stylist and the look lasted no more than an hour. Very disappointed since I know it works wonders for others.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got curly hair, this is it.  period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it, can&#x27;t live without it..what&#x27;s left to say?</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and I never got the pretty curls and I still had a lot of frizz.  Also my hair felt stiff and dry/crunchy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly impressed with how this product leaves my hair. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo. My old fav Panteen has been beat in everything but smell. I hate the way this smells. It smells so much like bad pine-sol I was afraid to use it at first. The products in this set have been the best I ever used based on results. I would have returned just because of the smell if the results hadn&#x27;t been awesome. I&#x27;m gonna try some other sulfate free product next time. If they ever change the smell I would buy again.</li>
    <li> it made my hair feel super soft and hydrated.  Loved the towel and with all the extras it is an awesome deal.</li>
    <li> The best starter kit.... You will buy more!!! It has helped my curly hair and I love it!!!! It works!</li>
    <li> I am new to products for curly hair and but I already use and like the gel so I thought I would try the shampoo and conditioner.  It is just okay.  I like jessicurls low lather shampoo better.</li>
    <li> Love deva curl by far the best product for curly hair. Always wanted the towel and clips now I have them.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my daughter-in-law.  I had tried it at her house and liked the results.  The product is great for curly hair. The curls are more defined and softer.  You will love the product.</li>
    <li> I liked this product so much that I have ordered the 32oz of the one condition and arc angel. The gel in this kit is just a sample size, so with my daughter and i using it it didn&#x27;t last long. The no poo is great as well.  Very refreshing, but you don&#x27;t use as much of it. To be honest, I rarely use the clips. I just don&#x27;t feel the need. It took us a few weeks to get used to using these products as it&#x27;s a different way of hair care altogether, but I get lots of compliments now. I love the towel included as well. It&#x27;s a nice size for scrunching hair. I would recommend if you are thinking about starting to use curly girl products to try one of these kits. It&#x27;s a good deal for the price, and lets you try a few products at once before commiting.</li>
    <li> My girls have very curly, frizzy hair.  This product definitely does it&#x27;s job!  I have used pink lotion and many other kinds of oils for their hair, and they usually both have extreme frizz at the end of the day.  The shampoo and conditioner are great for eliminating frizz from the minute it goes in! There is a noticeable difference when they get out of the bathtub and all the way throughout the day. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new poo for my curly hair and came across Diva Curl just due to the high ratings.  This definitely deserves all the praise.  My curly hair has never looked so good.  I have naturally curly hair and it is thin.  The no poo and conditioner makes my hair so much more curly and the curls are well defined.  I also had problems with the back of my scalp breaking out with scabs (too much info, I know), I assumed it was due to coloring my hair.  The very first time I used no poo, my scalp cleared and has been that way ever since.  So, I can only guess my scalp had a reaction to sulfates.  I will NEVER use anything else on my hair, NO SULFATES for me.  I have had many friends comment on how my hair looks so different and so healthy.  Again, this is a MUST HAVE for anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I just learned about the Curly Girl concept from a friend and was so excited, I ordered the book and this starter pack. I read the the reviews about the unpleasant fragrance of the products but thought how bad could it be? Well, I just finished my first shower with the products and my hair is still wet so I can&#x27;t tell you anything about the performance but based on the smell alone I won&#x27;t be reordering these products. It&#x27;s awful! I just hope it dissipates because I think if it doesn&#x27;t, it will be embarrassing if others can smell it on me. It smells like Mr. Clean and not in a clean fresh smell way. More like Lysol. I&#x27;m already dreading my next shower. Could it be I have wasted my money on something I won&#x27;t even use? Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the makers are reading this, please reconsider this formula. I&#x27;d like to buy the products to support the work of this movement but can&#x27;t smell like this. And in any case, the days of strong fragrances are over. Most people are very sensitive these days, myself included but this fragrance you just can&#x27;t hide. It would be great with no fragrance added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I&#x27;ll have to search out another product line, which is too bad. It would be so much easier to just stick with the people you know get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m being generous with two stars because of the towel and clips. Skip this one.</li>
    <li> Excited to get the kit, it was a disappointment.  The little towel is OK, but you can use your own towel.  I don&#x27;t mind that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds up, but the smell is unpleasant and I feel self conscious after I&#x27;ve shampooed and am out in public - wondering if others notice the smell.  I would never suggest this product.</li>
    <li> Great products! Great value! Very satisfied with my purchase and bottles were bigger than expected for the price! I would recommend this to friends!</li>
    <li> while the smell isn&#x27;t necessarily unpleasant, it is extremely strong. so strong that as soon as I slit the plastic I could smell. I will have to wash the towel before even considering using it.&lt;br /&gt;I used the one-condition before I washed my hair w/ my reg. no sulfate shampoo. in the hope that it would reduce the smell. No luck so far, but my hair isn&#x27;t try yet.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know when i&#x27;ll try the No-Poo I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m brave enough.&lt;br /&gt;No this that &amp; the other - it is shame it wasn&#x27;t no perfume too.</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching youtube videos of people who use Deva Curl. I wanted to stop using the flat iron and go \\&quot;au natural\\&quot;. Of course my hair is so dry from years of straightening so I thought I would give Deva Curl a shot. I have used so many curl products in the past BUT NOTHING MEASURES UP TO DEVA CURL. My curls look as good as the ringlets I had at two years old. I was skeptical about spending this much money on a hair product that might not work BUT IT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY. I got so many complements on my hair and I will continue to use Deva Curl. I am shocked at the outcome and I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> So I purchased Deva Curl for the first time in this little &#x27;kit&#x27;..for the record, this kit is of great value for the price! (Youre getting the &#x27;no-poo&#x27; and &#x27;one condition&#x27; cheaper than you would if you purchased them separately..plus you get some free clips and the towl!)..for the quality of the products, the clips are really great, and the conditioner &amp; poo are both great quality, but make sure you know how to use them...the first time I tried them, I was very disappointed with the results, but then it hit me that these products are meant to be used a certain way (Id never used a \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; before so the whole no lathering thing was a foreign concept to me lol)..but I think that both the poo &amp; conditioner are great quality and will probably work well if you know what youre doing...and another thing, my hair Is EXTREMELY damaged and dry/thin/brittle/weak etc lol, and these didn&#x27;t honestly didn&#x27;t do much to help make my hair feel healthy..like I said, it isn&#x27;t because these aren&#x27;t good products or anything, they are, but if you have extremely damaged hair, then I cant promise you that these will be enough to repair your hair...I wondered why my hair wasn&#x27;t particularly liking the duo, but then it hit me..the package says nothing about repairing damaged hair...but yeah, anyway, if you don&#x27;t really have bad damage to your hair, then these will probably work excellent for you!! * side note...the &#x27;deva towel&#x27; is very soft, but when I even so as touched the thing to my hair, I got all sorts of little white fuzzies in my hair lol, so it was kind of shedding, so beware of that...other than that, great quality product..best of luck to any one that tries this!!:)</li>
    <li> It was just okay. I&#x27;ve had less expensive products that have worked better. It smells great and its nice and light.</li>
