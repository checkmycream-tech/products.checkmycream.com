      <li>I love, love, love these hair sticks.</li>
      <li>like it&#x27;s a magical wand or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not so sure about handmade either.</li>
      <li>I love they way</li>
      <li>There were also a strand of beads dangling from the top.</li>
      <li>Cute, and work well... :-)</li>
      <li>Because of the smoothness and thickness of these sticks, they tend to slide around a bit more than my others do.  </li>
      <li>The second set that I ordered are awesome!  </li>
      <li>I recommend them :)</li>
      <li>Perhaps if I had more hair they would work better</li>
      <li>so I find the slimmer sticks stay in place better for my hair type and style purposes</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>They are very smooth and easy to guide through hair.</li>
      <li>She loves them and they are still holding up strong after 6 months of use.</li>
      <li>One is a lot longer than the other, but they are polished nicely and look great in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful and simple.</li>
      <li>Nicely made, I received exactly what is shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>5.44 + free ship - when I ordered).</li>
      <li>and I want to put it up in bun to be secure but not pull my hair.</li>
      <li>and I smooth it</li>
      <li>Before using them, I give my waist-length hair a light application of sea salt spray - it gives the sticks some traction/texture to stay put.  </li>
      <li>and I twist it around itself secure with one of these</li>
      <li>The shorter one of these was smooth and didn&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re so smooth</li>
      <li>They look very nice with my hair in a bun or French twist.</li>
      <li>They look organic and beautiful, they also are very sturdy so far.</li>
      <li>These are my new favorite way to wear my hair!  </li>
      <li>These are great for anyone with long hair.  </li>
      <li>- they&#x27;ve got a bit of a &amp;#34;Rick Owens 2010&amp;#34; vibe going on and are stylishly unique.</li>
      <li>these stay in my hair better than I would have anticipated when I first got them</li>
      <li>I fixed that however they are smooth that they need to be wider at the top...</li>
      <li>Smooth and unique - love the way they glide into my hair and look so different, but are still neutral.</li>
      <li>I find these to be good lengths for wearing alone or as a pair, and definitely noticeable when wearing - and after all, don&#x27;t we wear hair sticks instead of bobby pins for that?  ;)</li>
      <li>Love these handy little hair accessories, wish they came in shorter sizes.</li>
      <li>They are flexible too, which is nice, so I only need to use one at a time.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about the shape.  </li>
      <li>Stayed in my hair pretty well, and my hair generally isn&#x27;t contained very easily.</li>
      <li>these slide right thru my hair and onto the floor....</li>
      <li>(I use them to secure a high bun).  </li>
      <li>Love the ease of winding my long hair into a bun and securing it quickly with one of these sticks.</li>
      <li>They are a little longer that what I wanted but for the price the quality is really good.</li>
      <li>They are so pretty</li>
      <li>Holds even better than a big clip.</li>
      <li>I received two tacky wooden hair sticks with multicolored thread wrapped around the top.</li>
      <li>Product received was exactly as pictured and came intact in bubble wrap.  </li>
      <li>hair is to short for these now but will consider ordering some more if my hair gets longer so I can keep wizarding it up.</li>
      <li>These hair sticks arrived packaged in their own bubble-wrap envelope along with the other items in my order.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately because these are natural horn my dog also really liked them, and has eaten both since I irresponsibly left them on our coffee table.  </li>
      <li>These are super cute but very sharp</li>
      <li>He is no worse for wear, but the sticks did not survive.</li>
      <li>The item arrived on time and are a great size and color but the quality of the material is really poor.</li>
      <li>The longer on sticks out, which I don&#x27;t like as much, but both hold well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you have straight hair, this may not be for you.</li>
      <li>I have not had one fall out or free my hairstyle, but I do need to adjust them occasionally during the day.  </li>
      <li>If your hair is wavy, curly or you tease it lightly before pinning your hairstyle, you will likely have no issues with these sticks at all.  </li>
      <li>Really like these.</li>
      <li>These came really fast.  </li>
      <li>My hair is straight</li>
      <li>Very pretty and different.  </li>
      <li>The ones I received look exactly like the picture up on the website: one black and one light colored.  </li>
      <li>Highly displeased.</li>
      <li>This made for a longer than normal wait to receive them.</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t have to worry about damaging her hair by having to constantly pull back her hair like she would with a ponytail, and these give a much more professional look.  </li>
      <li>The best part was that I got one that was a normal functioning size and another obnoxiously long one that I can whip dramatically out of my hair and randomly shout spells out from Harry Potter</li>
      <li>I understand that this is an organic, natural material, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to come apart like that!</li>
      <li>Received 2 as described; one dark &amp; one light.</li>
      <li>However, despite my waist length hair, I&#x27;ve found these sticks a little too long to be comfortable, and they are so smooth that my straight hair tends to come loose.</li>
      <li>She often needs to pull her hair back for work and this makes it quick and simple to do.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer the shorter of the 2 to hold a bun in my hair, the ends stick out enough to hold my hair, but don&#x27;t stick out around my head.  </li>
      <li>Would not recommend  to any one; do not waste your time.</li>
      <li>I wish there were a negative rating option because that would have better suited my feelings about my product.</li>
      <li>They look like a butter knife in my hair but they are pretty and keep my long hair  up.</li>
      <li>I have a few other bone hair sticks and by far these are the thickest and smoothest ones I have and the points are not as sharp as my others making them a bit more comfortable to get in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have long straight hair</li>
      <li>They work well, but one is much longer  than the other by 2 inches</li>
      <li>If you have thick curly hair, this should be right up your alley!</li>

    <li> I have a few other bone hair sticks and by far these are the thickest and smoothest ones I have and the points are not as sharp as my others making them a bit more comfortable to get in my hair.  The longer one measures in at 9-1/2\\&quot; and the shorter one at 6-3/4\\&quot; and both are approximately 1/2\\&quot;+ wide on the widest top part.  The ones you receive may vary slightly.  I find these to be good lengths for wearing alone or as a pair, and definitely noticeable when wearing - and after all, don&#x27;t we wear hair sticks instead of bobby pins for that?  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to these as opposed to my slimmer hair sticks is my hair type and of course, YMMV on that point.  My hair is straight and I smooth it so I find the slimmer sticks stay in place better for my hair type and style purposes (I use them to secure a high bun).  Because of the smoothness and thickness of these sticks, they tend to slide around a bit more than my others do.  I have not had one fall out or free my hairstyle, but I do need to adjust them occasionally during the day.  If your hair is wavy, curly or you tease it lightly before pinning your hairstyle, you will likely have no issues with these sticks at all.  :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I received hair sticks almost identical to what is pictured.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is a shipping mix up or other problem for the people receiving wooden sticks with beads.  The ones I received are narrow on one end and wide on the other.  They are fairly straight, though not perfectly so.  They have a larger diameter than your average wood, metal, or plastic stick.  They aren&#x27;t the type where you would use two to hold up a bun.</li>
    <li> I love they way they hold my hair in place i have gotten several comments on the style and look it give my long hair</li>
    <li> These arrived the very next day! They are so pretty and they are practically similar to the ones displayed. They work so well, way better than chopsticks! I love these!</li>
    <li> Bought them awhile ago and these worked really great for me. They are a little slippery for hair so I suggest using a tight bun if you go for it. The best part was that I got one that was a normal functioning size and another obnoxiously long one that I can whip dramatically out of my hair and randomly shout spells out from Harry Potter like it&#x27;s a magical wand or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is to short for these now but will consider ordering some more if my hair gets longer so I can keep wizarding it up.</li>
    <li> Great quality and really cool!</li>
    <li> Work great in mt hair</li>
    <li> Awesome and great to get to work in a flash lol</li>
    <li> Love these hair sticks! They are very smooth and easy to guide through hair. I recommend them :)</li>
    <li> these stay in my hair better than I would have anticipated when I first got them, they&#x27;re so smooth I didn&#x27;t think they would, but they work great.  I much prefer the shorter of the 2 to hold a bun in my hair, the ends stick out enough to hold my hair, but don&#x27;t stick out around my head.

He is no worse for wear, but the sticks did not survive.</li>
    <li> These were a Christmas gift for my daughter. She often needs to pull her hair back for work and this makes it quick and simple to do.  She doesn&#x27;t have to worry about damaging her hair by having to constantly pull back her hair like she would with a ponytail, and these give a much more professional look.  She loves them and they are still holding up strong after 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> These are great for anyone with long hair.  I have long straight hair and I twist it around itself secure with one of these and it stays up all day with no fuss.  Holds even better than a big clip.</li>
    <li> Product received was exactly as pictured and came intact in bubble wrap.  Stayed in my hair pretty well, and my hair generally isn&#x27;t contained very easily.</li>
    <li> long enough to twirl and set my long hair in place. I sometimes use both at once crossways and it looks nice</li>
    <li> Smooth and unique - love the way they glide into my hair and look so different, but are still neutral. Happy about the cost, as well. Would buy again (and have, second purchase!)</li>
    <li> Very pretty and different.  They look very nice with my hair in a bun or French twist.</li>
    <li> I like to be able to just twist my hair into a bun and go!  These I use both at the same time and they hold well.  Once in a while they slip out.  I have long thick course hair.  If you have silky hair they would probably slide out worse.</li>
    <li> Too slick and slides out of hair.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these hair sticks. They came on time and were just as described. They look organic and beautiful, they also are very sturdy so far. They do have a little give for tighter buns but don&#x27;t snap, but I do thing that eventually when my hair gets thicker and longer it would be harder to do tighter buns without snapping, we&#x27;ll just have to see in a few months. Either way I would totally buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and attractive</li>
    <li> The only reason I am selecting one star is because you have to select a star in order to write a review. I wish there were a negative rating option because that would have better suited my feelings about my product. I received two tacky wooden hair sticks with multicolored thread wrapped around the top. There were also a strand of beads dangling from the top. One of the strands of beads were broken and loose in the bottom of the bag. Highly displeased. Would not recommend  to any one; do not waste your time.</li>
    <li> I got tacky wooden sticks with gaudy beads attached instead of these.</li>
    <li> Very smooth with a nice shape (they are all different). Doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair and I like the colors.</li>
    <li> They are a bit slick and don&#x27;t stay in very well. Perhaps if I had more hair they would work better</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and are a great size and color but the quality of the material is really poor. One of the sticks was not polished well and had a nick that would snag on my hair and the other literally split into two along the grain. I understand that this is an organic, natural material, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to come apart like that!</li>
    <li> Love these handy little hair accessories, wish they came in shorter sizes.</li>
    <li> Love the ease of winding my long hair into a bun and securing it quickly with one of these sticks. They work great, look good, and the price was good.</li>
    <li> My hair is past my waist and I want to put it up in bun to be secure but not pull my hair. The shorter one of these was smooth and didn&#x27;t pull my hair. The longer one arrived broken--phooey- for the price I will go back to using chopsticks</li>
    <li> Nicely made, I received exactly what is shown in the picture. However, despite my waist length hair, I&#x27;ve found these sticks a little too long to be comfortable, and they are so smooth that my straight hair tends to come loose. However, that&#x27;s a hair texture issue and not the fault of the hair sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have straight hair, this may not be for you. If you have thick curly hair, this should be right up your alley!</li>
    <li> These are super cute but very sharp</li>
    <li> Received 2 as described; one dark &amp; one light. Hold and grip hair well for a unique and polished look for a fair price (&amp;5.44 + free ship - when I ordered). Just ordered another set!</li>
    <li> They work well, but one is much longer  than the other by 2 inches and I would have preferred two of the same size.  They are completely different colors, like the picture.  They are flexible too, which is nice, so I only need to use one at a time.  It lost a star due to the 2 very different lengths.</li>
    <li> One was cracked at the tip ...I fixed that however they are smooth that they need to be wider at the top...these slide right thru my hair and onto the floor....</li>
    <li> These hair sticks are absolutely beautiful.  There was no damage to the hair sticks upon receipt.  It made for a wonderful gift to my wife!  The only down side is that the items were shipped from China.  This made for a longer than normal wait to receive them.</li>
    <li> These hair sticks arrived packaged in their own bubble-wrap envelope along with the other items in my order.  The ones I received look exactly like the picture up on the website: one black and one light colored.  There were a few nicks on them, but nothing too major or detracting from the overall natural aesthetic.  Before using them, I give my waist-length hair a light application of sea salt spray - it gives the sticks some traction/texture to stay put.  Overall, I like these - they&#x27;ve got a bit of a &amp;#34;Rick Owens 2010&amp;#34; vibe going on and are stylishly unique.</li>
    <li> Really like these. Not crazy about the shape.  They look like a butter knife in my hair but they are pretty and keep my long hair  up. They are a little longer that what I wanted but for the price the quality is really good.</li>
    <li> These are just colored plastic. Cute, and work well... :-) But not bone!!! Not so sure about handmade either. Also, they&#x27;re flat. Not rounded like what the photo portrays. I like them.. But they&#x27;re definitely not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite way to wear my hair!  Beautiful and simple.</li>
    <li> one of the two i received broke within a week. it broke from the center as if it was glued together along the center. disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are great, BUT one of them splintered and now it snags my hair.</li>
    <li> These came really fast.  One is a lot longer than the other, but they are polished nicely and look great in my hair.  The second set that I ordered are awesome!  I love the uniqueness of these and can&#x27;t wait to wear them!</li>
    <li> The hair sticks look beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Unfortunately they catch and pull on my hair, so I will have to sand down some rough spots before I try them again.</li>
