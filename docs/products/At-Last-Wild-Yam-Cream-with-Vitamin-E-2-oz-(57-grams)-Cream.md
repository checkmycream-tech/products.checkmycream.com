      <li>Nicely priced and no travel time!</li>
      <li>I just purchased this and will rate again after a fair trial period.</li>
      <li>ingredients look good as well&lt;</li>
      <li>product is about as safe as medicine can get!</li>
      <li>This is the best absorbing one I have used.</li>
      <li>Always discuss with your own care team.</li>
      <li>I picked this one because it is paraben free with good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone</li>
      <li>I am so GLAD to find this product.</li>
      <li>Just my opinion though :)</li>
      <li>am buying it on Amazon now because it is more cost-effective and reliable.</li>
      <li>love this cream.</li>
      <li>This cream was for my mother who has been using it for many years now.</li>
      <li>The product itself was fine.</li>
      <li>The Hormone Cure*, available here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>You read that right!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it if you liked the old one...</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Excellent altternative to hormone replacement theapy, used with other natural herbs</li>
      <li>It was like instant relief for me, almost like magic!</li>
      <li>The grocer seems to be out of stock more frequently than I can afford.</li>
      <li>it is worth a try</li>
      <li>Second, I am insistently committed to the most effective and purest products available: no allergens, no phthalates, no parabens, no BPA, as organic as affordably possible, no fragrance (husband&#x27;s allergies), no lavender or rosemary (gives me hives, but MANY personal care products rely on them), etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be free of bothersome hot flashes</li>
      <li>Before I ordered this product my hot flashes were unbearful , this product worked wonders</li>
      <li>This helps my hot flashes and mood swings</li>
      <li>The most valuable information comes from actual product users.</li>
      <li>This product worked ok on me, but I had also bought the Extra Strength, and that is actually what helped me the most.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>She was getting hot flashes</li>
      <li>Been using this cream for the first time</li>
      <li>I have made it through menopause without chemicals or drugs so far!!!!</li>
      <li>With some external sources of high stress in my life, my mood swings had begun to dominate my days and most of my nights.</li>
      <li>the bottom line is that it worked very well for me..</li>
      <li>I did not see much improvement or changes - maybe after a few more weeks i will feel different &amp; better.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It actually increased my hot flashes!</li>
      <li>First, to understand my context, you need to know that I am super-sensitive with a couple of pages of allergies: includes gluten, soy, NSAIDs, various foods and dyes, etc.</li>
      <li>I have read that the Wild Yam is often tolerated by those that do not tolerate progesterone</li>
      <li>I was just looking for some wild yam cream.</li>
      <li>: I am not a healthcare professional.</li>
      <li>The Wild Yam Cream you get is not the one in the peach and cream colored box.  </li>
      <li>Shortly thereafter, my eyes fell on this product in my natural grocery store.</li>
      <li>Natural progesterone cream used to help me but after using it for a decade I became toxic (it can store in your fatty tissue)and can no longer use it as I have become very sensitive to even natural progesterone and do not tolerate it</li>

    <li> I got this for my mom. She was getting hot flashes and she loves it. I&#x27;m not a woman but 5 stars to anything mommy loves lol.</li>
    <li> The Wild Yam Cream you get is not the one in the peach and cream colored box.  It is a different formula and now comes in a purple box.  It irritated my skin and turned it red.  I don&#x27;t recommend it if you liked the old one...</li>
    <li> This helps my hot flashes and mood swings</li>
    <li> Great product!  Been using this companies product for several year; believe it helps my body balance my loss of estrogen.</li>
    <li> Yes! You read that right! I have used this product for about 6 wks now as a PM woman and it has literally given me back my mind! First, to understand my context, you need to know that I am super-sensitive with a couple of pages of allergies: includes gluten, soy, NSAIDs, various foods and dyes, etc. Second, I am insistently committed to the most effective and purest products available: no allergens, no phthalates, no parabens, no BPA, as organic as affordably possible, no fragrance (husband&#x27;s allergies), no lavender or rosemary (gives me hives, but MANY personal care products rely on them), etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I am FORCED by my biology to be EXTREMELY SELECTIVE about the products that I buy. With some external sources of high stress in my life, my mood swings had begun to dominate my days and most of my nights. Then I started reading Dr. Sara Gottfried&#x27;s *The Hormone Cure*, available here on Amazon. Shortly thereafter, my eyes fell on this product in my natural grocery store. So I bought it. It was like instant relief for me, almost like magic! I use it 2x per day, but never after 6pm, as it can keep me awake at night. All those crying jags and deep dives into the dark pool of depression are well-controlled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying it on Amazon now because it is more cost-effective and reliable. The grocer seems to be out of stock more frequently than I can afford. Yes, it&#x27;s that dramatic a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also get Prescribed Choice: PhosphatidylSerine (recommended by a naturopath and Dr. Daniel Amen) here on Amazon and use it 2x daily. It is NOT stimulating, so one in the morning and one after dinner. That product has eliminated the spikes of unreasonable anger that were hitting me several times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is about as safe as medicine can get! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAVEAT: I am not a healthcare professional. Always discuss with your own care team.</li>
    <li> This is the best absorbing one I have used. I even used Wiley Protocol. And everyone else is too expensively priced for what you need. I am going with this one- trying the gel too- less messy.  I am so GLAD to find this product. Pe-menopausal symptoms are under control.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  It actually increased my hot flashes!</li>
    <li> the bottom line is that it worked very well for me.. ingredients look good as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have heat symptoms it is worth a try</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this product my hot flashes were unbearful , this product worked wonders I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be free of bothersome hot flashes</li>
    <li> This product worked ok on me, but I had also bought the Extra Strength, and that is actually what helped me the most.  I would recommend this product to people under 30, but the Extra strength if you&#x27;re over 30.  Just my opinion though :)</li>
    <li> I did not see much improvement or changes - maybe after a few more weeks i will feel different &amp; better.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and a wonderful product! Nicely priced and no travel time!</li>
    <li> It works for me and has for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star rating until I try it. I just purchased this and will rate again after a fair trial period. I&#x27;m just hoping that someone who orders this product will reply to me if they are using this for PMS-perimenopausal symptoms. I have insomnia and fatigue (along with some headache and fluid gain) with my cycles.... oh and menstrual cramps. Natural progesterone cream used to help me but after using it for a decade I became toxic (it can store in your fatty tissue)and can no longer use it as I have become very sensitive to even natural progesterone and do not tolerate it (it causes my cortisol to rise and I gain fluid from it). I have read that the Wild Yam is often tolerated by those that do not tolerate progesterone and it has some of the same benefits (in addition to no toxicity issues). I picked this one because it is paraben free with good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone...... who is re-ordering due to improvements in their PMS/insomnia/fatigue/headaches or the like, please let me know how it has worked for you. The most valuable information comes from actual product users. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent altternative to hormone replacement theapy, used with other natural herbs I have made it through menopause without chemicals or drugs so far!!!!</li>
    <li> This cream was for my mother who has been using it for many years now. It simply works.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with this. I apply as directions stated, but maybe because it&#x27;s external use only, is why it doesn&#x27;t work , like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> But my wife does, and I have no complaints. She is over 50 and this has helped her through Menopause.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that the product helped but other info would indicate it does help and and not others. The product itself was fine.</li>
    <li> This works great for cramps!  I have had very painful cramps but taking the wild yam cream has reduced them significantly.</li>
    <li> A dramatic difference. Quick shipping. Perfect purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it&#x27;s great!...Amazon also had the best price out there.</li>
    <li> love this cream. seems to help with my mood quite a bit. use it before bed and in the morning. have tried other creams but they did nothing. this one seems to help.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for some wild yam cream. It smells a little stale but that&#x27;s to be expected with an herbal cream, although honestly it just smells like plain lotion--no stink at all. It goes on like a slightly thicker lotion and takes a little bit to absorb.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for the first time and I have to say it makes a difference.  I have not had the severe dryness associated with menopause.  Husband likes it too!</li>
