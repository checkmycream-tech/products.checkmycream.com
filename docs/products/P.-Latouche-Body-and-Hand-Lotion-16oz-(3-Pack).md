    <li> I have been using this lotion for years. A friend gave me a two ounce bottle to try and I fell in love. I work in retail and get compliments from my customers daily. I am constantly asked &amp;#34;What is that perfume you&#x27;re wearing?&amp;#34;  I no longer wear perfume or cologne, only P.Latouche lotion. If a soft subtle scent is what you like, this is ti. Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion! I receive compliments every time I have it on! It has a light scent that&#x27;s not too overbearing. It has a thick texture (which is to be expected since it&#x27;s a hand &amp; body lotion); so, there&#x27;s no need to use a lot. My shipment came earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
