      <li>is the best pomade !!!</li>
      <li>This vegan hair styling wax is excellent.</li>
      <li>beautiful.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>Has a great hold without being oily.</li>
      <li>smells great and will buy again.</li>
      <li>It works great for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;d use this pomade over ANY gel, because of the great ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a great hair product for my kid son and this works and holds well.</li>
      <li>Works great and has almost nothing caustic/hazardous inside the product.</li>
      <li>I am happy to say that Giovanni Wicked Wax pomade is the product I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
      <li>This is GREAT FOR EDGES.</li>
      <li>For a pomade the hold wasn&#x27;t as good as I hoped.</li>
      <li>I like this stuff for fly aways and nice sleek ponytails.  </li>
      <li>It does have a wonderful scent and it is nice that it is water-soluble and will wash out easily, but it just didn&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
      <li>He loved it and looks very handsome using this.</li>
      <li>Very interesting styling aid.</li>
      <li>Love the vegan aspect of this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly oils, so it makes perfect sense that it just absorbed into my hair, but that is why I wanted a wax.  </li>
      <li>Giovanni Wicked Wax smells nice</li>
      <li>Great stuff, and very importantly, cruelty free.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as preferred, but the fact that its vegan and good for my hair is what gives it 4 stars.</li>
      <li>You can comb through it, and it washes out very easily.</li>
      <li>Very pleasant fragrance, and it doesn&#x27;t annoy my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Great product at a very reasonable price point.</li>
      <li>A very mild, light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes which is better</li>
      <li>Buy the Giovanni Styling Glue - it has tons more hold than the \\&quot;wicked texture\\&quot; and it still has the matte finish.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is ok, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and holds really well without flaking.</li>
      <li>so I think I am more safe using this product.</li>
      <li>:fi d:struct and then use this from now on. :)</li>
      <li>I am still wishing someone could identify the ingredient used in so many products that smells like Raid to me.  </li>
      <li>but I like this one better when it comes to ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a year or so and love it.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going for more of a more full and wavy hold, it&#x27;s best to rub and spread a lot of the product in your hands before applying to dry</li>
      <li>appreciate their effort with trying to use more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients and making cruelty free</li>
      <li>easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to rinse off my hands, and doesn&#x27;t clog my drain.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another thing to consider is that this product is fairly easy to wash out (for the people who likes water soluble) and it does get sticky when you emulsify it with your hands.</li>
      <li>Its a bit sticky, but don&#x27;t worry once you put it on it looks fine.</li>
      <li>so it is nice to be able to add it on to an Amazon order when I need a new jar.</li>
      <li>Myakes my hair look super healthy and is great for red hair!</li>
      <li>Not sticky and paraben and sulphate free.  </li>
      <li>It gives fabulous volume, and is not sticky or greasy.</li>
      <li>This was a new one for me, and am very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>American Crew Fiber is amazing - it has fantastic hold, a matte finish, still allows you to change your hair anytime, and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>If you have short straight hair like me, this should work great for you.</li>
      <li>Best hair product since shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is non greasy, washes out with regular shampoo, has oils and botanicals for your hair health, yet doesn&#x27;t make it weighted down (I have fine hair)...</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s VEGAN!</li>
      <li>that it washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling coarse, unlike most styling waxes and pomades that have harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have ever used to smooth by African American natural hair.</li>
      <li>It originally found it when I was looking for an ethically sourced pomade.</li>
      <li>just the right amount of hold - doesn&#x27;t make my hair</li>
      <li>It works just fine on my short hair, and it washes out easily.</li>
      <li>buy the styling glue instead - lasts all day and matches American Crew Fiber in terms of making your hair look awesome - only with natural ingredients!</li>
      <li>Great Product, Small amount.</li>
      <li>consistency is rather viscous and thick, so it&#x27;s best to apply it to my hair when it&#x27;s damp or wet, for easy, even distribution.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it has many not-so-natural ingredients, which is why I wanted to try the Giovanni Wicked Texture Pomade.</li>
      <li>It works ok but doesn&#x27;t hold as well and as firmly as a traditional pomade.</li>
      <li>The product ingredients contain no wax, and now the new name makes that more clear.  </li>
      <li>Love this because there is no heavy smell like many of the other texturizers.  </li>
      <li>It also requires a significant amount more product to achieve the same effect, which is a bummer since it is more expensive per ounce than many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Big fan of this natural (and more important, natural looking) product!</li>
      <li>consistency of the pomade is a little bit more sticky than what I would consider a true pomade, but it works just as well.</li>
      <li>But they did not send me the pure organic product.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely foul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product really does the trick.</li>
      <li>it really is, but its not what I thought I was getting.</li>
      <li>The product works really well.</li>
      <li>The two things I really like about it</li>
      <li>I switched to this and have been much happier.</li>
      <li>Also it is cheaper than in whole foods</li>
      <li>and so I was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemicals and is natural but still provides good hold.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the scent is very strong and I won&#x27;t be able to use this product.</li>
      <li>This product is good in very small amounts for adding shine and grease like texture to hair.</li>
      <li>Not sure what kind of substandard stuff</li>
      <li>Love that this has no shine, and very flexible but firm</li>
      <li>size doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, and might run out quickly for people who use product on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>Very light, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue.</li>
      <li>This is a very clean green product for the enviro person inside of us all.  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;definition of pomade\\&quot; is a state branding statement that it doesn&#x27;t really live up to.</li>
      <li>On the basis of my thick straight Asian hair, I can honestly say that this vegan pomade would not give you hair styles with volume (i.e. quiff, pomp,); however, it can give you a decent slick-down side parts when used on towel-dried hair.</li>
      <li>I previously fell in love with American Crew Fiber.</li>
      <li>It is clear, so not yellowing and holds my style in place.</li>
      <li>I have medium/thick, short, straight hair, and this product gives it some separation, shine, and lift.</li>
      <li>The fact  that it is a natural product makes it</li>
      <li>Giovanni products are fantastic--CVS &amp; Target used to carry in the natural products area- but often hit or miss</li>
      <li>but unfortunately, I&#x27;m really just not liking the texture and don&#x27;t understand why you wouldn&#x27;t just use gel over this, because the end result is very similar.</li>
      <li>I only used this product twice, but both times it created initial texture and definition, but within an hour it had absorbed into my hair and the effect was gone.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it is decent &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Takes about a half hour to harden your hair, and it&#x27;s a mild hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hold up hair or dry very well.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last three months, and it seems to give medium-light hold on dry hair, and light hold on wet hair.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff, but I cannot stand to use it, it makes me sick to my stomach and gives me a headache.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (unless I use too much of it).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product at a very reasonable price point.</li>
    <li> I am going to get my $ back because this is not the product that it should be. Not sure what kind of substandard stuff it really is, but its not what I thought I was getting. I have used this product for 4yrs and I know it! This is not it!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 because it is pretty difficult to find the organic Giovanni wax. But they did not send me the pure organic product. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very light, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue. Has a great hold without being oily. Very pleasant fragrance, and it doesn&#x27;t annoy my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great and holds really well without flaking. I signed up for Prime Monthly delivery.</li>
    <li> This vegan hair styling wax is excellent. I scoop out a finger full, spread a thin layer of it across the palm of my hand, and run it through damp hair before styling with my fingers. There&#x27;s no stiffness (unless you lay it on thick and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for), no frizz all day, and a little goes a long way. I haven&#x27;t used anything else for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: the product appears to sparkle in the jar but this effect does not appear on hair.</li>
    <li> This wax is not even a medium hold at all, but close! I like d:fi d:struct when it comes to hair hold.. but I like this one better when it comes to ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I am a vegan so I think I am more safe using this product. I am going to finish up d:fi d:struct and then use this from now on. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used to smooth by African American natural hair. If you are looking for a product to use to put your hair in a bun, this is it.  The fact  that it is a natural product makes it AAA+</li>
    <li> does the same thing that aveda pomade does, but at a fraction of the price($10 compared to around $25).  does not have the avada smell, but i am a fan of no scent products.  i use this pomade as a &amp;#34;finisher&amp;#34; paired with the Giovanni Styling Glue, Custom Hair modeler, and it gives my hair the shine affect i am looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the vegan aspect of this! It isn&#x27;t as strong as preferred, but the fact that its vegan and good for my hair is what gives it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great hair product for my kid son and this works and holds well. Doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes which is better so my kid wont notice/smell the product on his hair.</li>
    <li> Giovanni products are fantastic--CVS &amp; Target used to carry in the natural products area- but often hit or miss if they&#x27;ll have the pomade&lt;br /&gt;This is the best pomade !!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have natural hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave a white flaky build up on my dark hair.  Not sticky and paraben and sulphate free.  This is a very clean green product for the enviro person inside of us all.  I have this on auto ship!!!! Saves money$$$...Why Not???</li>
    <li> It works ok but doesn&#x27;t hold as well and as firmly as a traditional pomade. It also requires a significant amount more product to achieve the same effect, which is a bummer since it is more expensive per ounce than many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate their effort with trying to use more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients and making cruelty free products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who might not be expecting it - there is glitter mixed in with the pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is ok, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad enough to return, however I won&#x27;t buy it again. The \\&quot;definition of pomade\\&quot; is a state branding statement that it doesn&#x27;t really live up to.</li>
    <li> I guess they reformulated this product but it is no longer called &amp;#34;wicked wax&amp;#34;, now it is called &amp;#34;wicked texture&amp;#34; and according to the Giovanni website, they are the same product.  The product ingredients contain no wax, and now the new name makes that more clear.  However, I was looking for a wax.  I only used this product twice, but both times it created initial texture and definition, but within an hour it had absorbed into my hair and the effect was gone.  It does have a wonderful scent and it is nice that it is water-soluble and will wash out easily, but it just didn&#x27;t hold up.  It&#x27;s mostly oils, so it makes perfect sense that it just absorbed into my hair, but that is why I wanted a wax.  Just know what to expect...if your&#x27;re looking for the effect of a wax, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband. He loved it and looks very handsome using this. smells great and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Small amount. Takes about a half hour to harden your hair, and it&#x27;s a mild hold. It also causes slight flaking (increases possibilities of dandruff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d use this pomade over ANY gel, because of the great ingredients.</li>
    <li> We like it  but it is too small. Giovanni please have bigger size product. Also it is cheaper than in whole foods</li>
    <li> Giovanni is my go to product line.  This was a new one for me, and am very satisfied.  It is clear, so not yellowing and holds my style in place.</li>
    <li> Very interesting styling aid. I have medium/thick, short, straight hair, and this product gives it some separation, shine, and lift. It&#x27;s lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (unless I use too much of it). A very mild, light, pleasant fragrance. It&#x27;s also easy to rinse off my hands, and doesn&#x27;t clog my drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is rather viscous and thick, so it&#x27;s best to apply it to my hair when it&#x27;s damp or wet, for easy, even distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another con is that the 2 oz. size doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, and might run out quickly for people who use product on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is crap.  Hold does not stay, and my hair frizzed up within 1 hour.  I literally used 15% of the container and it still does not hold well.  A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> If you have short straight hair like me, this should work great for you. It gives fabulous volume, and is not sticky or greasy.</li>
    <li> has the texture of gel but lasts like a wax. easy to use.  lasts through the day.  even my boys like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been  using Wicked Wax for a couple of years now. The two things I really like about it are:&lt;br /&gt;1. no noticeable fragrance&lt;br /&gt;2. just the right amount of hold - doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find at stores - I did get it once at Whole Foods - so it is nice to be able to add it on to an Amazon order when I need a new jar.</li>
    <li> The product works really well. The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last long. If you are buying this for the fact that it is organic and adds texture, give OGX Mens Texturizing Paste a try. I switched to this and have been much happier.</li>
    <li> Love this because there is no heavy smell like many of the other texturizers.  You can comb through it, and it washes out very easily.</li>
    <li> This product really does the trick. It originally found it when I was looking for an ethically sourced pomade. This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought it. It works great for me. I enjoy knowing that it there isn&#x27;t a bunch of weird junk in it, and that there aren&#x27;t any concerns with how it is sourced.</li>
    <li> I have fallen for Giovanni products.  I am not sure wht took me so long but work really well with my hair. This is GREAT FOR EDGES.</li>
    <li> For a pomade the hold wasn&#x27;t as good as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, and very importantly, cruelty free. I order this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last three months, and it seems to give medium-light hold on dry hair, and light hold on wet hair. On the basis of my thick straight Asian hair, I can honestly say that this vegan pomade would not give you hair styles with volume (i.e. quiff, pomp,); however, it can give you a decent slick-down side parts when used on towel-dried hair. Another thing to consider is that this product is fairly easy to wash out (for the people who likes water soluble) and it does get sticky when you emulsify it with your hands. Overall, it is decent &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; styling product, with the focus of paraben-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a 50/50, as I can only recommend this if you are green-conscious; otherwise, I would encourage the other half to check out other styling products without petroleum, paraffin, beeswax, mineral oil, and heavy silicones. (Will be trying out Suavecito firme hold)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky with hair products and so I was hesitant to place an online order for a styling wax/pomade that I&#x27;ve never tried before. I am happy to say that Giovanni Wicked Wax pomade is the product I&#x27;ve been searching for. I have thinning short hair and so I was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemicals and is natural but still provides good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the pomade is a little bit more sticky than what I would consider a true pomade, but it works just as well. If you&#x27;re going for a spikey and shiny look, I would suggest applying the product to damp hair. If you&#x27;re going for more of a more full and wavy hold, it&#x27;s best to rub and spread a lot of the product in your hands before applying to dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great that it washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling coarse, unlike most styling waxes and pomades that have harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to mention that it has some sparkly stuff inside... just not very manly when you look closely at it</li>
    <li> I have been using this pomade for a couple of years now, I  have short hair and it controls and leaves it a bit &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; beautiful.  Its a bit sticky, but don&#x27;t worry once you put it on it looks fine.</li>
    <li> The water based pomade that I usually get wasn&#x27;t prime eligible in my time of need so I felt like trying something different. Giovanni Wicked Wax smells nice but unfortunately, I&#x27;m really just not liking the texture and don&#x27;t understand why you wouldn&#x27;t just use gel over this, because the end result is very similar. After fully drying my hair gets hard with this product, which is the main reason I stopped using gel years ago. This doesn&#x27;t seem like wax or pomade...</li>
    <li> Works great and has almost nothing caustic/hazardous inside the product.</li>
    <li> Best hair product since shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is non greasy, washes out with regular shampoo, has oils and botanicals for your hair health, yet doesn&#x27;t make it weighted down (I have fine hair)...awesome combo between a gel and a pomade...PERFECT!</li>
    <li> This product is good in very small amounts for adding shine and grease like texture to hair. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hold up hair or dry very well. It&#x27;s also a little shimmery. If you are seeking a matte finish to your hair. I would suggest you try the Giovanni styling glue. If not look for a reformer . FYI this product is not waxy its goopy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year or so and love it.  It works just fine on my short hair, and it washes out easily.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this pommade sucks. It did not slick down my edges and it also left a residue on my hair. It was a total waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Love that this has no shine, and very flexible but firm hold.  You can reposition throughout the day, and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like anything is in your hair.  Big fan of this natural (and more important, natural looking) product!</li>
    <li> I have type 3B/3c curly hair to my waist and I use this to hold down unruly edges when I press/flat iron my hair and it does the job. But as it&#x27;s wax based it does leave a residue and with my scalp&#x27;s chemistry this translates to oiliness after a few days if I overuse it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping, based on the description &amp;#34;Eco Chic Technology,&amp;#34; that the scent would be subtle and not give me a headache or make my eyes burn.  Unfortunately the scent is very strong and I won&#x27;t be able to use this product.</li>
    <li> Inconsistent quality. My recent order was a little bit softer than it&#x27;s supposed to be. Thus making it harder to style my hair</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, but I cannot stand to use it, it makes me sick to my stomach and gives me a headache.  I am still wishing someone could identify the ingredient used in so many products that smells like Raid to me.  It is absolutely foul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely out of options now, there is not a single hair product that works the way I want without a perfume or bug spray smell, both of which make me physically ill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short-medium long hair. I previously fell in love with American Crew Fiber. American Crew Fiber is amazing - it has fantastic hold, a matte finish, still allows you to change your hair anytime, and washes out easily. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it has many not-so-natural ingredients, which is why I wanted to try the Giovanni Wicked Texture Pomade. I also bought \\&quot;Giovanni styling glue\\&quot; because I couldn&#x27;t make up my mind. Buy the Giovanni Styling Glue - it has tons more hold than the \\&quot;wicked texture\\&quot; and it still has the matte finish. Do not buy this (your hairstyle will collapse/change within 30 minutes) buy the styling glue instead - lasts all day and matches American Crew Fiber in terms of making your hair look awesome - only with natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> I suggested this to a friend and told her it would hold a bucking mule down.  I like this stuff for fly aways and nice sleek ponytails.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> First, it&#x27;s VEGAN! Yay for not having animal products in my hair (which is so weird to start with)! Myakes my hair look super healthy and is great for red hair!</li>
