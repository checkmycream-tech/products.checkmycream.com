      <li>to warm up shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot about barber shops using warm shaving cream and wanted to try it out for myself.  </li>

      <li>Can and does provide good usage, but could be better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The ring on this wouldn&#x27;t hold a can of shave cream, I had to unscrew the ring on my old unit and swap them to get it to work.  The most disheartening thing was finding the $6 Goodwill price tag on the box, and feeling I&#x27;d been ripped off.  Amazon should check their suppliers better.</li>
    <li> This product just simply didn&#x27;t work. Regular shaving cream cans don&#x27;t fit properly. I can see why these are \\&quot;not available in your local store\\&quot;! I also think it&#x27;s way over-priced for what it is and what it &#x27;s SUPPOSED to do.</li>
    <li> The instructions are clear enough. Remove the cap, line up the can&#x27;s nozzle with the receptacle on the dispenser, slide the gel selector, depress the lock, and insert the can. After that was done, the dispenser wouldn&#x27;t stop shooting shaving cream all over my counter. I tried this several times, each time, re-reading the instructions, and still the shaving cream would shoot out of the warmer in a steady stream of wasted shaving cream. It wasted two whole cans of shaving cream (different brands) before I gave up. Is a pulse the only qualification to be an engineer for Conair? What a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I bought this great device because I shower at night after my workouts, but shave in the morning. Shaving with cold water is not very fun, but the way our house is built it takes a while for hot water to get to the bathroom. I hated wasting a few minutes and several gallons of water every morning just to shave.    I was amazed what a great shave I got with the lather machine. Even using cold water, I got a fast, comfortable shave. On the mornings I showered first, it was even better. My wife was impressed with how smooth my face was.    I agree with other reviewers that the gel could be warmer, but in our sue-happy society I can understand why that couldn&#x27;t happen. It was warm enough to do the job well and it felt great.    I was slightly nervous about putting this thing together due to all the comments, but was surprised how easy it actually was. The instructions weren&#x27;t very clear, and the illustrations were tiny. Apparently most manufacturers haven&#x27;t figured out the population is getting older, and tiny little pictures just don&#x27;t cut it anymore.</li>
    <li> I love the luxurious feeling of shaving with hot lather.  It seems to work a little better with gel than lather.</li>
    <li> This brand was good years ago but as a new one is needed they do not last near as long and are not worth the money</li>
    <li> For me this product was definitely worth the $16.  I&#x27;ve read the reviews that are critical of this product and yes, it isn&#x27;t perfect but for the price it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  It doesn&#x27;t get the gel just boiling hot or anything but it definitely warms it up enough to provide a great alternative to bracing your face with icy gel each winter morning.  That&#x27;s all I expected it to do and it does that well.  Remember, we&#x27;re talking about $16...  I found it easy to load, clean and it is a nice, neat package and it makes the counter seem less cluttered than having a can of shaving gel sitting there.</li>
    <li> The lather machine did arrive in a timely manner, however this thing was one incredible pile of garbage. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be great, but at least be functional for a year. Well it only worked for about a week. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this thing!</li>
    <li> This is the second unit purchased, the first one didn&#x27;t have any heat controls, and this latest unit does,Model HGL2, but the lather becomes too thin, and continues to drip at the nozzle leaving a mess each time. I do shake the can before each shave. &lt;br /&gt;I tried gel, and that was just a big mess, the can kept hoozing out gel and got it all over the place, what a mess. Sorry, but they need to make a special gel or lather just for that machine. &lt;br /&gt;Over the counter gels and lathers just don&#x27;t work well with this invention. Not worth all the trouble for a little heat.</li>
    <li> It is a great item and the shipping was really fast, would buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> This product is useless ! The gel does not get hot enough , it comes out as some form of toxic goo and it smells like burnt cheese . I used it for a week and then tossed it in the garbage . $20 WASTED.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my father.  According to him, it works great and he really enjoys it.</li>
    <li> Having hot lather has made a big difference!  He has a very heavy beard and this machine has saved some sanity around here!</li>
    <li> used this product once and it stopped putting out cream. had one before that lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This Hot Gel/Lather machine is wonderful.  I had had one like it before and used it until it would not work anymore.  Great way to get your day started.  I love the way it can use the regular size cans of shaving cream or the larger cans.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Conair&#x27;s combination hot gel/lather machine and would recommend it to any one who shaves with an aerosol shaving cream. The one I purchased from Amazon is a replacement as I found out, that Conair is not making any hot lather machines anymore. This  disappoints me greatly, as I have gotten use to getting a nice smooth shave from the warm lather.     I&#x27;m hoping that Conair will reconsider producing this product in the near future.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Gets the lather nice and warm.  Simple controls.  Tricky getting shave cream can initially installed, but doable.</li>
    <li> My son loves his hot lather machine. Thank you Amazon for you saved the day because I could not find this any where.</li>
    <li> attaching the canister to the heating unit is a monumental task i could not do it at all and especially because i am disabled with use of only 1 hand. attaching the canister is the only complaint i have about this product it is impossible for someone like me to do it i also had each of ,y 2 brothers try and they had the same problem,...perfectly able bodied guys couldnt get the cannister attached...should be simple:depress locking feature,innsert canister,release locking mechanism and bobs your uncle! nope...not quite...on the side of the thing it looks simple but me nor either of my brothers have gotten it attached correctly...we can get it attached ,however, it is crooked everytime (and it must be straight for it to work properly). this product is useless if you cant get the canister of gel attached...i feel totally ripped off!</li>
    <li> I really like this item. The only things that kept me from giving it 5 stars: 1.Shaving can does not lock completely 360 degrees, 0nly 180 degrees. 2. I have not been able to switch all the way to Gel without having the can disconnect; only half way for 2/3 gel, 1/3 lather. 3. The same thing happens when I use the \\&quot;PUSH\\&quot; button. 4. Lather will not get hot continuously when I push the black dispense button. I must wait a short time and push again. It helps a little if I turn on the machine before I get into the shower so that I can shave afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these things, I can live with how it works for what my major need is.</li>
    <li> Works great really impressed feels just like your in the old time barbers chair  thanks to one of the other reviews the tip on shaking it up first was a big tip</li>
    <li> After one use I am returning this to the store. I shave with lather and discovered that the heat provided by this unit degrades the lather. I actually had to use twice as much lather to get the same coverage as lather straight from the can.     I had the unit set to it&#x27;s highest heat setting. The lather was luke warm at best and by the time I applied it to my face, it was as cold as it would have been straight from the can. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> First off I this makes the second unit I bought (gift for a friend) and he loves it as well.  I have read other reviews and this is just mine in regards to others and my experience.  This item is a convenience based product and should be seen as so.  For the price you get more than you bargain for, as it heats up your shaving foam or gel for a smooth shave as well as conditioning the skin.  I have read where some have complained about the heat not being high enough.  We live in a lawsuit culture here in the U.S. and the heat level being too high or not marked to show how much heat would cause legal liability on the company, which I am sure they considered, so that is the heat issue.  The non allowance of using Nivea shaving gel is a downer (never used it myself) but heard great things; however, with all products there are shortfalls, but at least Conair took the liberty to clearly state this on the box to inform you-the consumer that you may make the choice for yourself.  In all this is a great product as you can get part of that professional barber/salon facial care for shaving that can go anywhere with you.  If the heat is not hot enough or the issue of being informed that your favored gel can not be used then be glad you do not have to buy, but can find another product that suits your satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Product is ok. The shaving cream can is hard to get in place. Directions don&#x27;t help much. I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again. However, the seller was fantastic!! Arrived in just a few days!! :)</li>
    <li> This will not handle shaving gel. I saw reviews stating the (gel)stuff shoots all ove the place.  Now I now why.  Regular cheap shaving cream works better and is clearly what this was designed for.  The gel application was a retro fit which was not thought through.  I see why some say even the shaving cream application comes out flat and runny.  You have to pick up the unit and remember to shake it, like you do when using a can of shaving cream.  Seems kind of awkward shaking that whole unit around...  Overall barely worth the price as a novelty/toy.  It does give warm to almost hot cream to your face.  Look at it as a toy and not a serious product.</li>
    <li> When I was  young, the barbers (not stylists) would use a warm shaving foam to clean up around my neck. That hot lather felt great and left my skin feeling clean and smooth. When I saw the Conair dispenser, I had to have one. Out of the box I was disappointed. Most cans of foam do not fit inside the base. As others have said, that seems a pretty basic engineering characteristic to build into a product like this one. Still -- you don&#x27;t really need the base -- the can of foam is attached directly to the dispenser head, which does all the work. I tried four different brands of foam and two brands of gel before giving up -- both the foam and the gel come out of the nozzle in a trickle -- I had to stand there for a full minute before I had enough foam for a shave. By that time, the foam in my hand was already cooling. As I started to shave, I noticed additional foam continued to dribble out of the dispenser nozzle onto my counter. I got into the habit of just reaching over and grabbing the surplus on a finger and holding it under the running water -- had to do that several times each time I shaved.  I noticed among other reviews that only one other buyer complained about the lack of flow or annoyingly slow flow -- so maybe that&#x27;s an anomaly. I&#x27;m not likely to find out.  Someone is going to develop a hot shaving foam dispenser that works, and the word will get out, and it will be a good seller.   This isn&#x27;t it . . .</li>
    <li> Had this 3 months, i feel like you need to take a course to learn to operate this thing. after all the misery, it broke, heater is fine but it seems as if it&#x27;s clogged. i recently switched to lathering up with shaving soap and a good ol badger brush, gives you the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> I have owned several different versions of this product &amp; this is the best one I have owned the lather is as warm as you like with-in the safety limits. I use gel but the machine can use either. I would recommend anyone looking for a shaving cream warmer to buy this machine. the ship it to you with-in 1 week. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> A HUGE con: at the moment when I bought it the product page stated that the item is compatible with most cream/gel cans, but it&#x27;s not compatible with Nivea brand ones (which is stated on the box, by the way). Nivea isn&#x27;t such a minor brand (and is the one I used to use all the time) that it&#x27;s not worth even mentioning it in the description, especially given it is mentioned on the packaging! So I had to switch to a different brand, which I&#x27;m not very pleased with. Also the gel (I didn&#x27;t try to use it with foam though) cools too quickly after I put it on my face, so it doesn&#x27;t do the job of warming up my skin at all.    I consider it pretty much a waste of my money.    In addition, I saw this product in a local discount store for half the price the other day. I believe I bought it for $15 on 08/19/10 and now its price on Amazon is about $13.</li>
    <li> If looking at this product conjures up images of getting a hot shave at the barber, then I&#x27;m afraid this product may never live up to those expectations.  Like many others, I really wanted to like this product, but it simply has too many issues to be rated any higher than \\&quot;meh.\\&quot;  Out of the box, it looks pretty simple.  You get the base/stand, the top heating mechanism, and a choice of two nozzles (one for foam and another for gel) that attach to the top heating mechanism, depending on what you&#x27;re using.  I tried using both foam (Barbasol) and gel (Edge) for comparison.  Both of these cans were compatible, but I can foresee other brands not working unless they have a metal \\&quot;ring\\&quot; under the plastic cap that attaches to the top heating mechanism (see step 3, below).  I found the assembly to not be that bad, but it was a bit more time consuming and complicated than I expected (which is why I&#x27;ve outlined the numerous steps below):  1) First, you have to attach the nozzle you want (foam or gel) to the top heating mechanism.  Easy.  2) Second, you have to remove the plastic cap from the can of shaving foam/gel to expose the little nozzle.  I did this very easily with my hand with the Barbasol, and using the included \\&quot;key\\&quot; on the bottom of the stand for the Edge gel -- again, easy, but if your hand slips, bring out the band-aids.  3) Third, you then place the nozzle into a hole in the underside of the top heating mechanism while simultaneously pushing a button on it.  Once the nozzle is seated, you release the button and the top heating mechanism should grasp the \\&quot;ring\\&quot; on the can.  I&#x27;ll admit, this took a few tries to get it right, but once you know what to do, it&#x27;s easy to do again.  4) Fourth, place the top heating mechanism, with the can of shave foam/gel, onto the stand, and twist to lock.  Easy, but don&#x27;t push too hard or the stand may break.  5) Fifth, if you&#x27;re using shave gel, you have to depress the big button on the top of the heating mechanism while simultaneously sliding another little toggle over to the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; setting.  This \\&quot;locks\\&quot; in the shave gel, but is a bit finicky.  6) Sixth, you have to set the temperature control dial to the desired heat (there is a guide on the top heating mechanism that tells you how hot you can set foam and gel, respectively.  Easy.  7) Seventh, plug it in and turn it on.  Easy.  8) Eighth, wait two or three minutes for it to heat up (it has a light that flashes while it is heating, and stays on when ready).  Easy, if you&#x27;re patient.  9) Ninth, when heated up, depress the big button on the top of the heating mechanism to release foam, or the small button on the gel nozzle to release gel.  Easy, but watch out for steam.  Now for the results.  The gel comes out in a semi-lather form (not in a clear or colored gel form like when you use it straight out of the can), and is relatively warm.  The foam was trickier to get right -- set the temperature too high or leave it heated for too long and it comes out as more of a liquid. But, if you set the temperature too low, you just get regular old foam that&#x27;s only mildly warm.  In both cases, unfortunately by the time you apply it to your face, get enough coverage, then begin to shave, the temperature is pretty much the same as if you applied it straight out of the can.  I&#x27;m sure some will argue that warm cream applied to the face improves the quality of the shave, but I really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I don&#x27;t think most people would.  When you&#x27;re done with your underwhelming shave, you hit the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button and unplug it, but then the whole contraption just sits there on the counter taking up space.  I haven&#x27;t bothered to try to clean it (as bits of foam or gel tend to linger around the nozzle after use), but I&#x27;m sure after a while it might get a bit gummed up if you don&#x27;t take care of it.  When you combine the average results with a product that was a bit cumbersome to set up and just purely takes up too much room on the counter, it just doesn&#x27;t makemuch sense to buy it.  I have such a problem beard that I really wanted to like this thing, but can&#x27;t.  At the end of the day, it&#x27;s just easier to use a foam or gel straight out of the can.  I probably won&#x27;t return it or get rid of it, but maybe I can get it to dispense hot coffee while shaving instead.</li>
    <li> IT was fine to use, but it is top heavy once you get teh shaving cream can attached to the top and fell down several times until I finally just threw it away.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these units, and both broke within a few months ... the shaving cream stops coming through the heating unit ... tried numerous cans of shaving cream, even took one of the units apart to see if it could be cleaned out.  Looks like the &#x27;release&#x27; mechanism is either poorly designed, or fails w. use.  Great idea ... but needs more design work. Probably better to just heat the whole can w. a low wattage heater. ...</li>
    <li> I owned a similar type unit 20+ years ago that worked very well, unfortunately the modern versions just don&#x27;t perform well. Once you follow the installation instructions (which require you to be rather mechanically inclined) the results are a disappointing luke-warm lather. Even on the highest heat setting the lather doesn&#x27;t reach a high enough temperature and cools significantly just in the time to spread it on your face. Save your money!</li>
    <li> This product is very useful. However, the lather could be a little warmer when it comes out.</li>
    <li> ...I ordered this for my husband and it can be messy. It tends to flow out and you always have mess on the front. If after about an hr after use you wipe it, it will stop oozing. It warms quickly and my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. Also delivery was prompt and the unit works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this for Father&#x27;s Day after observing me dipping my shaving gel in the warm water for a few seconds and asking me why.  It&#x27;s one of those things I would feel weird buying for myself, but am very glad I received as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attaching a new can was not push-button simple, but wasn&#x27;t any more complicated than I expected either.  It warmed up much faster than I expected, and feels great on my face.  Combined with my [[ASIN:B0009W7MG4 Gillette M3 Power Razor]], it&#x27;s the closest, most comfortable shave I remember ever getting.  Rinsing off after shaving this morning, my hands actually squeaked against the skin of my face.  Doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One of the biggest problems with getting a decent shave is temperature.  If your skin is too cool, whiskers retract and resist your blade.  This product should provide a solution, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the consumer must provide their own can of lather or gel.  It should be noted here that I had to change my preferred brand of shaving gel to use this product, as the configuration of a Nivea can is not compatible.  And while a \\&quot;key\\&quot; -- basically, a small flat-bladed screwdriver -- is provided to assist with removing/prying-off the plastic top of a metal can, the removal is still rather tricky.  A little recklessness could send that \\&quot;key\\&quot; into your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the installation method for my device differed from the instructions included in the box.  However, there were alternate instructions printed on a large, permanently-attached label on the back of the cylindrical base.  By squinting at these difficult to see photos, I was able to lock an altered can of Gilette Fusion into place.  There was some amount of mess, as you must line up the small tube atop the can with a hole at the base of the actual heating unit.  Again, carelessness could result in a lot of wasted gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about three minutes for the unit to heat the gel, but if the gel is not dispensed very soon, the product will turn off and return the gel to room temperature in minutes.  This is a safety feature, I know, but it would be handy to have a bit more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the gel is heated, the temperature (even at the highest setting) is little more than what one might have by running warm water over the can itself.  As a result, the gel cools soon after hitting the skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to activate the whiskers at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if you wanted to change gels?  There is no obvious way to clean the product, to remove the traces of previous gels.  Over time, I can only imagine the \\&quot;plumbing\\&quot; of the machine becoming more and more gummed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, this is a product that I wanted to like, but I just couldn&#x27;t.  A little more R&amp;D, a little more testing, maybe the next generation model will be better.d up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So basically, this is a product that I wanted to like, but I just couldn&#x27;t.  A little more R&amp;D, a little more testing, maybe the next generation model will be better.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, but this product did not work as promised. The black canister does not hold any type or brand of Lather can, only Gel type cans. I did call the customer service number and asked why this is, and  the rep told me that it is a Type - O on the package. In order to use with a Lather can, you just put the device on the top of the can and use as is. The older Model product did fit the lather type cans, but this one does not. Sorry but if you are going to use this with a lather can, you might want to get the older White Model. The product looks starange when you cant use the Black canister as pictured.</li>
    <li> I have the toughest beard known to mankind but this CONAIR product heats up the lather I normally use to soften my beard and produce the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever experienced.  Assembly is just the least bit tricky but the results are pure heaven.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream/gel warmer as a Christmas gift for my husband and he really likes it. The quality is good. It really works.</li>
    <li> I used to have Conair&#x27;s older model of this machine, but it was lost in moving, and I was hoping to replace it with this newer version.  This disappointment is no replacement. Yes, the space shuttle-looking controls and switches give it a more modern overall look, but the device&#x27;s main function is sorely lacking. Besides, who cares how the controls look if they&#x27;re completely non-functional? The dispensed lather is far from hot -- it&#x27;s barely warm, maybe a few degrees over room temperature. Even then, that tiny degree of warming is lost less than a second (literally) after pushing the \\&quot;Dispense\\&quot; button. Anything that comes out after that is no more heated than it would be if you had just taken the can off your medicine cabinet shelf. Turning the temperature switch higher or lower makes no difference whatsoever; neither does giving the unit more time to get the lather hotter. You can wait all day, it&#x27;s just not going to happen.  The company warns in the instructions that you should be careful of a possible burst of hot steam that might precede the actual foam. Not to worry - at this lukewarm temperature, it&#x27;s safe.  The older version of this dispenser was far superior. It&#x27;s still around, here at Amazon and on e-bay. Find it. Buy it. Give this one a miss.</li>
    <li> Have not yet had it that long but set up is not that complicated. So far I tried it with a gel and it warmed up somewhat, but I did not really give it a chance to heat up. I think it will work better with a foam shaving cream</li>
    <li> Paid $13.28 for this item and feel I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.  The gel nozzle began to dispense more and more slowly as days passed.  Finally, it got so slow it become unusable.  Tried to clean the passage (the head is NOT submersible) but still couldn&#x27;t restore the flow of gel.</li>
    <li> Best thing invented next to the barber with hot towels and a straight razor, helps with a clean hot shave, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a refreshing clean and hot shave.</li>
    <li> I had an old con air shaving cream warmer that I used for years. It finally played out and I ordered a new one. In fact I got two of them; one for home- the other for my weekend home. Neither one of them work effectively. They don&#x27;t warm the shaving cream any more than if I ran some hot water over the can. One of them is stopped up and the cream will barely come out. This product is not worth buying.[[ASIN:B000BD4T94 Conair HGL1 Combination Hot Gel/Lather Machine, Black]]</li>
    <li> I bought this great gift for my husband.  Each morning I enjoy listening to the feeling that a hot lather shave gives him.  This is an awesome gift idea for the special man in your life.</li>
    <li> on the first try it blew up an entire can of shave gel  What a disappointment.  I really wanted this for my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Hi I bought this for my Husband, for Christmas. He has not received it yet, he will on Christmas day. I was wondering, what is the best shaving cream or gel to use with this product? Thank you!</li>
    <li> The Conair HGL1 Combination Hot Gel/Lather Machine has made my shaves much more enjoyable. This product easily accepts my large, bonus can of Edge Gel with no fuss. The machine heats up the gel quickly and it feels GREAT when it hits my face. My shaves are closer now too. I waited until I had to change cans before writing and it was no trouble. I really like being able to have a hot shave without having to switch to a foamy shaving cream. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would recommend it to any guy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He had brain surgery, radiation and lost most of his hair. This product allows him to shave his head in warm, soothing, comfort. Even if your size can won&#x27;t fit, the top will attach to only size can. He loves it!</li>
    <li> It broke after only 8 months of light use.  A seal broke and when you would press the button, foam would shoot out of pretty much every seam except the nozzle.  I wasn&#x27;t able to fix it.  During the 8 months it worked, I felt the foam was kind of warm but certainly not warm enough.  Plus not enough foam gets heated.  Usually the last 20% that I put on didn&#x27;t get heated at all.  Also, most of the foam cans that I bought wouldn&#x27;t fit inside the plastic sheath so I just had the heating unit sitting on top of the can.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Used  old Conair lather machine for years.  Will always use your product.  Bought one for son.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it (no pun), this is not a high tech product, but a simple device that warms up a can of shaving cream.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about three to four years, and it&#x27;s worked fine.  I use regular shaving cream, and have not had any problems connecting a can of Gillette Foamy or Barbasol to the unit.  I&#x27;ve also found that using this device eliminates the amount of residual cream in the can when the aerosol runs out (guess that means I&#x27;ve gotten one free can of cream over the time I&#x27;ve used this, but worth noting).    Early on, I learned that you need to shake the unit (like you would a can of cream)before using so as not to get a handful of warm cream soup when you&#x27;re ready to shave.  This is a bit cumbersome given the dimensions and weight of the unit, but makes the final result much better.  I can&#x27;t help but wonder if many of the poor reviews reflect this logistical problem, but I don&#x27;t know how to get around it other than shaking it before plugging it in.    I&#x27;ve also noted that many reviewers have complained as to how much this actually \\&quot;warms\\&quot; the shaving cream.  It&#x27;s not hot, I&#x27;ll grant you, but it&#x27;s certainly much warmer than the cream straight out of the can.  To that end, given that we&#x27;re talking about a $15-20 device that heats up $1-2 cans of shaving cream, I&#x27;m not sure I want something that can make a really hot bunch of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great product - love the fact that you can use both gel and lather; it heats in no time and the shave is perfect!  A must have for any man in your life.  Two men in our household and we love it!  I even ordered a second for a gift.  AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my husband and I was extremely disappointed.  It is poorly made and basically is not worth the money.  I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband as a birthday gift, and it works VERY well in heating up gel to whatever temp you like.  The highest setting can get very hot if left on too long, but within 1 min - 1 min 30 sec the gel is perfect temp for the face.  My husband likes that the lather is warm before it touches his face in the morning, and it helps a bit in shaving as well.    &lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve used this product myself (on my legs) and LOVED the way the gel lather felt on my skin.  It&#x27;s wonderful to have it heated up instead of cold, and it does help in shaving.  At this price, it&#x27;s a great gift!  (One small complaint is that it is pretty large and will look out of place and kind of unsightly on your bathroom counter.)</li>
    <li> Very stylish in Euro Black. Works quite well, love the adjustable settings. Works well with gel or lather. It&#x27;s still new, hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It heats so much better than the last one we had. Its great all the way around. The shipping was really fast I thought too. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I used it a few times, but never found the extra time and effort worth the payout</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one I&#x27;d had for several years. The new one has a base which won&#x27;t acomodate Barbasol. Fortunately, the old base fits the new heating unit. New one doesn&#x27;t seem to heat as hot.</li>
    <li> I gave my husband the Conair Lather machine and he loves it.  It works with either gel or foam shaving creams and warms the lather making his shaving experience enjoyable.  I was unsure if it would be a good gift but he has raved about it every time he shaves.  I would recommend this product.  The item arrived on time, and there were no problems with the purchase.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like about hot shaving cream rubbed into your beard? With this bizarre contraption from Conair... plenty.     Firstly, what should frighten you away from purchasing this is that it has six controls on top of the damned thing. Six controls to do what one or two should do. Believe your eyes, because it only gets worse! Secondly, what you can&#x27;t see, is a set of instructions that are so overwrought, and so edged out by disclaimers denying legal responsibility, that none of them are helpful. Thirdly, if you think the visible portion of the device is poor, wait till you see how you insert the can. Again the instructions (found in three different places) might as well be written in a different language for how poorly they describe the process of attaching a can of shaving cream. You pry the head off a can of shaving cream, you insert the bare nozzle, into the head and close an almost razor sharp collar around it. I guarantee you you wlll do it wrong and fill the collar with shaving cream. What could be more natural than sticking you finger into the cap to remove the excess lather that is now in the way? Well if you value your fingers, don&#x27;t do it. Because wiggling your finger around too vigorously, is when you find out that the collar is rather sharp: ninetey percent chance you injure yourself.     Quantity of Foam per Button Press: If you succesfully overcome this device and get it to dispense, the gel nozzle produces an unsatisfying squirt-gun stream of hot shaving cream. The device can only heat up cream that has left the can and is in the Conair cap; a miniscule amount. An LED flashes at you to tell you that the tablespoon of shaving cream in your hand is all that you get until it can heat some more. That&#x27;s good for five more minutes. If you leave the device plugged in, you are warned it&#x27;s still a bathroom electrocution hazard (even if it&#x27;s turned off!). The device makes your can top-heavy so Conair provides an enormous sleeve to put it in, and one imagines, to prevent the now electrified can from toppling into your sink, tub or toilet. Your reasonably sized can of shaving cream and is now the size of a quart of milk.     No wonder this thing only appears in stores around Christmas. Every choice this design makes is a dud, compounding problem after problem.</li>
    <li> To get hot lather, which is nice, you first have to get the device installed on top the can.  I would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated.  The directions provided are sparse in several languages.  First you have to pry the top off the can of shaving cream.  They provide a pry tool for that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream better than others.  Then you have to fit the device on top the can.  It worked well with one brand in a large size can.  When I tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half the can during the installation process.  Using a different brand in a large can, I had trouble prying the top off the can.  If you have time and patience, and are willing to spend some money on various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well, give it a try.  Otherwise, be forewarned it may lead to frustration and bad language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if companies intending to sell products in the US (apparently manufactured somewhere in Asia) would provide a clear set of instuctions in English, in reasonable large readable type, with illustrations.  In this case, they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for.  I do not need instructions in foreign languages, and get tired of limited instructions in six languages.</li>
    <li> I really like my hot lather dispenser.  I don&#x27;t understand why the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this item because it is great and made by a very reputable company.    In my opinion this would make a great inexpensive thoughtful Christmas present.  (Thanks, but I already have one but money I can always use. :) )</li>
    <li> Its not perfect  about every other one you buy works the way its supposed to but for the price its worth throwing one or two away. If it works it tends to last about two years</li>
    <li> I use this product to apply gel to my face before I shave with a razor blade every morning. That is all</li>
    <li> My husband loves this little luxury item which I purchased in December of 2012.  Easy to use and to change out cans of shave cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent for that nice hot shave!  My son &amp; husband both love it.  Convenient &amp; easy to use with any shaving cream</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace an older Conair hot lather machine that finally quit.    This newer version (HGL1) simply doesn&#x27;t get the lather hot.    Seek out the older version (Conair HLM10)and buy that instead. It is a few dollars more, but does a better job.     I&#x27;m tossing my newer version and replacing it with one of the older ones. Too bad for me....money wasted!    [[ASIN:B000GRXCBG CONAIR CORP PERS CARE #HLM10 Hot Lather Machine]]</li>
    <li> I had the original lather machine ( which I used Gel shaving cream ) and had no problem.  I have been thru three tall cans of Edge Gel and still can not get this piece of junk to work.  For one thing the leaflet instructions do not match the instruction on the black tube that holds the can if you ever get it work. It has a press button that has no use at all.  Really, it is just too hard to get the shaving cream attached to the top unit.  And when you try and it slips off, well when you take the top unit off to try again, it spills gel from every hole on the unit and even from the gel can itself.  I really did go thru three cans on gel trying to get it right.  And when I finally did get a can to stay on and the unit would no longer release gel indicating that the can was empty, well no there is still many shaves left in the can! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!   UPDATE UPDATE 05/03/10  After 4 months of trying to get this thing to work, it landed in the garbage can today.  It stop heating, and when I pluged it in the on light came on  by itself.  And it started to blink, and it blinked and it blinked and it blinked.  In between the blinking, I used another can of gel and my tap water (which gets hotter than this thing) and I shaved and washed my face and put everything away and so I checked, it blinked and it blinked.  So out of curiosity I pushed the button and yes it was still cold and still blinking.  After that I unpluged it and tossed it in the garbage.  Now I understand that some people say this works like a charm.  The only one that worked like a charm for me was the original version that was one piece that attached to the top of the can with no bells and whistles, it lasted me for years. Some things are just better the way they are.  FYI you can no longer find this on Conair Store web site, hmmm, maybe they got the message. But not to worry there at plenty on eBay...lol</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon/Macy&#x27;s last week. It didn&#x27;t heat up regular lather adequately.  I then tried using gel. What a joke. As soon as I inserted the gel can the gel kept leaking out and out and out.  I then find I can&#x27;t return it to Macy&#x27;s because I bought it from Amazon and if I use return shipping form it will cost me $6.95.  I threw the darned thing in the trash.  A truly bad experience.  I am out almost $30 and have lost some  faith in internet shopping.  You should be able to return an item and not have to pay $7 for the privilege.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s crap don&#x27;t buy it it really! I did get a full refund from the company, but that was the only good thing about it.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for a friend. had to try it out for myself to make sure it worked. read mixed review. a month later hes still loving it.  i recommend using lather than gel. lather stays warm even after applied to face. were both in the military and we have to shave every day so this machine is worth its weight in gold. i ordered a second one as a gift and im going to order a third one for myself! amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and it didn&#x27;t work with his regular foaming cream. It seems to work ok with the gel but still doesn&#x27;t get as warm as I expected.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He really loves it. The foam is warm and the adjustable temperature control makes it so he can ge the exact temp he is comfortable with.  He has not tried it with gel yet.  It can be used with both, and with any size can, so you can buy the cheap big cans of foam on sale, and they still work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem we had was that the foam can did not fit inside the black sleeve. I am guessing that the sleeve would only fit the gel cans, but I don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t make it to fit either. I would like for him to leave it out on the counter, and have the can cleverly hidden by the black sleeve, but if he uses foam, the sleeve is not useable. He doesn&#x27;t really care, and it&#x27;s just a woman thing to worry about asthetics, but if they make another model in the future, maybe they can make it please both sexes...smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The looks of the thing are not the most important to us, and the practicality of the device is more so, so that&#x27;s why this product still gets a 5-star rating from me.  My husband loves it, and uses it every day!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart just before Xmas. It is junk and not worth $20. It is easy to use and fits most gel and foam cans (not Nivea or the standard foam cans). If you ever went trick or treating as a teenager (you know what I mean) then you can certainly pop the top off the can and put this together. The problems with this thing is: &lt;br /&gt;1) The gel does not get warm enough even at its highest setting. &lt;br /&gt;2) It cools off to room temp as soon as you get it to your face. &lt;br /&gt;If you do not want clutter on your counter then you have to put it away after each use. &lt;br /&gt;3) It recommends that you unplug it after and between uses. &lt;br /&gt;4) Very hard to clean.  &lt;br /&gt;This would work great if you could dispense it from the can right onto your face. If you want a warm and great shave, then spend $5 and get a fog free mirror and shave in the shower. If you like to blow money and throwing $20 away is your thing then get this.</li>
    <li> Thought this would get hotter than it does. Hubby had hoped so too. Can and does provide good usage, but could be better. Overall ok.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a christmas present and was anxious to try it out. Major disappointment when my Nivea gel wasn&#x27;t capatable. Of course there&#x27;s no recommendations in the packaging as for what brands work. Went to the store just to get a regular can of shaving cream. Snapped the can in place and it emptied the most of it before I could figure out what was wrong. Now the inside of the dispensor and where it connects is all covered in shaving cream. I couldn&#x27;t really rinse it out because there&#x27;s a heating element and risk of electrical shock. Tried a couple more times...ended up throwing it across the room and yelled a little. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my brother-in-law and he loves it. He says it works great and is easy to use. I felt I got a good deal and I&#x27;m pleased he enjoys using it.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH IT !  IF MY HOT LATHER MACHINE BROKE TODAY, I WOULDN&#x27;T REPLACE IT.  I SHOULD OF BELIEVED ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT SAID IT WASN&#x27;T WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Conair hot lather machine and it worked fine, until it \\&quot;gave up the ghost\\&quot;.  The new one heats lather so poorly that you can&#x27;t hardly tell that it has warmed the shave cream at all.  On top of that, I was supposed to receive removable tips for both lather and gel and got two for lather only.  I am quite disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Will take cans of shaving cream and gel. Heats the lather nicely which makes a real treat. Very sturdy product, purchase with no worries.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and used it with shave gel.  It worked good, heated to a good temperature, but not exactly hot.  But I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the gel when it was heated.  I bought shave lather and when trying to use it the lather comes out all over the unit.  I reseated the lather container several times and each time it just flow out every open space.  I have since thrown it away.  I will try one of the other models and see if I have better luck.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who use to run hot water for 10 min. to warm up shaving cream.  We looked in every store around and could not find warmer, finally found on Amazon. Boyfriend LOVES it and I&#x27;m glad not to here water running in morning</li>
    <li> THE UNIT NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY FROM DAY 1 HAD A UNIT BEFORE THIS 1 AND HAD NO PROBLEMS IT JUST BURNED OUT SO WANTED TO GET A NEW 1 AND NOT VERY HAPPY IT IS JUST TAKING UP SPACE IN MY CABINET .</li>
    <li> After trying both the gel and the regular shave creams, the gel does not work as well. The main thing with the cream is to shake before every use.  I have had it for a few years now and really like it in the winter.</li>
    <li> Make that description &amp;#34;Warm lather&amp;#34;.  Does not get hot.</li>
    <li> It does not heat the gel very well and you use a lot more product than you otherwise would. I would return it if not so much time has passed since i have had it. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T HEAT THE SHAVING CREAM HOT ENOUGH SINCE I&#x27;VE HAD IT AND IT&#x27;S ALMOST 3 YRS OLD.</li>
    <li> For over thirty years I have been using the Hot Gel/Lather Machines.  This is my third one of this type and I expect it to last about eight to ten years.  At that time I hope they are still available so I can purchase another.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT HEAT THE SHAVING CREAM THE WAY THE PRODUCT WAS ADVERTISED. VERY DISSAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO LET AMAZON KNOW ABOUT IT.</li>
    <li> he uses this everyday , i searched everywhere for this item, then decided to check amazon and YES , ya&#x27;ll came through for me..works great!</li>
    <li> My husband loves these little machines, and they are getting difficult to find.  Eventually, however, they do clog up and stop operating.  As long as they continue to work, they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> This product was the right price.  I really like the old prior model I had before this one because the lather was a lot hotter but this one works.</li>
    <li> works very well and helps the razor perform with an ease that I must brag about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the best razor and now the best cream dispenser</li>
    <li> my husband loves a hot shave, and this product works as advertised...it is easy to do, gives you options and is simple to clean up after</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this!!  Now he doesn&#x27;t need to run the water so darn hot in the morning to warm up his face.</li>
    <li> The Conair HGL1 combination hot Gel/Lather Machine is the best thing I have purchesed for my self. I use a cheep gel and this is the easy 1,2,3 instrctions and the gel comes out as hot as you want it. As the directions say just turn it on before you get through brushing your teeth it is hot in seconds and ready. The unit comes with two tips, one for cream and the other for gel.</li>
    <li> The hot lather machine was defective and never worked.  The machine would turn on and heat up but could never get the machine to dispense the lather.</li>
    <li> Great product of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I love the hot foam, and the ability to switch from foam to Gel. The product dispenses slower than I like but it gets the job done. I purchased mine as a refurbished product, but it works fine and i have no regrets, as i use it every day.</li>
    <li> We were not able to find this in any of the stores around here.  My husband just loves the warm lather</li>
    <li> Purchased in late 2009. Dead of natural causes in early 2012. A poor system that will eventually fail to hold foam in the chamber and will spill out around edges. In reading other reviews I see it is a common problem.  A product of shaving cream I used years ago called the &amp;#34;Hot One&amp;#34; was discontinued and this was the best I could find for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;  It now sits on the back of a large work bench in the garage for the last couple years awaiting to go to trash, or a attempt to repair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother&#x27;s birthday, he love&#x27;s it and the ajustable temp. control gets hot like it says!! he uses gel- the only problem, is that the can attachement is difficult to work with. would recomend the product.</li>
    <li> This product did not fit the standard shaving cream container like \\&quot;EDGE\\&quot;, \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot;, \\&quot;Johnson\\&quot; \\&quot;SKINTIMATE\\&quot; by S.C. Johnson or any other manufacturer because the retaining ring that clasps under the lip of the shave cream container was not manufactured correctly. The older model of which we had for 5 years (probably made in the USA) was manufactured correctly &amp; lasted until the heating element gave up the Ghost after 1,825 uses. The newer model (probably made in CHINA) looks cheaper made and not able to clasp on the lip of the shave cream due to the part that clasps is too small &amp; wrong angle &amp; poor quality. It was NOT a FUN experience for me. We&#x27;ll shop for a better model made in the USA. Thank you.~Lin.</li>
    <li> very good. here on time</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for that man in your life. If you are needing a reason to get up and face the day then the hot lather machine from Amazon will give you one. It will get you going!!!</li>
    <li> I have had my Conair shave warmer for years and well, my son is ready for a long needed shave so he is getting this same model for Christmas.  Nothing better than a nice warm shave every morning.  It heats up in about 1-2 minutes while I am brushing my teeth and then just press the button and steaming foam comes out for a nice clean, no bump shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for one of these, it makes shaving a lot easier.  This hot lather is ideal for someone who uses a safety razon and likes a close shave.</li>
    <li> In contrast to the older versions of this product, which loaded easily and worked reasonably well, this model is overly complicated, difficult to load, slow to heat, and requires the user to stand directly over it to see the tiny light that stops flashing to tell you when the lather is supposedly hot.  \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; is a misnomer; the lather comes out only slightly warmer than if it came straight out of the can without the long delay, and by the time it&#x27;s applied to the face it is back to room temperature.  The only possible use for this product would be for students in engineering classes who have to analyze bad design.  After just one use, mine is on its way to the landfill.  The \\&quot;key\\&quot; for removing the can&#x27;s plastic nozzle is as dangerous as it is unnecessary, in addition to being easy to lose. Just use your thumb (under a towel or facecloth if you like) to press up against the nozzle and off it comes quite easily.</li>
    <li> This does produce nice hot creamy lather.  however after a while it gets black specks in the nozzle and I&#x27;m not sure how to get them out.  I have looked for ways to take the nozzle apart and there doesnt seem to be any answers.  Other than mysterious black moldy specks I love this. But no way to clean properly means premature replacement times which outways the benefits</li>
    <li> SNL used to run a sketch where the characters would say &amp;#34;If its nae Scottish, its crap.&amp;#34;  I can say this is &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; lather machine is definitely not Scottish.  I purchased despite the generally lousy reviews because I had some money left over on an Amazon gift card.  I had no problem getting the can inserted so that the machine dispensed the foam, but the foam was warm at best.  Get  this only if you want a warm or tepid lather machine; if you want hot lather, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I bought this from an Amazon merchant.  I am not blaming the merchant for the poor quality of the product because it had enough bad reviews I was not expecting much.  Hopefully, I can get a refund from  Conair.</li>
    <li> At my request, my wife bought this for me as a gift and it worked for a while.  I never could get the gel to work but the lather type (Barbasol) worked fine.  I would push the on button, take a shower and the machine was ready by the time I dried off.  After about 3 cans of shaving cream it stopped working.  To dispense the lather you push on the top just behind the spout and it became impossible to push.  If I pushed very hard the can would pop off.  I have had this for a year or two and I am disappointed that it stopped working.  I wont buy another.</li>
    <li> i am a barber have to keep hitting button every hour &amp; half. need it to stay on all day.</li>
    <li> Hubby can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I got one about 10 years ago as a gift.  It worked great.  My fiancee got another one for me.  Total piece of krap.  The foam comes out so slowly that your beard will actually grow while you&#x27;re waiting.  I returned it to Amazon for another - same piece of garbage.  So I tried one more time - 3 strikes, it&#x27;s out.  I called ConAir who told me they&#x27;d made \\&quot;improvements\\&quot; that some people weren&#x27;t satisfied with.  Hey Conair - look at the feedback data here.  About 1/2 of the 100 reviews of your product are bad.  And that&#x27;s just on amazon.  I checked other sites and this waste of money isn&#x27;t getting any respect out on the rest of the web either.  Potential buyers - learn from our mistakes.  You are literally better off with nothing (or a hot towel on your face) than this tower of junk.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great machine, I like it. It&#x27;s easy to use and reliable. The main thing to insure good operation is to remove nozzle after each use and rinse it out with warm water. It&#x27;s a little time consuming but it&#x27;s worth it. I use it with the lather.</li>
    <li> Worked once or twice and then stopped working.  It was a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellant purchace. I hate to put cold shave cream on my face and with the Conair Hot Gel/Lather Machine I no longer have to. The Conair heats up very fast, push the button and you have warm shave cream. It&#x27;s sleek design is a plus also because it fits on my sink, doesn&#x27;t take up room and looks Great. Very easy to assemble and operate.</li>
    <li> This was very hard to set up. I almost broke it and wasted 1/2 can of gel. Poor directions. Gel is only warm at the highest setting. Would not buy again. Claims to heat lotion but does not say how.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does, with very little fuss. Don&#x27;t bother buying anything more expensive!  It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Third Conair warmer.  Lasts about 2-3 years, but worth the replacement.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with the product.  The shaving cream keeps oozing out of the machine slowly throughout the day so there is a small pile of shaving cream on the counter all the time. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> My Conair Lather Dispenser lasted for several years before it finally clogged up. I used primarily Gillette Sensitive Shave Gel and that seemed to work the best (vs. Edge, Schick Hydro and others). There is a wider temperature range option for shaving cream vs. gel but I was fine with the gel. I had an issue with shaving bumps/irritation and this product seemed to help, so I will probably buy it again. The top removal key can be tricky (I lost some skin on my thumb trying to pry off a Nivea top) but for the other brands listed it was generally not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an unrelated note, does anyone know the difference between this product and the ones from Conair that cost $100+?</li>
    <li> Warm lather not hot. Bought one a year ago and it was much better. Would not buy again.Price was cheap as was quality.</li>
    <li> This worked fine on the first can but would not work at all on the second can.  I tried everything and it just would not work.</li>
    <li> We had looked every where for this - my husband old one had stopped working - this is the only place we could find one just like his so we ordered 2</li>
    <li> This is a different model than my old one uses gel or foam shave cream. Work very well so far with cream, have not tried gel yet. These are getting very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and my teenage son love the warm lather.  My husband did have a bit of trouble first setting it up, but it is working great now.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> this hot lather machine is great for the money and the quality is also great it has an adjustment for the tempeture and it also has two nozels one for foam and the other for gel i know the foam works great and i am going to try the gel as soon as the foam runs out CONAIR THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GOOD PRODUCT ALLEN V.</li>
    <li> The product did not work properly from the day i received it. Shaving cream kept getting clogged up in it and when i would take the part off to check it, shaving cream would come pouring out of it. The instructions were not clear at all. I will never buy a conair product again.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one my husband has owned.  The first one was packed away for over a year, so it got plugged. He loves it though.  He definitely likes having the warm gel to shave with.</li>
    <li> Works well. Nice design. Heats cream up nicely. makes for a nice close shave and only takes a few minute longer than before.</li>
    <li> I had an old Conair Shaving cream dispenser and it lasted 10 yrs. That product got the shaving cream nice and warm. My new one does not get the shaving cream hot enough. I also  tried to install a gel can and I had gel everyplace, maybe it was just me, but I was not able to get it hooked up properly and gave up  .So I hooked up the shaving cream can and that went much better, but as I said its&#x27; not warm enough.</li>
    <li> I have used Conair heated shaving gel/lather machine for several year and they have worked quite well.  This is my first replacement of my original one. Long Lasting, very durable.  Gets used every day!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a total mess.  The soap that I received does not appear what the instructions correspond to. There is no way to use the bottle of Campbells liquid shave cream {8 oz} as the written instructions on the bottle of shave cream, the written instruction sheet, and instruction and pictures on the Conair base can work with what I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to start over just credit my account and I will try to buy something else and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;m a retired project engineer and this is the first project I have had that I couldn&#x27;t solve with the right materials.</li>
    <li> My son did not care for this product said to messy!</li>
    <li> I have it, got it in good time, packaged really well, but the assembly instruction are very evasive a cumbersome.</li>
    <li> Not hot at all , not even warm . A real Bumber!</li>
    <li> I purchased this over a month ago and have yet to find a shaving cream can that will work. It seems as if the stem from the cans that I&#x27;ve purchased aren&#x27;t long enough to function properly with this dispenser.</li>
    <li> This is a great product works good and every time I use it I feel super smooth cuz of the wary it leaves me when I finish shaving</li>
    <li> i use this lather machine everyday at work(barbershop) and the guys love it. i like that it is sturdy and doesnt take up as much space as the bulky old fashioned ones.i also like that i can use gel or cream with it and i like that you can control the temperature on it. it also looks stylish and professional. The price was great and they are so hard to find now.</li>
    <li> I was trying to get an old Gillette Hot Shave System GSM-3 working, but it doesn&#x27;t use gel and the new can of Gillette Foamy Sensitive I bought for it wouldn&#x27;t fit quite right and leaked lather all over the inside.  So I found this and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried gel in it yet, but the Gillette Foamy Sensitive fit inside of it perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leak at all.  That nice warm lather feels great when I am ready to shave after a shower.  I use a lather brush and only lather my face first, shave it as the lather rewarms, rinse the brush, then apply new warm lather to my throat.  Doing sections keeps your lather warm and fresh.  Re-lather for touch-ups as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something future buyers should know is that there is one temperature setting gauge and it apparently heats foam hotter than gel.  I have mine just a little past the hottest gel setting and the foam lather feels just right to me.  I enjoy that barber shop feel and smell from the Gillette Foamy Sensitive.  After my can of foam runs out, I will try some gel and see how it feels.  I look forward to shaving when I need to now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure you have the proper nozzle on before putting in your can of gel or foam.  There is one for gel and one for foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars since it might be possible gel doesn&#x27;t get as hot as foam.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap product. I read all the bad reviews and still decided to try it. Bad mistake! DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> I love this having warm shaving cream is so nice to have this over a year no problems was worth it wish you could find these anywhere but hard to find great item..</li>
    <li> going to give as a Christmas gift, husband has the same one already and loved it but it sadly died so now he will be back to normal</li>
    <li> It did not hold up and the the manufacturer did not honor their warranty.  Would not buy their products.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good product.  We had bought and used before but the product is no longer good.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my 82 year old Father for Christmas.  He has used the Conair Hot Lather Machine for years and his old just wore out!  He was so unhappy that he was not able to locate a replacement in any retail stores.  So he was really surprised when he opened his gift.  He wanted me to get him another one as a back-up!</li>
    <li> There is nothing like a warm shave in the morning</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend as a birthday present and he loves it! He likes having the gel warmed up before it touches his face.  When he first tried it out he put it on the warmest setting, and it was a little too warm for comfort for him, so he just adjusted it down.  I think there is plenty of room for adjusting the temperature to your liking.  His only complaint is that the gel that first dispenses IS warm enough, BUT if you need another large dollop right away, it isn&#x27;t always as warm as the first.  But if you give it about 15s (which is about how long it takes for him to apply the initial dollop on his face)for the cooler gel to warm up near the heating element it is not a problem! :)  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and so is he!</li>
    <li> Machine did not heat well on gel.  Used the older model for years and was happy to find on again.  However, was disappointed to the point that I have discontinued the use of it.  I would not recommend this newer model to anyone.  Sorry!!</li>
    <li> Exactly the product order and even with the delays which they  informed  it&#x27;s take  less than two week.</li>
    <li> Works just like the one we had for many years. My husband is very satisfied!  Warms both gel or cream.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this really does work. It does not get the 5th star because it does not come out steaming hot. There is probably some legality at the temperature it can be. I really like the way the shaving cream feels when it is warm though so this purchase was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions took me a few minutes to figure out but once I was able to get it up and running it was pretty easy. The one thing that you can imagine is that shaving is a very sloppy process, so add in this machine and it makes it more sloppier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine will warm up your shaving cream and make for a better shave. You will have to deal with cleaning up the mess the machine makes by getting it all over the handle but that is a small price to pay for heated shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Could not get it to work.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a replacement for an older Conair Lather Machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am using gel now, rather than lather, and the instructions for attaching a gel can are too brief. I wasted a can of gel getting it right. Once done, it dispenses beautifully. Super frustrating at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone at Conair could make this much, much easier.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas.  He said he loves it!  Gently warms any can of lather for a comfy close shave.</li>
    <li> If you imagined the hot shaving cream one used to get at barber shops than you will be disappointed. Not a very good product. I&#x27;m giving mine away.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas, he absolutely loves it. First time to by the combo unit and its a hit.</li>
    <li> This product makes one enjoy shaving, relaxes beard for a clean cut shave.  Easy assembly.  As a physically challenged man who uses one hand, the product is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a few years now, and I enjoy it immensely.  I bought it as a way to spoil myself a little, and having warm shaving cream on your face during a shave is a wonder.  I know I&#x27;m spoiled when I go out somewhere and have to shave in the morning using shaving cream out of the can and put it on my face cold.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  All you have to do is buy a regular can of shaving cream, take the plastic nozzle off, and put it in the warmer.  I&#x27;ve heard a lot about barber shops using warm shaving cream and wanted to try it out for myself.  So for anyone who shaves, I recommend this product.  And it&#x27;s good for shaving cream or gel.</li>
    <li> product had been used by someone else. would not recomend it at all.why are seven more words required oe me?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my hot gel/lather machine for about a week now and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I will have to update this review at a later date once I&#x27;ve tried the machine with gel (I&#x27;ve only used lather), but it seems to work fairly well.  Is the lather going to burn your skin coming out?  Definitely not.  But it&#x27;s not cold either.  It works and is decently heated.  I also think the lather comes out less messy than previous (and more expensive) machines I&#x27;ve owned.  It has automatic turnoff if you forget to hit the off button.  It is a little tricky attaching the bottle to the cap of the machine, but once you correctly get it on, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one drawback- you can&#x27;t shake the can of shaving cream easily while it is in the machine.  Thus, your lather comes out someone wet, rather than creamy.  I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll have better luck with that once I switch to shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (12/06/12): I&#x27;ve now tried the machine with shaving gel and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I&#x27;ve noticed two big problems: it doesn&#x27;t warm the shaving gel very well and it doesn&#x27;t continue to dispense the gel until the shaving gel can is empty.  It didn&#x27;t notice either of these problems when I used the machine with shaving cream, as the cream is dispensed at a decent temperature and the entire can can be used in the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still happy with the purchase, but will probably only use it with shaving cream from this point further (which I prefer anyway).  However, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $50 for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these on the clearance rack at a certain big-box retailer a few years ago, and it was returned used with a few of the accessories missing (the cap remover and the hot lather dispense nozzle).  At that time, these retailed for about $40 a piece, and at the clearance price it was a steal.  So I cleaned it up, and have been using it for the last few years.  The gel was somewhat luke-warm out of the machine, and it was somewhat of a pain to get the can into the dispenser, but when it was setup correctly, it provided me with one of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  For someone with sensitive skin, this was a vast improvement over gel right out of the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided I wanted to use the hot-lather option, so I purchased this same product again though Amazon.  The price was comparable to the price of the clearance product I originally purchased, but the ease of setup was much easier; the can of lather snapped right into place.  I&#x27;m going to chalk up the flaws of setup the previous product had to possibly being part of the reason it was returned.  It took a few moments longer to warm up the lather than did the gel (which I was expecting), but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have to warm up for a few seconds after every dispense, but maybe that&#x27;s just my impatient nature.  I could easily cover half of my face in one dispensing, my entire face if I really worked the lather.  Again, a smooth shave, and at a much cheaper cost than a can of shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone.  For the price, you simply cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> The Conair HGL1 Combo Hot Gel/Lather Machine works OK but even at the temperature set @ high, the lather is barely warm. I haven&#x27;t tried the Gel feature yet but assume it will be the same. Do I need to get the more expensive Conair Lather Heater/s to get hotter lather? Anyone with similarcondition?</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE MY HOT LATHER MACHINE. I TURN IT ON JUST BEFORE I SHOWER AND WHEN I GET OUT THE SHAVING CREAM IS NICE AND WARM. IT MAKES A VERY NICE SHAVE. ALMOST LIKE GOING TO THE OLD TIME BARBER.</li>
    <li> Yes, these Hot Gel/Lather machines do not actually get the lather HOT, but they do a good job of warming the lather up.  Will you get a HOT shave?  No, but you will get a nice warm lather that will soften your beard.  On cold mornings that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this model for a about 4-5 years and I finally had to replace it.  The cost of that one was 19.99 at target.  But I guess they no longer carry lather warmers.  I went to a few stores, including BB&amp;B, and could not find one.  Found it on Amazon and saved 5 bucks...cost was 14.99.  Nothing worng with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warming time is relatively short 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new unit heats up to the same temperature as the old one, so no improvement there.  I believe this is due to either burning or perhaps the can getting too hot and rupturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good unit for the price.</li>
    <li> After reading previous reviews, I doubted this product would work well. But, for the price, I thought I would take a chance. First, all the complaints about setting it up are misplaced. I had no problem at all. If you are able to read the instructions, and us a bit of common sense, installing the shaving cream/gel cans is very easy. The lather warms up to a nice temperature. I have been using it now for about a month and look forward to my daily shave.  Great product. Thank goodness for Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t find this at any of our local stores. And the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am downgrading my initial review one star. About 6 months into use, black specks started to appear in the shave cream after heating the unit up. Several times I have disassembled the unit and gave it a thorough cleaning. Each time after about 3 to 5 uses the speck start to reappear. Have some hesitation using it anymore.</li>
    <li> The Combination Hot/Gel Lather Machine was a gift for my brother.  He said it was awesome and that every man should have one. I&#x27;m his favorite sister ... at least for now.</li>
    <li> It is a comfortable shave with the hot lather machine.  I will purchase again for soothing shaves.  I have used for several months.</li>
    <li> The one I received doesn&#x27;t look like the picture shown. Why do you show one picture  and mail a different one?</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband.  It replaces the hot lather machine he had before.  He seems to really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because my husband like it. I was not happy when I went into our local drug store and seen the same item for $19.99 and I just paid $ 40.00.</li>
    <li> The shaving lotion is only briefly warmed. It feels warm immediately after it is dispensed, but by the time it gets to your skin, it is cold. You can&#x27;t move fast enough to get warm lotion in contact with your skin.</li>
    <li> This is great when it works and it heats up quickly.  It has weak seals and leaks foam/gel easily causing it to be messy after every use.  Also, the unit is a little bulkier than I expected for counter space.  It is effective for the price, but I would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to operate and produces hot gel/lather very quickly.  The hot lather makes it easy and comfortable to shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his hit lather machine</li>
    <li> First 2-3 uses got very good hot lather -- now it is only luke warm after a long preheat time of at least 30 minutes</li>
    <li> The later is lukewarm, but for hot gel? IDEAL!  No complaints otherwise. It does help you to get a close, comfortable shave. it comes with both lather and gel attachments along with instructions. Joe</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations. My husband loves it and it makes shaving a pleasant experience! It was difficult to find but I was glad to find it for my husband for Christms.</li>
    <li> Fiance likes it wish their were more creams that fit machine</li>
    <li> The product works reasonably well. It makes the foamy WARM , not hot. To get a good barber shop shave , one needs to heat the beard with hot foam to soften the beard. This tool does not do that , but at least it makes the foamy warm enough that a man is not putting cold foamy on his face.</li>
    <li> had one in the past knew exactly what i was ordering.so it didn&#x27;t suprise me it worked as I had anticapated</li>
    <li> Some people complained that the shaving cream didn&#x27;t get hot enough and I can attest to that. BUT it does get really warm and works in loosening up the skin and does provide a good, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Conair has a very reliable and dependable machine which heats shaving creme nicely in a very short amount of time. I find that after showering I get a better shave using warm shave cream. When you haven&#x27;t tried heating gel or lather give consideration to purchasing this machine. Something tells me you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Worst product ever dosnt fit new shaving creams</li>
