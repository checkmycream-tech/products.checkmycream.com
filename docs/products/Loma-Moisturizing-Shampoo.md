    <li> I love this shampoo because it is organic and it works. I use it daily. Only complaint is it a large bottle, and I wish it had a pump top dispenser.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a years.  Switched to something else when I ran out but came running back.  Keeps my hair soft.  It is gluten free and not tested on animals which are great selling points.</li>
    <li> I purchased this exact product at my salon and the shampoo was a distant clear &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and had a distinct orange or citrus smell. The lather was so so but I loved it because it wasn&#x27;t making me head oily after use. I user it with the conditioner which I still do use. This product came to me in a bottle not marked organic like the salon product did and had a sticker on the back marked organic. The color of the shampoo is white , lathers way too much, smells like coconut and leaves me with greasy hair after a day. I am not happy. Will never purchase from here again. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Great Gluten free shampoo. Smells great. I have used the product exclusively for several years. Healthy hair from a healthy product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo &amp; did not strip my hair.  Purchase this with that Daily conditioner and tried this together  and also used Peartin Fortifying Repairative serum ( now called Loma Fortifying Repairative Tonic) before I blow dried my hair.  My hair was not  frizzy and styled very well leaving my hair silky smooth.  I was so happy with this line of product that I told my cousin and she ordered the same and told her friends.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This with the loma moisturizing shampoo is the only thing I use. Great for colored hair and the two together help with sun fade.</li>
    <li> Love it ~ and no sulfides! (Arrived on schedule)</li>
    <li> Same great shampoo I have used for several years.  Thanks for keeping the quality--nice fragrance!  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing shampoo!  It has a clean, citrus scent and works well for my color treated (blow dried daily) hair.  Used in conjunction with the Loma conditioners, my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> lathers well for not having a lot of products that lather.  Smooth and cleaning.  A little goes a long way.  I am impressed and I have purchased this at least 3 times and will continue.  great brand, texture, cleaning, rinsing, feeling and smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped me keep my hair from turning into straw during the dry summers here in California. Works very nicely!</li>
    <li> Do you color your hair? Does the color fade within a few week&amp;#34;? Time to pick up your Loma organic shampoo. You will love the results.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!!!! Long time user!</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine and I color it so finding a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t get weighted down by moisturizing shampoo is hard.

    <li> I only use this shampoo</li>
    <li> Smells great and we have really hard water and my hair is so soft after using this product.</li>

    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It moisturizes and cleans with no sulfates.  I don&#x27;t even use a conditioner&lt;br /&gt;while shampooing. I only use a light oil spray while my hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;You will love this product</li>

    <li> The best ! I love it !</li>
    <li> Loma is the best hair product by far!  Those of you who use Wen, you should give Loma a try!!</li>
    <li> Bought a smaller bottle through my salon but found the pricing through Amazon was better.  More fabulous product and better price.
