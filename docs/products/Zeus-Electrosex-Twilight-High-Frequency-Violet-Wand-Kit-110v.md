      <li>Great price for product.  </li>
      <li>I was one of those kids who loved the Tesla globes so being able to zap myself or my partner with purple electricity is one of the best things about having grown up!  </li>
      <li>Good quality item that shipped and arrived as advertised.</li>
      <li>It is very intense in a very good way!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>nice item , even the girlfriend likes it .</li>
      <li>the bright side...while it worked it was nice not to have to worry about which direction it was held in - the mechanical wands will change intensity or not work when held at certain angles.</li>
      <li>Still very fun though!</li>
      <li>EASY TO USESE AND VERY LIGHT.</li>
      <li>This is a beginner or light bdsm item.</li>
      <li>The light and noise add the experience.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it</li>
      <li>I enjoy electro play.</li>
      <li>This kit was easy to use right out the box!</li>
      <li>very nice product, well constructed and fun to use I like the different attachments which each one delivers a different feeling when applied to your skin,definately a good product</li>
      <li>Well My slaves just love this piece of equiptment,It really does shock and electrify those sensual parts of the body</li>
      <li>stimulating &amp; fun to use.</li>
      <li>This was my first experience with electro type products.</li>
      <li>My partner was reserved at first but now loves the  tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in trying electro stim</li>
      <li>This little gadget is amazing fun.  </li>
      <li>Really gets things moving.....</li>
      <li>It had a decent spark for a while...</li>
      <li>I would say that two or three treatments, mild current, and they will shrink, and eventually fall off....</li>
      <li>It is still a very stimulating feeling and makes your nerves sensitive.</li>
      <li>While this is a weaker version wand and does not cause the intense zap that i had expected, The black case leaks and zaps the user if held a certain way.</li>

    <li> NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE THIS GREAT TOY!  EASY TO USESE AND VERY LIGHT. IT WILL SHOW YOU THE MAJICK!! BELEIVE ME!</li>
    <li> This item is not for the fasint hearted. I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Great product. Great price for product.  Best deal I could find. I would recommend this to anyone interested in trying electro stim</li>
    <li> nice item , even the girlfriend likes it .</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with electro type products. I thought it would be stronger.  It is still a very stimulating feeling and makes your nerves sensitive. The light and noise add the experience. I enjoy it but if your looking for a hard zap then look at the e-stim boxes. This is a beginner or light bdsm item. Still very fun though!</li>
    <li> This was a big disappointment. Not worth the money you spend. If I could return the Zeus Electrosex Twilight, I would.</li>
    <li> It had a decent spark for a while...but after a dozen or so uses something happened and it&#x27;s extremely weak now.  Disappointed...it&#x27;s not the $2-300 ones (which IMHO are way overpriced for what they are) but for what it costs I expected it to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side...while it worked it was nice not to have to worry about which direction it was held in - the mechanical wands will change intensity or not work when held at certain angles.</li>
    <li> Good quality item that shipped and arrived as advertised. The adjustable power and attachments were as advertised. All in all I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a great product</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought it would be :(</li>
    <li> While this is a weaker version wand and does not cause the intense zap that i had expected, The black case leaks and zaps the user if held a certain way. I tried to shore up the problem with electrical tape but it only reduced the zap not eliminated it.</li>
    <li> very nice product, well constructed and fun to use I like the different attachments which each one delivers a different feeling when applied to your skin,definately a good product</li>
    <li> Well My slaves just love this piece of equiptment,It really does shock and electrify those sensual parts of the body</li>
    <li> Does a phenominal job of burning off tag warts... as well as other things... I would say that two or three treatments, mild current, and they will shrink, and eventually fall off.... I was of course talking about the warts...</li>
    <li> I must say this wand is not a cheap version, it was a real hit at a party we was at.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS ITEM! I enjoy electro play. My play partner used this wand on every part of my body! It is very intense in a very good way! He is a novice to Electrosex so I wanted to get a kit that was simple for him to use. This kit was easy to use right out the box! We immediately plugged it in and had a great time! On my clitoris it was the BEST thing EVER! Guys and Girls you can&#x27;t go wrong with this kit!</li>
    <li> Really gets things moving.....stimulating &amp; fun to use. My partner was reserved at first but now loves the  tingling sensation. The range of stimulation is very good.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is amazing fun.  I was one of those kids who loved the Tesla globes so being able to zap myself or my partner with purple electricity is one of the best things about having grown up!  The highest setting isn&#x27;t going to set your hair on fire but you will definitely catch someone&#x27;s attention with it... really good value for a violet wand!</li>
