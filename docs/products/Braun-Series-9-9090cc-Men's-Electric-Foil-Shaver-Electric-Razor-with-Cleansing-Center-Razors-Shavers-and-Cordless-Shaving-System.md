      <li>I would have to say the looks are attractive and would match many decor.</li>

    <li> I have been using another brand electric razor for a long time along with a traditional razor from time to time.  I was so excited when I received my Braun Razor as a promotion, since I had been looking for a change for some time and had to get it charged and start using it immediately.  Thank God - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I had a great close shave that felt good and looked great.  What more can you ask for.  Then it just got better, this thing can clean itself.  So far I am very impressed, now I have to se how it stands the test of time.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for at least ten years. It was a $50 electric razor, and pretty much no frills. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a cartridge razor since then. I was given a Braun Series 9 shaver for free to review.  Compared to that old electric razor, the Braun Series 9 shaver is like magic. I had about four days beard stubble, and fully expected it to hurt a little bit. Not only did it not hurt, but it shaved my face pretty much effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model I have comes with the Clean &amp; Charge station. To give you an idea of how much stubble it cut, it gave me three water drops (out of three) to indicate the maximum amount of cleaning needed.  After it cleans, it actually enters a drying cycle to dry the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going on a trip in a couple of days, and one other benefit of carrying an electric razor is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about taking too much shaving cream and getting it confiscated by the TSA. I&#x27;ll just throw the razor and the charging cable in the included hard shell carrying case, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> I received my Braun series 9090 as a product tester on Bzzagent. When I looked at  other reviews online I was excited to try this product. But when I  received it i was more impressed then before in the quality of the razor. I was very impressed by its size and how it felt in my hand. I have to say that after using my Braun to shave my beard I am delighted with the results, clean and close shave. I also made use of the side burn trimmer for my sideburns and to clean up my mustache.  I find it very easy to clean because of the three minute alcohol rinse. I also love the rotating head to get a great shave on my mustache. But compared to disposable razors it is a very great alternative if you are willing to pay some money to get a high end razor.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying this shaver is quality.  The Braun Series 9 shaver is a statement on how functionality and form can be brought together in a clever way for such a commonly used product. This may be by far the best product that Braun has produced in a very long time.  The cutting edge technology is assembled in a beautifully crafted product that works as good as it looks. Each part of this shaver is made with aesthetics, comfort and usability in mind – a well-designed user interface, thumb rest and overall grip make using the product a joy. In a nutshell, the Braun Series Shaver offers the following benefits: Improved shaving head – comprised of four cutting elements, two foils and two trimmers. These elements are cleverly combined to deliver the cleanest shave through the sonic technology that adapts to the density of the beard. The Braun Series 9 shaver can mow through a three day beard in a fraction of the time that other shavers do. Secondly, flexible cutting elements – work individually to read the contours of the face for a clean and even shave. Third, efficient – yet comfortable shave devoid of the usual problems of razor burn or cuts. As expected from Braun, the operation of the shaver is intuitive and simple. This shaver is especially useful for people who do not like shaving everyday but skip a day or two. The Braun Series 9 shaver is strong enough to handle overgrown hairs unlike the conventional shavers that can only do so much. The noise levels of this shaver are significantly lower than that of other products of a similar class and the smooth vibrations provide a calming and relaxing feeling to your shave. Overall, this is a good quality shaver that should serve you well for a long time – something that will justify the price that some might find beyond their reach. Overall, fantastic piece of machinery! It does its work quickly and more than well - a clean and flawless shave. Reaching difficult places is a breeze and the result is perfect. The ONLY con I have is the cleaning contraption. One, it is large and it comes with a cartridge containing flammable chemicals which means travelling with it is out of question. Two, the indicator on the shaver requires a cleaning session after EACH shave! In fact I just let the machine run for about 15 seconds in the air, without even touching my skin, and the cleaning indicator went on. And then you are supposed to replace the cleaning fluid at least once every 8 weeks even if not used. Seems suspiciously like a clever way to extract more money from customers. For that I&#x27;ve knocked one star off.  In conclusion, definitely a great shaver and I highly recommend it.perfect. The ONLY con I have is the cleaning contraption.

    <li> I received this Braun Series 9 9090cc electric shaver for review through BzzAgent a company that coordinates product reviews and reports results back to manufacturers. I have traditionally used a manual razor (schick hydro) with shaving cream, as I have always found electric razors to irritate my skin and do a subpar job. So I began using with some skepticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: The kit included included the shaver, a cleaning unit, the power cord, charging/cleaning station, one solution kit for the station, a reinforced cloth travel case, cleaning brush, and instruction manual. I found the Braun Series 9 easy to set up and get charging. Even the base cleaning station was easy with the special cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the cleaning station, it does an amazing job of both cleaning the razor and drying it afterward. It is easy trouble free to insert the razor. The process takes forty-five minutes or so, which I suppose isn&#x27;t bad considering I don&#x27;t need it again until the next day. There is a fan for drying that is a bit noisy, but does a good job. In my past use, electric razors never cleaned too well and this does a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving experience itself went quickly and despite the size of the razor head, works well with the contours of my face. I also liked that I could lock the head in place if needed. The biggest plus for me is that after two weeks it has yet to leave my skin irritated. My beard is pretty thick and electric razors in the past struggled to do an even mediocre job without great irritation. The shave also was quick and did not have the mess and time issues like a manual razor does. The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Being used to a manual razor, this is still an electric razor. While it is a close shave, it still cannot give the perfectly smooth shave of a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual recommends oiling the shaving head occasionally, but does not include any oil to do so - something I found a little annoying. Then there is also the upkeep costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer recommends replacing the cleaning solution every eight weeks. While I completely understand the need, one of the big benefits to an electric shaver is lower long-term costs. So no real way around it, but something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If I used a manual razor all of the time, this would be an obvious choice. After two weeks I am on the fence if this will replace my use of manual razors. When in a hurry or traveling, without question I will certainly enjoy the razor.is also the upkeep costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer recommends replacing the cleaning solution every eight weeks.

    <li> I received the Braun 9090cc from BzzAgent , and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I have been a longtime user of Braun electric razors, I currently used a series 5. It did a great job but the advantages the series 9 offers are really impressive. The series 9 is quick charging and it gives the most comfortable and extremely close shave I have ever had and that includes all electric and disposable blade razors. It doesn&#x27;t matter which direction the hair is growing one pass is all it takes. The series 9 has a digital readout a floating head that can be locked in 5 different positions, and the razor is waterproof so it can be rinsed off under the tap. The series 9 also has a pop up trimmer for sideburns beards and it comes with the new clean and renew station. The clean and renew station basically tells you when to clean and then you have a fresh clean shaver after every cycle. It may be a little louder than the previous cleaning station but nothing to cause concern. This new 9090cc definitely rates 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun Series 9. I tried electric shavers in the past, but have been using manual razors for the bulk of my shaving career. I felt that the past electric shavers didn&#x27;t get all the hairs. This Braun isn&#x27;t perfect, but is a lot better! I still have a few issues with neck hairs that lay flat, but overall I enjoy this electric shaver. The self-cleaning base is awesome too!. It tells you when it needs to be cleaned!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did get this product free, but this is my honest opinion*</li>
    <li> When BzzAgent provided me with a free Braun Series 9 shaver to evaluate, I thought, &amp;#34;What might this shaver have that my already loved Braun Series 7 doesn&#x27;t offer?&amp;#34; In that context, I found why the 9 series is Braun&#x27;s new king. This shaver is incredibly comfortable, no pulling or irritation. I struggled for years to find a razor that would avoid razor bumps on the neck area. I&#x27;ve used everything from straight razors, cartridge razors, rotary electrics, foil electrics, etc.  Only this Braun shaver has succeeded in completely preventing razor bumps or irritation. The best quality of this razor is the speed. I can be fully clean shaven to a smooth face and size burns trimmed under 4 minutes. Every minute of my morning counts! I also at first thought the Braun cleaning system was nothing more than a gimmick. Wrong! The cleaning system truly helps to provide a consistently close shave by making sure the razor is stripped of skin oils and dirt, removes cut hair, and fully charges the razor. The cleaner has a very nice citrus scent and it truly makes the morning shave much more pleasant knowing you are starting with a perfectly clean razor. The cleaning system has been updated with the 9 series. Compared to the Series 7, the razor now drops in and stays mostly vertical, as opposed to leaning to the left in the previous Braun system. It also seems to analyze the cleanliness of the shaver differently, as sometimes after a shave it will enter a more deep cleaning mode. I would highly recommend this cleaning system and cannot see myself going without at this point. In some ways I prefer the older style cleaning station because the razor clearly drops into place and gives you a constant update of fluid level remaining.  I should also mention that the Series 9 shaver is noticeably quieter than previous Braun models I&#x27;ve had. The larger shaving foil is also much more efficient at covering larger areas of the face, but yet is still manageable under the nose and other tight spots. I also much prefer the trimmer included with the Series 9. The trimmer blade is wide and extends high above the razor when in use, making it very easy to shape sideburns quickly.  An advantage of the Series 7 on the other hand is the smaller cutting head trims tight spots around the nose more easily. The question that begs asking is, &amp;#34;Is this shaver worth the premium over the Series 7?&amp;#34; I say yes. Of all the electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried, the Braun Series 9 is by far my favorite and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a premium electric shaver.

    <li> I got this product free from Bzzagent to test this new shaver. This is without doubt the best shaver that I have ever used.  The very first shave and I was in love with it.  I have a &amp;#34;baby face&amp;#34; but a tough bread and usually if I get a clean close shave,  my face looks burned.  This new Braun 9090cc Shaver has  40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute for an outstandingly thorough shave. Besides the great shave,  the new cleaning system that comes with it takes the hassle out of cleaning the shaver.  It&#x27;s ready to give you a close shave when you use it the very next time. I really didn&#x27;t expect this great shave because I have tried a couple of rotary shavers in my lifetime without success.  I am recommending this new Braun 9090cc shaver to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I got my bzzAgent invitation for Braun Series 9090cc. I have never used Braun shavers before. When it finally arrived, I could not wait to open it. It has a charging station, an electric shaver, cleaning brush, one clean and renew cartridge and a travel pouch.It is the best shaver ever in the market. I have list of reasons on why I have decided to give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself- Great shaver. The head is very flexible while makes it easier to shave on hard to reach areas. It has The intelligent SyncroSonic™ technology which allows a closest possible shave. In simplest term means I don&#x27;t have to shave as often as I would if I were using my old shaver. I have medium thick hair and this shaver gets my face cleaned like a baby. The center blades cut thick hair without burning sensation. Shaver has 5 adjustable positions which can be set as fixed or flexible depending on situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging Dock - Compact charging dock allows you to charge quickly. Full charging cycle takes around 50 minutes.  The second best feature after shaver itself is fast charge option which will charge your shaver in 3 minutes and will allow you to use for one time shave. Shaver has numeric battery level indicator for remaining battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning system- The best technology to sanitize your shaver and make it super clean. Shaver has a cleaning system and charging station acts as a charger as well as cleaning system. Once you put the cartridge under charging station, it will clean and remove all the residue and hair from shaver.It also lubricates the charger while cleaning.It makes it as clean as new. It also has inbuilt hygienic indicator which lights up when cleaning is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are easy to use and most of them are self explanatory. Also, it has a compact design and does not create wire clutter because of spiral charging cable.&lt;br /&gt; I was using Phillips Norelco shaver before but I must say this has set new level of expectations. I never knew a shaver could be this smart and have resourceful features. This is truly the best one in the market.el of expectations. I never knew a shaver could be this smart and have resourceful features. This is truly the best one in the market.</li>
    <li> I just received the Braun Series 9 razor with SyncroSonic™ technology from Bzzagent.com to review and boy am I impressed. When I first started to shave I picked up an electric razor and I didn&#x27;t like it. It always left this little stubble and got filthy. But my option is definitely changed now. As soon as the razor hit my face my it was like a mini massage for my cheeks. What&#x27;s funny is I normally shave against the grain with my traditional razor to get a nice smooth shave but I also get a rash at times. With the Braun series 9 I also shaved against the grain because that what the instructions recommend and all I got was a nice smooth face with absolutely no razor burn or breakout. Finally after I was done I put the razor into the cleaning/charging station. The razor comes with an a cleaning solutions that keeps the razor nice and clean. Once again another big plus for this razor. Overall I have it 4 stars for doing a superb job and the only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because everything could always be improved. Just look at how far electronic razor as come this far.</li>
    <li> This is a costly shaver but it is without a doubt the best I have ever used. I however did receive this shaver from Braun as a promotion. Bear in mind that you are not getting just the shaver itself, you are getting the clean and charge station which, as its name suggests, cleans, lubricates and charges the shaver in a convenient way. Braun claims that using the station is 10 times more hygienic than simply rinsing the shaver under tape water and produces a closer shave and better skin comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have absolutely no reasons not to believe the marketing hype. Ease of use and comfort are the two features that make this shaver so highly recommended. The shaver is big (compared to my previous shavers) but very gentle: it adapts to the contour of my face, making shaving a more pleasant experience. I particularly like the pop-up long hair trimmer that deals with my sideburns so effectively. I can even shave during a shower, with or without gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that this system requires some maintenance. The cutting system cassette requires changing every 18 months and occasional oiling, while the cleaning centre refill needs attention about once a month. A minor irritation is that the station is on the big side and noisy when operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one occasion when you definitely get the quality you pay for. If you&#x27;re considering a high-end shaver, this is the one to go for.&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely a great shaver, a must have..</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I received this unit for free to sample and provide a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Braun user for over three years and never really felt that there would be any value for me to jump up to a more premium model. I have owned a series 3 and 6, with 6 as the current model before I received the 9. The 9 series after the first use absolutely impressed me. Just the feel of the shaver you feel as if its made of top grade materials, there is no cheap feel to this unit. The actual cutting of this shaver is light years form any other electric shaver I have ever used, and the pivoting head was perfect for my stubborn neck hair. The main difference between the 6 and this one is the amount of blades and trimmers. There are three series of trimmers that are activated all in one motion. This by far was as close as you get to the feel of a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning mechanism is all electronic and I have noticed that it is much more quieter than previous versions. Overall this is the best shaver I have ever used, both from a functional, results, and aesthetic standpoint. I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a premium shave, its worth the extra bucks.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 9 9090cc Electric Shaver with Cleaning Center from BzzAgent as part of a Bzz campaign FOR FREE. Upon being selected for the campaign I began to do a significant amount of research into the Braun Series 9. What I found was an abysmal lack of information with respect to this series in particular. Obviously because it is Braun&#x27;s latest and greatest and most people hadn&#x27;t really gotten their hands on it State-side just yet. I had a ton of questions though and no one place really answered them. Now that I have the razor and have been using it for about a week, I&#x27;m excited to be able to share the answers to my questions with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by saying I am a life-long cartridge razor user. I never made the jump to electric because I had always heard that the shave wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as close, the cuts were worse (entirely false apparently), and it just wasn&#x27;t as comfortable. That&#x27;s what I heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with the Braun Series 9 9090cc was a little rough because of the above, the fact that I&#x27;d never used an electric before. I didn&#x27;t know what spots would need more pressure, less pressure, a few passes, etc. I even watched a video on how to shave with an electric! I found myself doing a cursory pass, leaving the bathroom and having to go back several times to get those spots that I missed. I also started with a solid 3-4 day beard. On me, that growth is near entirely invisible because of my hair color, but it’s present, uncomfortable and even a little thick, so I figured it’d be a good test. I was right. Eventually I wound up with what I would consider a comfortable shave that was NEARLY as close as what I could get with a cartridge razor with shaving cream. Considering I thought I’d be walking around with a bit of a shadow, I was highly impressed, and no stubble unless I really pulled at my skin in spots that are generally a pain even with a cart razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next few shaves improved in both accuracy and time to complete. I am now to the point where I can knock out a nice clean shave in about 3 minutes. I’m also shaving with much less fear of cutting myself. Essentially because I feel like it’s pretty much not even possible. I have been stretching, pulling and digging into my face to get a nice clean shave for a week or so now and I’m just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 9 9090cc brings a good deal of value to the table on top of a nice clean shave that you can even take on the go. The shaver comes with a locking / unlocking tilt head that plays very nice with the curves of your face. It comes with a trimmer for tight spots, side burns, etc. So far I have had good success with the trimmer in keeping my lines straight. On top of that, you get a charging / cleaning base and a single cleaning cartridge, estimated to last approximately 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base cradles and cleans the razor when not in use while using an alcohol based solution from the cleaning cartridge inserted in the bottom of the base. It should be noted that the charging base requires to be plugged in (when charging), and that it takes up a little bit of space. If you have a small bathroom with limited outlets, this could get tricky. There isn’t a law that says it needs to be in the bathroom, but common sense puts it there most times. Following the instructions, after a shave, you should remove the head of the razor, use the included brush to sweep out any easily accessible loose remaining hairs, re-connect the head and then place head down in the cleaning center. With the touch of a button, the cleaner goes to work and 3 minutes later, you get a near surgically fresh electric shaver clean as the day it was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner cartridges can be found for about $19.32 for 4. Braun Clean &amp; Renew 2 Cartridges Consider that about $4.83 per month to maintain your razor. When held up against cartridges (about 4 per month at $16 per pack), the cost for shave per month is a heck of a value, if you discount the initial cost of entry. At $350, some may find the Series 9 9090cc a bitter pill to swallow, but the month-over-month savings are definitely a teaspoon of honey to help the medicine go down. Just a little math for you. If you use this vs. cartridges, the razor pays for itself in 55 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being raised on cartridge razors, and now stunned by how well this works leaves me with a bit of planning and strategizing to do I think. A cartridge shave with shaving cream is baby’s butt smooth. Electric a little less so. I think my plan go forward is to continue using the electric during the week, and go with a wet cartridge shave over the weekend. That should keep cost down, time less, and shaves comfortably close week over week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned at the start of this that I had questions. I have answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Can you shave wet with the series 9 9090cc? The short answer is no. The long answer is that Series 9 from Braun has two wet razors, the 9095 and the 9040. However, at the risk of voiding the warranty on my shiny new $350 razor, I tried a wet shave. I wasn’t electrocuted and the razor came nice and clean after a cleaning cycle. The shave was also comfortable and familiar to a cartridge shave. I make no testament to the long term wear that this may cause. I’m sure any defects resultant to this kind of use will void warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Do electric razors shave as closely as cartridge or disposable razors? Almost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you slip with an electric razor, can you cut yourself terribly and need to go to the hospital? I’m pretty sure you won’t be able to do that. But if you do, the number is still 911.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Are the cleaning cartridges refillable vs. re-purchase-able? See my previous notes on warranty. There are countless recipes to hack your cleaning cartridge online. Using them will assuredly void your warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Do you need to replace the razor blades for an electric shaver? Yep. “Braun recommends changing your shaver’s foil &amp; cutter block every 18 months to maintain your shaver’s maximum performance.” A replacement foil and cutter block is about $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Is it easy to shave with an electric? It is something I can stand in front of a mirror and do. Missing spots drives me nuts, and if I’m not at a mirror, I miss spots. I can’t understand how I have seen men driving and using an electric razor, but it happens. These men are brave professionals and I commend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 9 9090cc is a great electric razor. I say with honesty that I don’t have any other electric shaver to compare it to, but when matched against my normal shaving regiment of shaving cream and cartridge razor, it holds up well and it will supplement my weekly shaving routine in a way that will save time and cost. I can’t ask for a lot more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;I have now had the Braun Series 9 9090 long enough to feel like it&#x27;s part of my routing. Now, it is part of my routing. I shave with the 9090 5 days a week, and do one close shave with a cartridge razor and shave gel for that super clean feeling once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 5 days, I&#x27;m comfortable, my shave is close, my skin is smooth to the touch. No in-grown hairs, no cuts, not even skin irritation. I feel great, confident and look presentable on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the shave time tends to take only a little bit less time than a wet cartridge shave, but the cost savings are already being felt. Saving on cream, saving on razors, saving on water! The razor has remained pretty much as clean as un-boxing day thanks to it&#x27;s cleaning base. I am still using my first cartridge. I run the cleaning cycle every second or third shave and so far I&#x27;m very very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t persisted my use in wet shaving, the dry shave is really very nice and close and leaves my skin happy. If you are on the fence about picking up a Braun Series 9 shaver,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the price is a little scary, and I come from a place where I got mine for free from BzzAgent, but if I didn&#x27;t, now knowing about electric shaving, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a fantastic package of convenience and good shaving!rmance.” A replacement foil and cutter block is about $60.  6.

    <li> I received this shaver as part of a promotion from Braun.  It did NOT influence this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get straight to the point, the Braun Series 9090 shaver is one phenomenal shaver.  I have an incredibly coarse/thick beard and most electric shavers I have tried have a tough time cutting the hair on my chin.  They bog down and sometimes painfully pull or pinch the hairs instead of cutting them.  In addition, they do a poor job of cutting the hair on my neck which tends to like to lay down as opposed to stand up and allow itself to be cut.  Happy to report that my coarse thick beard and uncooperative neck hair were no match for the cutting panache of the Braun Series 9090 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To really put the 9090 to the test, I tried it on 3 days of beard growth.  After all, it says right on the box that it&#x27;s rated for 3 days of growth!  Although it took some time to shave my entire face (you have to work slowly), the Braun 9090 cleaned up my face without issue.  It easily trapped and cut the longer hairs on my face.  To my delight, my thick beard never bogged down the cutting head of the shaver.  Further, it was able to grab and cut the hairs on my neck that like to lay down.  It shows right on the box how Braun has engineered the cutting head specifically to cut in many different directions, and also to trap and stand upright those pesky little hairs on your neck that will give most other electric razors problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon completion, I placed the 9090 into its charging/cleaning stand and pressed the clean buttton.  The stand comes with an alcohol reservoir which cleans the entire cutting head of the shaver.  This gives you a &#x27;just out of the box&#x27; shave, every time you use this razor.  A cool feature of this cleaning system is that upon completion of the cleaning cycle, a fan kicks on that will dry the blades completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m super impressed with this razor.  I&#x27;m retiring my old elecric razor in favor of the Braun Series 9090 shaver.  Highly recommend for any electric shaver aficionados.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!haver aficionados.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> pretty awesome shaver. I upgraded from a regualr vibrate style schick shaver to one of these bad boys. It really gives an extremely close shave on my face and neck. It even gets the baby hairs on your neck. Maintenance is a breeze as well. The whole unit looks really good sitting on my bathroom counter. I&#x27;m really enjoying this shaver. My one and only gripe would be that the cord could&#x27;ve been longer, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to minus a star. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as a promotion from Braun. I&#x27;m not giving it praise for this reason, however. I&#x27;m not afraid to give a critical review for products I receive from manufacturers.  This shaver deserves a good review, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a safety razor, but I am always intrigued by electric shavers. Every razor and shaver I have used disappoints me because I am spoiled by my safety razor. The Braun Series 9 is finally a great alternative for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the first Braun Series shaver with self-cleaning features years ago. I must say that the Braun Series 9 is much better. I have a beard, but I do shave the area from where my chin meets my neck downwards. As you know, this is a difficult place to shave because the hair grows upwards and sometimes in other directions. I found that I had to use several passes to get all of the hair the first time I used it, but I did have a few days of growth, so I cannot blame the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I know, though, is that the shaver does need to learn my facial hair and skin. The second day I used it, the shave did a better job of cutting the hair. It still struggled just a touch with grabbing some of the hairs. I found that I really needed to pull my skin tight and move the shavers in multiple directions to get some of the longer-length stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I use the shaver more, it gets easier to use, which is really kind of amazing. For the first time, I have a shaver that doesn&#x27;t give me bumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Definitely follow the directions and shave before you wash your face. The oils on your face help the shaver to glide. My skin gets irritated if I shave after a shower and the shaver doesn&#x27;t glide as well across my face.&lt;br /&gt;2. Be careful of longer hair. I had a few times where the shaver grabbed the longer beard hairs and pulled on them painfully.&lt;br /&gt;3. Trim down longer hairs before using the shaver in order to get a closer shave&lt;br /&gt;4. Follow the directions and pull your skin tight to get the best shave with the fewest passesn tight to get the best shave with the fewest passes</li>
    <li> This shaver is definitely great, you can tell its built to last just by how it feels in your hand. Quality materials and a solid feel are your first thoughts when unboxing the shaver. One thing that should be made clear to anyone deciding to purchase, the cleaner base is large and requires ample ample space near an electrical outlet. You will also need to purchase additional cleaner packs to replenish after you run out and these run for about 25 bucks for 3. Now as far as a shaver goes I am a complete face and head shaver, meaning as a balding male I use this shaver to keep my head clean as well as my face. It does a very good job keeping a close neat shave, does not nick or pinch my skin and has a very helpful trimmer for my goatie. I do however feel that at this price point(over 300 hundred bucks) it could be even better. I do not feel a completely smooth stubble free shave by touch but in the mirror there is no visible hair. The cleaner is a great feature but is very load so keep that in mind if you plan on running it at night with kids or people sleeping. Overall this is a great shaver, Braun continues to set the bar very high. This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used and the best part is I received this shaver as part of a promotion from Braun and BzzAgent! Lucky me &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> After using the Braun Series 9 shaver for a week, it has definitely lived up to the claims of not destroying my face or shaving in agony after 3 days of beard growth. It had to live up to a tall standard as I was using the previous top model of Braun. While it has slimmed down in design, it is far more comfortable to hold, and works really well on my face with a full beard. It is gentle to not snag beard hair that I want to retain, but gives a close smooth shave each time.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of design features, one minor, the other more important. The trimmer in the rear of the device is smaller than previous models, so it takes longer to use on a full face. Works well, but more time consuming, minor detail. More importantly  the charging and cleaning station is much lower material craftsmanship than previous models. It literally broke when I attempted to connect the charging cord to the station! I had to disassemble the station and reconnect everything. Perhaps just a one off issue, but not fun when you receive a new toy and want to use it. One the plus side, much prettier and MUCH quieter than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I believe The Braun Series 9 Shaver is simply outstanding.  So grateful to have this in my hand in a daily basis to give me the professional look I need every morning.  The feel of the Braun Series 9 feels great in my hand while I&#x27;m doing my morning shave,  So simple to use.  The Braun Series 9 is just another example of Braun continuing its quality for us guys trying to get our day started.  My wife seems to have no complaints about the smooth face I get from the Braun Series 9  shaver.</li>
    <li> Not the best of the electric razors I have used. It may be me in particular, however, none of them seem to be able to get my neck close enough. I have several other razors that work just as well at a lower cost. This one does have some more features than others, but operated like a swiss army knife. The battery hold a better charge than most. Not that this razor is all bad, I just feel it&#x27;s not the best option for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun 9090 electric shaver for a few weeks now (I received this razor as part of a BZZAgent promotion) and overall I think it is a great product, and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first electric razor and I was concerned with it pulling my hair and not giving a close shave but to my surprise my fears were not realized.  I have a full tough beard and have found that while not shaving as close as my five blade cartridge shaver it is very close.  The package states it is good for a three day beard so I gave that a try and it still shaves close without any pulling of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 9090 was easy to open, and included the shaver, cleaning unit, power cord, one Clean &amp; Charge cartridge, a reinforced cloth travel case, cleaning brush, and instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and the cleaning cycle is quick.  I have opened the blade and everything looks very clean after the cleaning cycle and  it is  supposed to kill any germs also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this razor and plan to use this for years to come</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some experience with electric shavers over the last 25 years, including a Braun shaver back in 1989, which was pretty good if you shaved every day but couldn&#x27;t handle more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth. I gave up on electric shavers for a while because I still had to go back an go over some areas with a manual razor. I gave electric shaving another shot when BzzAgent and Braun sent me the new Braun Series 9 (9090cc) shaver to review. The 9090cc is &amp;#34;Braun&#x27;s #1 with Intelligent Syncro Sonic Technology.&amp;#34; Braun states that the Series 9 is their best ever in efficiency and comfort. I was excited to have such state-of-the-art shaving technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this model is waterproof but is not designed to be used in the shower. One thing to note about using electric shavers is that you need to give it at least a week so your face (and beard) get used to it. The shaver head can get a little hot on your face (not so hot that it burns) but there&#x27;s definitely some friction with your skin as it&#x27;s cutting the hairs. My first observation was that the Braun 9090 has a large shaver head and covers a lot of surface area - great if you have a large face and you&#x27;re making quick passes over large areas but for me it felt much too big. Two foil heads (OptiFoil) and two trimmers (lift &amp; cut and direct &amp; cut) made this shaver somewhat cumbersome. I liked the flexibility of the shaving head and also the option to lock it in a variety of positions (I think 5), which is useful on certain areas of my face. The foils and trimmers all float freely with the contours of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 9090 has a nice design and feel, and there&#x27;s no doubt that it&#x27;s built of quality materials with precision fit and finish. The blue LED display, power button and ergonomic feel really screamed &amp;#34;quality.&amp;#34; Bonus points for including a really nice travel pouch! The unit charges quickly using the power cord and also charges when it&#x27;s in the clean &amp; charge station. I was a little skeptical of the clean &amp; charge station; another thing on my countertop and cleaning cartridges that I now have to buy. This was pretty new to me, as none of the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned had a cleaning station. To my surprise, I really liked the clean &amp; charge station. My shaver was spotless and dry after a cleaning cycle, and it had a pleasant, refreshing smell. According to Braun, it also lubricates the shaver with each cleaning. Very nice feature despite the periodic cost of the cleaning cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it work? Well, as I expected (for past experience), I got a close smooth shave with some missed spots on my neck and jaw line. After a few minutes of operation and multiple passes on my face, the shaver head got a little warm with the 10,000 micro vibrations that Braun claims. They also claim that there 40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute but I still had some trouble spots after multiple passes. For the record, I only shave down with a manual razor and can get a reasonably close shave without irritating my skin by shaving up against the grain. I had to keep that in mind because with any electric razor, you&#x27;re shaving &amp;#34;up,&amp;#34; which should result in a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day I noticed that I had a bit of razor rash, some of which looked like pimples, around my chin, mustache and mouth. Fear not - I was going to give this a week or two until my sensitive skin could tolerate this new shaving method. With each passing day, the shaver left a little less noticeable irritation to my skin. I used the Braun 9090 each day to tackle my medium-heavy beard with just a day&#x27;s growth. By the first weekend (and 6 uses), I took a day off and gave my face a rest. The following day, I used the shaver and found that it plowed through the extra growth in the larger area of my face but couldn&#x27;t handle the tight spots near my sideburns, underneath my jaw and my neck. That&#x27;s not to say it missed it all, but it was definitelyspotty. I honestly think if the shaving head was smaller, it would work a little (or a lot) better. But I don&#x27;t have a giant face and I would imagine the Braun would have a hard time on a really angular face as well. It took about the same amount of time as shaving with a manual razor, so there was not convenience benefit beyond just getting a dry shave and not having to use water or shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend it? It depends. If you like a hot shave in the shower, than no. This is not a wet/dry shaver. If you shave every single day and have a medium to light beard, then yes. If you have a small face or a heavy beard, then it&#x27;s a toss-up. You&#x27;ll probably have to make a couple quick passes with a manual razor to do a little more &amp;#34;clean-up.&amp;#34; The Braun Series 9 9090cc is a quality product in every regard. As someone who likes to shave in the shower when the steam can open my pores, the Braun was a change to my routine but something I was willing to do for convenience and for a closer shave. My biggest gripes are the size of the shaving head, no wet usage, and patchy spots in tough areas.head was smaller, it would work a little (or a lot) better.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this wonderful shaver now for over a month courtesy of a promotional evaluation from the Braun company.  This is truly an exceptional product and kudos should go out to Braun for offering such a high quality men&#x27;s shaver.  I never thought an electric razor would be invented that could actually handle my extreme beard.  This 9090 series 9 model shaves my face to near perfection, only leaving a trace amount of stubble on my throat/ neck line.  Once a week or so I still like to shave with traditional razor and shaving cream just to smooth out a few rough patches.  This shaver is leaps and bounds ahead of shavers made in the past.  The intelligent Syncro-Sonic blade technology was an invention decades in the making, us with heavy beards had to be patient for years waiting for this system.  This shaver doesn&#x27;t come cheap ($350-$400), but in the long run may save you money on disposable razors and shaving cream.  If you can afford this unique shaver and are tired of the shaving cream/razor routine by all means purchase it and be prepared for one of the great shavers ever produced.</li>
    <li> I received this as a review model from Bzz Agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me get to the point. This shaver like other reviews say will give a great shave even with the roughest skin. I don&#x27;t moisturize and my workplace environment is really harsh and dry. I thought I would test the Braun Series 9 shavers&#x27; mettle by letting a few days go by between shaves and checking the results of the the ensuing shave. Even after a few weeks this shaver is still giving me great shaves. Surprisingly it was still a great shave. No irritation or itching after the shave which was a main complaint of mine of other electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Next I would have to say the looks are attractive and would match many decor. It looks manly and doesn&#x27;t detract from its environment. I like that about it. If I am going to have something in my bathroom, on my side, I want something that looks great. The Braun Series 9 has looks to spare.&lt;br /&gt;If there is any gripes about this shaver, it would probably be that when it is cleaning (a pretty short cycle about 3 minutes) it is loud. The drying cycle though is fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;In short I really like this shaver. It gives great shaves beyond the daily toil and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, but I have been a Braun user for years. I cannot say enough about this shaver. It has the fastest blade of any shaver that I have ever owned, and that equates to a clean and fast shave. The head has 2 settings. You can lock it into place, or you can set it at free floating. The free floating setting allows the head to move and adjust to the curves of your face and neck. It gives the closest shave of any electric shaver that I have ever owned. It also has a trimmer, on the backside, for shaping and trimming. It&#x27;s great for sideburns and beards. Finally, it comes with it&#x27;s own cleaning system. This is great for those of us who are to lazy to manually clean our shavers. Just push a button and the shaver vibrates, as cleaning solution is released into the shaver. This ensures that the shaver is not only clean of debris, but also sanitized. It&#x27;s a great shaver, at a great price. If you&#x27;re like me, and just love the convenience of an electric shaver, then this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 9 series is by far the best looking shaver I have ever seen or owned.  Its base is sleek.  In addition, the silver shaver is beautiful and elegant.  It looks like a premium appliance but for your bathroom.  The product also comes with a brush and a cleaning agent to maintaining the shaver.  The Braun does a decent job of providing a close shave.  Over the coming months will provide the real questions we all want answered.  This Braun 9 series shaver is a premium shaver that doesn&#x27;t come cheap.  Therefore, as a consumer I want to know how will this shaver hold up over time.  Can it last years without burning out the motor, losing its 50 minute charge ability, or the blades becoming too dull to shave.  Over the next few months I will post other reviews to explain how this shaver holds up over time.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this product from a campaign by Braun and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the Braun Series 9090 electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;I love the cleaning feature the best, when you are finished shaving, simply return shaver to its base, push the clean button, and it does the rest. Feels like a new razor after every cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The one down side for me was the head. Bulky and not very nimble.&lt;br /&gt;Head does have a locking feature that comes in handy.</li>
    <li> I feel the Intelligent Sonic Technology combining with the Pivoting shaving head and Flexible cutting elements really helps and made shaving easy since it takes less time for me to shave with Braun Series 9090 because of the lesser passes needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the new Clean &amp; Charge Station has the option for fast clean. Previous model I used only have the complete clean option and it takes a long time for the shaver to be clean and dried.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using blades for many years, and, frankly, shaving that way has become a tedious – yet necessary – chore.  So I was pretty stoked about being given the opportunity to use the Braun 9090cc as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I was really surprised by how quickly the shaver reached a full charge: right out of the box, it took no more than an hour!  Secondly, I found this shaver to be a well-balanced instrument that really felt good in my hand.  For my first shave with the 9090cc I decided to give it a good test: so I tried after not having shaved for 3 days.  I may have had to spend a little more time shaving, but the Braun 9090cc did a good job with no discomfort in spite of having to cut through 3 days of growth!  The trimmer is located on the back of instrument, and when in the raised position offers plenty of clearance to see what you are doing.  Lastly, cleanup was a breeze: simply rinse the shaver’s head under hot running water, then remove the head to let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, there are guys who have a beard thicker than mine, but mine is plenty challenging for any electric shaver; and the Braun 9090cc is a great shaver.  It out-performs any electric I&#x27;ve ever used.  While it does not give me as close of a shave as I get from a blade, it can quickly give me a decent shave.</li>
    <li> I received this Braun Series 9 9090cc electric shaver for review through BzzAgent a company that coordinates product reviews and reports results back to manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Braun shaver is their top of the line item with a floating and cross-cutting shaving head. In using it I found It adjusts easily to the contours of the face especially the upper neck and jawline. They have worked extra hard to provide a comfortable hold while shaving with a front thumb cradle and the back side has a no-skid area where your other fingers hold the shaver as you move slowly about your face. This provides a very comfortable experience relaxing your hold and your wrist while shaving. My hand felt relaxed after use and no numbness or anything like that on the hand. The shaver does not need hard pressing, in fact, it won’t work as well if you press too hard, as I did the first couple of times.. The extra long trimmer is long enough to clear the shaving head with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 9 comes with a charging station which includes a self-cleaning reservoir. The shaver is stored upside down in the slot and quickly recharges automatically and in the same position it can be automatically cleaned by hitting the on button. It also comes with a hard case for travel and a small brush to use on the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SKINNY: This shaver is perfect if you have a heavy beard in the morning and rushed out for work. It only works ok on light beards. It won&#x27;t provide a smooth shave like a great brush-applied lather shave, but there is no electric shaver that will do that. There will also be an an added expense to having to replace the head cleaning solution cartridge every couple of months or sooner.</li>
    <li> Edit: I tried this product as part of a promotional campaign. Here&#x27;s my two cents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: I have almost always used the traditional rotary electric razors, which I had found gave me a better, closer shave. I was wary about the special foils and the 4-way shaving system; it seemed at first too much like another Gillette-esque gimmick. However, after shaving several times with the Braun Series 9, I must confess that I have found that not only does it truly pick up those difficult hairs on the first pass, it also excels in reaching those difficult areas like the chin and neck; this is a big deal for me! Also, the foils are easily removed for quick cleaning, and the trimmer mechanism is clean and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutral: The cleaning station. While a neat feature (essentially what it does is bathe the foils in an alcohol solution for cleaning and disinfecting) it&#x27;s not something I would pay the extra bucks for--a quick rinse every so often has always worked great for me. As long as I&#x27;m the only one using it, I don&#x27;t feel a need for deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: The Braun Series 9 is not travel size. It is certainly the largest electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned--it does come with a nice zip up travel case though. If you plan on using it exclusively at home, this is obviously not an issue. Also, the lock for adjusting the head angle is right at the spot where you put your thumb when you hold it, and it too easily comes unlocked while you shave, allowing the head to move around too much.</li>
    <li> First of all i must say this is absolutely best shaver i have ever used.When Buzzagent&#x27;s sent me the Braun Series 9 to try i was very hesitant.Mostly because i have a great barber who cleans my face with a straight razor and for years i thought this was the way to a great shave.Until last week when i used the Braun and i was blown away not only did it cleaned better but it was painless and the best part no cuts,no razor bumps and no after affect.I take my hat off to buzzagents for introducing me to this wonderful product and to Braun for finally having a product which is awesome for us African American males with sensitive skin.Good job guys you have a consumer  for life</li>
    <li> After receiving the Braun Series 9 shaver as part of a promotion all I can say is that I continue to be impressed.  Out of the box the shaver is fantastic looking.  Sleek and well built, it is a precision shaver.  I&#x27;ve used their shavers before and I continue to be impressed with how close of a shave you can get with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head really does a great job on the transition from your chin and cheeks to your neck.  I have sensitive skin and because of the multiple razors on the head of this shaver I didn&#x27;t have time to get skin irritation because it cuts so well.  Additionally, I love how the charging base also cleans the razor so that I&#x27;m always using a clean and sanitary razor.  Speaking of the cleaning base, it does a great job at keeping it clean and even goes as far as drying it after the end of the cleaning cycle.  My only complaint is that the cleaning base is a little noisy and the cleaning cycle is a lot longer than in previous shavers from Braun that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this Series 9 shaver really does deliver on a close shave in a quick amount of time.  I would definitely recommend!  Thanks, Braun!</li>
    <li> I have been trying  the braun series 9 shaver for about 2 weeks which i received as a promotion from Braun through bzzagent website, and I am impressed with a lot of aspects that this razor has that makes different than others, to start this, I have very curly hair and beard that almost always gets ingrown hairs and folliculitis after every razor shave, I have experienced less of that since using this razor, but I still do get some, however using this shaver I have gotten the cleanest and best shave compared to other brands like  Phillips, but this razor still leaves some hair that seems impossible to remove no matter how meticulous or slow I use it. I like the cleaning deck which does an excellent job in keeping the shaver clean and charging it at the same time. I think his razor is perfect for someone with thick beard but with hair that is more straight than mine. Overall it is truly one of the best that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 9 Shaver as part of a promotion from Braun and BzzAgent to test and review. The Series 9 9090 provided the highest quality shave I&#x27;ve had in an electric shaver. On my first use, I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days, and the Braun Series 9 had no problems giving a close shave and left me with no irritated skin. The part that left me most impressed was the speed in which it worked. In just a couple of minutes I had a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;On the counter, the chrome looks good and I don&#x27;t feel the need to hide it in a drawer when it&#x27;s not in use or charging. The base cleans the head of the razor ensuring each use feels like the first.&lt;br /&gt;The head swivels which allows constant contact with my skin, even in the odd curves on my neck or under my nose. The body of the shave has solid weight and is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Braun shavers before, but the Series 9 has increased in quality over the prior versions in functionality and design.</li>
    <li> I was offered to test this shaver from  promotional campaign from the brand and as soon as I received the package, I ripped the package open put the shaver to charge at the very first outlet I could find, the base and the shaver fit snugly together I didn&#x27;t even have to read the manual, well shaver was FLAT no power at all so I had to patiently wait for a full charge while reading the manual. 1 hour late my shaver was blinking green and green means GO!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flew up in front of a mirror with a 4-5 day beard, ill put this puppy to a test, lets see if it can handle a MANS face, not this 3 day promise as it was saying online and on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BZZZZZ BZZZZZ BZZZZZ BZZZZ 10 minutes later I was still shaving just because it was fun to play with my new toy from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt my skin it was smooth not razor smooth maybe I expected too much from a shaver, I had to use a razor over my Adams apple, I was kinda disappointed shouldn&#x27;t this clear all this especially after shaving for 10 minutes. I put the shaver to clean, popped off the head with a click of a button and tapped it on the sink, it sure was full of stubble, I put the shaver in the base again and it recommended a 3 drop clean cycle so I kicked that off. I waited 2 days before my next shave, just wanted to see how my skin reacted, NOT A MARK or RASH which is nice I always get a little rash from a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second shave was easy and it took everything I had grown, even the Adams apple problem from before so it seems that the 3 day beard guarantee counts for me too, this shaver will leave you smooth if your beard is no older than 3 days, it will not leave you with baby smooth skin, that still takes a razor but it does the job to perfection as expected from a shaver and the big plus is the non irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why isn&#x27;t this rated 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t leave a baby-face shave which I kinda expected from a high end shaver, BUT it does give a clean shave without foam, gel, hot water and expensive razor-blades so its really a question about preference, I CHOOSE Braun,  the skin irritation vs a very small stubble i can deal with that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomasquestion about preference, I CHOOSE Braun,  the skin irritation vs a very small stubble i can deal with that  Thomas</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as part of a promotion from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I am normally a blade user, and haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in quite some time. I have a light beard , and generally shave only a few times per week.&lt;br /&gt;My past experience with electrics was not particularly favorable, but I was looking forward to trying this product as everything I&#x27;ve ever heard about the Braun brand has been positive.&lt;br /&gt;I received my Braun 9090cc about a week ago, and it came with the the shaver, cleaning unit, power cord, one Clean &amp; Charge cartridge, a reinforced cloth travel case, cleaning brush, and instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is made in Germany, has a matte gray plastic front, is comfortable to hold, and light, but solidly built. The cleaning somewhat bulky, and takes up some room on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shaver several times, and it provides a smooth, fast and comfortable shave. Even with the rather large shaver head, I was able to shave all parts of my face with ease. Though I did have to go over a couple of trouble spots repeatedly to get all the whiskers shaven. This is not unlike virtually all other electrics I have used. Additionally, this product is a bit noisier than most of the electrics I have used.&lt;br /&gt;As with most other shavers I have used, the trimmer is awful. Positioned as it is, flush with the rear of the shaver head, it is nearly impossible to see what you are trimming, and as a result offers imprecision and difficulty in maneuvering.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning unit, while bulky, operates fantastically. It cleans, disinfects and dries the shaver in about 45 minutes, and does so pretty quietly and efficiently. If you are travelling, or simply don&#x27;t want to use the cleaning unit, this shaver can be rinsed under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Braun 9090cc. While it probably won&#x27;t make me abandon my blades altogether, this product is now an excellent option for those mornings that I just want a quick, smooth, comfortable shave without the hassle of using blades. The Braun 9090cc has most certainly changed my negative outlook on electric shavers - I am definitely a convert.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cleaning unit&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Excellent battery life, and a quick charge&lt;br /&gt;Tremendous craftmanship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Horrible trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Expensive at $350+&lt;br /&gt;Not usable wet, with gels and foams&lt;br /&gt;A little on the noisy sidehout the hassle of using blades.

    <li> I have gone through multiple electric razors and this one is by far the best I have ever used. I received this razor as part of a promotion, similar to others, and I always have a couple spots that I couldn&#x27;t get but the Braun Series 9 solves all those problem spots! I am truly thrilled and can&#x27;t wait to use this everyday in the near future. For anyone thinking about whether this is a shaver for you, trust me it is.</li>
    <li> I have been using my new razor for a week and a half now and here is what I think about the newest in BrAun&#x27;s product line, the Series 9 9090cc. I have used regular straight edge razors, (cheaper ones and the more expensive kind) and several different electric razors in my life. My &amp;#34;newest&amp;#34; one was a BrAun series 1 which I have used for years and loved. But when I recieved my new Series 9 9090cc I could not wait to try it out. Unfortunately I had to wait since I had just shaved prior to recieving the package, aghh! The series 9 gives me a perfect, tight shave. It gets all of my facial hairs, no matter what direction they are growing in or what lenght they are. Those are issues I have always had with other electrics, not  with the series  9. I do not get finger numbness from prolonged use and vibration, since I can shave much quicker now than before, and the vibration of the shaver is incredibly much more subtle, more like a massage. Three different, wide shave heads get all types of hair in one or two passes, and they move independently to the contours of your face . The battery charges in about an hour,has a niffty LED display to show me it&#x27;s charge and you can  charge it in an emergency in only five minutes, though I have not have had to do this yet even after a week of use. It comes with a carrying pouch and a cleaning brush that you will probably never ever need to use, since it includes a cleaning station that cleans and sanitizes the razor thoroughly after every use, and it also dries the blades with a built in fan. The trimmer works great, and I especially like it&#x27;s new back facing mount, which makes it easier to get those pesky sideburns and mustaches into proper  shape. It has a special power lock function which keeps it from being turned on by accidentally pushing the power button, which is great for when you travel. I even love it&#x27;s chrome and satin black look, it&#x27; like it was made for the terminator :) . I can Honestly say, just as about any other guy out there who has to shave constantly, that I have never looked forward to the daily grind of having to shave. Until now. This is hands down, the best shaving experience I have ever had, period. In my opinion, there are only three  &amp;#34;downsides&amp;#34; to this shaver. I find that many times as I shave, I inadvertently flip up the swivel head button because of it&#x27;s placement. Also the cleaning solution is not exactly inexpensive and you will need to replace it about every eight weeks. Finally, it&#x27;s about a $300 investment, that will hopefully will come down with time.&lt;br /&gt;To sum it all up: Pros&#x3D;&#x3D; EVERYTHING, close shave, fast, beautiful, cleaning station, multiple wide heads, long battery life, battery power indicator, power lock travel function.  Cons- in reality, just the price tag about $300, and you will have to spend a little for the comfort of always having a fresh, clean shave using the cleaning solution, not a bad trade I believe.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I want to say that even though I have recieved the product as a special promotion from Braun, my review has been as thorough and honest as I could have possibly have made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used the shaver for almost three weeks now, I still have to say that is hands down the best electric shaver I have ever used. It cleans itself, four different shaver heads get to all my facial hairs, it&#x27;s so fast that it&#x27;s like getting a mini massage as you shave, it&#x27;s ergonomic and overall a beautiful product. The only cons to this product that I have been able to ascertain: it&#x27;s not cheap, at over $300, but this is a treat for your face, so not necessarily a con if you hate shaving; you will have to spend some money periodically to replace the cleaning cartridges, but again, the flip side is using a newly cleaned shaver every time. The biggest drawback for me, is the multi-head lock switch and pivoting head: the switch is placed exactly where I place my thumb while shaving, so I have to be extra careful not to push on it while shaving or I inadvertently release the head. Also the head of the shaver, I find if I press just a little too much and not even that strongly, it releases from the lock and pivots by itself as I shave. This last point might be the big issue for me. Will the head assembly eventually fail because it can&#x27;t remain easily locked while shaving? That is the big question, and considering what you will have to pay for this product, it is THE big question in my mind. I give it a 4.5 out of 5 just because of the shaver head locking issue and nothing else. Overall still love this shavershaving or I inadvertently release the head.

    <li> I&#x27;ve had three or four electric razors in the past, but all pale in comparison to the Series 9!  I have a full beard on my face (and mustache), but  keep my neck and above the cheekbones clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, I&#x27;ve been using a Gillete Fusion ProGlide whilst in the shower, which adds a good 5 - 10 minutes of shower time.  Now I can shave in the car or while doing something else- saving time and water!&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is fairly quiet for an electric razor.  The head of the razor can pivot (or not!) at the push of a button, making it perfect for following the contours of your face and neck. I thought the carrying case was a nice touch also, keeps me from worrying about the shaver&#x27;s foil getting damaged while in my travel bag!  The &amp;#34;docking station&amp;#34; and cleaning solution keep the razor charged and clean whenever I need it.  The cleaner motor is a little loud for my tastes, but I guess that really isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Normally when I switch from shaving with a regular razor blade on my neck, to an electric one, I usually end up with some ingrown hairs or beard bumps.  Not this time though! I do occasionally still get a yanked out beard-hair if I get to close to my beard with the side of the razor foil. Also, if I go 2-3 days without shaving, I&#x27;ve found the razor is a little uncomfortable to use - pulling more than cutting the hairs.  But I don&#x27;t normally go that long without a shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t seem to have to go over my neck as many times as I used to with other electric shavers - to get that nice clean shave.  Also, I haven&#x27;t noticed any missed hairs either.  Just a great shave.  Very happy that I received this razor as a tester for BzzAgent.com.  Not sure I&#x27;d be willing to put down $350+ of my own money for it though. The cleaning solution is under $20 for a four pack, so that seems pretty reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;One other point - the razor looks great and it feels very nice in your hand.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and looks and seems to be very well assembled from nice plastics and metals.  I wish the stand/cleaner wasn&#x27;t that piano-black plastic that easily pics up finger prints and smudges though.ems to be very well assembled from nice plastics and metals.  I wish the stand/cleaner wasn&#x27;t that piano-black plastic that easily pics up finger prints and smudges though.</li>
    <li> First of all, I received the Braun Series 9 as a promotion to review the shaver. With that said, I&#x27;d like to say that this is the best electric razor I have ever used. Heres a list of the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It takes less passes to shave, does not tug on longer beard hair (just in case I miss an day or two of shaving), and it gets extremely close! It is very easy to maintain as most maintenance is done by the docking station. The shaver itself is very quiet and  extremely comfortable on the skin. I have not experienced any razor burn or irritation even after passing over a spot repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I really had only two major cons with the product. The first being that the trimmer on the back of the razor is not so good. I&#x27;ve tried different ways to get it to cut in my sideburns well, but to no avail. At this price range I would expect better performance from the trimmer. Secondly, the docking station is quite loud when cleaning the shaver. I&#x27;m afraid to set it to clean if there are people are still sleeping. I have tried multiple ways to muffle the sound but it is still loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;This razor is definitely top tier, but the price range is a little high for what you get. I&#x27;ve used another electric razor that was less than a third of price of this razor and can get pretty decent results. Overall it is a great electric razor and cuts down my shaving time in the mornings by half. It is the easiest razor I have ever maintained and it cuts almost as close as an actual razor blade without all the razor burn and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4/5 stars. Great razor, but lost a star for the subpar trimmer, steep price, and loud cleaning cycle. If those minor issues were improved, this would get 5/5 stars any day. I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a high end shaver that&#x27;s going to get the job done right, the first time.</li>
    <li> Note: I received this razor as part of a promotional offer from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaver I have owned so far.  The multiple hi-tech foils give me a smooth shave without skin irritation, even with a 3 day beard.  I also like how it doesn&#x27;t take a bunch of passes to get everything, like many other electric razors I&#x27;ve tried.  The auto-cleaning feature is great too.  Only downside is the cleaner refills are a little pricey. Definitely found my new favorite razor.</li>
    <li> What a machine. This beast touches all contours and crevices on my face. I even got it for free. It;s like this thing was built for the strongest men. The hairiest men who love to shave from head to toe. It can do all that for you. But it only gets four stars which I will now delve into. When you are welding such a powerful tool, what do you do when shaving your face is not enough? What happens when you need more?  When holding the ultimate hair remover tool, you&#x27;re mind starts to wander to other areas. It was like I wasn&#x27;t in control. Standing in front of the mirror my eyes ventured up. Would I look good with a shaved head? Hmm. I turned the razor on. The whirr got louder as it passed by my ear. I stopped. What was I doing? I sat the razor down and walked away. I came back and I checked for mind control or hyponotic mechanisms in the razor. Surely there was one. How else had I almost shaved my own head? I put the razor away. It must of have been a momentary lapse in judgement, I decided. That was until I came back to it for my next shave. Once again, shaving my face wasn&#x27;t enough. This machine needed to be put to use. My girlfriend walked by. She might look good with a shaved head. After I realized my thought, I realized it was the razor. It was too good. It worked too well. It was too much for me. I knew what I had to do. I gave it to my girlfriend and asked her to hide it away.I couldn&#x27;t handle it. If you&#x27;re of strong mind and love great razors, this razor is for you. If you are even slightly weak and faint of heart, stay away. This razor has mystical superior powers.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product!!  I was able to try this product for FREE because of a promotion by Braun and bzzagent.com.  I love how close of a shave I get when using this, and how confident I feel after.  I can&#x27;t wait to use this shaver each time I need to shave.</li>
    <li> I received from BzzAgent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 9090 is an excellent electric razor. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but gets closer than any electric shaver I have used on my bald head.&lt;br /&gt;I like the cleaning deck which does an excellent job in keeping the shaver clean and charging at the same time. I think this electric razor is perfect for my thick beard. Overall it is truly one of the best that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Thanks to being a product reviewer for BzzAgent, I got chosen to try out Braun Series 9 9090cc Electric shaver with cleaning center. This is by far the nicest electric razor I have ever had! It provides me with a smooth shave, I have yet to get any ingrown hairs using this.. and the product is so easy to clean! You just plug it in and put the razor on the dock bay. For those of you buying this razor, it is WELL worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This review is based on the Braun Series 9 9090cc Electric Shaver that I was chosen to test, and that I received completely FREE from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 10 years, so I was a little hesitant to test the Braun Series 9 9090cc at first. My old electric shaver would literally pull longer hairs instead of gently cut.&lt;br /&gt;I had no need to worry, Braun has produced an incredible product in the Series 9.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the Box: The Shaver is beautifully designed, perfectly Slim, Solid Build and Weight but not overly heavy, great to hold, you can feel the quality that&#x27;s gone into producing the Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;During the first charge The Shaver was at Full Charge within an hour as stated.&lt;br /&gt;After switching on the shaver a gentle Buzzing sound began, with a delicate vibration, unlike the noisy Shavers of times gone by.&lt;br /&gt;I had 4 days worth of growth on my face so this was definitely a Big test for the Series 9, but I had nothing to worry about, the 4 specialized cutters glided through the long hair and stubble like a knife through butter, quiet a lot of my face was clean in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;I probably spent a good 7 minutes or so shaving, which to me is an incredibly fast shave considering the 4 days of hair and stubble I had on my face. The Series 9 glided effortlessly over the contours of my face, the Shaver did all the hard work, all I did was hold and guide it.&lt;br /&gt;I have sideburns, I couldn&#x27;t get a tight shave right up to the bottom of my side burns but the Long Hair Trimmer made light work of that and a nice tight cut was produced. I did have a couple of ingrowing hairs left over, but I don&#x27;t know of any Shaver that can deal with those, that&#x27;s so minor it&#x27;s hardly worth mentioning really.&lt;br /&gt;In past experience I always found under my nose a tricky place to Shave, but with the locking mechanism on the pivoting head it was very easy to shave in that area, one pass and it was clear of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Not once during the shave did I feel any discomfort, chafing or irritation from the cutters or foil, it really was a surprising and wonderful shaving experience. After shaving there was no redness or sore areas on my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;I checked to see how closely the Specialized Cutting Elements cut the hair, I was surprised to see that it was just as close a cut as I get when I use my disposable razor, I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the Series 9 was a breeze and also very fast, after following the instructions closely I used the small brush to remove stubble, hair and dust from the pivoting head and gently tapped the Foil and Cutter Cassette to remove excess stubble, very simple, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;A small single droplet icon appeared on the shavers display informing me to use the Clean &amp; Charge Station. The Station isn&#x27;t of the same quality as the Shaver itself, but no need to worry, it does exactly what it says on the box, very well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very simple to install the shaver, it fits like a glove in the station, you press one button and the Station goes into automatic Clean mode.&lt;br /&gt;After 2-3 minutes the Cleaning cycle ends and then the Drying fan starts, the Series 9 was Clean, Dry and fully charged again with in an hour, very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Over time you do have to replace the cleaning fluid cartridge, Braun recommend every 8 weeks, but if you thoroughly clean the Shaver with the brush and get out as much hair and dust as possible manually, I think you can make the Cleaning Fluid last a little longer, especially if like me you don&#x27;t shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;On top of everything else provided in the box one extra element that impressed me was the carry case for the Shaver, lightweight but incredibly sturdy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;As far as Pro&#x27;s go, the whole product impressed me, the Look, Feel, Weight, Quality, Shave and Cleaning process of the Series 9 went beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;If there is one slight Con, it would be the Price, at around $400 it might put a few people off, but that really is minor, you&#x27;re paying for a very high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Impressed, and look forward to my next shave.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  My face hasn&#x27;t been this clean since I was a baby.  The shaver is extremely easy to use on the face and cheeks, but can be slightly harder on the neck and mustache.  For someone that likes to shave everyday or every other day, this is a must buy for you.  For those that like to grow a beard, an electric shaver is not for you because it will just take clumps of hair off, and not a clean process.  This electric shaver comes with a cool case and self-cleaning charging station.  It&#x27;s of very premium quality and I think a must-own for any man that likes to shave often and keep his face totally clean.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for over 2 weeks now. I love it more and more with each us. I received this razor from bzzagent for free. As a person who has extremely sensitive skin a  good razor is a must. This razor has made shaving more enjoyable and less hassle.  I love the one hr charge time.  The cleaning cradle is a great thing to have to keep the razor clean. I would recommend this razor to anyone that has sensitive skin or is just looking for a close smooth shave.  Thank you braun</li>
    <li> It has been years since I tried an electric razor so I was very excited to get selected for the Braun Series 9 shaver review squad! Upon receiving the package in the mail, I was eager to get this out of the box, charged up and ready to go for my next shave. Right out of the box, I have to say the razor was much more complicated than the old electric razor I owned in the past. The directions were clear on how to set everything up (including the charging/cleaning station), but I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure I had put everything together correctly. Turns out, I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the charging/cleaning station goes, its fairly large. I don&#x27;t have a very large counter in my bathroom, so this is prohibitive in where I can store the unit. I&#x27;ve had to unplug it and store it in on a shelf which sounds reasonable, but I am concerned about bumping the unit with the cleaning solution in it. This is one area that I would like a smaller base station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself works well. I like the pivoting head and the ease of the cleaning station (when I am able to plug it an and let the several hour cleaning cycle work). Overall, it does a good job, but it just isn&#x27;t the same as a traditional razor and shave gel. I feel that I need to shave every day in order to obtain the same, smooth feeling that I get from a blade.</li>
    <li> I work from home and have a “fuzzy slipper commute” upstairs to my office. I work long hours and honestly… I don’t remember or necessarily need to shave every single day. However, this comes back to bite me when I do need be more presentable to the outside world. The problem after even a few days is that I often end up with uneven stubble and several longer than normal hairs that are really difficult to trim. The second problem is that I often don’t realize that I have not recently shaved and when I finally do, I’m generally already rushed to leave the house. With the Braun Series 9 9090, I can get an amazingly QUICK and straight razor-like CLOSE and SMOOTH shave and I no longer miss those problematic long hairs!  Despite not shaving every day I do care about how I look and a clean shave is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve owned several Braun (and other rotary-based) shavers in the past but the Braun Series 9 (9090) is by far my favorite. When I was asked to review this shaver as a part of a Braun/BzzAgent promotion I was more than willing to experience first-hand how Braun has innovated with their latest model. I was not disappointed and you wont be either! First of all, I was really curious to see how the new shaving head would deal with my uneven stubble. Look at the shaving head difference in the attached picture comparing a few of my older Braun models (the Braun Series 9 9090cc is on the far right).  The Series 9 has FOUR specialized cutting elements. Long, short, thick, thin – it does not matter they all get trimmed and the best part is that it generally takes one or two quick passes of the razor to accomplish the task. With other razors I felt like I was always trying to stand the rouge hair on end to attack it perpendicular to the shaver head.  I honestly didn’t realize how much extra time it was taking me to get a clean shave until I saw the difference with this new shaver. The intelligent &amp;#34;Sonic Technology with 40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute, designed to capture different types of hair&amp;#34; truly delivers!  Perhaps a bit of a nit but it has taken some adjustment to find the “edges” of the cutting blades for areas around my goatee and sideburns for when I want to create a clean and straight line. I would have preferred if the actual shaving head were a bit more compact and less bulbous on the sides. It’s a small issue and I’ve already adjusted to it. It’s kinda like knowing where the front bumper is located on an unfamiliar or new car when you cannot see it over the hood. You adjust and pretty soon it’s the new normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 9, though a bit on the high-end/expensive side, might give some a pause for concern or hesitation. The combination of four cutting elements, the automatic (and easy!) cleaner/charger station and the consistent feeling of a razor-like close shave will not leave you feeling like you wasted your hard earned money! I can honestly said I would purchase this in a heartbeat and I’ve already recommended it to several people. This shaver, more than any other I’ve used, saves me a huge amount of time and frustration and just as important, I absolutely love the quality of the shave. I bet you are ready for an upgraded shaving experience too. I know I was!to capture different types of hair&amp;#34; truly delivers!

    <li> I received the Braun Series 9 9090cc Electric Shaver with Cleaning Center as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I was always skeptical of using shaving machines on my face.  I have tried several that have not come close to using an actual razor. I’m the type of guy that grows a beard over night and in a weekend I can have a full beard. All my friends say I’m amazing at growing facial hair. How do you keep it tamed?  I must say, I buy razor blades after razor blades which get very expensive.  I usually go through one or two blades a week. I have very coarse hair that somehow destroys blades.&lt;br /&gt;After opening the Braun Series 9090 I was impressed with the packing and style of the machine.  It was very compact, fit well in my hand and also came with a travel case. On my first try the Braun Series 9090 was simple to use and maneuvered around my face well. For the true test the Braun Series 9090 has converted me into a true believer that it can cut my facial hairs just as good as any razor blades can. I must say it left my skin feeling smooth with no stubs. I was amazed that it did not pull on my hair or irritate my skin. After using the Braun Series 9090 my face felt just as soft as baby’s skin.  I’m looking forward to many skin close shaves to come using the Braun Series 9090.</li>
    <li> This is an overall pretty great razor. Braun did a great job with this. It is sleek looking and fits great in my hand making for a very comfortable shave every time. With every pro there is a con. Actually two for me:  the package leads you to believe the battery indicator has numbers when in fact it has bars (not a deal breaker); second is that the trimmer didn&#x27;t work to well for me. That was a little disappointing. With that said, I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers in the past and also along side Philips Norelco razors with the three circle blades pushed into a triangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When BzzAgent provided me with a Braun Series 9 shaver to evaluate, I thought, how is this any different than what I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this is the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve used to date. The first shave I was surprised I only had to make a couple passes. My beard is not thick or coarse so typically I have to spend awhile  passing over suborn areas to get stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part I was having any difficulty with were my side burns. After a few passes I realized there was a flip up side burn shaver built into this razor, and it worked very well!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a few weeks now.  It does very well shaving and keeps my face clean for the day.  Compared to my previous shaver, Norelco SensoTouch, I can tell I am getting a cleaner cut.  It also gives a more comfortable cut.  The shaver itself is rather massive to the ones I have had in the past.  You can tell by the shaver head that it covers a wide area.  It also has multiple types of cutters to give you a better shave.  The issues I have so far with it though, only make me give it a 4 star.  The square shaped area of the shaver piece cannot reach or trim one small area around both sides of my nose.  I even tried the sideburn trimmer piece.  Which requires me to pull out my straight blade razor to finish the job, which is frustrating.  The power cord that plugs into the cleaning station needs to be longer.  I have to move it every time I need to clean it.  There are pieces of the cleaning station that are made of glossy piano black.  I am constantly cleaning those to keep it clean looking, being near my sink.  The cleaning process itself is very straight forward and gives my shaver a good cleaning.  My only concerns with the cleaning solution is the price to replace it.  At my local grocery it cost 12.99.  My other concern is how many times I have to clean it.  The razor has an indicator light on it to tell you when it needs to be cleaned.  It comes on every time I finish shaving.  I cannot imagine it needs that much cleaning.  Over all, it is way better than any shaver I have had in the past and have already recommended it to friends.  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product works great even with a week long beard. I would advise everyone to try it out.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. In the battle of electric vs. traditional shaving I definitely side with traditional shaving. In my opinion it just provides a closer, less irritating shave experience. However, the Braun Series 9 far exceeded my expectations and is an outstanding product. The first time I used the razor from Braun as a promotional item I could feel the flexibility of the razor as it moved with the contour of my face better than any other electric I&#x27;ve ever used. I didn&#x27;t have to go back and forth over the same area to finally get rid of the hair. This means a shorter duration of shaving and much less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is an outstanding product, probably the best on the market, and certainly the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The Braun Series 9 gets my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Conclusion First:  This shaver (free from BzzAgent to me for my review and spreading the word), although satisfying every part of the gadget hungry, comes short in the only category that matters: getting all the hair off your face.  It leaves stragglers behind that make you look a bit sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick fast growing facial hair and I don&#x27;t need to shave everyday for work.  I&#x27;ve tested this razor by shaving about a half dozen times.  I&#x27;ve tried with 1, 2, and 3 days growth.  At 3 days growth theres a bit of pulling pain but only a bit.  I&#x27;ve had the best success with only 1 day growth.  Even then, and especially on the neck and cheekbone tops, it leaves hair behind.  And that looks sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a photographer I have to take a close look at faces.  If I saw a subject who had a shave like the one I get from this razor, I&#x27;d think the person was not camera ready.  High standard, but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you had a light growth, had to be clean shaven for work every day, and weren&#x27;t extremely picky - then it would be a handy and fast tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does shave close where it shaves.  But the neck especially is trouble.  I have an average face: my neck isn&#x27;t supper flabby or tight.  And I&#x27;ve tried everything with this razor to get all the hair to no avail:  working the razor locked and unlocked at every direction and angle and pulling the skin tight, too.  Still stragglers left behind, as you can see from the photos.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using the razor! I have to shave each and everyday for my job and I have to say that the Braun Series 9 is the best electric razor that I have ever used!  It glides over my skin with ease leaving nothing but soft, smooth skin.  Its self-cleaning design makes the whole process easy and much less time consuming that regular electric razors. It has 4 individualized cutting options for different types of hair and is oh so gentle on my sensitive skin.  My wife loves the smooth results and I love the ease of use.  Overall this is a great new product from a trusted brand that I plan on using each and every day! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
    <li> I was very excited to be invited into this campaign.  I can&#x27;t believe I was given a free, $300.00+ electric razor to try out.  This is what bzzagent is all about in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use a safety razor to shave 2-3 times week.  I can&#x27;t shave back to back days because it will just chew up my skin.  Plus with the safety razor, I will usually only get one sweet shave with a blade.  When the blade is too sharp, or too dull, I cut myself.  I think they call it the art of shaving for a reason - because you&#x27;re supposed to take your time and go slow.  However, at 5:30am, with one eye open, no coffee, two kids to get out the door to school and trying to get to work by 730am, time is not on my side.  I cannot enjoy my shave.  I need to get in and out and on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My free razor arrived at my door on Tuesday.  After a quick change (60 minutes charge gets you 50 minutes of shaving?!  Nice), I was looking forward to using it on Wednesday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now shaving with a straight razor is obviously different than shaving with an electric.  I&#x27;m going to have to get my electric feet back under me, not having used one for many years now, but my first shave went well and more importantly fast.  After my shave, the razor indicated it needed to be cleaned with the cleaning system.  I&#x27;m not sure how often that is going to happen.  My father&#x27;s biggest complaint about his Braun is the cost of the replacement cleaning solutions.  After the shave, on a quick inspection of my face, I could see I missed a few spots, but that was user error.  I have to get my no-shaving cream system down.  I could also tell some areas were not as smooth as a straight razor would get them as well however again, that may be user error.  My beard grows in multiple directions.  I would normally shave 2-3 times with a straight razor to get everything - yet another reason I was excited for this product.  It claims it cuts in multiple directions in one swoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 seemed to go better than the first day.  A feature I embraced today that I hadn&#x27;t yesterday was locking the pivoting head to get areas that are missed.  This is great for areas like under your nose and some angles on my neck where I need a little less give and some more &amp;#34;go get it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ongoing... Ive been using the razor for over a week and enjoying it.  My mornings have sped up and I&#x27;m still getting a nice shave.  Each day I feel I learn more about how to shave better than the day prior.  I can see this is going to be a good relationship ongoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final test - I went camping for a few days and had to chop off my beard once I got back.  I don&#x27;t have the thickest or fullest beard, but because my hair grows in every direction, in the past, electric razors would take a long time and not get the job done well.  However, within a couple of minutes I was able to get a solid shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly enjoying this product and look forward to using this ongoing.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 9/24/2015&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Series 9090 daily for over a month now.  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;still loving it.  I like how my face looks and feels but love not&lt;br /&gt;lathering up, shaving in all directions and cutting myself almost&lt;br /&gt;daily.  I now longer have to plan my shaving around important events&lt;br /&gt;in my life.  It&#x27;s more like getting a small haircut each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knock I&#x27;ve had with all shavers is the upkeep and cost.  Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;electric razorsh has always been tedious but not with the Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Center.  Pop it in and walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cost, the cleaning center needs refills of the cleaning&lt;br /&gt;solution.  I used a Braun cleaning center years ago and going to CVS&lt;br /&gt;and the cost started to wear on me.  Howver, now living in the Amazon&lt;br /&gt;world, I found a solid subscribe and save&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SNGSFS?ref_&#x3D;sns_myd_detail_page).&lt;br /&gt;A little over $4 per refill is awesome.  I even sharedthis with my&lt;br /&gt;father who complained about wanting to get away from his Braun when I&lt;br /&gt;told him I was using one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I beleive you need to change out the head every 18-months or so.&lt;br /&gt;A quick Amazon search shows series 9 heads going for $50.  So over the&lt;br /&gt;span of 18-months, you need to spend an additional $6.70 in upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right in line with all the via-snail mail shaving clubs without&lt;br /&gt;needing shaving cream, after shave and the worry of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.ad every 18-months or so.

    <li> Let me say first that I am reviewing this shaver as a promotion from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s out of the way. I LOVED THIS SHAVER. for some background I go back and forth from beard to no beard to goatee to mutton chops so I use all kinds of different shavers. This Braun 9 series is sleek and super effective. It is waterproof (big bonus), and the shave action is super smooth with no pinching or pulling even on the longer flat hairs at the bottom of the throat. It gives a super close and comfortable shave without any real tugging or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the close shave my favorite thing about it is the super convenient alcohol based cleaner / charging dock. Pop the shaver open and dump the hair then just set it in the dock push a button and not worry about it again until the next shave. Being a very lazy person I loved how easy it is to keep up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only drawbacks would be I think the sideburn trimmer could use a little more umph, and it can get a bit slick in the shower with the super smooth shiny surface. There is some grip on the sides but I would like a bit more. The shaver does feel sturdy though so I&#x27;m not too worried about dropping it. I see these 2 things as extremely minor though, and are immensely outweighed by the quality of shave and the easy care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a shaver that does what its supposed to do and is super easy to upkeep this one is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a promotion from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 9090 electric shaver is a fantastic product, and I couldn’t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full, coarse and tough beard like razor wire, but also have very sensitive skin and am prone to ingrown hairs.  I’ve owned and used numerous top of the line electric shavers from Braun, Panasonic and Norelco, cartridge razors like the Gillette Fusion Proglide and Mach 3 Turbo, and even old fashioned double-edge razors used shaving brushes and soap. I’ve found that foil electric shavers offer me the best shave with the least irritation, and before the Braun 9090, my preferred shaver was Braun’s prior top model, the 790.  I intended to purchase a new Braun Series 9 regardless of the promotion, and was excited to try the shaver immediately upon its release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 9090 came well-packaged, was easy to open, and included the shaver, cleaning unit, power cord, one Clean &amp; Charge cartridge, a reinforced cloth travel case, cleaning brush, and instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is made in Germany, has a matte gray plastic front and black rubber back, is very ergonomic and comfortable to hold, and light, but solidly built.  The cleaning unit is sleek, and far more stylish than old style cleaning units used with Braun’s Series 7 and other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve now used the shaver for about a week, and without a doubt, it’s the smoothest, fastest, and most comfortable and irritation-free shave I’ve ever experienced. Despite the four cutting elements on the relatively large shaver head, I had no trouble navigating my neck, jawline or under my nose, and the shaving head’s improvements over my trusty Braun 790 permitted a clean shave without having to go over certain spots repeatedly because the whiskers grow in different directions. It was also far better with multi-day growth than the 790. The shaver was louder than most rotary electrics, but a little quieter than my old Brauns and Panasonics.  I prefer to use a pre-shave powder (Remington Face Saver) when using an electric shaver, but achieved nearly equal results with William’s Lectric Shave or without any prep product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the pop-up trimmer.  Most electric shavers include such trimmers, and they usually are barely adequate.  However, the Braun 9090’s was worse than most, and notably inferior to the Braun 790. The trimmer pops-up flush to the back of the shaving head, and as a result, it’s difficult to maneuver and see what you’re cutting.  It’s also inexplicably slightly concave, and effectively reduces the cutting area and precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun cleaning unit is unquestionably the best in the market.  It’s fast, truly disinfects with an alcohol-based cleaning solution, efficiently dries the shaver, and is not too loud.  The shaver is usually cleaned, lubricated and dry within approximately 45 minutes. Unlike my Braun 790’s cleaning unit, the 9090’s uses a fan a part of the drying process, and is therefore a little louder.  If you don’t want to use the cleaning unit or are traveling, the shaver is totally waterproof, and can be easily cleaned under the tap, with or without soap. It’s also possible to simply tap out the hair from the shaving head and brush-out the whiskers. If you manually clean the shaver, Braun recommends that you occasionally oil the shaving head and trimmer.  Unlike my prior Brauns, the manufacturer did not include a small bottle of oil, although Braun sells its own oil separately, or you can use the spay cleaners from companies like Remington (Shaver Saver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the Braun 9090 to anyone looking for great shave comparable to a blade.  However, I offer two caveats.  First, although excellent, the Braun Series 9 shavers are expensive.  The Braun Series 7 shavers will provide a great shave nearly equal to the Series 9 at a lower price.  If budget is a factor, the Series 7 is a better value, but if you want the best of the best, do not hesitate to choose a Series 9. Second, unlike other top models from Norelco and Panasonic, the Braun 9090 is only a dry shaver, and even though it is waterproof, it cannot be used to shave wet, in the shower, or with foam or gel. If I had purchased a Series 9, absent a very high price premium, I would have definitely chosen one of the Series 9 models that could be used wet, such as the Braun 9095.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Smooth, comfortable shave!!!&lt;br /&gt;+ Ergonomic, easy to hold, non-slippery handle&lt;br /&gt;+ Efficient cleaning-unit with an alcohol-based cleaning solution that is widely available&lt;br /&gt;+ Waterproof for manual cleaning&lt;br /&gt;+ Long battery life (50+ minutes, 5 minute quick-charge, and can be used while plugged-in)&lt;br /&gt;+ Good protective travel case&lt;br /&gt;+ High-quality, made in Germany&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive (but not unreasonable for a top of the line electric shaver)&lt;br /&gt;- Ineffective and difficult to use pop-up trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- Lubricating oil for manual cleaning not included&lt;br /&gt;- Cannot be used wet and/or with shave foams or gelss 7 is a better value, but if you want the best of the best, do not hesitate to choose a Series 9.

    <li> I just received the Braun Series 9 shaver from BzzAgent! To be clear, I have always been a blade shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Series 9 shaver comes with the usual package which includes all the important components. These include:&lt;br /&gt;• Braun Series 9 9090cc Shaver packed in a travel case&lt;br /&gt;• Cleaning station&lt;br /&gt;• Charger that can be used for the station as well as the razor&lt;br /&gt;• Travel case including small brush&lt;br /&gt;• One cleaning cartridge&lt;br /&gt;• Relevant documentation- warranty and manuals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does not come fully charged and must be charged to start using it. It took about an hour for the Braun Series 9 to be fully charged on the first charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression is that is a very high quality shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, the performance of the Braun is very good. The shaver removes all hairs. With a three-day beard though, you will have to do a few passes to completely remove the stubble. Also it seemed to have a hard time getting a closes shave under eh jaw. The Braun is a four-stage cutting system with two trimmers. One criticism that I have with this shaver is the large razor head. While this feature is an advantage when tackling areas of the face such as the neck or chin, it presents a problem when shaving the nose and mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleaning station, there is not much to say really. After connecting the razor and pressing the start button, the cleaning process immediately starts. The cleaning liquid is flushed out of the cleaning cartridge through the shaving head thereby cleaning it. The used (dirty) then flows back into the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;• This is a very good quality razor that delivers a clean and comfortable shave even with long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;• The double trimmers do a good job of removing all hairs. In addition to this, the cleaning station performs very well leaving behind a clean shaving head. Another plus is that the shaver is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;• The price. The shaver does not come cheap at about $350+ on ebay. (Its not available on Amazon yet)&lt;br /&gt;• It had a hard time giving me a clean close shave under my Jaw&lt;br /&gt;• The shaving head is too large for the nose and mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would recommend the Braun Series 9 shaver to anyone who can afford it. In my view, the shaver comes close to a blade shaver in terms of closeness. The price. The shaver does not come cheap at about $350+ on ebay.

    <li> I am reviewing the Braun Series 9 9090cc Electric Shaver that I received as part of a product promotion from the brand. Let me start by saying this is a great product.  I had my concerns at first, but after a week of using the Braun Series 9 shaver, I&#x27;m sold.  A little about me: I am dark complected with very thick, course, facial hair. I also shave my head daily.  For the past few years, I have been using a double edge safety razor, with a traditional shave cream and brush on my face.  On my head I have been using disposable cartridge razors (after trying various razors designed specifically for shaving heads with disastrous results).&lt;br /&gt;When picking up the Braun Series 9 my initial concerns were:&lt;br /&gt;1. Would it give me a close enough shave to compare with the safety razor?&lt;br /&gt;2. Would it irritate my neck and produce razor bumps like other electric razors I have tried in the past did?&lt;br /&gt;3. Would it be quick and versatile enough to shave my head daily?&lt;br /&gt;4. Would it be easy to travel with?&lt;br /&gt;5. Would it be easy to clean and maintain?&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using the Braun Series 9 I can answer yes to each of these questions.  The shaver is quick and gentle, providing a close comfortable shave on both my face and head.  It quickly attacks the hard to reach stubble on my neck and behind my ears without irritating my skin or leaving shave bumps.  It eliminates the mess of shave cream and the time it takes to whip up a good lather.  It navigates around my mustache and goatee without snagging and pulling on the hair that I want to keep.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is quick and simple.  I just drop the shaver into the charging/cleaning station and it does all the work for me.&lt;br /&gt;On the second day that I had the shaver, I had to leave town for a quick, two day, business trip.  I put the shaver in the included travel case and tossed it into my overnight bag.  Traveling with the Braun Series 9 was significantly easier, cleaner and more compact than with my previous shaving kit and the charge was more than enough to last a couple of days without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;In short, I would definitely recommend the Braun Series 9 shaver without hesitation.t a couple of days without recharging. In short, I would definitely recommend the Braun Series 9 shaver without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver from BzzAgent to review.  I started using the Braun Series 9 9090 electric shaver last week after receiving my Bzzkit. I have used electric shavers on and off for the last 25 years.  This shaver was impressive from the first sight with just the opening the box.  The shaver looks large and has an amazing feel in the hand  with a very responsive tilting head that can be locked in position depending on shaving preferences.  I have had problems with my neck area with every electric shaver I have ever used but this shaver had no trouble and with the head design I could shave at several different angles with causing any rawness.  The self cleaning ability of the shaver is an added bonus to keep the shaver running at its best for each and every shave.  The closeness of the shave is very close compared to the other shavers I have used and without all of the additional passes the other shavers required.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone who have tried other shavers in the past and not been completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> The take-home message: Braun Series 9090 gives a good shave, but beyond that: it&#x27;s a beautiful machine. It&#x27;s sleek, sophisticated, feels great in the hand and looks good to boot, with beautiful curves, techy blue lights and a powerful, streamlined appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to review this product early with a free sample as a BzzAgent, and have now been using it for nearly a month. The quality of the shave with this razor is high, but not off-the-charts. My favorite thing about it is that it works equally well for a day-old shadow as it does for three-day stubble. No catching, no stubborn patches. You&#x27;re left with a quality shave and little to no irritation regardless of how long it&#x27;s been since your last shave (within reason of course). I&#x27;m also a fan of the adjustable head piece that can lock in a variety of positions, which makes this for a very comfortable and &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That much for the shave itself. My favorite parts are the aesthetics and intangibles. This thing looks like a work of art in a similar way to how an iPhone looks like a work of art. Technologically sleek, curved, powerful and fun. In the hand it feels solid but not heavy. It gives you the impression of having just the right amount of power for the job. My only qualm is that for some reason by the end of a long shave I find that I&#x27;ve been gripping the razor too hard and my hand aches a bit. That said, this thing looks/feels so good I actually LOOK FORWARD to pulling it out and using it. That&#x27;s the power of design. A word about the alcohol auto-clean option: I found it to be fun and whiz-bang and it smelled nice, but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between this cleaning option and a simple brush/rinse. Maybe it imparted a little lubricant to my face when using a freshly auto-cleaned razor? Be that as it may, this function is only a side-note to the solid shave and fantastic design of this product.</li>
    <li> I think that the Braun series 9 is an amazing shaver! I received this shaver to test out as part of a promotion and am so glad I did! It is still made in Germany and the quality shows. Everything about it is thought through and precision made. I love the 3 different cutting paths that get the long, medium and short hairs. I love that the blades do not get hot during shaving. I love how close the shave gets and how my skin doesn&#x27;t feel raw or tender after shaving. I love the cleaning/charging station that this shaver comes with. As a shaver, I can&#x27;t really ask for much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two pesky things that annoy me a bit every time I use the shaver are (1) there is no little pouch for the mini brush they give you inside of the carrying case and (2) the shaver&#x27;s head swivel switch is positioned exactly where my thumb goes during shaving (see attached pic), which causes me to click on the swivel and me having to readjust right away. The first one is a very minor gripe and not a big deal, I&#x27;m not even really sure why they include the brush when the cleaning station does all of the cleaning for you already. The second point is also minor but still rather annoying. The switch to change the direction of the shaver is grooved making it a comfortable place to rest your thumb. However, it inevitably clicks on the swivel no matter how lightly you hold it, forcing you to click it back and readjust the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great shaver no question about it. If you have the money to get this high-end shaver then do it! You and your face will not regret it!</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 9 shaver that I received through a promotion by Braun is a great product for maintenance of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a black male who suffers from razor bumps with some electric and non-electric razors, I am always excited to use a product that does not irritate my skin. To get an accurate idea as to how well this product actually worked, I used this product for a week prior to writing this review.  This shaver performed well in not irritating my skin, and it provided a pretty close shave for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I used the Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System in the past and what I appreciate about the Braun Series 9 shaver, it how it doesn’t require an additional charging apparatus for travel.  A power cord can be plugged directly into the Braun Series 9 shaver unlike the Braun CoolTec .&lt;br /&gt;A drawback for this product is that the edger accessory of the Braun Series 9 does not work well.  I have a chin strap and it is very difficult to line up using the Braun Series 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product does a great job for maintenance of your beard if you are not concerned about side burns or chin straps.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive the new Braun Series 9090 electric shaver. Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t much experience with electric shavers, usually opting for the manual sort...but I was willing to give it a try once again with my only previous experience not really providing the most comfortable or closest of shaves. I have to say, on first appearances, this shaver really looks the business with the chrome touches, light up buttons and you can certainly appreciate the quality of the materials used in putting it together. I wasn&#x27;t even expecting all the little components that came with it - the cleaning brush, shaver case and a clean &amp; charge station that&#x27;ll wash the head with an alcoholic solution and dry it for a more thorough clean. The shaver itself feels quite heavy, but I actually like the weight, sturdiness and how it feels to manoeuvre. I was very curious as to how it would feel on my skin - would it tear my face off? Would it leave red blotches across my neck as I tend to find with my razor blades? Will it cut the beard hair efficiently and leave a smooth after-feel. I must say, I&#x27;ve been left pleasantly surprised and it accomplishes all these points very well. It glides over the face and neck with ease, the flexible shaving system really follows the contour of my face and leaves a very smooth finish. It&#x27;s extremely comfortable and hasn&#x27;t cut me once which is always a huge plus! I&#x27;ve found that my chin and the sides always feel completely smooth and clean shaven, but my neck is somewhat less so with this shaver (less so than razors). I&#x27;m sure if I spent longer going over the neck some more, I could get a better result for sure. What I like the most about this shaver is just how much it has quickened my shaving routine in the mornings. I do not have the thickest of beards, but I tend to shave everyday for work purposes and this saves me a lot of time. Cleaning this razor appears very easy by lifting the shaver head off by pinching either side and pulling away and using the brush to sweep away any stray beard hairs...or just using the dock when it calls for it. I feel that for a very special occasion, I would likely stick with the manual razor for the closest overall shave, but this is certainly my choice for the majority of days now. This has proven to be an &#x27;excellent&#x27; product for me which I&#x27;m really happy to have and I actually feel like I&#x27;ve been converted to the electric shaver market because of this Braun product. 10 out of 10!!d using the brush to sweep away any stray beard hairs...or just using the dock when it calls for it.
