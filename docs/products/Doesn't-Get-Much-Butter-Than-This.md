<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this for the LOC method of moisturizing my hair, as well as my 2 little sisters&#x27; hair, and it works beautifully. I love the smell too. This would definitely be a product I buy on the regular. I think it qualified for Amazon Prime too so I saved on shipping as opposed to buying this product from Manetabolism&#x27;s actual website.</li>
    <li> Perfect Moisturizer, light and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a hair journey for a while now and I&#x27;m still searching for products, but this butter is one of the best things I&#x27;ve put in my hair. I have 3c in the back, 4a &amp; 4b on the sides, and some crazy 2something texture in the middle. And even with all those textures this butter was able to meet all their needs. I love this and it&#x27;s definitely a staple from now on. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Mane choice doesn&#x27;t get much butter than this is a great hair butter, I&#x27;ve use many butters in my hair and haven&#x27;t got good result from the use and because I have thin hair the butter is lite and keeps my hair moisturize and  doesn&#x27;t over  power my hair making it greasy and have a build up. Ladies if you haven&#x27;t found a butter that works for you then look no more because you will love this product.</li>
    <li> As a male I used this product as a moisturizer and sealer after showering for wave hairstyle. Worked  great and has a good smell and adds a little shine. I bought based solely on the ingredients list, wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> OMG, this stuff is amazing!!! It leaves my hair so soft and manageable and it moisturizes,as well I would recommend this if no one has tried this I think you should really give it a try I love it and I will continue using this this is now part of my hair regiment thank you guys so much</li>
    <li> OMG this butter is no joke. I have to textures in my hair right now so it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that will seal my new growth and not weigh down my relaxed ends. Well this was all that and then some. It is a staple and will forever be a staple. It smells so good to, leaving a lingering scent after i apply it to my hair. A+</li>
    <li> This product is very worth the money</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see results yet.  Has used it for two months.</li>
    <li> Finally a product I can use daily.  It is very light and melts with immediate contact with the body temperature.  I also love using it when I massage my scalp.  The smell is lovely and also light.  My hair lust and shine is to die for.  What is amazing also about this product, is I use it as a twisting cream.  I have 4B hair and my twistouts last for a very long time with a tight hold.</li>
    <li> It is an okay product.</li>
    <li> Well it does go on like butter but it did not moisturizer my hair.  It smells wonderful and gave a nice sheen, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product it really works since I have been using it my hair has not been broken</li>
    <li> These products came highly recommended and so I bought them... Thy feel good on my hair but can&#x27;t speak to effectiveness just yet...</li>
    <li> the hair feels great after use,</li>
    <li> Received quickly, the product is smooth and works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> The best hair product ever. It holds your curls and moisturized with no added greasiness.. It&#x27;s a must in the hair natural game. Won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the mane products.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  Keeps my hair soft and I love the smell. The amount is prefect.  Goes a long way. Very pleased and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel! It really helps define my curls.  Would higly recommend to anyone looking for a healthy hair product</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this because it keeps my hair soft and manageable. I put this on my hair one rainy day and straightened it and my hair was still pin straight without an umbrella. It&#x27;s amazing. My natural hair is curly and coarse. It does wonders.</li>
    <li> This product is the worst.. Waste of $20.34.. This product is so greasy and made my hair feel like Brillo . I had to rewash my hair and use another product .. DON&#x27;T waste ur money.. Nowadays everyone and their mother think they can create natural hair products. Have several seats</li>
    <li> Great product. A little thick but does create hair growth/retention. Weighed my hair down but overall a good product and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Is it suppose to be watery? Doubt that is should be. Got mine and it was completely liquified, thinking about putting it into the fridge I don&#x27;t know if that will help. Hopefully it does</li>
    <li> I like the product and I&#x27;ve seen some change since using it.  I would recommend this product to friends and family</li>
    <li> Love how this smells and the shine it gives to my hair and my husband&#x27;s beard!</li>
    <li> You can use thus daily and won&#x27;t get that nasty product build up</li>
    <li> First off... this is all that and a bag of chips! I love this butter and will never ever use anything else to twist my hair. I first ordered this when the product was first launched and fell in love! It&#x27;s so light and has a great smell.... A little goes a long way. I usually wash my hair (deep condition) on a weekly basis but I will say I never have to go back and moisturize my hair after using this. Courtney just had free shipping on this product and I ORDERED 2 CONTAINERS OF THIS PRODUCT!!! I would recommend anyone to try this product because it&#x27;s worth the money... and not as expensive as other products.  Now I&#x27;ve tried as I am... Jane Carter Nourish and Shine and yes those products are good but THIS BUTTER IS GREAT!!! Courtney has a loyal costumer in me! MY HAIR IS IN HEAVEN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have 4 b hair)</li>
    <li> I am natural &amp; have been since July of 2008 and have 3b, 4a, 4b type hair. I have used a ton of products, but this one us something amazing.  The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d love it, as everybody said I would, but after continuing to use it, I am completely &amp; utterly in love with the product.  It is quite possibly the best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It leaves my hair unbelievably soft &amp; moisturized, which is huge because I had been dealing with extreme dryness no matter how often I sealed &amp; moisturized.  I have only been using it for about 2 weeks but it I am extremely happy I bought it and kept using it after the first time. So if you&#x27;re unsure just try a second time it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> A must have for 4c hair type.  My hair loved it.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! Out of all of the products I&#x27;ve used on my natural hair journey, this product is the ONLY one that keeps my hair moisturized with my twist outs. When I first received it I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but honey, after my first twist out I fell in LOVE! Definitely recommending this to all my curlfriends!!!</li>
    <li> This is a must buy!&lt;br /&gt;Having been natural all my life - I have tried and tested all hair butters BUT this one does exactly what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is norished for days and a little sure does go a long way - I have had this beauty for near a year (and I have bra length hair 4b/a).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that hey don&#x27;t sell it in the UK so waiting for products as good as this is hard :)</li>
    <li> I love this product its lightweight and makes my hair shine. I also use it on my 3 year olds natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  As I am a now a life time user, I recently recommended it to my auntie who has had Alopecia for past 8 years.  She has always been very proud of and taken very good care of her hair.  She has only been using it for two weeks now but she loves it. I like the new confidence she has just by using it for such a short time. I can wait to see what it will do for her edges over the next few months.</li>
    <li> I love using this on my hair but I love it even more when I use it with other products in my friends twist out. I haven got to the point where I can do a twist out on my own hair but when I can I know it will be amazing!</li>
    <li> This butter is the best!!! The smell is amazing. It simply melts in your hand and gives your hair amazing moisture. Definitely food for your  hair, I always  have  to  have one whenever I&#x27;m  running low I am quick to order another. Sometimes I simply forget you don&#x27;t  need a lot because  a little goes a long way with  this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> Blessing for my edges</li>
    <li> I like this butter for my flexirod sets but I think its too heavy for the summer, but perfect for helping to seal in moisture during the colder months</li>
    <li> Love...Love this product...I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it...it makes my hair shiny and it feels healthier.</li>
    <li> This product is dreamy!  It does everything it claims and more.  My hair loves it!  You do not need a lot, most products say this but this product really goes a long way.  Another winner for Mane Choice, hats off!  I look forward to the shampoo line.</li>
    <li> This butter is the bomb!!!!! It gives me really good moisture and we&#x27;ll defined twist out! Awesome stuff!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different butters for my twist out and this one hits the spot dead on. I have 4C hair and my daughter has 3C hair and it works on both textures.  It&#x27;s a smooth creamy texture and the smell is awesome.  If you need a cream to help with your twist out and to moisturize this is IT.....</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this</li>
    <li> This product has definitely become a staple product in my regimen. This butter leaves my twistouts looking FABULOUS, no frizz and soft and shiny. If you haven&#x27;t made the Mane Choice, you are missing out!!!! Love this product line!!</li>
    <li> This hair butter is everything... it softens and protects... I have fine curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down. It absorbs well not oily.... you need to try this....</li>
    <li> So I have very thick curly hair and it is difficult to find a product where so little goes such a long way. I LOVE this stuff. I can use a dime size on my hair and it is so soft and moisturized. I actually just ran out of my first one and it lasted six months and I wash my hair at least once a week. Take the plunge and order this butter it is the business.</li>
    <li> I ordered this butter after 2.5 years of being natural. I was told that Shea butter and all other sorts of butters would do the trick to lock in moisture in the hair. Nonetheless using all these other products has left my hair dry and shedding. It wasn&#x27;t until I ordered and used this product to lock in moisture that it superseded my expectations. I can use this alone without applying the LOC method. My hair and daughter&#x27;s hair is moisturized. Not to mention it smells great unlike plain shea butter. And that&#x27;s a plus for me!</li>
    <li> Now this right here is just what it says &amp;#34;Doesn&#x27;t Get Much BUTTER Than This&amp;#34;  I ordered two jars of this &amp; I use it after EVERY WEEKLY WASH!!!  I tried other products before but when this first came out, it became my one &amp; only!!! I section my hair &amp; apply this to each section, then I twist my hair, let it dry naturally. When I untwist my hair the next day my hair is so soft &amp; manageable. A little goes along way too. I absolutely love The Mane Choice products &amp; tell everyone I know about trying them for themselves. I am a loyal customer &amp; so grateful to have found products that work amazing on my hair!!!</li>
    <li> I might have over done it by using it night and day (my hair was too greasy for my liking), but this butter helped my hair get to its healthiest.  I hadn&#x27;t had a trim in much over a year and my hair was breaking at the ends and coming out like crazy in the shower, but after my first jar of this my hair was healthy and my hair consultant LongHairDontCare2011 told me that a trim was barely needed.</li>
    <li> My friens bought this for me because of my dry and brittle hair. After using this for only 1 month, my hair is now soft and has lots of body.</li>
    <li> Oh my Goodness.This hair butter is so soft and no greasy. Just what I was looking for. Great for any type of hair, but even &amp;#34;Butter&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;on my natural mane. Thank you Courtney and @eclark for this great product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! A little goes a long way... It&#x27;s perfect on its own to refresh or seal. The blend is amazing. The perfect concoction of all the oils closest to a Naturalista&#x27;s heart but not to heavy that are creative styles &amp;#34;flop&amp;#34; - Thanks again Mane Choice. It really doesn&#x27;t get much Butter than THIS :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product just to experiment and it really helped more than I thought. It smells great &amp; gave my hair great shine.</li>
    <li> My hair is the type to get sooo dry within one day. So i read the amazing reviews and decided tk try it out. I am never going to another moisturizer !! This cream gives me defined twist outs makes my hair super soft and smells good too ! What more can you ask for. I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I witness amazing results from people using Mane products. I would love to see how it will turns out on my hair!!!</li>
    <li> This products is great for every one! I  ordered some and finally got to use it when I took my sew in out. My head was itching so bad. After I took the weave out I had noticed that my scalp was extra dry (white) and flaky. So after washing and conditioning it I applied this wonderful product to my scalp and hair. My scalp has went back to being moisturized as well as my hair getting healthier. It keeps a shine too it and makes my hair look great on a twist out, braid out, flexi rod set. If you want to regain the shine and health of your hair purchase this! This product was made to bless our hair!!</li>
    <li> This thing is magic! Makes my hair so soft and my hair loves it. All her products are good for transitioning</li>
    <li> I also borrowed some of this from my sister in law &amp; I liked it, it was very light &amp; it left my hair shiny &amp; it didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry like all the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> love it smooth and soft</li>
    <li> This makes my hair soo soft and manageable!  I have different textures on my head... 3c and 4a so finding someting that works great all over my head was kinda hard, but now I look no further.  I didnt get it soo much for growth, just mainly for moisture and it&#x27;s working great.  Great deliver to boot!</li>
    <li> The title for this product speaks for itself. When it comes to natural hair creams &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t get any Better(Butter) than This&amp;#34; . This is the go to jar in my house. I use it on myself and my daughters hair. The jar lasts a long time and we use it often. I recommend this product for all natural hair types. Most of my family members have natural hair. Like myself they were &amp;#34;product junkies&amp;#34; until I told them about The Mane Choice. I use this whenever I do twist outs, flat twist, braid outs, and fexi rod sets, or kids styles on my daughter. I am in LOVE. No turning back for me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product it has helped my hair so much through my transitioning phase I love all of the manetabolisim products</li>
    <li> This works great on my daughters hair. I am almost out so I am definitely going to reorder. Keeps her hair very moisturized</li>
    <li> THE BEST HAIR MOISTURIZER EVER! I put it on my dry hair at night and wrap my hair up. The next day I unwrap my hair and my hair feels like butter. I like love it. Plus it smells great too.</li>
    <li> I discovered the Mane Choice products via social media and I am forever thankful. First let me say my hair is relaxed!! I know a lot of natural hair ladies use these products but for those of us who are relaxed, these products work great for us also. I struggled to find products that would give my hair that nice shine without all the yuck and this is it. This container has lasted me for quite some time also so I feel like I am definitely getting a good value. I use it mostly around my edges, to smooth down my hair for the pony tail and to moisturize my ends. The first time I used it, my hair was still damp from a wash before I got ready to blow it out and that&#x27;s really where the magic is. It moisturized and sealed my hair perfectly. It is a must have for this girl!!</li>
    <li> My cousin uses this butter and her results are flawless !!!!! MANE CHOICE is def the MAIN CHOICE !!!!</li>
    <li> I cant stress enough how great Courtney&#x27;s products are for 4C hair. This butter leaves your hair extremely soft after taking down twist, bantu knots braid outs, etc. I highly recommend this product for anyone that is natural. You will LOVE it. Also try the hair vitamins, those are prob my fav product from The mane choice. To see amazing testimonials and reviews follow them on instagram @themanechoice</li>
    <li> I love this butter. My hair has never felt softer and more easier to manage than when I wash my hair and use the butter to moisturize for a wash and go look. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Another great product of from the mane choice,  does wonders to my hair, wouldn&#x27;t use any thing but this from now on. :) get yours day guys!!</li>
    <li> When I Transitioned From Relaxed To Natural There Wasn&#x27;t Anything That Would Keep My Hair Moisturized And Soft. I Stumbled Across This Product And Gave It A Try. I Immediately Fell In Love With It. My Hair No Longer Felt Dry And Brittle But Started To Feel Softer And Was More Manageable. As A Result My Hair Is Stronger And Healthier And Has Been Growing At A Much Faster Rate.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair butter I&#x27;ve tried so far on my natural hair journey. This is a multi use butter. I use it for all my protective styling, to slick down my edges with gel, and on my straight hair to give it sheen. I highly recommend this, and the customer service is awesome. A++++</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair butter. I can use it in so many ways. I&#x27;ve used it for my twist outs, bantu knot outs, and on children&#x27;s hair to help moisturize and smooth. The consistency is amazing and will not weigh your hair down at all while ensuring your hair is moisturized.</li>
    <li> My bestfriend/roomate owns this and she has a much ore kinkier texture than I do. Whenever I feel my hair is just drying out and in need of some shine I steal hers to give me a nice shine and soft touch.</li>
    <li> I have tired so many butters since being natural so I was a little hesitant to try this product. But boy I am glad I did!!! It had done much for my hair after Making the final step to my wash days an enjoyable one. I apply this butter to my hair from root to end on slightly damp hair, not only doeas it leave my hair extremely moisturized but it give it so much shine &amp; silk. I wouldn&#x27;t have to moostirize my hair for another 4 days. One of the best investments I had made I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else awesome product!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time.  I started using the product that night and can tell the difference in my hair already.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I absolutely love it!! I was having trouble looking for products to make a good twist out.braid out with and my hair was always dry. I bough this product a month a go and my hair feels amazing and my curls are more defined. Thank you for this product!</li>
    <li> Love love love... I tried this on my 5yr old daughter and fell in love...I have drawers and drawers of natural products to help moisturize the hair that did work so well. After I tried this my baby girls hair was soft held moisture smelled fabulous and had some shine...&amp; a little definitely goes a long way...It truly doesn&#x27;t get much butter than this....thx manechoice !!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products on my hair from commercial to homemade &amp;&amp; I can honestly say &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t get much BUTTER than this!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The Mane Choice hair butter gives my hair shine and moisture without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in protective style braids and nothing soothes my scalp butter, oo excuse me better! Lol. GREAT PRODUCT! not 1 complaint!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this butter!! I normally use gel for my twist outs, but after seeing everyone raving about this stuff online, I just had to try it. I bought this and the conditioner, which is amazing as well. I used both to two strand twist my hair. I did a deep condition and then used the butter to twist. I could not believe how unbelievably soft my hair was when I was taking my twists down. Even the feel of it wet was amazing! I hear nothing but great things about the manechoice, and I definitely see why! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Keeps my hair soft and I love the smell. The amount is prefect. Goes a long way. Very pleased and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this hair butter. As soon as you put it in your scalp it melts like butter baby!</li>
    <li> I love all of their products I put this on all the time.</li>
    <li> So far I like the outcome of this product</li>
    <li> First let me say that yes I&#x27;ve used this product before but my real reason for doing a review is because of something I&#x27;ve noticed. Why are there so many reviews on September 22nd? On top of that most are from women of color like myself, who are either natural or transitioning! It&#x27;s so funny how the product is appealing to this new trend of going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. If the product is good it will speak for itself...ijs. I love a good review but I&#x27;d much rather honestly! ✌️</li>
    <li> Nice product. Keeps my hair moist. not greasy.</li>
    <li> You know what&#x27;s \\&quot;butter\\&quot; than this? The homemade version I&#x27;ve started to make myself.  I enjoy mixing things so I&#x27;ve learned to make my own hair butter with hemp seed butter and other very interesting, lesser known butters all available on Amazon.com.  My hair seems to love my version more so I guess no harm, no foul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not knocking this product in any way, I think it&#x27;s good.  Not everyone has the time, patience or interest in making their own products so if I just described you, go ahead and try this product.  All I&#x27;m saying is I like my own stuff better, I mean butter.</li>
    <li> I think I finally found the right product - have used it twice and I am in love!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I absolutely love this moisturizer.  It keeps our hair moisturized throughout the week. It has helped tremendously withe health of our hair and maintaining moisture.  It is officially a staple for us.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and tames my thick coarse hair. It did weigh my hair down a bit which could have been due to the amount I used. It definitely managed the frizz and smoothed out the curls when used to slick my hair into a bun. Still a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> The best moisturized product I&#x27;ve ever used, I really worship her products lol</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much &amp;#34;BUTTER&amp;#34; than this.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight,  refreshing,  moisturizing,  nourishing,  promotes growth &amp; a little goes a long way. This butter is my absolute favorite . It gave me the softest,  fluffy twist out ever ..5☆☆☆☆☆Most Def Recommend!</li>
    <li> So about this hair butter...it is fabulous. My hair is very thick and it is usually hard to retain moisture because of my thickness. But with this I wet my hair and apply just a bit and it moisturizes it so well. It even helped clear up my dry scalp. I have eczema so I have always had to deal with a dry itchy scalp but since I have been using this product it has turned that issue around tremendously!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and the deep conditioning mask offered on the website, after finishing my transition from getting regular relaxers/perms track to being natural. I saw all of the reviews and the creators own experience with the product and had nothing to lose, after all I just did the big chop. My family members (both female and male) are the biggest critics of natural hair, when I introduced them to the line and watched the video available on the site numerous times with them they still were skeptical. So when I say the proof is in the pudding the proof is in the pudding it is! After several treatments of the Green Tea &amp; Carrot Deep Condition Mask and using the Doesn&#x27;t Get Much Butter than This, we (my family and I) saw amazing results.My &#x27;knotty hair&amp;#34; as my family refers to it, was now soft, manageable curls. Not only dose my hair look and feel amazing my scalp feels heathy too. Thank you so much for sharing your natural hair are secret. Best product in the history of products on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t get much better than this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for the rest of the line to be released, congratulations on the success and may it  continue !

    <li> I love love love this hair butter, immediately upon using it my hair was so soft and fluffy. The scent is very light and I really like that, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or makes it feel greasy. This is now one of my staple products. I cannot wait to try the deep condish and vitamins! I highly recommend this to anyone with hair. Lol! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great hair product.  Moisturizes well!</li>
    <li> This is essentially a lighter, more spreadable version of shea butter, which is the primary ingredient.  There&#x27;s no miracle here, in my opinion.  The product does not contain water, therefore it is NOT moisturizing on its own.  You can, as with any other oil-based product, put water on your hair and use this to help seal that moisture in for 24 hours or so.  During that time, yes, your hair will be soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are all natural, which is a plus, and there&#x27;s no nasty smell.  I consider this a basic sealer that is lighter and less tacky-feeling than pure shea butter.  The price is reasonable, so it&#x27;s fine for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re experiencing a hair dryness/breakage crisis, this is not going to solve it single-handedly so I wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone to run out and buy this.  You need to do your deep-conditioning, your resting hairdos, have a great detangling conditioner and non-ragged comb, etc.</li>
    <li> August 14:  it has been a month since my initial review and I am very pleased to say this is a wonderful product.  I was losing my hair in spots, there were areas that just would not grow and it look and felt like fake doll hair.  My hair is relaxed and it looks wondeful now, fuller, thicker and so soft and shiny.  It has worked miracles for me so i highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give a review yet because I just ordered it the suggestion of my beautician but note that most of the reviews were posted on September 22, 2014 which usually indicates manufacturer paid reviews.  Most reviews are posted in April, June, September and use similar verbiage so keep that in  mind.  I will post results in 30 days.  Amazon needs to do something about these fake testimonials.</li>
    <li> I really love this butter - I had kind of mixed feelings about it, because it didn&#x27;t feel as if it was doing anything to my hair while I was putting it on, but folks - it&#x27;s the only mixture that gives me defined twists. and it feels so moisturized when you untwist your hair. I really realize too that a little bit of it goes a long way.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;ll do the same for you, but it did it for me, after years of looking I&#x27;ve found what my hair likes. I&#x27;ve been using products that feel great on my hair and I thought that it was the product, but on taking down my hair, it just felt okay. NOT THIS PRODUCT - it feels okay, but the take down is when you realize how good the product is.</li>
    <li> Much thicker than I thought it would be. But I will give it a try!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works wonders! Love the entire product line!</li>
    <li> I got this item very fast and I have been using the product for a month now and it works. My hair is not dry and brittle, as it was before I started this product. I would recommend this product to anyone with natural hair! The jar is huge and will last a few months, depending on your length.</li>
    <li> hello, love it I brought 2 my first time and can&#x27;t live without it less shedding and it&#x27;s not heavy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been natural for 2 years now with no perm. I finally colored my hair amonth ago to cover some of the grey. I have been looking for a great product to use. I have been reading the reviews from your products and finally ordered the manetabolism supplements. I haven&#x27;t been able to order the hair products yet due to being out of work, but I will hopefully be able to order them in a month or so. Looking forward to a great hair recovery from stress breakage and too much heat.</li>
    <li> This product is extraordinary!! Mane choice is the BEST choice! My hair has grown so much and has gotten so full and thick since using these products! I shed less and my hair is stronger than ever before!! Love it Love it Love it!!</li>
    <li> I like this product on my hair when I am wearing my fro or when I do pony tails on my girls. I like the moisture it gives.</li>
    <li> This product has been an absolute miracle, I&#x27;ve used it for myself and my daughter.  It&#x27;s great to use when putting your hair in a protective style.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is dry, but using this product has helped tremendously!  I also love to use it when I braid mine or my daughter&#x27;s hair.  So glad I made a great choice in buying it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great for my really dry hair.. perfect for everyday usage and it smells great... I can go without this product after washing my hair. It bring my hair back to life</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. My hair feels buttery soft after using this and I love the smell also! I am coming to the end of my tub but definitely going to be purchasing another one. Very nourishing!</li>
    <li> Great product. Holds my edges well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently in transition from heat damaged hair to healthy undamaged hair and this product works so well in my hair when I do protective styles like twists or braids. Definitely look into getting this along with the Manetabolism vitamins. It&#x27;s a great combo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on a hair journey and this is one of my fav go to products. I absolutely love this &amp; all the other products assosiated with the Mane Choice. Highly recommend for all!</li>
    <li> My aunt uses this on my cousins hair which is really curly so I thought I&#x27;d try it out on my hair. I absolutely love it! It doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell and it leaves my hair feeling extremely soft!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It is definitely one of my staple products. I primarily use it on my edges. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair, especially at the crown of my head. I noticed after the two uses that my hair was softer and more manageable. The amount of shedding that I have now is significantly less. I give it two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I just received this product the other day and when I say this is a miracle &amp;#34;BUTTER&amp;#34; in a bottle that&#x27;s exactly what it is!! The name speaks for itself &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t get much BUTTER than this&amp;#34; because when I took my hair out my hair today it was VERY SOFT an  MOISTURIZED!! My hair has never felt so soft with any other butters that I have used in the past.  A little goes a long ways. I used a pea size on each of my twist and my hair feels AMAZING. This will be a staple product for me for life!!!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! I kid you not, it really does not get much better than this. You need a everyday moisturizer that won&#x27;t build up on your hair and is lightweight? Well this is the product for you. Don&#x27;t go waste your hard earned money for something that does nothing for your hair. Buy this product and your hair will love you for it. You&#x27;ll even love yourself a little more for making such a good choice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newly natural and I big chopped about a week I go, when ordered this product on Saturday it came within the next few days without any trouble. Then I started using it and I must say this will be one of my staples from now on, it really moisturizes and softens my hair, so guys this is a must have.</li>
    <li> I never purchased this product but &amp;#34;burrowed&amp;#34; it from a friend who was using the product. She had extremely THICK hair that she could only comb when wet. I realized that her hair was becoming more manageable and soft, she actually comb it when dry so I decided to try it and see what it did for my hair. My hair is relativity manageable but it gets extremely dry if not washed every week and becomes frizzy with all my split ends. After using this product twice it seemed like my ends were starting to mend. My hair was extremely bouncy after being blown out. This product is essential for natural hair</li>
    <li> A very light butter, practically melts as soon as it touches your hair and adds a nice shine too. It has a gentle scent which is a bonus for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product it gives your hair moisture and holds great. I been using it for about 2 months. I also use the main choice vitamins which has made my hair grow very well. I been using the vitamins now for 6 months, and i must say i will continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> This is a decent produt, but it&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
    <li> I received some from a friend of mine who purchased it. All I can say its very very moisturizing in both my hair and my daughters hair who is 2 and has very curly 3c hair but very dry/frizzy.. And I used it on her hair not only did it leave it very soft it also left a very healthy luster to it and this was the next day... One week later and her hair still has the same shine her braids are holding perfectly little to no frizz. (Usually by day three I would have needed to take down wash rebraid) I have since ordered my own. This is now my new holy grail!!!</li>
    <li> I Love this product very light and effective on my hair.  Great for my end and light enough to use every day.</li>
    <li> Very light hair butter with a refreshing scent. my hair is naturally very dry, but with this product i see a major difference. I use it twice a day, 1st by adding water and then this product. I also use the deep conditioning mask every two week and I&#x27;ve been taking the hair vitamins for about 2 months now. I think they have great products and will purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This fast melting butter melts away into oils when rubbed together in your palms that when applied to hair gives it such a fabulous sheen and its very moisturising, a little goes a loooongg way with this product !!!!</li>
    <li> This product was not the best for my hair..I&#x27;m not saying that it may not be good for yours! Everyone&#x27;s hair need is different. It moisturizer my hair and may it soft but did not help retain length as advertised!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the vitamins over hairfinity I heard a lot of negative side effects from them so I tried The Mane Choice and their products. Trust me everything works:)</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t get any butter or better than this... I absolutely love this product.. Haven&#x27;t been able to use the vitamins because I couldn&#x27;t afford them but this product have help bring my edges back and gave me great texture to my hair. I thank God I &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; followed Man Choice on Instagram now I have been blessed to find this product.. Yes I love Mane Choice. And follow they instagram they are Amazing.!! You should really try these products they are amazing..... Yaasss.!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product i not only use it in my hair but my daughter&#x27;s hair as well and everyone compliments her on her hair. The conditioner is also amazing for natural hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for Braid outs and to put on your edges. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the least bit.</li>
    <li> This butter moisturizers my hair without leaving that greasy residue. I live in a very humid  area so it&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizers that isn&#x27;t too heavy but gets the job DONE. Or should I say it USED to be hard to fin such a product! Thanks Mane Choice!!!</li>
    <li> As someone that is new to going Natural I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. Between finding creams without drying ingredients or sulfates or parabens is Hard. And while shopping it is easy to assume anything in the &amp;#34;Black section&amp;#34; of any target or Walmart is actually good for Black hair. After trying the hair growth pills I found more trust in the Mane Choice brand and decided to try this item and Love that I did ! I&#x27;ve been trying to see how long I can go without heat ( Flat irons and blow dryers) and so far it&#x27;s been about 5 months and this product definitely has helped with the process. If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s very moisturizing and will actually do what it says, this product is IT !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dying to try it ...it&#x27;s a 5 stars already because since i loved the green tea conditioner made by Courtney I know she killed this butter as well. I mean , just search &amp; look at her hair duhhh (courtneynaturalhair) ! God bless</li>
    <li> My initial encounter with this butter was at the World Natural Hair Show in Atlanta, Georgia. It was not available for sale at the time, but Courtney and The Mane Choice allowed us to smell and test it. For any hair product a must for me (after ingredients and effectiveness) is being able to tolerate the smell. I must say that this butter smells AMAZING! Oh, MY! It&#x27;s like a little piece of heaven. I swear it smells like the sweetest pound cake. Seriously, my mouth waters as soon as the jar opens. Lol. I also sampled the consistency on my hand and it was lightweight, smooth, and had an amazing shine. Once the product was available for sale, I purchased it. Even with my prior knowledge of the consistency, I assumed that it was like all the butters I was use to and I jumped right in and attempted a twist out. The butter is very lightweight, so I did not have the hold I had expected, but that was outweighed by the fact that my hair was left with a healthy shine, it was super soft, and it smelled delicious. Now I use it to coat my hair, add shine, and moisturize my hair. When I used the butter as intended I was completely satisfied with what it does for my hair. I&#x27;m not into making my own butters, so when I looked at the ingredients I was in awe. Everything I could ask for to help me on my healthy hair journey. It truly doesn&#x27;t get much \\&quot;butter\\&quot; than this.</li>
