<li> I&#x27;m crazy enough about to spend some decent money on.</li>
<li> Nectarine Blossom &amp; Honey has a top note of Cassis, heart note of Acacia Honey, and base note of Peach.  </li>
<li> May be it is just my skin that it is not fitting</li>
<li> Succulent nectarine, peach and cassis and delicate spring flowers melt into the note of acacia honey.</li>
<li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it still gets five stars because the scent is just intoxicating.</li>
<li> The bracket faced the wrong way when installed.</li>
<li> Very expensive in department stores, I saved almost $15.00 ordering this product on line.</li>

    <li> I waited over 3 weeks for this product to arrive and was in contact with the seller after about 2 weeks.  The seller was responsive, apologetic and refunded me promptly.  It never did arrive.</li>
    <li> TThis is my favorite spring/summer scent. It&#x27;s just lovely and every time I spray it I&#x27;m taken to the first blooms of spring. Layers beautifully with the Jasmine and Mint.</li>
    <li> The intensity of this particular bottle does not seem to be as strong as my first bottle that was a gift and purchased at a prominent department store.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift from cousin and when it ran out I wanted the same.  Love the scent.  The price is great.</li>
    <li> My new scent...love this so much...it takes a while to find a fragrance I&#x27;m crazy enough about to spend some decent money on. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this for a while!</li>
    <li> The bracket faced the wrong way when installed. Had to take out the heating element and place it in the old bracket thai I had removed from the oven.</li>
    <li> I do love a nice fruity fragrance and I had high expectations for Jo Malone Nectarine Blossom &amp; Honey.  Those expectations were very nicely met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jo Malone fragrances are categorized as: citrus, fruity, light floral, floral, spicy, or woody.  One of the fun things about Jo Malone is that you can create your own scent by layering your favorites.  Jo Malone describes the scent as “London&#x27;s Covent Garden early morning market. Succulent nectarine, peach and cassis and delicate spring flowers melt into the note of acacia honey. Sweet and delightfully playful. “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of sprays and I&#x27;ve been lightly layered with a beautifully fruity fragrance.  It dries down to something very light that says with me, in a subtle way, all day.  Nectarine Blossom &amp; Honey has a top note of Cassis, heart note of Acacia Honey, and base note of Peach.  I get peach more than anything else both when I first put it on and at the end of the day.  I can&#x27;t smell the cassis or honey at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very light fragrance and remains subtle throughout the day.  I do prefer lighter fragrances for work days.  I&#x27;m currently using this scent every day and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruity is one of my preferred fragrance profiles and Nectarine Blossom &amp; Honey is a great addition to my favorites list.</li>
    <li> I bought the cream and the perfume.  I adore the cream.It is out of this world. It stays and stays and stays :) You will feel fresh and citrus but not in a lemony way. You will fee like you are coming from the middle of an orange tropical forest! I wear the cream all the time and get great compliments but I put it before I go to bed religiously. It helps me sleep having beautiful calming thoughts!&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the perfume though.  It smelled like a man&#x27;s after shave cologne.  May be it is just my skin that it is not fitting but I will not buy it again. But the cream is a keeper for sure.</li>
    <li> My favorite BUT...you can order it from Nordstrom for $60 no shipping.</li>
    <li> Refreshing scent, not sickening sweet, lasts all day!</li>
    <li> The scent is light and fresh, not overpowering.  A great daytime fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very pricey but love the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before because I like it.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how much I love this smell! I get so many compliments on it. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it still gets five stars because the scent is just intoxicating.</li>
    <li> did not smell as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a fresh scent and stays with you all day, would definitely recommend to anyone who loves perfume.  Smells wonderful!</li>
