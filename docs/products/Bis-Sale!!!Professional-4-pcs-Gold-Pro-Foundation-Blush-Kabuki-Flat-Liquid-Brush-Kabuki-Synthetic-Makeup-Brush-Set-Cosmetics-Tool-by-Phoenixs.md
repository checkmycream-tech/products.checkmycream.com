      <li>(I don&#x27;t know why I expected full size brushes, these are about the size of eyeshadow brushes), but I didn&#x27;t read about them too thoroughly!</li>
      <li>Lucky for me because I had a prom makeup job later that evening</li>

      <li>These brushes are unbelievably soft, they do not shed (yet), they are comfortably firm, they do not smell, and the brushes do what they&#x27;re supposed to better than expected!</li>
      <li>These are so short so even though the bristles are soft, powder has a tendency to stay in globs.  </li>
      <li>I did not use the other two brushes on this job but will certainly find use for them soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So soft and smooth and thick!</li>

    <li> I was quite skeptical about ordering these brushes because of the low price, but I honestly can say at 1st use, I am pleasantly surprised!!! I ordered these brushes in the wee hours of the am on a Wednesday last week and they were on my doorstep Friday afternoon (thanks amazon Prime)!!! Lucky for me because I had a prom makeup job later that evening and I really wanted to use them.

The hairs on them were super soft before and after washing &amp; drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test of course was in how well they worked on a face. And they did not disappoint! The flat-topped kabuki brush blended my liquid foundation like a charm and the angled kabuki worked beautifully for blush and bronzer application. I did not use the other two brushes on this job but will certainly find use for them soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;ll hold up over time but, long story short, I WILL be ordering another set or two while I can get them at this steal of a price!</li>
