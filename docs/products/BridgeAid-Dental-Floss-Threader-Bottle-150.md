<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is the best. It works excellent with my bridge implant.</li>
    <li> These threaders are very comfortable and get under my bridge work with no problems.</li>
    <li> Subject says it all.  My dentist gives me the flimsy ones for free.  Rather pay for these than get the freebies.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy threaders that allow you to easily thread floss through your bridge. I used to get these from the dentist, but they switched to another type that are long and flimsy, which I couldn&#x27;t get through my bridge. I tried to find them at grocery stores and drugstores, but with no luck. Thankfully, I found these online and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I do like this floss because it is much shorter and easier for me to get threw my small bridge.  I will order it again when I need more.  This is actually my second time using this product.</li>
    <li> my hygentist uses these floss threaders during my cleaning to clean under my bridge. I looked at K-Mart, Walmart and Target to find this brand. Only on Amazon did i find them! These threaders are amazing and the price may be a little high but you do get 150 threaders per bottle. wonderful product and i will buy again.</li>
    <li> These work great for anyone that has a permanent bridge, or just tightly spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> I hesitated in spending the money for these but they work perfectly and last a lot longer than the ones in the stores.  It was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been hunting high and low for these things...they are a gem to find here.  I only use natural floss and these \\&quot;needles\\&quot; allow me to continue flossing with my natural floss....and they are otherwise impossible to find where I live.  Highly recommend these if you have a bridge!  I really like the container they come in too..one side has holes like a salt shaker so you can dispense one at a time easily.</li>
    <li> this product is easier to use than the type they sell in the drug stores. It was delivered very quickly and I am very satisfied with the product and the company. thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is much easier to use that the looped threaders.</li>
    <li> I use these to floss under a bridge. Very convenient to use, and helps me clean perfectly.    Next time, I might go for a larger pack to save some money. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been able to use this product because my dentist gives me samples after my teeth are cleaned.  I have tried other products ( special long strands of floss with guides attatched)  This type floss flimsy and hard for me to control.The Bridge guide is much easier to use. The Bridge Aid looks like a big plastic needle. It&#x27;s easy to thread and control. To me it&#x27;s an ideal product.</li>
    <li> But here goes. I just got a bridge. First one. When the dentist showed me how to floss under the tooth I was kind of horrified. I&#x27;m like that. But on his suggestion I bought these threaders. For the first couple of days I had a hard time getting the threader under my tooth but after a while I finally figured out how to fit it easily and quickly between one of the anchor teeth and the bridge tooth. Now I don&#x27;t even think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These threaders are a little stiffer than the type I bought at the pharmacy. That version was like a thick fishing line. I couldn&#x27;t get anywhere with that. Even with these being stiffer, they are skinny/flat and fit without any discomfort on the first try. I&#x27;ll keep this brand in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed to get between my bridges.  Works just as you said it would... If you have difficulty with the flimsy dental floss threaders - try these - Just what the Dr. ordered...</li>
    <li> Great price...came within days and no surprises!  They work great!</li>
    <li> I had been using the Oral B threading floss for about a year after getting my first bridge. They worked well enough but we&#x27;re very expensive compared to the BridgeAid threaders. In fact these are better and easier to use. I can now use the same threader repeatedly, unlike the Oral B. Save yourself some time and money, try this product.</li>
    <li> I got a new bridge so the dental floss threader was a must but buying in small packages was such a waste of money.  This was a great value and the container is perfect for getting one at a time.</li>
    <li> MY dentist had given me a few packets of these threaders after i had bridgework done. After the supply ran out, i was able to purchase these at a  major chain store pharmacy in Southeastern Massachusetts. Now they are not available at that store. I checked a few other pharmacies as well with no luck. i am so pleased amazon is selling  these threaders. Nothing else does the job.  These are essential especially after eating popcorn!</li>
    <li> I had a similar threader for a while until it broke, and the ones my dentist gave me were flimsy and too long for my small mouth. These threaders are easy to use, and the curve facilitates getting them into tight places in the mouth.  It is easy to get floss through the eye, and it stays put.  These are inexpensive enough to keep several in a travel bag, purse, or other  places they might be needed.  It is easy to get a new one from the bottle, as they slip through holes in the lid right into your hand.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I recently got 2 fixed retainers after some orthodontic work.  The dentist gave me G.U.M threaders which is what I&#x27;ve had before.   These are much better than those.  This is why.   1.  These have a nice curve to them so you don&#x27;t have to fish in your mouth to find the end once you thread it through.  2. The color is much easier to see if you drop it (I know sounds trivial but it&#x27;s not)  3.  These are thicker and sturdier than the GUM ones.      This thickness is a good and bad thing.  It is much easier to get them through your teeth but if you have don&#x27;t have a lot of room, these won&#x27;t go through.  I have to go back to my dentist and have her take off some of the bonding because this just won&#x27;t go between 2 teeth that are tight.     But I much prefer these over the flimsy ones the dentists gives you and they are much easier to use.  I use these once a day and Superfloss once a day.      This company has them on sale right now with really good shipping. I wish I had gotten more but oh well.  [...]</li>
    <li> I have used two other brands and both were too flimsy to get between my rear molars.  I have a round house bridge on my uppers and for years have been irritated each time I flossed with the flimsy ones I got free from my dentist and the ones I purchased.  I had never seen these in the stores I shop at so didn&#x27;t know there was any option.  Recently I decided to google floss threaders to see what came up.  After reading the reviews I realized I wasn&#x27;t alone in my opinion of the &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34; and decided to give these a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  Flossing is no longer a chore I dread.</li>
    <li> safety seal not intact</li>
    <li> product good but three months later  using now..</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I have been needing. I have a bridge including two back molars, and to thread the flimsy GUM product or the stupid floss+threader combo through were both absolutely a waste of time. It would take 45 minutes just to try and thread it through. After googling and googling, I found this product and figured &amp;#34;why not.&amp;#34; Boom--I had the floss threaded the very first try. The rigid plastic makes it stiff enough to go through the sub-gingival crevice above the bridge. I highly recommend this for anyone with a bridge anywhere in their mouth. It makes flossing them an easy task.</li>
    <li> As advertised and have been using them daily Thanks</li>
    <li> With two kids with permanent retainers, it could get costly flossing and cleaning. This is the best way to buy threaders, in bulk and with savings.</li>
    <li> these are great for dental bridgework.  i use them all the time and they are easy to use and inexpensive, when bought in this amoount.</li>
    <li> I used to use Butler floss threaders, but they are too flimsy and difficult to use. My Dental Hygienist gave me samples of these. They are stiffer than the Butler threaders and much easier to get through the space between teeth on crowns. Problem is, as good as these are, I have never found them in a store, so I buy them through Amazon about two or three times a year.</li>
    <li> These things are great for flossing under my built-in retainer.  They are flat, so they slide between teeth much easier than the plastic wire kind.</li>
    <li> I could only find the large threaders. These small ones will last me a long time and I now have a source to get more if needed.</li>
    <li> I have known this product--used for flossing under a fixed bridge--since my dentist gave generous samples several years ago.  This is the only package available to me; and as each unit last literally until it is accidentally lost, one really doesn&#x27;t need 150 threaders. My pharmacist could have ordered a big, clumsy device in a smaller package, but not this BridgeAid Threader, which is really the only one I&#x27;d use.  It&#x27;s not expensive; but it&#x27;s annoying to have to buy 150 of them--a supply which will last much longer than I will. If it weren&#x27;t for this bulk packaging, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any one with a bridge. As you need a threader for your floss to get under the bride work. The only complaint that I have is it should be straight and it has a bend in it making it harder to work with.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product several times.  It works best for cleaning between dental bridges.  The curved design makes it simple to use with bare fingers.</li>
    <li> this is the best threader i have seen for bridges. my dental hygienist. introduced me to them and i love them. they are easy to thread and they do the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
    <li> I was surprised after opening up bottle, removing the seal and trying out the threader. All the past reviews were good but I respectfully disagree. Compared to superfloss and G.U.M.S brand [sample pak which is what my dentist gave me when I left his office], this threader is much shorter and much much too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s me, I just got two implants and 4 teeth bridge so the fit is extremely snug and as close to natural teeth as one can get. I find it extremely difficult and painful to insert this thread through the very small opening. I&#x27;m still debating whether to ask for refund or just throw them away.</li>
    <li> WORKS GOOD FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> Great buy or a hard to find product</li>
    <li> I was treated with lingual orthodontic tooth two and a half years.  I was about to floss before brushing, floss your teeth to normal Black Triangle  The technology requires little plug.    However, if you use this product, you can easily pass through the black triangle dental floss.  Lingual orthodontic who do not aligned even if it means good.    The amount is, but I bought two, because it was used with the same thing over and over again,  I also do not use a bottle of the treatment period of 2.5 years.</li>
    <li> Best of its kind on the market. Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband.  He had just gotten a bridge to replace some teeth and had great difficulty flossing under the bridge.  These do the trick!</li>
    <li> The floos threader is functional and the price is reasonable.  The product is delivered promptly and I would order again since it comes in a large bottle.</li>
    <li> These dental floss threaders help, much better than other items I have tried. Have purchase again. I recommend these to people with dental implants.</li>
    <li> Great floss threader for braces.  Stiff, thicker material making it easier.  Short length makes it a quicker to thread through teeth.  My tip is to tie the floss to the threader with a slip knot and then floss away!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product. It can be refilled with new threaders when current stock is consumed and also easily transported. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried threader floss...I&#x27;ve tried the other things my dentist says is designed to help with flossing behind dental appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time the dentist was out of threader floss samples and gave me this as a sample.  These are plastic like and much more firm than any threader floss I&#x27;ve used.  In my case, I have a permanent retainer behind the upper front teeth. They&#x27;re placed close to the gum line so it&#x27;s hard to get something flimsy through the tooth/gum area unless you&#x27;ve got something relatively firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case - these work perfectly.  You use a little floss through the small hole, and use the BridgeAid to help push it through.  Since these are more firm than most other threader floss&#x27; on the market, it&#x27;s much easier to get it through smaller more exact spacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my particular use case, these are exactly what I need.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The best alternative for the price.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and excellent product</li>
    <li> It has the very easy shake and pour top that lets each one come out through a hole. No need to try and grab them or root around in a box, etc for one. I have a bridge and this works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> Floss threaders in local stores are fairly expensive. This product is much cheaper, and it works better than the product I previously used for threading floss under bridges. I especially liked that it is curved and has no trouble sliding through the tiny openings between teeth. The only drawback to me was, due to my age (older eyes and older fingers), I have a bit of trouble sometimes getting the floss through the eye of the threader. Otherwise, they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Great for my bridge. Very easy to use and it really goes through your dental bridge without hurting. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These are not your average Bridge threaders. These are what the dentist sends you home to use, usually in a sample packet of 10 or 20. If you have restorations, crowns, caps or bridges then you will WANT AND NEED to keep these by your tootbrush and floss if you want to keep those expensive dental restorations from having to be removed and redone due to new decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These flossing aids are not like the cheap wisps of plastic hot melded together that you buy in the grocery store. No, these are molded with an easy to thread eye and are sturdy enough for you to thread under multiple bridges in one session without the eye breaking or coming apart. I use one of these a day and can&#x27;t stand to be without them. In truth, when I have been low, I have washed them in oral wash and re-used them but I don&#x27;t ever want to have to do that again. Therefore I keep a good stock of these. If you have been using those flimsy green or blue DenTek Floss Threaders-50 ct , then you are NOT able to rigorously floss under your bridges and down beneath the gumline between tight crowns. The same goes for those little hand-held flossers that shred when faced with a tightly fitted crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridgeaid is what I have been using for years and before I began using them, I had an awful time getting the store bough brand to thread UNDER the bridge. This glide right under and up due to their shape. It beats STABBING your gums and cheeks with the other kind that are too thin and flimsy to slide thru on the first try and which are not polished on the ends.  Bridgeaid has a molded design that holds its curved shape and the end of it is polished smooth.  Yes, it takes a little practice but once you&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it, you&#x27;ll love them and never go back to DENTEK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also worth the money because you only have to use ONE per flossing session and it will not come apart as others do. You save time using these as well. Don&#x27;t hesitate. if your dentist gave you some and you think you can get by with the flimsy ones, I&#x27;m telling you not to bother. It&#x27;s pennywise and pound foolish. You&#x27;ll save SO MUCH MORE money in the gumline and under-bridge cavities you prevent by using these regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I would advise, however is to check AMAZON PRIME for these.  Often the orice is a buck or two more but the shipping is free.  However, sometimes the price fluctuates and it&#x27;s cheaper to get them here.  Just comparison shop.hink you can get by with the flimsy ones, I&#x27;m telling you not to bother. It&#x27;s pennywise and pound foolish.

    <li> BridgeAid Dental Floss Threaders are helpful to clean the teeth.</li>
    <li> We have a tendency to ignore flossing our bridge. This is great, fairly easy to thread and works perfect. I don&#x27;t reuse them but with 150 I need to buy them only several times a year to save thousands of dollars worth of bridge work and pain. Great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my son who has braces.  He loves them and says that they are so easy to use.  They are not as long as the ones the orthodontist gave him, so he said they are easier to use.  I will definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> I tried it and although it doesn&#x27;t work like the kind i used before, I actually like this better.</li>
    <li> product is perfect in every way. It is simple to use and was shipped in a very sanitary container. packaging is really good.</li>
    <li> Great product, can never find it in stores. Would like to buy it that way. But happy I could purchase them online. I have a new bridge and have to use these to floss.</li>
    <li> Not very convenient to use. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> They are not as thin and long as other threaders I have used in the past. They have a stiff cut out shape, which is different than I expected, but it works. I think that they get the job done, but are not as nice as some other threaders I have used.</li>
    <li> This is great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Floss is to short and small to easily handle. It should be more flexible.  Easy to use bottle to obtain floss.</li>
    <li> these work very well for me and you can use them many times it seems without losing their stiffness.  Also a good value for price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these floss aids for years with complete satisfaction. The container, which is ne to me, is a great improvement.</li>
    <li> I use these to thread beads onto my knitting. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying needles and actually works better due to the threaders flexibility.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended them but I could not find them and since I have crowns everywhere I need something sturdy.  So finally I found them on Amazon and it is easy to use.  It also goes all the way into the back.  Good item and worth the money, I now don&#x27;t have to swear anymore when I floss.</li>
    <li> These work.  I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find a cheaper set, though.  I mean, it&#x27;s just thin plastic.</li>
    <li> Opening to insert the floss smaller than I hoped, as is the thickness of the plastic.  Sort of an eye test to get the floss through the opening.</li>
    <li> I had used these in the past but when I moved to another state I couldn&#x27;t find them in any drug store or in Walmart.  Even my dentist was not familiar with them.  Only found the longer floppy ones which are really diffficult to get between my tooth and bridge. I&#x27;m so happy they&#x27;re still available.</li>
    <li> The product arrived &amp; was just as expected.  The dispenser jar is handy.  It&#x27;s not available locally.  Appreciate this service.</li>
    <li> The best! Floss does not fall off threader.</li>
    <li> Bridge flossers are hard to find in stores so I am happy I can find these through Amazon.  This brand is not as stiff as some brands but they get the job done at a low cost.</li>
    <li> Not that easy to thread, but they work for bridges.  I like the larger loop ones better.</li>
    <li> I already tried, my second order, it is very good, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order again</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and incredibly easy to thread. The bottle design makes it easy to shake one threader out without getting your fingers all over the other unused threaders.</li>
