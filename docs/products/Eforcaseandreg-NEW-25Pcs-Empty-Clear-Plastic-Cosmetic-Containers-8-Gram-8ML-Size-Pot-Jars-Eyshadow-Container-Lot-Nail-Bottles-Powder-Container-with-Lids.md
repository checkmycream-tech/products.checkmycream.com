<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are great for making my beeswax lip balm.  Just DO NOT boil to sterilize, use alcohol instead. otherwise you end up with a bunch of warped plastic</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re prefect size and the lids stay tight, but my only problem is that they were very scratched on the outsides. Which isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem for me because I&#x27;m going to be giving away the things I use these for, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re going to be selling whatever you put in these. They&#x27;re cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Love these containers, they fit perfectly with the lids. I&#x27;m using them to put my samples in and they work very well. I&#x27;m extremely impressed and happy I got them.</li>
    <li> Work great for the dry samples I use.  Arrived quickly too.</li>
    <li> in love with the containers, met my expectations and very easy to open. will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I love these little containers! I&#x27;ve used them to give out natural vapor rub samples, for homemade lip balm, even diy art supplies. They&#x27;re a great size and very portable. I will reorder!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I anticipated</li>
    <li> Too little - item not properly described. The cost to retun the item is ridiculously high! Seller not willing to pay for the return cost. Very dissapointing</li>
    <li> Worked great for my daughter&#x27;s high school project and was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> These shipped to me from Amazon&#x27;s warehouse super fast. They arrived in a box with some other items inside a sealed bag with the lids loosely screwed on. None of them were cracked, a bit scuffed but not too where I feel they&#x27;re unpresentable. All lids fit great. These are tiny (as expected with 5gram containers) so they are a bit thin but seem to be nice quality. I think they will be Perfect for sampling out my DIY projects. 1&amp;#34; round label fits perfectly on top or botton with a bit of room to spare. Do not recommend for liquids. So far it seems like a great jar &amp; would re-order.</li>
    <li> What I expected but missing one cover.</li>
    <li> The containers overall look great. None are missing, cracked, or scratched. A little smaller than I expected but true to size.</li>
    <li> Five arrived broken, most arrived scratched. Not the worst product in the world, but I kind of wish I&#x27;d shopped around a bit more and found something better.  Update: They are in no way airtight and have dried out every product I&#x27;ve put in them. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> A couple were damaged, but they worked great for lip butters I made.</li>
    <li> Good product very small and the tops don&#x27;t always thread right</li>
    <li> Just reordered these little containers.  Theyre the perfect size for homemade lip balm!</li>
    <li> THEY SERVE MY PURPOSE VERY WELL. WILL BE WELL USED. THANKS</li>
    <li> I love these! But I wish I could buy more and get a discount. I need like 300, these are great and sturdy and you can&#x27;t beat the price at .28 cents each</li>
    <li> I like the product but I was shorted 2 of them.  Package says 50, I got 48.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I am using these to make lip balm as gifts.  I have also made salves and put them in one of these little containers. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this size so useful for so many homemade products that I make.  I especially like to use them for my homemade chapstick, and tinted lip balms. Great for lip plumper and loose eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Great price and really like them, but my older daughter told me we need to use tubes for our lip balm.......Not looking forward to pouring into those little tubes....ugh&lt;br /&gt;These were easy to use and I like how you can see through them.</li>
    <li> Spend a few extra bucks and get better quality.  My package arrived ,  no bubble wrap or protection.  There are 4 containers cracked or broken.  In the photo, they appear to be a nice, clear plastic.  The majority of my lids are scratched.  Overall,  not pleased.</li>
    <li> Pretty good condition. None were broken. Arrived quickly. I will order again.</li>
    <li> CONTAINER IS MUCH SMALLER THAN WE EXPECTED. VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> Ok first off, they arrived jumbled in a bag and I had to assemble and count each one to make sure none were missing. That sucked. This also means they arrived with almost ALL the plastic containers scratched and scuffed. They gave me a little phone stand too (which was nice), but I would&#x27;ve preferred everything to be in good shape instead. The way they are now they look pretty bad, but at least they&#x27;re all there.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat these for the price.  If you are looking for a container to put something in for resale I would probably not use these - I would go with something a little higher quality.  However we made homemade lip balm and included it in a holiday basket for my daughters class at school and these were perfect.  Mine all arrived just fine, none broken or scratched.  Just note they are made of &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; plastic.  I hate it when people buy the cheapest product and give it bad reviews - for the price these are great</li>
    <li> I may not have been paying attention well enough, but these were much, much smaller than I had anticipated. There seem to be  made well enough but are just a very small.</li>
    <li> They worked great for my first time ever making lip balms, however almost half of the containers cracked.  I am not too sure if it had to do with the heat or if they came that way.  I was a bit disappointed because I was unable to give them out as a gift.</li>
