    <li> I really like,keeps my hair in place even when its muggy outside.  It also helps when styling my hair.the price fair</li>
    <li> I had bought this same hairspray from hair salons and it was an aerosol that I really liked. However, this product is smaller than the aerosol version and is a pump. It doesn&#x27;t have the same smell either. The aerosol version had a light vanilla smell. If you are fine with pump hairsprays, then you might like this product. Personally, I prefer aerosol hairsprays so I returned this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff- smells great and holds well. I wish it were easier to find and less expensive!</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair that has no natural body, this product when used with a round brush and hair dryer, a flat iron, or curling iron gives body to my hair that lasts all day with out it being crunchy like some hairsprays and gels. Gives a texture to hair so not for people who want their hair to be shiny or silky smooth, but is you want some volume, body, and want your hair down and that style to last all day this is a great product, best I have used so far.</li>
    <li> this is one of the finest hair sprays of its kind. I am so sorry that Davines has decided to change the formula.</li>
    <li> Great for styling and teasing your hair when hairspray is too heavy.  Never sticky.  Another fabulous Davines product.  Highly recommend.</li>

    <li> I love this hairspray.  Unfortunately I understand it has been discontinued.  Its a shame because It is the only hairspray out there of its kind. Sprays like a pump and has great hold.  The one turn off for me in this particular instance was that now that supplies out there are getting low, the price was extremely inflated which was annoying.  But, I purchased it anyway.</li>
    <li> Goes on light and it smells great.  This hairspray is not sticky or crunchy on the hair. It is expensive and hard to find.</li>
    <li> Will hold a style all day without reapplying.  Has a very nice scent.  Once it&#x27;s set, you can comb through your hair and it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hairspray! It is a non-aerosol ( good for environment and your lungs) and it has amazing hold! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, you can still comb through it but enough hold to help with humidity or rainy days. I have finer hair so the hold may feel stronger to me but it still leaves my hair looking shiny and soft. This spray smells like dessert!! If you want your hair to smell like delicious chocolate buy this hairspray, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> The No 9 structuring mist holds hair great, and is light to the touch.  No heavy feel and no residue.</li>
    <li> Excellent hold and push spray dispenser is way better than a traditional hold-down nozzle allowing you to use just the right amount without spraying everywhere.</li>
    <li> Fabulous hair styling product.  No buildup even after 6 days continuous use..  No trace of hair spray.  Worth the money</li>
    <li> Love this spray but it has become too pricey for me.</li>
    <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey, but it works!</li>
    <li> Works well shaping hair when used wet.  Holds well.  Seeing as I have never been completely happy with any hairspray, this really is a good product for the money.</li>
    <li> Davines hair product are expensive, but generally performs well. This order was shipped directly from Amazon and evidently was not checked before shipping. The aerosol container had no pressure and leaked badly.  This is when Amazon shows it operational weakiest. Returning products is difficult (no direction contact with a customer service)and time consuming.</li>
    <li> Davines discontinued making my favorite hairspray which really stunk, until I gave this one a try.  I have long fine hair that put up mostly during the week because I&#x27;m in an office and can&#x27;t stand my hair in my face while at my computer.  It lasts all day with out it being crunchy, unnatural or looking like I shellacked my head.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best mist I have ever used.  I threw out my hairspray when I first starting using this.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever!</li>
