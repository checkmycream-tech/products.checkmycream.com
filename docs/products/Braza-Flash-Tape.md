      <li>I have no idea how I lived without it before (with great difficulty, of course).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this tape for a couple of months now and every time has worked great.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it works great...</li>
      <li>This tape is great.</li>
      <li>Great quality tape, though.</li>
      <li>I experienced neither of those issues.  </li>

      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>NOPE, the tape held my dress in place perfectly and comfortably.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS TAPE!  </li>
      <li>I Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Do not use on stretchy fabric and you&#x27;ll probably be ok!</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>I was able to dance no problem too!</li>
      <li>It was amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>I got sooo many compliments on the dress and took a gazillion pictures in it, I loved the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to adjust my dress at all.</li>
      <li>Good to have on hand for so many uses.  </li>
      <li>It came in so handy before a wedding.</li>
      <li>Buy this tape ladies, it sticks to skin marvelously and the tape dispenser makes it so easy to get just the right amount of tape you need.  </li>
      <li>Super amazing!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I think it would work better on a lighter garment like a shirt or dress with straps.</li>
      <li>This stuff works better than duct tape.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I used to use a safely pin between the buttons of blouses, now I use this and avoid the damage to my clothes.</li>
      <li>I love this fabric tape.</li>
      <li>Although I had no sticky residue, I&#x27;m sure it can easily be removed by getting a cotton ball and using a bit of olive oil and swiping it across the skin.  </li>
      <li>And in my defense, the sateen fabric seemed more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; than my bra, but the shirt was fine.</li>
      <li>Used this once so far on a maternity photo shoot and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I used this tape to secure a gorgeously sexy custom made sequin dress I had purchased from KamiShade.com.</li>
      <li>Pretty strong, just hurt my skin and the fabric more than anticipated!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off fabric easily</li>
      <li>Easily removed from fabric and skin after use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to peel off fabric and skin at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It honestly works very well!</li>
      <li>One hand wash and the shirt was fine.  </li>
      <li>This double stick tape works great.  </li>
      <li>Although it does adhere to fabric, it doesn&#x27;t secure the clothing to your skin--even for a moment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also fantastic for dresses (keeping them in place).</li>
      <li>It did feel awkward because I could feel the tape sticking to me, but most importantly it stayed and made me more confident and happy with my dress.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t stick and it irritated my skin luckily</li>
      <li>Was using fabrics to drape on the pregnant lady and it really helped keeping the fabric in the area</li>
      <li>I did make sure my skin was clean and dry (not oily) before applying, just a heads up.</li>
      <li>I am also a VERY busty girl, and because of the way the dress was made, it was definitely a go braless or don&#x27;t even think about wearing the dress kind of thing.</li>
      <li>My dress was definitely movie starlet sequin quality, and Braza Fashion Tape helped me to keep myself looking fabulous!  </li>
      <li>It is SO much easier and faster than using a safety pin!</li>
      <li>So I had another sexy dress on back up.</li>
      <li>Probably would work better if you actually had boobs...</li>
      <li>The first 12 inches worked but after that it does not stick</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>It was not easy to remove from metallic spandex fabric and pulled a good bit of the &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; off the metallic garment.</li>
      <li>A roll lasts forever, so flash tape is extremely cost effective.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I used this to tack a loose fitting spaghetti strap shirt to my bra.  </li>
      <li>I used it for a runway gig, and it was fine in short bursts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another issue is whenever I tear the side that covers the tape off, the thing sticks onto the tape which was really problematic.</li>
      <li>Also, from so much moving around on my body, the tape got gunky around the edges and I needed rubbing alcohol to take it off my skin.</li>
      <li>I forgot to wipe the area to remove any lotions/oils and it stuck very well...</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it really wouldn&#x27;t be gentle on the clothing..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m perplexed by the reviews that say this tape either doesn&#x27;t stick to skin or that it stuck to skin so well that some sort of residue was left on the skin.  </li>
      <li>but I know that they will not be coming off until I&#x27;m ready to take them off</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to need it for longer than 2 hours, so I can&#x27;t speak much to all-day wear.</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t even need that much of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also a very busty girl (38G)</li>
      <li>It sticks and holds really well between skin and cloth and even cloth on cloth.</li>
      <li>Maybe with other materials it will work better.</li>
      <li>This tape keeps me decent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good heavy sticky doublesided medical tape.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Used it to secure a fanny pad for doing mat pilates to my underwear but does not hold too well when it gets wet and sweaty.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews and it seemed more positive than negative</li>
      <li>did have to scrub off some of the tape residue left behind the next day - but what was important was that it worked for my very special and important event allowing me to look and feel comfortable and elegant (sorry, but there is nothing classy about having to pull up your wedding dress every 5 minutes).</li>
      <li>and I anticipated having to change early!</li>
      <li>Holds you right in place as long as you don&#x27;t sweat a lot.</li>
      <li>I am rather pleased with this tape, however one needs to remember that it only sticks to one side of the fabric, if you dress is two layers of fabric it may fold down.</li>
      <li>This is some very sticky tape - needed it for a bridesmaid dress to stay up on the sides and it definitely worked.  </li>
      <li>I used it to &amp;#34;hem&amp;#34; a pair of pants for a conference when I didn&#x27;t have time to get them done professionally and the tape did the trip.</li>
      <li>may have gotten a slightly old roll -</li>
      <li>but I have used it to tape scarves to my chest so they&#x27;ll stay tucked inside; to keep shirts from riding up; and, most importantly, to keep blouses from slipping down and causing a \\&quot;wardrobe malfunction\\&quot; as happened on a job interview a few months ago.  </li>
      <li>It lasts on fabric-to-fabric VERY well, though skin-to-fabric will probably just depend on how long you need to wear it, and where on your body it&#x27;ll be positioned.</li>
      <li>Granted, the dress was a bit loose around my chest, which is why I used the tape, but it did not hold up the dress very well.</li>
      <li>Works well, but the tape residue doesn&#x27;t completely come off of multiple types of fabrics even after soaking with detergent.</li>
      <li>I was surprised the tape lasted that long</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Keeps my Pasties stuck tight! I Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My strapless silk wedding dress had a tendency to slightly slip and even though I took it to three different tailors I was told it was the make of the dress and no one would touch it. Someone at my work suggested body tape to help keep me from pulling it up all night. I went down to a store nearby and this was the brand that they sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great! I was iffy from all the reviews and not really sure how well tape could hold up my dress which was slightly heavy. I didn&#x27;t even have time to put tape around the bust - only two strips down my back were done. It did feel awkward because I could feel the tape sticking to me, but most importantly it stayed and made me more confident and happy with my dress. My bridesmaid also used it to hide her bra straps and she didn&#x27;t show all night long - her only complaint was cleaning off the stickiness from her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have used it to keep some of the spaces between shirt button holes closed as my bust is a little larger and often causes gaps. Although it can look a little awkward and needs to be placed right, it sticks very well. I did make sure my skin was clean and dry (not oily) before applying, just a heads up. And my now-husband (Yay!) did have to scrub off some of the tape residue left behind the next day - but what was important was that it worked for my very special and important event allowing me to look and feel comfortable and elegant (sorry, but there is nothing classy about having to pull up your wedding dress every 5 minutes).</li>
    <li> I see they have changed the listing now, but when I ordered this, it made you think you were getting 6 for the price of one, with 6 rolls of tape in the picture as well as mention of 6 rolls in the description. That&#x27;s the only reason I ordered it, could have gotten this locally cheaper. Great quality tape, though.</li>
    <li> Probably would work better if you actually had boobs...</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and it seemed more positive than negative so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t work for me however. It only sticks on my skin for about 3 minutes then it loses its grip.&lt;br /&gt;The tape is really thin and lightweight so I had a feeling it wasn&#x27;t going to hold well enough.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is whenever I tear the side that covers the tape off, the thing sticks onto the tape which was really problematic.</li>
    <li> Best fashion tape. Does at job, sticks all&lt;br /&gt;Night through sweat and humidity. Love it. I keep buying.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my daughter to use for her dance costume gloves, but I&#x27;ve taken over it on days I wear my low cut bra. No more boobs popping out... the tape keeps everything in it&#x27;s place.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work. Sticks to skin decently enough (though not great) but definitely not to fabrics. Don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> While I have not yet used this, I loaned it to a friend at a wedding and it saved the day in preventing a wardrobe malfunction. Good to have on hand for so many uses.  Definitely girl&#x27;s duct tape!</li>
    <li> Stuck to my skin so well it almost hurt to take it off. It didn&#x27;t stick well to my dress though, so that was a waste. Maybe with other materials it will work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m perplexed by the reviews that say this tape either doesn&#x27;t stick to skin or that it stuck to skin so well that some sort of residue was left on the skin.  I experienced neither of those issues.  I LOVE THIS TAPE!  I used this tape to secure a gorgeously sexy custom made sequin dress I had purchased from KamiShade.com. The dress had a very very low cut plunging neckline, and it had wide straps that I knew would slide off of my shoulders because of the way the dress was made. I am also a VERY busty girl, and because of the way the dress was made, it was definitely a go braless or don&#x27;t even think about wearing the dress kind of thing. I&#x27;m also a very busty girl (38G) I didn&#x27;t want \\&quot;the girls\\&quot; popping out on me all night.. Flash tape to the rescue! I secured the front of the plunging neckline to my cleavage and also secured the shoulder area. And it lasted ALL NIGHT. It was amazing. I put the dress on at 7:00pm and didn&#x27;t change out of it until 12:30pm. I was surprised the tape lasted that long and I anticipated having to change early! So I had another sexy dress on back up. NOPE, the tape held my dress in place perfectly and comfortably. I was able to dance no problem too! I got sooo many compliments on the dress and took a gazillion pictures in it, I loved the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to adjust my dress at all. My dress was definitely movie starlet sequin quality, and Braza Fashion Tape helped me to keep myself looking fabulous!  Buy this tape ladies, it sticks to skin marvelously and the tape dispenser makes it so easy to get just the right amount of tape you need.  Also, DO NOT put any type of moisturizer on your skin in the area you plan to adhere, it should be common sense as nothing can stick to oily skin. Although I had no sticky residue, I&#x27;m sure it can easily be removed by getting a cotton ball and using a bit of olive oil and swiping it across the skin.  Braza Fashion tape is wonderful and I look forward to using it again and wearing my fabulously sexy sequin dress again!quin dress again!</li>
    <li> I have to wear a uniform for work that includes a button up shirt. The shirt always opened up between two of the buttons and I hated using a safety pin because it always takes me so long to get it to work correctly. This tape is the perfect solution! It is SO much easier and faster than using a safety pin! I&#x27;ve been using this tape for a couple of months now and every time has worked great. My shirt always stays closed and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore. The only problem is sometimes the tape will leave a slight residue behind, but I&#x27;ve found that using smaller pieces of tape helps prevent that from happening.</li>
    <li> This worked well to keep a dance costume from slipping off part of a bra. It was not easy to remove from metallic spandex fabric and pulled a good bit of the &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; off the metallic garment. Be careful to apply it in non-visible areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have gotten a slightly old roll - the backing had a tendency to separate and made it more difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good heavy sticky doublesided medical tape.</li>
    <li> Used it to secure a fanny pad for doing mat pilates to my underwear but does not hold too well when it gets wet and sweaty.  Hard to remove afterwards too.</li>
    <li> IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO USE WITHOUT HELP, AND IT DIDN&#x27;T LAY FLAT ENOUGH TO BE UNSEEN.  THEN IT STUCK TO ALL THE THINGS IT SHOULD BE ON.</li>
    <li> This tape is great. I used it to &amp;#34;hem&amp;#34; a pair of pants for a conference when I didn&#x27;t have time to get them done professionally and the tape did the trip. It&#x27;s also fantastic for dresses (keeping them in place). I&#x27;d forgotten about this tape for a few years, but it&#x27;s now a staple.</li>
    <li> This the second roll that I&#x27;ve had and I use it a lot .It holds extremely well. I use it each summer to tape my outdoor cushions to the seats. I have also given rolls to my daughter and she loves it also.  And I do use it on my clothes as advertised.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no way to sugar coat it, I&#x27;m a busty woman. This tape keeps me decent. I used to use a safely pin between the buttons of blouses, now I use this and avoid the damage to my clothes. I also use this to keep bra straps hidden under wide neck shirts. A roll lasts forever, so flash tape is extremely cost effective.</li>
    <li> This works well with thick fabric. It came in so handy before a wedding. My bridesmaid dress was a little lose. So I used the tape to hold it up.</li>
    <li> love it! As long as you don&#x27;t sweat, then it peels off...</li>
    <li> It honestly works very well!</li>
    <li> The first 12 inches worked but after that it does not stick</li>
    <li> Definitely sticks! I forgot to wipe the area to remove any lotions/oils and it stuck very well...I used it to hold on a strapless backless bra.</li>
    <li> This product is the worst of both worlds. Although it does adhere to fabric, it doesn&#x27;t secure the clothing to your skin--even for a moment. While it is somewhat effective at closing gaps in garments, it is difficult to remove at the end of the day because the tape splits and leaves a gummy mess on the fabric.</li>
    <li> This works as expected.</li>
    <li> This double stick tape works great.  No more worrying about people seeing something they don&#x27;t need to (or want to!).</li>
    <li> Super amazing! This stuff is great, I use it all the time. I have no idea how I lived without it before (with great difficulty, of course). It sticks and holds really well between skin and cloth and even cloth on cloth. And you don&#x27;t even need that much of it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this tape for a couple of months but I have used it to tape scarves to my chest so they&#x27;ll stay tucked inside; to keep shirts from riding up; and, most importantly, to keep blouses from slipping down and causing a \\&quot;wardrobe malfunction\\&quot; as happened on a job interview a few months ago.  Just this morning, I used it as emergency hem tape to tape trousers&#x27; hem where it was coming lose and I didn&#x27;t have time to sew it. It&#x27;s easy to peel off fabric and skin at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I am rather pleased with this tape, however one needs to remember that it only sticks to one side of the fabric, if you dress is two layers of fabric it may fold down. The tape held firm but began to start showing as the fabric of my dress tried to pull away.</li>
    <li> Pretty strong, just hurt my skin and the fabric more than anticipated! Didn&#x27;t realize it really wouldn&#x27;t be gentle on the clothing.. Isn&#x27;t that the point of this?</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than duct tape. It sticks through a forty eight hour dance amd probably the apocalypse too. Just remember to take it off before the wash or it will stay on the clothes for eternity. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> much cheaper than the competitor, but do be forewarned: it will leave slightly ugly marks on your bra strap if you care</li>
    <li> No it was horrible it didn&#x27;t stick and it irritated my skin luckily my prom dress wasn&#x27;t that big or that would have been a disaster</li>
    <li> I love this fabric tape. I make pasties and this stuff keeps then on all night. It doesn&#x27;t come off fabric easily so the pasties are a one time wear but I know that they will not be coming off until I&#x27;m ready to take them off</li>
    <li> Works well, but the tape residue doesn&#x27;t completely come off of multiple types of fabrics even after soaking with detergent.</li>
    <li> Works well. It didn&#x27;t pull off fabric or skin with movement. Easily removed from fabric and skin after use.</li>
    <li> I used this to tack a loose fitting spaghetti strap shirt to my bra.  It held up for 8 hours with no problem.  When I got undressed, it came off of the sateen shirt with a little struggle.  One hand wash and the shirt was fine.  The bra was a different story.  After a few washes, the straps are still tacky, so much that I can&#x27;t wear a shirt without it sticking to the spots where the tape was.  This isn&#x27;t the biggest deal, but because it&#x27;s a VS bra, It&#x27;s a $75 loss. It says not to use on delicate fabric so maybe that&#x27;s my fault, but I think it should also say no stretchy fabric.  And in my defense, the sateen fabric seemed more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; than my bra, but the shirt was fine. Do not use on stretchy fabric and you&#x27;ll probably be ok!</li>
    <li> Used this once so far on a maternity photo shoot and it worked great. Was using fabrics to drape on the pregnant lady and it really helped keeping the fabric in the area I wanted that was not clamped around her. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Holds you right in place as long as you don&#x27;t sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I&#x27;ve used it in a pinch on crepe, cotton, and chiffon. It lasts on fabric-to-fabric VERY well, though skin-to-fabric will probably just depend on how long you need to wear it, and where on your body it&#x27;ll be positioned. Chances are (ladies), you want this for your chest area. I used it for a runway gig, and it was fine in short bursts. I&#x27;ve yet to need it for longer than 2 hours, so I can&#x27;t speak much to all-day wear.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is some very sticky tape - needed it for a bridesmaid dress to stay up on the sides and it definitely worked.  After a few hours of sweating though, the tape will wear.  It bunched up by the end of the night and started rubbing against my skin. Otherwise, it works great...</li>
    <li> It works for a little while. I used it for a strapless bridesmaid&#x27;s dress. Granted, the dress was a bit loose around my chest, which is why I used the tape, but it did not hold up the dress very well. I think it would work better on a lighter garment like a shirt or dress with straps. Also, from so much moving around on my body, the tape got gunky around the edges and I needed rubbing alcohol to take it off my skin.</li>
