      <li>I love this eyecream!</li>

      <li>I use all of pangea organics and find them to be quite effective.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real significant results.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best eye cream I have tried!</li>
      <li>You would spend much more trying to find a suitable substitute.</li>
      <li>The cream is very smooth and I use it every night.</li>
      <li>The product is ok.  </li>
      <li>It has no smell, which I love because I find a lot of eye creams too fragrant.</li>
      <li>and I love this line.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many eye creams to cure my eye bags.  </li>
      <li>I put this eye cream on thinking it would be organic, and thus, completely safe.</li>
      <li>I use this each morning, then go over it with a more moisturizing cream.  </li>
      <li>It is okay.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to find it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>I received this cream as a free sample with another skin product order and was so pleased that I ordered this product from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I think these one is pretty effective.  </li>
      <li>Liked it at first.  </li>
      <li>This cream is light and disappears rapidly when patted in, but keeps my skin moist even in the winter.</li>
      <li>And I love that after I put it on, the skin around my eyes actually glows (in a good way).</li>
      <li>Pangea&#x27;s Rose and White Tea Eye Cream does all of that and more.</li>
      <li>The cream is light, but still moisturizes adequately.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause my makeup to run or</li>
      <li>While unfortunately it seems that there is no product that will make me look 20 again, this is the best eye cream of the many I have tried.</li>
      <li>This cream is very rich and hydrating, it is important to say I&#x27;m in mid-twenties and have been using it for about 5 years, I have steadily watch the results until now, is rich and creamy although it absorbs quickly and allows to use make- up relatively fast afterwards.</li>
      <li>it is really great for dark circles.  </li>
      <li>It smells really good and a tube goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth for the price.</li>
      <li>The Pangea is the most gentle of the two, but perhaps this makes it less effective as an anti-aging eye treatment?</li>
      <li>The sample I received from Sephora may have been more concentrated and the actual product is not all that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on the same tube (0.5 oz) for more than a year.</li>
      <li>This is the first cream that has visible lessened them.  </li>
      <li>I will gladly pay the prices they ask, which I do not see as excessive, and it&#x27;s healthy for your skin and body.  </li>
      <li>Another stellar product from Pangea.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I found out Whole foods was no longer carrying this product</li>
      <li>and it feels very soothing.</li>
      <li>The scent is gentle, and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;cloying.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I was looking for an organic cream that would moisturize, smooth, and possibly brighten my eye area.</li>
      <li>I would highly reccommend this eye cream even if you are not using the Pangea line.</li>
      <li>Being almost 50, I need a little more moisture.  </li>
      <li>A pea sized amount is too much, this product really goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I like that the texture of this cream is not too thick and feels very light.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it if you want natural, reach and soft cream, that will still provide you results.</li>
      <li>This eye cream is definitely firming, however, it isn&#x27;t really moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I love that it is all natural, although it is quite pricey for the size a little goes long way.</li>
      <li>It is light and creamy, not the least bit greasy.</li>
      <li>The dollar amount may seem high for such a small tube, but such a tiny amount is needed that it lasts for months and thus is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>dark circles have diminished and I haven&#x27;t developed any fine lines or wrinkles in my eye area in the past 2.5 years that I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
      <li>Think my dark circles have really diminished.</li>

<li> A little goes a long way and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> A little bit of the product goes a long way.</li>
<li> In response to the nonreview posted due to the size and price...</li>
<li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since childhood.  </li>
<li> But dark circles are hereditary</li>
<li> It helps the dark circles underneath the eyes fade and helps diminish the lines around the eyes.</li>
<li> you feel really tight after putting it on..</li>
<li> But a little pricey for the results I achieved.</li>
<li> It is very slightly scented, nothing so noticeable that it is a bother.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t mind the cost either because I use so little at a time, the sample, which was small, lasted two weeks.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m still using it, but in rotation with my usual Aveda Green Science Firming eye cream.</li>
<li> It may have been because of something else on my skin and how they acted together... not sure.</li>
<li> Not sure what results I expected/got.  </li>
<li> Help me a lot when I sleep really late</li>
<li> but I fail to see any reduction of dark circles.  </li>
<li> Although the cream is billed as a wrinkle reducer (I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes, at least not yet!!)</li>
<li> used to use La Mer, and have now become obsessed with this.&lt;br</li>
<li> Read the ingredients on some of the products and inform yourself about just how bad it is to use these products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This eye cream is definitely firming, however, it isn&#x27;t really moisturizing.  Being almost 50, I need a little more moisture.  I use this each morning, then go over it with a more moisturizing cream.  It is double the product, but I do like the firming qualities of this item.</li>
    <li> I use all of pangea organics and find them to be quite effective.  In response to the nonreview posted due to the size and price...They have changed the size of the eye cream to .5 oz now.  These products are concentrated and you DO NOT need to gob the stuff on.  A little goes a long way and lasts a long time. I will gladly pay the prices they ask, which I do not see as excessive, and it&#x27;s healthy for your skin and body.  There is alot of chemical junk out on the retail that costs a ton of money and it does nothing, I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of them.  Read the ingredients on some of the products and inform yourself about just how bad it is to use these products. One good source for this info is the Environmental Working Group website. For anyone wanting to try pangea I would not hesitate.</li>
    <li> I love this eyecream! It helps the dark circles underneath the eyes fade and helps diminish the lines around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This cream is very rich and hydrating, it is important to say I&#x27;m in mid-twenties and have been using it for about 5 years, I have steadily watch the results until now, is rich and creamy although it absorbs quickly and allows to use make- up relatively fast afterwards. I love that it is all natural, although it is quite pricey for the size a little goes long way. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it if you want natural, reach and soft cream, that will still provide you results.</li>
    <li> I put this eye cream on thinking it would be organic, and thus, completely safe. Shortly after application, the entire eye area turned red and started burning. I have no idea why.&lt;br /&gt;Test this product out on your arm before you apply.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic cream that would moisturize, smooth, and possibly brighten my eye area. Pangea&#x27;s Rose and White Tea Eye Cream does all of that and more. A little bit of the product goes a long way. The cream is light, but still moisturizes adequately. And I love that after I put it on, the skin around my eyes actually glows (in a good way). Another stellar product from Pangea. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this cream actually works for me.I have tried many ,and for me this one works best.</li>
    <li> A pea sized amount is too much, this product really goes a long way.  It is very slightly scented, nothing so noticeable that it is a bother.  The cream is very smooth and I use it every night. I use this as a preemptive strike and don&#x27;t mind using it every night. Don&#x27;t mind the cost either because I use so little at a time, the sample, which was small, lasted two weeks.  -Valerie [...]</li>
    <li> The dollar amount may seem high for such a small tube, but such a tiny amount is needed that it lasts for months and thus is well worth the money.

While unfortunately it seems that there is no product that will make me look 20 again, this is the best eye cream of the many I have tried.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing, I&#x27;ve been using it for years now. Amazon is the cheapest place I have found that carries this product. It smells really good and a tube goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever had. Think my dark circles have really diminished. Help me a lot when I sleep really late</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since childhood.  This is the first cream that has visible lessened them.  Although the cream is billed as a wrinkle reducer (I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes, at least not yet!!) it is really great for dark circles.  I received this cream as a free sample with another skin product order and was so pleased that I ordered this product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> But a little pricey for the results I achieved. The sample I received from Sephora may have been more concentrated and the actual product is not all that.</li>
    <li> Over priced.  It is okay.  I didn&#x27;t see any real significant results.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s pricey, this eye cream will last a long time when you use it as directed. I&#x27;ve been on the same tube (0.5 oz) for more than a year. I only apply it in the morning, but I&#x27;ve used it every day since it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect consistency for me- light yet substantial- and it feels very soothing. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause my makeup to run or cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is quite sensitive, and nearly every other product that I&#x27;ve used for my eye area has irritated and caused redness and slight to moderate swelling. Pangea feels wonderful to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dark circles have diminished and I haven&#x27;t developed any fine lines or wrinkles in my eye area in the past 2.5 years that I&#x27;ve used it. (I cannot say the same for my forehead and around my mouth!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried the sample, but are hesitant to purchase based on the price, go for it! You would spend much more trying to find a suitable substitute.</li>
    <li> The product is ok.  It moisturizes but I fail to see any reduction of dark circles.  But dark circles are hereditary (i&#x27;ve had them all my life) so I&#x27;m not upset it didn&#x27;t take those away, I didn&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Pangea&#x27;s eye cream!!!  It works beautifully--I can definitely see and feel a difference in the skin around my eyes--and a little goes a long way.  Will definitely keep this product as part of my &#x27;beauty arsenal.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Tried a trial then went looking for more!  Works and smells great too!  I would recommend this one for eye treatment</li>
    <li> Liked it at first.  Not sure what results I expected/got.  After awhile, when I&#x27;d put it on the area would turn red.  It may have been because of something else on my skin and how they acted together... not sure.</li>
    <li> it works!&lt;br /&gt;I used to use La Mer, and have now become obsessed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makes you feel really tight after putting it on..&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference using twice a day, after 2 wks.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eye cream I have tried! I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple weeks, but already notice that my skin is getting tighter, my upper eyelids are not so puffy, and my bags are reduced. I like that the texture of this cream is not too thick and feels very light. It has no smell, which I love because I find a lot of eye creams too fragrant. I would highly reccommend this eye cream even if you are not using the Pangea line.</li>
    <li> I found out Whole foods was no longer carrying this product and I love this line. I was excited to find it on Amazon! Great product</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. This is where I found the best price, too. It is light and creamy, not the least bit greasy. You only use a tiny amount around your eyes each day so it lasts a long time. The scent is gentle, and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;cloying.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Received a sample while shopping at WF, and enjoyed the creamy moisture, pleasant smell, and the non-irritating gentleness of the product. As other reviewers have noted, the sample appears to have a different consistency that the actual product... the actual product seems not as moisturizing nor as aromatic. I&#x27;m still using it, but in rotation with my usual Aveda Green Science Firming eye cream. As a sensitive contact-lens wearer, neither of these cause the sting or blurriness that other eye creams bring on. The Pangea is the most gentle of the two, but perhaps this makes it less effective as an anti-aging eye treatment?</li>
    <li> I have tried so many eye creams to cure my eye bags.  I think these one is pretty effective.  I have already using the third one.  I think it&#x27;s worth for the price.</li>
