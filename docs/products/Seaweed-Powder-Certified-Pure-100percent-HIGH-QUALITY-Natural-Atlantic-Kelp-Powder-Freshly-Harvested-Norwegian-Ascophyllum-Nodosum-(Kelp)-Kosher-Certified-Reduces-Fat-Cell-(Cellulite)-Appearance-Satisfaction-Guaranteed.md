<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the Seaweed powder a few weeks ago and I can&#x27;t believe I love it! I have acne prone skin as well as red marks from acne scarring and this has helped my complexion and has helped to prevent acne from forming. I have been using this as a facial cleanser both in the morning and at night. (I use it in the evening after removing makeup). It also helps my face from getting really oily. The only thing is that it smells like fish food, but besides that it&#x27;s great. I think it is meant to be used for your entire body, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve made several facial masks and a foot mask with this powder, I think the quality is great. Shipping was fast and the customer service was good.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Use for the face masks and for cellulitis. My skin is so soft and tight  after. The seaweed  powder is very  beneficial  for  the skin. Just got indian green  clay which  I will  use together with the seeweed for my cellulite. Ithe take a  time  to  see  any  results  but I am very  pleased  with  a result  I have right now. I would  recommend  the product.</li>
    <li> The company delivered the product in a timely manner and did email recipes. I&#x27;ve been using this as a scrub using the recipe on the container ever other day for 2 weeks. I haven&#x27;t seen results on the cellulite yet but my skin feels amazing. I&#x27;m holding out hope that it will reduce the dimpling soon.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that was 100% Seaweed; and tried this product and was very happy. This is the real deal. Smells like the ocean too. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this so much! What can I say? It smells fantastic, is a good price, and works well. I use it once every 1-2 weeks and so far my skin is looking much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! I will be buying this again when I run out :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really great products! thank you! Zizi Blaski</li>
    <li> I was told that this powder is use to control blood sugar</li>
    <li> I love the affect it has on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great, the company sent me ideas on other ways to use the product, I&#x27;ve used powered sea weed in shakes, baths and face wash, but I didn&#x27;t know it can be used with clay to help cellulite.</li>
    <li> I have begun to see a smoothing of the large cellulite clumps on my thighs. I am totally amazed with what I am experiencing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the recipe that the seller provided me with.  It is slightly different from the recipe a friend gave me.</li>
    <li> My Seaweed Powder did a great treatment with the recipe book that the company&lt;br /&gt;supplies you with it is a spa treatment at home and also is great for friends to come&lt;br /&gt;over and try&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this natural product to bring your skin back to its youth again</li>
    <li> excellent product. leaves very soft pien. I charm.</li>
    <li> This kelp powder is so versatile it can be used in face masks, hair treatments, body scrubs and more! It was great to test this out this was my first time using Kelp Powder so I was a newbie but Natural Essentials provided me with many recipes for different scrubs and masks to start me off, they even send an email with additional recipes to test they were so great to work with! You can tell that they really believe in their product and want to help people improve the look of their skin or even enjoy a nice spa facial at home! I really liked this product it is wonderful and made my skin nice and soft. Thank you Natural Essentials for providing me with this sample to test out.</li>
    <li> Best quality I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Mixed with green clay, it makes a very cleansing and energizing mask after exfoliation. It smells really like seaweek so I add a drop of eucalyptus or lavender essential oil. Once a month and it really let the skin fresh and revitalized.</li>
    <li> Hi Julie, thanks so much for reaching out to me and giving me a coupon for my next purchase... I only used the powder on one occasion, my first experience didn&#x27;t go to well.. It was a very messy and I haven&#x27;t tried it again since then... I haven&#x27;t given up and will be trying again very soon.😊</li>
    <li> I used this powder as a body wrap. I have applied 3 so far. This is over a 5 day period, I mixed the powder as directed and applied to my midsection. I left it on for 1 hour while I cleaned the house as other activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all let me say the smell is a little unpleasant but too overbarring. I used plastic wrap instead of the body wrap material. I applied this every other day for the last 5 days. It really did make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My jeans that were really snug are now more comfortable. I haven&#x27;t lost any weight according to the scale but there is a noticable difference.</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this product for any purpose. Athough I am very excited to learn all the ways this seaweed powder will benefit me, I have no idea on how to use it. There are no instructions or recipes on the jar that I may use, but I did receive an email for only one; and the jar has website that I can go on to get more recipes I guess. However, there should be a more conventional way of retrieving the information needed in order for me and other consumers to enjoy our product when we get it. I suggest this jar come with a pamphlet of ideas on what the kelp powder is beneficial towards, recipes, and instructions.</li>
    <li> Great product! Amazing seller, answered all my questions, gave me recipes and checked in on me. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> GREAT Powder!  I used this seaweed powder inside soap that I made.  I noticed my skin to be soft and very smooth after the first use.  The more I used it the better my skin looked and felt.  I recommend this powder for everyone whom wants to look and feel amazing.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!!! i use it as as a belly wrap to reduce inches and it actually does that...its not a miracle worker u wont have a flat stomach the instant you use it but i do notice a marked difference when i use it...i mix it with french green clay and wrap with saran wrap an then bandage wrap an leave it on for an hour...i also use some on the cellulite on my thighs and my legs are now a little smoother...hopefully with continued use it will get rid of them totally...will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Works fantastic in baths for skin health.</li>
    <li> So very pleased with this product! I have tried many products in dealing with my cellulite and this one has blown me away. I&#x27;ve also made facial masks with this powder that have been very beneficial to my skin. The customer service that accompanies this product is just has great as the product. I highly recommend this powder for your beauty needs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this Seaweed Powder for two reasons: first of all, it is organic and secondary, I do believe in magic power of seaweed. Plus I do believe in Mother-Nature and do not believe that some trihydrosulfamethacarbo-something-you-cannot-even-pronounce ingredients of most of fancy creams on the market can do any good to your skin. Our grandmothers used only Mother-Nature gifts for any kind of skin care and it worked perfect. The Seaweed Powder is rich with micro elements and iodine, and it helps to my skin look much younger. I&#x27;ve started with face masks 2 times a week and my own recipe works very well: I mix 1 full tea spoon of Seaweed Powder with hot water to make a pur&amp;eacute;e like mix and add a little bit of organic coconut oil (1/2-1 teaspoon) which I warm up in a tablespoon holding it just above the flame of any candle (or I use gas stove as well), till it transforms to liquid form. The coconut oil is a perfect remedy for any type of skin, especially dry one, and in combination with seaweed powder it makes my skin glow. I have to admit, the seaweed smells like a raw fish but I can handle it. I do my little trick, while having my facial seaweed mask I burn sandalwood incense sticks in my room to &amp;#34;negotiate smell of the ocean&amp;#34; :-) General condition of my skin has improved and even skin tone is more even now, after only 3 weeks of use (6 masks total). I will definitely buy this product again. I think this jar will last for many months, the way I use it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful service and good product strong smell tho</li>
    <li> I love it! My order was right on time just like they said , the recipes for the masks are great and very easy to put on practice . I use the seaweed powder mix with clay powder, coffee, 3 tbs olive oil, 3 tbs argan oil and 3tbs warm water all mix together for body wraps( I use plastic wraps $1 dollar tree) then over I put the sauna pants and  cover with a blanket for 30 min. For me is really working, the skin is looking really toner and healthier . I will reorder the seaweed when I run low for sure. Thank you for the good suggestion , are very much appreciate specially the ones for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  The product is organic and seems to be of good quality.  I cannot speak for its use as a face mask or any other typical/advertised purposes, because I use it as a supplement in my dog&#x27;s food.  I have a dog cook book (so 21st century, I know) that recommends adding seaweed powder to a supplemental stew, that is then added to other home cooked meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find any seaweed powder in stores, so I bought some seaweed wraps and tried grinding them into a powder using a coffee grinder, but that broke my grinder!  Plus it still never got very fine and didn&#x27;t look like very good quality when I was finished.  This Natural Escentials product fits the bill nicely, and doesn&#x27;t seem overpriced for how much you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also has great customer service.  They immediately sent me some recipes and asked if I was satisfied.  They weren&#x27;t too naggy, and even gave me a 30% off coupon for my next purchase after I gave them a brief reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to that!</li>
    <li> The seaweed powder is easy to use and works well with the clay powder to form a creamy and rich mixture.  After putting the mixture on the face as a mask and allows it to dry-out, it gives you a cool, refresh and tight feeling.  Since it is a seaweed mixture, you may smell the kelp and it is kind of strong for some people though, but it is normal.  To reduce that smell, I put in some coffee grinds and since coffee grind can be used as part of the mask mixture, it works out pretty well for me.  I love it and hope you like it too!</li>
    <li> Excellent products, And the customer services super good!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT ,MADE SKIN FEEL LIKE SILK,</li>
    <li> Love this product leaves my skin soft</li>
    <li> The best seaweed, I use coconut oil and this seaweed for wraps, I just love it!</li>
    <li> So far so good, the smell of this product is strong in the sense that it is pure seaweed,but it works. I mixed the powder with coffee grounds,a little EVOO, and water. You can for sure tell the difference. Give it some time. Nothing happens over night.</li>
    <li> This is quality kelp with no filler.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and its price.. I use it as face mask and my sister as a wrap that defiantly I will buy it again</li>
    <li> The customer service is fabulous! Excellent communication and e recipes emailed immediately. I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results however, I mixed this seaweed powder with bentonite clay and my skin felt great as well as helping the clay not dry out my skin. If you have dry skin this is a must with the clay. I also read olive oil mixed with the seaweed powder and clay is good. Ok the smell is horrid especially if you hate fish like I do but I can tough it out. I will try ess. oils as others have suggested. I figured it might smell bad, I mean it is seaweed people ;D.&lt;br /&gt;I think this will be a great product to continue but too soon to tell. 5 stars because even though it smells (expected) it is a good product. I would question the product if it did not have that smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, mixes easily.  I mixed up a blend to use before showering.  I don&#x27;t mind the odor; it&#x27;s seaweed, so it&#x27;s not going to smell like roses.  But it isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell either.  If you want the benefits of seaweed, you have to use the seaweed and yes, you may smell the seaweed.</li>
    <li> This product is great, I totally love it and I&#x27;m sure I will order more! My skin getting so smooth after each use. Also wanted to say thank you to the seller for great customer service!!! I would definitely recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Looking forward to trying more recipes with this.</li>
    <li> I saw an episode of Dr. Oz that talked about the benefits of seaweed for cellulite. I was very skeptical but decided to try this product. I followed the instructions and created a paste with it. My cellulite is mainly on my thighs and butt area so I lathered up. The container and Dr. Oz have a recipe that consists of seaweed powder, olive oil and sea salt. The recipes state that you later up and then shower but I like to sit in it for a bit. The mixture gets very slimy when wet so be sure to use it in the bathtub or somewhere else safe that you don&#x27;t mind covering in this stuff. Anything you touch gets coated. After putting it on I grabbed a book and relaxed in the tub, no water, for about 20 mins. It works!!!!! My cellulite diminished significantly after a week. I still continue to use this product, not daily but once or twice a week. I love it. It leaves my skin feeling super soft too! I was given this product at a discount for my honest review and I am very pleased with this product...as stated in my review. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is such a great powder. I made up a huge batch of mask for my daughter to use at her pedi-party. All of the kids loved the way their feet and legs felt after we took off the hot towels and plastic wrap.  I have just a bit of powder left which I will be making into a facial mask....for ME!  I can&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> Well, I think the product is high quality; I just haven&#x27;t noticed any significant results in terms of my cellulite. It may be, though, that I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is a bit messy which is to be expected. I tried the seaweed wrap and can&#x27;t wait to try more recipes!</li>
    <li> This is my first review even though I had purchased many products on Amazon.This seaweed powder really hydrate and smooth out my skin complexion. I have have no problem with the smell but it is quite messy when use. I just adore the seller because he or she emailed me multiple times to check up how I am liking the product  and even kind enough to provides me coupon for my next purchase &amp;#60;3.</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that not only is this an organic product but that the ebook accompanying the product (emailed separately by the manufacturer) serves as a great reference for using the seaweed powder and benefitting from it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing amazing product .... sprinkle a little in my food and eat it (tastes great) or i combine it with my skin recipe to get rid of unwanted situations such as rashes, warts, herpes etc.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product to do Dr. Oz&#x27;s five day challenge. I hope it works! Gave it  one star because I had to rate it to post, Keso you updated</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review in hopes that it may help someone else. The product came quickly and packaged well. Only problem is that when I applied it to my face as a mask, it started stinging after a minute and my face became inflamed. I don&#x27;t thing this had anything to do with the product or seller quality but an allergic reaction. I mixed this with plain water so I know it had to do with the product itself. For anyone else out there trying this, it never hurts to do a patch test.</li>
    <li> the spa scrub leaves your skin feeling so smooth. just slightly noticed the smoothing of my &amp;#34;bag of wet laundry&amp;#34; which is what I refer to the back of my thighs. I will keep using in hopes for more diminishing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. I mixed it with yogurt as a face mask. The powder mixes well and makes a smooth mask. However, the fishy smell was so unbearable. I think I&#x27;ll have to add some essential oil or something to cover the smell. But it&#x27;s 100% seaweed so it&#x27;s not surprising. It made my face feel really soft after first use. I liked it and will be using it weekly to see if there&#x27;s a more long-term permanent result.</li>
    <li> Love it and healthy for skin</li>
    <li> so far happy with this will have to wait and update on it</li>
    <li> I love Natural Escentials Seaweed Powder. First of all you should know that I have used other products from Natural Escentials, and I have never had a problem with any of their products. This seaweed powder is very fine. There are no large pieces so it mixes perfectly for beauty recipes. There is a recipe right on the label for a Cellulite Scrub. I use it with Greek yogurt and honey for a face mask, and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This powder is stinky but I do feel it is effective. When I put in on my face I can feel my skin tighten. I have been using this for about a month (1X wk) on my thighs as a wrap. I can feel that my skin is much more softer and pliable. It is a messy process when putting on. I mix mine in a small bowl and then let it set for about a minute to thicken. (please note do not mix much at a time, mixture will thicken and become moldy). When I apply the product to my thighs it tends to make a mess on the floor. Easy to clean right up though. I am hoping in time that my cellulite will diminish. I will add that I can see a slight difference. I do exercise regularly and drink plenty of water. I just need an extra boost to try to be able to wear a swim suit. I was most impressed that the company contacted me about a month out to check the status of my results. The representative even took the time to address my questions and advise her recommendations. I would say Best Customer Service Hands Down!</li>
    <li> I needed that product for soap making and really it was a perfect choice to make my soap recipe successful</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product it has been a miracle on my legs.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the seaweed powder.  I really like this product!  I love using natural ingredients and this seaweed powder is 100% natural.  It is good for various scrubs, masks and wraps.  It really makes your skin feel soft and smooth!  It can be made to different consistency&#x27;s depending on the recipe you use and this company also sends a really handy electronic recipe booklet as well so that you can try different ways to use it.</li>
    <li> Nice product&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean up</li>
    <li> It stinks, it takes time, it&#x27;s messy, didn&#x27;t do nothing for me don&#x27;t waste your money with all the crap we get suckered into buying you can save up for surgery and get real results!</li>
    <li> I ordered this seaweed powder to make face masks. I tried using it and it was an epic failure. I followed a recipe I found on Google. I don&#x27;t know if it was the recipe or if it was the powder. I wish I had just bought the mask pre-made. I think it would be a good product if i new the proper way to use it. I did really like that it came with an e- book though.</li>
    <li> Helped with my cellulite</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after every use. I&#x27;ve recommended some family and friends to try this out.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a good but it stinks</li>
    <li> I love this high quality seaweed powder! Its been fabulous in my seaweed scrubs! Great quality product. Will order again!</li>
    <li> good seaweed powder, good fresh smell, I do body scrubs and wraps with powder and my skin feels smooth and very soft. I want to find more time for myself and do body wraps often to see real result. I&#x27;m breastfeeding mom and how I saw when I do wraps often than 1 time a week my baby feels fussy.  so need to wait about year till I will done with breastfeeding .&lt;br /&gt;Seller very nice, she wrote to me about 2-3 times to find out how I like powder , but always don&#x27;t have a tome to answer . So, seller , sorry for that and thank you for your taking care about your customers.</li>
    <li> Great product! They sent me personalized recipes and a coupon after purchase which I loved! Very good quality powder!</li>
    <li> When I mix it for the cellulite  reduction. I don&#x27;t see results yet but my skin feels very smooth after I apply and shower.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! A little difficult to use at first, but very helpful and immediately effective!</li>
    <li> So to begin the smell is not the greatest. It takes some getting used to and it&#x27;s still not good... Lol. That being said the seaweed feels really refreshing on your skin. It does seem to help a little so far but I&#x27;m sure with more time I will see a better result! I&#x27;m honestly happy already that I got this!</li>
    <li> I have been soaking for three years. And I have never used seaweed in my soaps before. I had a customer who wanted me to duplicate of soap that she had to mail order. And she would rather buy local then to mail order it. So I ordered this seaweed. And I am so happy that I did. I don&#x27;t know how I have gone three years and not have this as a staple in my soaping additives.</li>
    <li> It really stinks and is hard to rub on your body as it dries up even with tons of water and rolls off your skin into the tub or on the floor. Perhaps would be better if calculations of water were better and added essential oils. You&#x27;re going to have to get your measurements down to a science to keep this from flaking off your skin.</li>
    <li> Its a good product. I like an effect after a use but i don&#x27;t like a smell.</li>
    <li> The item arrived one day earlier than expected which is very appreciated. I have been using this with Aloe Vera, Raw Honey, Milk, and Rose Water to help with the fishy smell seaweed which is expected. I have noticed that my skin becomes extremely smoother, softer, and back acne has reduced significantly which was the reason why I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this product, I just started using it about 1 month ago as part of a body wrap around my belly. I am a mother of two and have noticed a significant difference after just two wraps. I feel like after a couple of days after I do my wrap my belly loses some inches, or I am not as bloated. It is truly miraculous. I also use it on my face, as a face mask since I have very dry skin. I can&#x27;t complain the seaweed leaves my face nice and supple. I will continue to use and buy this product, I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a body scrub!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She&#x27;s made a couple masks with it now and says it&#x27;s working well! It&#x27;s a little hard to get the right consistency for her to get it to stay on her face but once you do your skin feels great afterwords.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use in the shower in my legs everyday</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the seaweed. It is really good. I had noticed the different on my skin. It is smoother, soft, needs more work, since I only have a week using it but I ca see the different. I had tried other products and believe me this is the only thing that I can confirm that is wonderful. You will receive an e-book in pdf format with diffferent recipes for you to try at home. Costumer service is excellent. Julie, had been there since the moment I bought it giving me new recipes and answering all my questions. I would definitely recommend this seaweed and it is high quality. My cellulite is disappearing little by little, of course with a combination: of drinking a lot of water and being more active, and I added the seaweed powder: every day doing scrub and one day during the week a wrap which makes the big diffferent. When try these ( scrub and wrap) do it inside the tub since it is messy and use and old towel since it stains, Be careful you don&#x27;t stain your rug or your clothes. It an Excellent product, I&#x27;m so happy with my seaweed. I recommend it 100%. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as a mask yet.  What I plan to do is put  it in smoothies and in my dogs food.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is okay.</li>
    <li> This leaves your skin feeling as smooth as a baby&#x27;s cheek.</li>
    <li> I really really enjoy the seaweed powder, I am very happy with the results, as long as I&#x27;m alive I will continue to use this and highly recommend all of you to use it, I have spread the word to my friends and family, believe me it&#x27;s the best face product on earth, very satisfied customer!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍😄</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in the shower and I love it (it&#x27;s been about two weeks so far).  I mixed it with sea salt, almond, avocado and eucalyptus or peppermint oil.  Mix to your consistency.  It does roll off somewhat, but patience is key.  I mixed it to a slightly think, but spreadable consistency and rub it on my thighs in the shower.  Some of it falls off, but I just pick it up and massage it back in.  You don&#x27;t have to completely cover your thighs in seaweed, I just massage it into my thighs for about 1 minute, then rinse it off.  My thighs are so soft afterwards as well as my hands and anywhere else I use it.  I see and feel a difference.  I&#x27;ll try and post a before and after photo after about two months use.</li>
    <li> Saw doctor oz when he had a show about cellulite .. So your product has been very helpful !</li>
    <li> I have not used other seaweed powder brands too compare this poweder to, but it look like a good quality product. I have only been using it for 2 weeks, and so far I like it.</li>
    <li> This has a nice consistency and it&#x27;s not super gritty and won&#x27;t clog your sinks. I used it as a face mask. I added some water and honey to it and my face was super clear and super clean after. I would use this mask once or twice a week to get all the toxins and impurities out of my face from all the makeup I use throughout the week.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it for everything from face masks to cellulite wraps and it all works amazingly. I will definately be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on my legs yet. I&#x27;ll take before and after pics. My cellulite is really bad so it won&#x27;t be hard to see something, hopefully. I didn&#x27;t use it in a tea tree anti-aging mask. I like it thus far. I&#x27;m enjoy making my own masks though so if that&#x27;s not your thing you should go to a salon. Hope to have amazing results on my legs to share :)</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s just start out by saying Seaweed Powder - Pure 100% Natural Atlantic Kelp Powder - Freshly Harvested Norwegian Ascophyllum Nodosum (Kelp) - Kosher Certified can help multiple medical conditions but I wouldn&#x27;t say to actually digest it ~Normally when I add anything new to my routine I usually take it alone for a couple of weeks so that I can isolate what works for me and what doesn&#x27;t. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much of anything. To be honest I had used another one similar to this  recently and had identical results that&#x27;s why I think it is only fare to add some from an older review to start this is  a little  darker then other and it&#x27;s stats freshly harvested maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s Darker green too Anyway the other I tried recently gave me pretty much the same results so here we go  I did some more  researching the different brands of seaweed types online Like other recently , the Seaweed Powder - Pure Ascophyllum Nodosum (Kelp) Powder - A Cellulite-Reducing Seaweed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Wrap Mask Ingredient - Kosher Certified - From&lt;br /&gt;Natural Escentials is another keeper.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is  I always have reddish/purplish underlying \\&quot;scars\\&quot; from the acne I had gone back to a dermatologist, but they wanted to put me on all kinds of medications Sorry but I like natural from earth stuff and I have cellulite behind legs area and inner thigh area too .  Powdered seaweed (kelp powder ) has the longest shelf life and is supposed to be the most \\&quot;drawing\\&quot; power for impurities in the skin. It is also the most drying of all . So I received this packaged mess free in plastic bag double machine sealed is a plus you can empty as I did in plastic jar with top .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I develop cystic pimples on my forehead and my jawline/neck and is a mess. I tested this  powered seaweed because of this ongoing issue still I have a little of problem till this very day but improved with seed weed (kelp like I stated that I recently used too  . I used a little plastic cup and measuring spoon and mixed 1/2 tsp of powder with 1 tsp of tap water. I mixed it well and rubbed it only onto the problem areas used my fingers it was pretty runny, and has a funky dark green color, but I let it dry and then went to sleep leaving it on my skin overnight. Let me tell you, I have never seen anything like it second again time results of use WOW~~~ One day I promise I will take picture so that I could post on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here what my skin looked like , and what it looks like now. This stuff is at pretty even league with the  one I used Recently  it will heal your skin as it did with mine . The little cystic acne that Came back a tiny bit  on my forehead disappeared like magic again . My pores that&#x27;s say there still not here .  The best part is, this package of powder is 1lb and will probably last me a few times if I just use it as an overnight remedy on face . If you have leftovers from what You had already mixed with water the first night, My advice because I made this mistake before with other seaweed kelp I put the lid on my little plastic mixing cup, added a few drops of water the next night, and I was able to re-use the mixture just a Tip : ). A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;little only  you&#x27;ll can use as all-over face mask once a week too (And of course for if you have cellulite behind your butt cheeks and inner thighs This is my second time  using a recipe but this one is different then last not the same unique in it&#x27;s own way worked great as well as last recipe I used  ~~ A little advice again for your cellulite area you can use a flat head big plastic spoon or your fingers I tried this recipe for my body wrap it worked like a charm behind buttocks and inner thighs now it is starting to tighten up again with this one too &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup seaweed&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup green clay&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup lime juice&lt;br /&gt;1 tbsp honey&lt;br /&gt;3 tbsp hot water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Massage onto cellulite before showering once daily this worked very well since I have a dryness to my back and bad cellulite area .Also, you must be prepared to look like a lizard after putting this on your face and body and some of it can rub off on your pillowcase if you choose to use it as an overnight treatment make sure your not allergic to seaweed ( kelp) either . I am For Second time SO thrilled with the results but again with Natural Escentials not that the other stuff  I used was bad in anyway at all.&lt;br /&gt;I wish to have used this second kind of stuff as well when I was a teen this  Super Super Natural earth bound Stuff is the second ~Best helper  : )&lt;br /&gt;Courtesy of Natural Escentials !&lt;br /&gt;.

    <li> The seaweed powder arrived in a plastic bag with a sticker on it. No plastic jar like the one seen here. I have no idea if it is the same product listed here or not, as it just states the company&#x27;s web address and nothing more, no instructions, no ingredients (other than, &#x27;100% seaweed powder&#x27; ...which tells me nothing). As for the product itself, it certainly smells like seaweed, so I guess that&#x27;s good. I was expecting it to be smoother but even after I let it soak for a while it&#x27;s quite granular and doesn&#x27;t go on evenly. It may be a good product, however it doesn&#x27;t actually state that it&#x27;s organic or from the US, and the weird packaging has me perplexed and a bit annoyed that I have to find something in which to store this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but it mixed well with the olive oil &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what the results with be after continued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skin therapist and recently purchased this product.  I really enjoyed the effects on my clients&#x27; skin and their feedback has been great.  This powder mixes well with essential oils and other natural components and I&#x27;ve used it as a mask as well as a mild exfoliant.  If using as a mask on someone other than yourself, be sure to have plenty of warm and moist towels on hand to remove with since product can be a bit crumbly.  The best part of this purchase was the excellent customer service I received from Julie Rose...she gave me some fantastic tips and a very informative menu of different recipes.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is great seaweed powder.  It&#x27;s high quality and I have seen visible changes in my skin after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using seaweed powder in a scrub to help try to smooth out the dimples of cellulite I did exfoliate my legs/thighs &amp; butt 5-7 days a week. This is how I know this is not just because I all of a sudden started paying more attention to my thighs and exfoliating them with a scrub (seaweed or not) that my skin feels like this. I have other body scrubs I use regularly but since I have quit using those on my thighs and just started using the seaweed scrub on my thighs, my skin feel much more even and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used:&lt;br /&gt;4 tbsp Seaweed Powder&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup sea salt&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup sugar&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (optional)&lt;br /&gt;1 cup coconut oil (fractionated (liquid) works best but you can melt solid coconut oil and it will work fine too) - I started with a 1/4 cup and added about a 1/4 cup more because I like my scrubs a little more liquidy&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint essential oil - A LOT, like I think I used a tablespoon or more trying to cover up the smell of the apple cider vinegar (which I may leave out in the future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this in a face mask and I have also used this sort of like a face mask type consistency on my butt &amp; thighs.  I used equal parts seaweed powder and sodium bentonite clay (&amp;#34;Indian Healing Clay&amp;#34;) and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min. I really think its the combination of the seaweed powder with the peppermint oil that has made my skin/thighs look and feel a lot better. I have used this twice for body wraps using the seaweed powder, peppermint oil and water into a thin paste and wrapped my thighs in plastic wrap for 30 min.  I really like this sort of homemade body wrap, it&#x27;s fun and I like how it makes my skin look!  Very pleased with this powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________&lt;br /&gt;Made in: USA&lt;br /&gt;ASIN: B00JQP1SP6&lt;br /&gt;UPC: 820103212489&lt;br /&gt;Product purchased at a discount from: Natural Escentials&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 2 days after order date (without Amazon Prime)JQP1SP6&lt;br /&gt;UPC: 820103212489&lt;br /&gt;Product purchased at a discount from: Natural Escentials&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 2 days after order date (without Amazon Prime)</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as advertised, book of recipes for scrubs and masks is excellent.  I would buy all my spa essential products from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I am crazy about it,I love it from frist use..lam tried many of creams but not like these.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing really</li>
    <li> I add this food grade powder to smoothies - many health benefits including reduction&lt;br /&gt;of inflamation for arthritis. Also adding alfalfa and pea protein to smoothies. Kelp is a bit gritty and a&lt;br /&gt;strong taste so add banana, cinnamon, yogurt, stevia and other flavor enhancers to make&lt;br /&gt;more palatable. It will still not be delicious - so don&#x27;t have any illusions about yummy - but it&lt;br /&gt;will be drinkable - and a way to get lots of great healing nutrition. Haven&#x27;t been using long&lt;br /&gt;enough to be sure about impact on arthritis - seems to be slight improvement after only a week.&lt;br /&gt;Will need more time to be sure. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin yet - looking forward to that.&lt;br /&gt;Note to arthritis sufferers: Dr. David Brownstein&#x27;s book, Overcoming Arthritis is a must read.&lt;br /&gt;Provides case studies and clinical histories of patients CURED of arthritis through a regimen&lt;br /&gt;of low-dose, long-term antibiotics along with hormone balancing and holistic lifestyle changes.&lt;br /&gt;Arthritis is caused by mycoplasma bacteria and this protocol is a cure. Most doctors are treating&lt;br /&gt;symptoms only and don&#x27;t know there is a cure. I am concerned though about long-&lt;br /&gt;term antibiotics so for now am pursuing natural treatments - mind, body and spirit - (Dr. Joe&lt;br /&gt;Dispenza&#x27;s book, You Are the Placebo). If this doesn&#x27;t work, antibiotics will be my last recourse.&lt;br /&gt;There is hope for people who are suffering.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. 10 stars for customer service to this company!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I absolutely love this stuff. Great quality, and it makes my body wrap muds the perfect consistency.</li>
    <li> This makes your skin really soft, I haven&#x27;t used it on a consistent basis to tell if it will get rid of cellulite, but when you do use it makes sure to add some kind of essential oils as this does smell like actual seaweed and it is not a good smell.</li>
    <li> An awesome, high quality product. I love the way my skin looks and feels after I&#x27;ve used it. The customer support is outstanding. Very quick to respond to my questions and offered useful tips on different uses for the product. I felt like they genuinely wanted to make sure that I was informed about the product and that I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Is it messy?  Yes (a little bit), it is seaweed powder!  Does it smell fishy?  Yes (a little bit), it is seaweed powder!  Does it work?  Externally, yes; internally very likely!  You can skip the reviews of the &amp;#34;babies&amp;#34; who make a mess and those who refuse to accept that seaweed powder smells like seaweed powder!  Also, great price at less than $30!</li>
    <li> Seaweed rubs are great for eliminating toxins from your body. I use it on my legs for toning and cellulite reduction, as well as my face to clean out pores. Love this stuff and recommend to my clients. For more info, visit www.behealthyhappywhole.com.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin really soft and my cellulite is less by 50 percent.</li>
    <li> This product is great! it has given me very good results and I&#x27;ve seen that cellulite is less visible after I&#x27;ve been using it. I also use it  as a facial mask and I love it.</li>
    <li> The kelp powder arrived on time. I have used it twice so far. I am using it as a facial mask. The effects are visible, my skin already looks softer, and my acne flare ups have significantly reduced.  I plan on using this kelp powder twice weekly to keep my face looking healthy.  I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a natural facial mask.</li>
    <li> I Received It Waaay Sooner Than Expected! &#x3D;) I Haven&#x27;t Used It Yet, But Mostly Because I Have No Idea How.? I Thought It Would At Least Come With Basic Recipes But No! &#x3D;{ I Looked A Bit Online But I Can&#x27;t Really Find Anything &#x3D;\ HELP!</li>
    <li> Love the product......</li>
    <li> I saw this product (seaweed powder ) on dr oz and using it everyday as directed works on cellulite!! Delivered and promised and excellent folliow up.</li>
    <li> Ive had this product for three weeks now and I really love this powder. I think it works best when I mix it with oil. I&#x27;ve used it for body wraps, facials and in the shower with the cellulite brush. My skin has never been smoother and I can already tell that my cellulite I vanishing.</li>
    <li> Trying to process the return now. Never could tell if my skin looked better due to the stench. Do you want to smell like a school cafeteria on fish-stick day? Then buy this. Ugh. Gross.</li>
    <li> Seaweed powder really works for cellulite,and you can make facial mask for a natural glow</li>
    <li> Works great and you can feel it working on your skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Makes my skin soft and smooth. I love adding a essential oil I&#x27;m in the mod for and use it in the shower</li>
    <li> So far I am really enjoying the seaweed powder and its many uses for the face and body. I recently learned of the benefits of seaweed and this product has provided true results for me. I would recommend this product to anyone and the customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> I was all excited about this product until I tried it. The consistency is too grainy and it makes a complete mess. It also smells somewhat fishy which I wasn&#x27;t crazy about. I was expecting it to become a smoother paste after adding water, similar to what you would get in a spa. After leaving this stuff on forever I washed it off and there was no difference in my skin. I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on this stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and Customer Service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually writing this while I have the mask on my face. I wasn&#x27;t able to open the jar for about a week, the lid was on so tight. Let me tell you the mask does not come on smooth like the lady in the picture. The texture is so chunky, it looks like I&#x27;m spreading oatmeal on my face. I wish it would go on flat and smooth like the picture, disappointed this is false advertising. The smell isn&#x27;t bad. You do no recieve a free e book. On the website it&#x27;s only 2 lame recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just washed it off. My face feels the same no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The amount you receive with your order is well worth the price in&lt;br /&gt;itself. Once you try it, you see the results really fast. I found my skin smoother and fresher. It is really is remarkable.</li>
    <li> A total waste of money. Not only does it not work, it made a mess!</li>
    <li> First and foremost, this product is huge - as in last you a long, long, long time huge. My experience with seaweed powder is as related to external use only. I understand that this is a consumable grade of seaweed powder, and some do put it in smoothies to drink, but my review is limited to my external usage.  I like to use it as a detoxifier in my bath at night, and also as a facial mask. I will mix a bit of the powder with some warm water and honey to form a consistency to apply as a facial mask.  Sometimes I will switch out the honey with a bit of olive oil for variety, but I primarily use honey for its own natural antibacterial properties.  Having this product makes me feel as if I have brought a bit of my spa home for under $22!</li>
    <li> It is a great product . great seaweed powders and you really need little to mix with other ingredient to make your mask.the company sent me emails to give a mask recipes. They have great customer services.  I used it twice and notice a different. will continue to use and keep you update it.</li>
    <li> I am so, so extremely happy that I have found this amazing company for 2 very, very important reasons. I will honestly tell you, that over many, many years I have ordered a variety of products via Amazon.  I not one time had a reason to go back to leave a rating/ feedback.  In some cases it just wasn&#x27;t necessary for certain products, or I already knew what I was ordering would be a good product because it was coming from a reference who was a close friend. I can honestly tell you that this particular brand is the best, and most purest form that I have found that&#x27;s out there, and I have tried a few.  It was so obvious to me right away in it&#x27;s consistency/texture when making my body scrub.  I also noticed a marked difference in the quality, and I use this right now morning, and night in a scrub type form.  I HAVE NO CELLULITE!!!:):):) The customer service is a huge reason for me as well to keep coming back. The company has reached out to me via E-mail ( and not just a generic E-mail sent out to everybody, it was personal &amp; specific to me), and not only shared some great recipes for scrubs, but offered a coupon towards my next purchase!! Thank You so very, very much Natural Essentials!!! Sincerely, Your regular new friend &amp; regular customer, Gia!!!:):):)</li>
    <li> Received very quickly.  Made a mask with honey, egg white and olive olive oil.  My mom and I put this on.  Both of us were happy with the results.  Skin appears clear and glowing.  Thank you.  Also going to try the body mask. Will buy again...but not for a while, the jar will last. Great bargain.</li>
    <li> The seller is amazing! She has checked in with me and also given me some great tips. I love the powder in a scrub, but have not had as good of luck with making a body mask. That could definitely be operator error though. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Just tried the Seaweed powder for the first time using the recipe I was sent online as part of this promotional offer.  The product is easyto use and the recipes easy to follow. My face feels moist yet firmed.  I&#x27;m very likely to order more of this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Wonderful customer service and follow up from seller.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, easy to use and effective too. Will buy again!! Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered the kelp powder for a home facial, and the product was great. Natural Escentials also followed up by mailing me a facial recipe and a coupon - which I will get to after quite a few facials, as this is a lot of Kelp for the dollar!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product through and through.  I use it in my spa and I have to day I was impressed with just a teen minute facial/hand treatment.  It tightens, tones and leaves your skin hydrated.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again to restock!</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit too strong for me but well worth the result!</li>
    <li> GREAT detoxifier! Smells pretty bad and the company will spam you but the product is good so grin and bear it. Just tell the company to FO after the first message and they will comply.</li>
    <li> i got this to make a scub out of,i put lemon grass oil with it so it would smell good.this is a great product.i will purchase more when i run out.100% natual.thanks again for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been getting into making my own facial and body masks.  The Seaweed Powder is great to add to my new collection of natural products.  Natural Escentials has even been kind enough to give me some suggested recipes that are simple and refreshing.</li>
    <li> A little bit complicated to use. You need to buy olive oil and some other stuff too, but the result worth the price.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from eczema.  Bathing in the kelp powder has helped control the itching.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes the est after shower lotion! It is replenishing and a great surprise to everyone that uses it. I love that when I ordered it the company emailed me a bunch of recipes to try out. I have very bad acne and this works amazing as a facial to clean your pores and get rid of the problem faster as well.</li>
    <li> Second time buying - I watched Dr. Oz discuss how this can really work on cellulite; I&#x27;m a believer! While it may not get rid of all of it (or a really bad case); I did see a noticeable difference. I mix it w/olive oil, essential oil, Himalayan Sea Salt - I love the way my skin feels when I rinse. It is easily cleaned-up in the shower; you will want to apply it there because otherwise you may have a real mess (it kind of spatters if the consistency isn&#x27;t perfect). Be sure to buy an essential oil - it&#x27;s quite smelly (not in a pleasing way) otherwise. Far less expensive to make your own mixtures than buy the store bought ready-made; it&#x27;s also fun. The company sent me an email with both a recipe book and prior to my second order I also received a GREAT promo savings....but I was going to buy it again regardless. Actually this is probably one of the BEST companies I&#x27;ve purchased from on Amazon over the years; there have been many. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this as an ingredient in my homemade body scrub. Works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this per a show on Dr Oz that making a mix of this would reduce cellulite. It did nothing. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I use the powder as a face mask with honey or a face scrub with water.  It reminds me of going to the beach as a child because it has such a strong fish odor. ( it reminds my husband of dead fish because he went to the lake as a child).  It seems to keep my skin smooth.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a body wrap yet because I haven&#x27;t been in the mood for such a messy project.</li>
    <li> Very messy and difficult to stay on. It starts to peel off as soon as it is applied. Not a fan of the fishy smell either but it IS seaweed so can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
    <li> Great company and service...... My daughter loves this product!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with how quick I recieved my seaweed powder. Also using the seaweed for my weekly regime has made an improvement on my skin. Thanks for making such a wonderful product. Always a happy customer!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that seaweed wraps can detox and beautify the skin and I&#x27;ve tried a few different pre-made masks with seaweed in them. This is the first time that I tried the actual powder and was able to make not only my own facial masks but also my own body scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;I love natural scrubs and masks. And yes, the smell may not be pleasant for all people, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit. (Probably because I think it smells an awful lot like Spirulina, which I was taking regularly before getting pregnant.) If someone really has a problem with the scent, then there is always the option of adding in a natural essential oil of choice.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this powder with a little bit of honey and water, until it came out like a paste. Then, I scrubbed it onto my face and let it sit there for about fifteen minutes. It didn&#x27;t irritate my face. I rinsed it off with a warm, wet cloth, and my skin felt very soft, tighter, and exfoliated. It also looked very clean. I think that once a week is a good choice if using as a mask, for good results.&lt;br /&gt;My mom used a little bit of this powder in her bath to soak in. She said she absolutely loved the way that it made her skin feel. She said she felt more relaxed and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try it on cellulite but I imagine that it would help to firm up the area. I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying this as a regular scrub after delivering my baby, since I want to see how it would work on stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution--this powder can get a bit messy, as it is simply powder in a big jar, but my suggestion is to use some sort of spoon or mini scoop with it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given a jar of seaweed powder in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed here are my own and no other compensation was received.</li>
    <li> I am seeing some results already, mixed with the green clay and lime juice.</li>
    <li> Stinks terribly i cant get over the fishy muddy smell as soon as u wet it the smell gets terribly unbearable it smells like dead fish its horrid but i really dont kno if it works good or not it was too smelly for me to continue</li>
    <li> look like i have allergy to this product</li>
    <li> Amazing and that really helpfully improve and heal I thanks for that</li>
    <li> Very nice product and very nice customer service. I would definitely come back again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great company to work with and always available to answer any questions you have.</li>
    <li> Love this seaweed powder. You can make body wraps and facial masks and even add some to your body scrub. Make sure you add enough liquid and stir it up really good so it sticks to your skin and not flake off. I add a green clay and/or a gray clay to it for my masks and wraps. Julie from Natural Escentials sent me a really good recipe for a body wrap. Package came on time. So far so Good!!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective for detoxification and stimulating the skin. I saw results on my thighs by the second application.  It&#x27;s a healthy way to treat our selves. Thank you for it.</li>
    <li> I really like how versatile this powder is it can be used in face, body or hair masks. It smooths the appearance of cellulite all you have to do is mix it with a little distilled water and slather it on, wrap it and wait for the seaweed to work its magic. This is really a great powder I am so glad I was able to find it!!</li>
    <li> Had to return this product, too messy to use and it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin no matter how much water you add.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this product l was excited to use it, it was something new and different to me. So before I was ready to open my box I showerd and made sure my face was clean to start the process. I open the box to the natural escentials jar. The jar seems smaller than what I imagied but trust me you have more than enough in that tiny jar. I pulled up the email of recipes that the sender sends you, which I think is wonderful and very useful. I decided to make the soothing aloe Vera facial mask since I had only those ingredients and added a little tea tree oil to get that refreshing feel afterwards. But make sure when opening the jar you pound it on a smooth flat surface to level the seaweed so you won&#x27;t spill the excess since it&#x27;s packed to the rim like I did. So I followed the measurements to make the mask and mixed it to this runny jello like consistantcy. I&#x27;m not sure if it was suppose to feel nor look like that but I was pretty sure I follwed the directions. The way it looked made me question my measuring skills. After inspecting it I started to apply it to my face with this facial mask brush. Applying it took ally of time since the mixture was not applying to my face very well and instead crumbling off in chunks. So I added a little bit of water to make it pliable. In the end I used my fingers and manage to cover most of my face with the runny lumpy mixture but it took some time tho. So the fun part began, letting the mask set. I thought the masked would dry out just like the Indian Aztec clay but my assumption was otherwise. Make sure you have a towel cover your lap because the mask will drip if you sit/stand upwards. After waiting 20-30 min it was time to wash off. That part was messy too. I got water ever since it was not difficult but a couple more splash to wash off the grains of seaweed, so make sure to tie up your hair if it long because it will get in your hair. But what happen at the end of all this was a refreshed face that I have never felt before. Not only did my face look cleaner and clearer but my skin looked healthier. It actually felt lighter too as if a weight has been lifted off my face. This product does work to absorb the toxins and impurities out of your skin. I rate it a 4 because everything that you do with it when it comes to body wraps and masks it will be a messy process. And the fact that I believe the measurements on the recipes are wrong. But other than that the product does work as a good relaxing facial mask. For future references I believe that their sound be a video from help on mixing and applying the differnt facial and body masks, because then we would know if it came out right. P.s sorry for the typos if any.</li>
    <li> Hi quality product. Super sealed, we actually had to use some muscle to open the airtight seal, so very fresh. Great product especially for scrub.</li>
    <li> Great quality stuff - works well for topical applications. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I use the Seaweed Powder to flavor my food and get more iodine in my diet. I have added it to my tuna fish and that gives it a nice flavor. The seller has been very helpful answering questions.</li>
    <li> Great quality seaweed powder especially for the price! I like to mix this along with a few other things for face masks as well as mineral supplements. Seaweed powder is a great source of bioavailable iodine better than fish or any food from the sea that contains mercury or Iodized salt.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t had a chance to try this product out as much as I&#x27;d like to see a reduction in cellulite but the product arrived as promised and very quickly.  The seller, I believe her name is Julie..is wonderful.  She was willing to correspond with me a few times on how to get the best use out of this product. I&#x27;m thankful for her patience and emails.  I will try out her recipe and report back on the appearance of my cellulite after I&#x27;ve tried everything she advised me.</li>
    <li> I love the Seaweed Powder. I have made a facial mask with the powder and loved how smooth and clean my face felt. I&#x27;ve also used the Seaweed Powder in my bath. I also want to thank Natural Escentials for their attention to their customers. They answered all the questions promptly. Great customer service!!</li>
    <li> Great product !! I received it and immediately got the follow up digital version of receipes on how to use my powder. My skin is vibrant and so soft. I&#x27;ve been using it three weeks and really love the product</li>
    <li> I put a few spoonfuls of this into a HOT bath for a &#x27;detox&#x27; bath and it made me SWEAT. (more so than if I didn&#x27;t use it).&lt;br /&gt;After the bath, I felt really drained, drank tons of water and had to lie down for a nap. LOL. So... it works for me. Skin felt very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bathed with ACV, sea salt, epson salts, lemons, himalayan pink salts, and none of them were as powerful as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for a face mask... I couldn&#x27;t get the right consistency with water, so gave up.</li>
    <li> Awesome product will buy again!</li>
    <li> Gift for sister, she loves it. Product came very quickly and is a very good size for the price, will be getting one for myself!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once. The smell was fine. I put it in my bath. Not sure of results till I use it a bit longer. Will update</li>
    <li> I like  the product.  It mixes well with the olive  oil and essential oil I mix it with.  Jury is still it out on whether it will help reduce the appearance of cellulite, but using it faithfully and will evaluate in two weeks if I like the results.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It&#x27;s shown noticeable improvements after only two weeks of use, three times a week! I&#x27;m hooked! Buy, buy, buy before everyone catches on and it becomes unavailable!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I mix it with half seaweed powder, half clay powder and some apple cider vinegar. The ingredients are very pure and quality is great! The customer service was above and beyond expected! I&#x27;m very pleased..</li>
    <li> Awesome product will be a returning customer! Makes your skin really soft. The seller is really great and helpful as well. Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> Love it for body wraps but I wanted to ask how often do you do wraps per week for effective results?</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels after using the seaweed powder mixed with vinegar. I use it as a body scrub once a week and I leave it on for 15 to 25 minutes. After I rinse it off and my skin is super super soft, clean, and makes it alot easier to shave my legs too. I noticed an improvement in skin tone and my skin allergies I am not suffering from them as before. When I use it for facial masks I mix it with clay so it sticks better and it really sucks up the excessive oil in my face. I truly love this product and I would never again use any other kind of facial masks or body scrubs but this one.</li>
    <li> It is hard to mix to a good spreading consistency. I&#x27;ve used as a face mask twice now and my skin looks fantastic and hydrated. Will try as a body wrap soon, but I already recommend! It does smell like seaweed, but did you expect something else?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about the benefits of seaweed powder and after extensive research, I decided to purchase from this seller.  The item arrived very quickly and well packaged.  I&#x27;ve made two body wraps (I also add aztec clay since you only need a few tablespoons of the seaweed for effectiveness), and have made three facial masks and it looks like I still have enough to last me several months with regular use.  I made a cellulite wrap with coconut oil and the aztec clay and was super happy with the results.  I&#x27;ve used the clay on its own but the results are nothing compared to when adding the seaweed powder.  Additionally, my brother suffers from seborrhaic dermatitis, mainly affecting his face and scalp.  I made a mixture of one tablespoon of seaweed, distilled water, tsp of dead sea salt, and a few drops of rosemary oil and applied it to his face for 30 minutes.  After the mask his face was extremely red for several hours but by the next morning, his face was no longer red, and the dermatitis was about 80% gone.  So I made a mixture of water and dead sea salt for him to spray daily in between weekly masks but that alone hasn&#x27;t been nearly as effective as adding the seaweed powder.  He&#x27;s suffered from this condition for over 20 years and this was the first time we&#x27;ve ever seen his face so clear.  He&#x27;s been on steroids and whatever else his dermatologist has recommended, without much relief.  The results seem to last as his face as been looking great with weekly facial masks. Maintenance is key. I will also be adding a spoonful to my daily fruit smoothie since the benefits are tremendous, considering the high quantity of iodine and how important it is to a healthy body.  Overall I am extremely satisfied, and this seller has been wonderful with communication so I will certainly continue buying from her.</li>
    <li> I just received it and it&#x27;s great product to use. Your skin feels so smooth. Haven&#x27;t tried the body wrap yet. The seller was very nice. He kept updating me about the product shipment and also sent me an ebook  with recipes for face and body mask and also scrubs.</li>
    <li> The seller was excellent. My order was shipped promptly, and the seller followed-up with me multiple times to make sure the product met my needs, and also shared helpful tips on how to apply the powder properly. The product itself was pure, genuine, of good quality. Will definitely buy again from Natural Escentials!</li>
    <li> I use this as a seaweed mask as it feels so excellent on my skin and after washing off, my face feels so smooth and wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;My face feels so refreshed and clean! I absolutely, highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who wishes to have healthier, younger looking skin! I rate it an A+ for quality, price, and quantity!</li>
    <li> This seaweed powder is amazing. It is so easy to use. The seller is also amazing. She gave me several different recipes for the seaweed scrub and checked up with me to make sure I received it and how I was making out with it.  I have been using it for a few days now and my skin with the affected areas feels so much smoother. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It is really high quality product and the product was shipped in a timely manner. I am very satisfied and would be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This product works great in making your own facial masks! I added it to my mix of assorted clays and oils, and it was an excellent addition. Beyond being a great product at a great price, the customer service can&#x27;t be beat. The representative that reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with the product was nice, friendly, and a REAL person, not an automated message! I responded and she came back with another nice email with a coupon code! If I had been unhappy with my purchase for any reason I don&#x27;t doubt that it would have been taken care of without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own my own small business and this product is an excellent addition to what I make! I highly recommend them based on product AND customer service!</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible, but hey, it&#x27;s seaweed! The results are fantastic! I use it as a detox and the product is pure and easy to use. The people at Natural Escrntials are helpful, informative and nice. Also, my product arrived super fast! Great company! I will order again.</li>
    <li> I buy this kelp powder is for making enzyme fermentation. It is very good product. Making my enzyme fermentation going very well.</li>
    <li> Have only used a few times, but seems to work great! Firms up nicely when used as a mask.</li>
    <li> Slightly disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the chance to actually try this product. When I purchased it I had no idea it contains iodine. I didn&#x27;t find out until it arrived and I read it on the bottle. Unfortunately I happen to be allergic to iodine so I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Love the product!! The seaweed smell is pretty evident but my skin feels really soft and healthy after I use it.  It was sent to me right away and it also had lots of recipes for masks and body wraps that were included.</li>
    <li> This seaweed powder has been wonderful! I have used it in a number of home made beauty projects since I received it and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! Reading some of the reviews I was a tad concerned about what kind of smell I would find, but I don&#x27;t find the scent to be unpleasant, and was very close to what I expected considering that it IS seaweed! The powder is finely and mixed well with my other products. I am very pleased with this purchase and have added it to my permanent wishlist in order to purchase again when I run out! The seller has gone above and beyond with providing home health and beauty recipes via email, and has had great communication! I highly recommend this powder, and and pleasantly surprised at how much I have enjoyed using it!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t keep applying it because the smell bothered me too much.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, many uses, very nutritious. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very happy so far. I mixed this with green clay, lemon juice, honey and water to create a paste. I have used the paste for a body wrap around my belly. I then walked on the tredmill for half and hour. After I showered I saw a noticeable difference in the cellulite on my stomach. Just after one use! No kidding. I feel confident that with a few more wraps and I will be very happy. Oh... I have also used the same paste on my face twice. Not the reason I bought this but wow. The affects on my face were amazing too. Less puffiness under my eyes. Anyway. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The consistency is very thick but you can mix with a lot of different oils, even clay for a thinner &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; feeling. I even got my husband to sit and try it. Ha</li>
    <li> Talk about a day at the spa!&lt;br /&gt;This all natural product works wonders on my sink, helping to detoxify and relax.&lt;br /&gt;Once i received my order i also was greeted with a follow up email giving me even more luxurious recipes to imitate my spa day!&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s not customer service, i don&#x27;t know what is!&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely pleased with the product itself and the service i received,&lt;br /&gt;five star review all around.</li>
    <li> Great product makes my face very soft</li>
    <li> This product is great &amp; i have been seeing results already. Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I happened to see a show on TV that was talking about natural products to help with cellulite...they showed before/after pictures of a woman who had used seaweed powder as part of her therapy and there was a definite difference in just 5 days.  I purchased Natural Escentials Seaweed Powder and have been using it as part of my therapy and I&#x27;ve gotten the same results!  I&#x27;m looking forward to learning what more that I can use this wonderful product for and I appreciate the follow up that Rose has given me too.  It&#x27;s refreshing to know that companies have dedicated employees who want to help customers as well as pass along therapy recipes of their own!  Thanks Rose!</li>
    <li> Hello amazon  members. .. This product arrived to my home in a great amount of time. I used it 3 times.  I&#x27;m happy with this product.  I did a button wrap,  arm wrap,  stomach wrap , thighs wrapped.  And I also did my face . I set the timer for 30 minutes and then I jumped in the shower.  As I was cleaning and showering my skin felt as soft as a babies butt. And my face look clean and felt smoothly.  I&#x27;m pleased with my product.  I wish I could get this in a Gallon!&lt;br /&gt;I will update you next month. So far so good ladies. I need more .... I can see myself doing this 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonder for helping reduce cellulite  love the product and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Really helping my wife. She uses it as a mask.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Received with in reasonable time frame.</li>
    <li> Used for the first time tonight, making a facial mask with the recipe provided online. I have to say, I&#x27;m not impressed. The product is very messy and hard to work with. When you finally manage to get some to stay on your face, you have to sit there for 20 minutes smelling low tide. The odor is nauseating. But I figured, &amp;#34;hey if it works really well I can overlook these things.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, although my face felt refreshed, I don&#x27;t think it did a better job than the avocado mask in a tube that I&#x27;ve bought at CVS. It didn&#x27;t really tighten or clean my pores any better - and the avocado mask is less messy, more convenient to use, and doesn&#x27;t smell like dead fish. And, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the grainy stuff getting in my eyes because it stays put (I didn&#x27;t even do my forehead or around my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsing off, the messy continues. At first I got some in my mouth and it grossed me out. After I finished rinsing, the bathroom, facecloth, and my skin all smelled like low tide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am uncertain whether I will use it a second time, and I certainly won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff I felt the first time I used it how my body look like it had a glow I would re order I not sure if my cellulite look better by my skin dose</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for dry/ damaged skin.  It also helps with a few other things.  You can ingest it or put it on the skin.  This rocks for my kids dry skin</li>
    <li> I mixed the seaweed with honey and vinegar. I have a lot of acne scars.  The seaweed mixture really helped to smooth out my skin. I still have the scars, but they are definitely less noticeable. I have been using it everyday for almost 2 months. Jar is still almost full. Should last you for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using new beauty products like crazy lately, but this was the first time I got a jar of seaweed powder. I have only done facial masks with it so far, but I have to say it is awesome. I feel like I am having a spa quality facial. I love doing all masks, but this one feels so much more professional than those masks that cost a couple dollars at the store. I am excited to use this as a wrap</li>
    <li> This product and exercise is really helping me a lot with cellulite,  im using it once a week and so far im very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Best Seaweed powder i have ever tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to naturally exfoliate your skin.  This product does the job !</li>
    <li> I luv it. The smell is there but you just need to work around it. I add peppermint oil or other oils</li>
    <li> I used this Seaweed&lt;br /&gt;Powder for the last two nights on my face, it made my skin nice and firm. As I get older I find my skin getting loose and it&#x27;s not easy finding something I really like that works well and this works great. It also leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> High quality seaweed powder is a miracle!  It helps smooth cellulite, and makes my skin feel youthful!  Easy to mix, no clumps.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it to give myself at home spa treatments. It smells pretty bad, but can be masked with some essential oils. Great for pampering yourself!</li>
    <li> quick delivery. great product. take care</li>
    <li> I purchased seaweed powder because I saw it on Dr. Oz for cellulite. Little did I know that it would make my skin silky soft . I love how easy it is too prepare. I definitely would recommend it .</li>
    <li> Makes skin very smooth but the smell is very strong</li>
    <li> I use this seaweed powder to make my DIY mask once a week. I follow the mask recipes in the ebook that Seller sent me and the outcome is awesome!  The mask makes my skin smooth. hydrated and clear. It has a mile seaweed smell but it does not bother me. Love this powder, will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not because I couldn&#x27;t get it to stick. I followed the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; on the jar and applied it to my thighs. Thank goodness I did it in the kitchen because it just fell all over the floor. I carefully rubbed it all over, but very little of actually stayed on my legs. Then I wrapped my thighs with plastic wrap and left it on for an hour. Extremely messy and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do it again. There was so much to clean up from the floor and it wasn&#x27;t easy because of the olive oil.</li>
    <li> Wish it was easier to use. When I made the aloe honey mask it crumbled and didn&#x27;t go on like a normal mask. Maybe I am just not using it right. It&#x27;s been in my cupboard for 7 months now just because it doesn&#x27;t seem convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Fast! I use it for facial cleansers and masks! Great quality! I even had someone follow up to see how I liked it!</li>
    <li> good product, works well.</li>
    <li> I have used this both for cellulite (as suggested by the company) and to treat my cystic acne. (I make a paste of water and powder and leave overnight.) and have seen a marked difference in the appearance of cellulite and the length of my breakout. Can&#x27;t wait to find more uses!</li>
    <li> Love it ...I will buy again !!</li>
    <li> Fabulous customer service. Fabulous product. I did not receive the recipes, but I sent a quick e-mail to the seller and they responded immediately. I look forward to trying out the recipes. I was using the powder mainly as a scrub in the shower and it left my skin feeling refreshed.  Yes, it&#x27;s green and messy, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  I will update in a few months after consistent use.</li>
    <li> First time using seaweed powder but I like it so far. I am using it with Dead Sea salt as a body scrub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with the Dr. Oz seaweed scrub recipe and have already seen improvements as well as noticeably smoother skin ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is great and answers any questions you may have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely purchase again (and have) from this seller :)</li>
    <li> This mask is absolutely amazing! The best I&#x27;ve  ever tried! I have a very dry skin, and this mask moisturizes it very well! The skin feels fresh and tight. Even wrinkles under eyes have reduced a lot. I would totally recommend this mask to anyone.</li>
    <li> wonderful service and product. there are so many uses for this seaweed powder.</li>
    <li> I could not try more than once because of the smell. The smell remembers fish, and it is not pleasant. Nothing wrong with the product by itself! If you don&#x27;t like fish smell lime me I do not recommend, otherwise, it seams to be good!</li>
    <li> I really think I see a little less &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; on my thighs.  I&#x27;ve only used the product about five times but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This product right here works in so many ways. I recommend the product to anyone. The whole process to getting the product went very smooth. It didn&#x27;t take long for it to arrive plus the company will give you some great ideas on how to use the product. I give them a thumbs up !!!</li>
    <li> A high quality seaweed powder, excellent service that emails you recipes and hopes to ensure satisfaction.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, I saw results after the first use.  I mixed it with fine coffee grind, honey, &amp; mineral oil.  Massaged it thoroughly in my shower, left it for 10 mins, then washed off with the Bliss anti-cellulite soap.  I have an office job, so I focused on the lower sitting area that lacks circulation.  Then, I topped it off with my favorite anti cellulite cream/oil.  My skin feels soft and clean, like baby&#x27;s skin!!!. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> This certainly helped my legs seeing results after 2 uses with the klay, and looking forward to more treatments in the future.</li>
    <li> I am editing this review b/c customer service is excellent. I have not changed my mind about the product, but the seller contacted immediately and I always appreciate excellent customer service.       This stuff is a nightmare.  For starters, it smells horrendous, meaning the entire house smells like dead fish.  Second, it does not stay on as a wrap/mask.  The photo of the girl laying on the table with a smooth green layer on her back is completely false.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what you mix this with, it clumps up into dry balls and falls off.  Oh, and this comes with no recipes, so you will need to find them online on your own.  The seller send me an email with a face mask, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I am thinking all these great reviews were written by the same person.  I would never recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> gross  hard to use  got all over  what a mess!  Waste of money and time.  Dr Oz lied!</li>
    <li> it is a nice product, i haven&#x27;t been using it regularly but whenever i use it, i like the way It leaves my skin. But, it helps on dry skin and blood circulation more than cellulite.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Does wonders in tightening loose skin. I have not been back to the spa since finding this product.  Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the product!!!! It is great for facial masks and body wraps. With regular use u definitely see the results on your skin.</li>
    <li> I have never used any seaweed anything before but this was super easy to mix up and the after effects were great. I have acne on my back and i had my hubs apply it to my back and im already seeing improvement of my skin a bit clearer and smoother as well after just the first use. I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> It is organic and really awesome. Leaves my skin looking and feeling great. I love to use it before and after a workout, when i can. I would recommend it to anyone with patience and looking forward to get something for the long run.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this for cellulite treatment, After reading all the rave reviews about it on Amazon. I absolutely hate the product, First came with no instructions and recipes , You&#x27;ll just receive a box of powder , That&#x27;s it no instructions no recipes no nothing . I then tried different  cellulite recipes I read online. The powder sticks together like glue know matter what you mix it with (. I tried water olive oil salt you name it I tried) So when you go to apply to your thighs, The clumps keep falling off your body you can&#x27;t keep it on. Then when you go to massage it and it just all rolled up in little balls. It got all over the bathroom in the shower. Have to say this stuff stinks like fish. I figured if I can use it on my body maybe I can ingested bring my shake, Mixed it with my smoothie and I almost threw up. It tasted like Someone made my smoothie in a dish that had bad sushi and it. I absolutely hate the product and will be returning it, what a waste</li>
    <li> Great product! Reasonable price! Will definitely buy it again, hope to see the results soon! :)</li>
    <li> So far so good. Messy but works!</li>
    <li> Works great. Reminds me of how my fish tank used to smell so the smell isn&#x27;t the best but it washes right off. You need to be just right with the mixture. If its too dry it just clumps up into little balls and falls off the skin. I used water, olive oil, coffee grounds and green clay to make a wrap. Only did it once so the results were not noticable.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but feel certain I&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the fast shipping. Very cool stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I bought it mainly for the cellulite on my legs, I haven&#x27;t used it on there yet, but I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face and ears twice a week, and my skin is phenomenal! It radiates, gives me a glow, it&#x27;s smooth, and the blackheads are gone. I also had eczema on my ears, and I don&#x27;t have it anymore! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work for the cellulite too, I&#x27;ll post about that too :)</li>
    <li> Quick ship and high quality, just not useful for me.</li>
    <li> Seaweed Powder - HIGH QUALITY</li>
    <li> I love, love, love using Seaweed Powder for masks!  This one that Natural Escentials sent me to review is a great choice for all your Seaweed Skincare adventures!  The Seaweed Powder by Natural Escentials can be used for everything from a Facial Detox Mask to a Cellulite treatment.  I think it was also be great to use to make homemade gifts for this holiday season.  You can get cute little mason jars and make up your own Face Masks, Body Masks and even scrubs to give to all your girlfriends, they would love you for it!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it to make some pretty amazing masks and my favorite part is when you can feel the bad stuff that gets stuck in your pores getting sucked out as the masks dry!  Love that!  Afterwards, your skin feels so soft, smooth, exfoliated and DETOXED.  The best part is the Seaweed Powder by Natural Escentials can be used on any skin type.</li>
    <li> I like to try new things, this was one of them. I use bottled face masks but never tried a seaweed powder before. On the seaweed powder it has a link to the website, I went there and got a recipe to make a citrus seaweed scrub. I already had all the stuff to make it and mixed it up in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a strong smell as I poured in the seaweed, but as I added in the sweet orange oil it smelled so much better! I added in a little water to make it a bit thinner. I applied it to my face and let it sit 20 minutes. I had no problem with leaving it on while I did housework and I loved the texture and how it felt on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove I used a cloth to gently scrub in a circle. The texture of the seaweed was nice, and helped exfoliate my skin and pull off any dry skin. When I was all wiped off I felt my face and noticed it felt softer and was refreshed and clean. I put on my makeup an hour later and I had a much more smooth application because all my dry skin was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend using a scented oil in this if you plan on using it on your face. The smell of it alone was not so pleasant. Overall I like this product and will continue to use it and come back for more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;This was sent to me for purpose of testing, an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality product. I used it for body wraps. Fast delivery, great communication and the company emails  recipes and stays in contact. Will definitely order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this powder is all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, I was not a fan. As a busy mom I was looking for something to detox my thighs and belly, reduce some cellulite. If you have 45 minutes to spare to make the mixtyre, slather it on your thighs, butt and stomach, than wrap in plastic wrap, wait 20 minutes then shower it off, once a day or once a week if you&#x27;re lucky, then this stuff is for you! I have to say that the company was very wasy to work with, sent emails to me with a recipe and asked about my satisfaction as well. That was pleasant!</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome product. This seller emailed me to make sure everything was great...and gave a great recipe for a wrap. I added mines with bentonite clay and it was smooth.  I&#x27;m already starting to see results. I love it will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Gives a great facial mask. Makes your face feel alive and fresh. Really am going to love this. It is a little messy but think that adding the bentonite clay will thicken it up and help it not be so runny.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this along with a couple of other beauty products and have to say this is my favorite thing I&#x27;ve gotten (in terms of beauty) so far! The seller also sent me a huge compilation of recipes for all kinds masks and scrubs and although I&#x27;ve only tried a few, they all leave my skin feeling silky soft and looking super radiant! I especially loved the aloe honey mask (skin felt like liquid silk afterwards) and the bath body scrub (It makes your skin feel silky soft afterwards all day up to your next shower!). The seller also sent me a personal email with an extra recipe or two as well as thanking me for purchasing this product. It was a really nice touch, not like others who could care less if you like the product. Anyways, thanks for a great product! Can&#x27;t wait to run out so I can buy more lol. Or maybe I&#x27;ll try the clay next there were some good recipes for that too...</li>
    <li> Oh how I love this product! It gave me a glowy skin and my face felt so smooth. And as soon as the product was shipped (which I got it earlier than expected), they sent me an email with the recipe e-book. They are so nice. I would definitely purchase another one as soon as I&#x27;ll finish this.</li>
    <li> I am sooooooo amazed!!!! The fist time i used it my pores looked sooooooo much smaller and my deep acne scars looked ALOT better.My skin feels refreshed looks super smooth and looks better and better i love my skin (i just wish i would have found this sooner).</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I have used it as a wrap and as a scrub.  I use different recipes for wraps that i find online.  By default,  i found that it made my hair soft.  Seaweed is a great product in general and i am pretty happy with this purchase. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this product. The recipes that came with it are a +.  I think if u r using as mask the follow required amount but for scrubs 1/2 would work + it may be less fishy that way. And, I used an exceptional amount of essential oils!  I think my issue was with packaging- no seal, nothing. Surprised me a hit and I was quite skeptical on using it but I figured it&#x27;s a powder...&amp; I&#x27;m not eating it.</li>
