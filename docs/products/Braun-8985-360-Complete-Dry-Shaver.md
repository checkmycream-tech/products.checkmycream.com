### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After about one week I was used to the shaver and it works great!</li>
      <li>This is the best electric I have ever owed</li>
      <li>Well, it turns out to be the best shaver</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed</li>
      <li>However, I am very happy with the closeness of the shave after boycotting electric razors.</li>
      <li>Best investment considering the amount of money blades have increased.</li>
      <li>The IDEA is great!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with shaver and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>and he is happy with it.</li>
      <li>Great shaver.</li>
      <li>This is a very good electric shaver -- much better than the Norelco I had.  </li>
      <li>The shave is also good.</li>
      <li>A good product.</li>
      <li>I have owned this shaver for six months now and am still waiting to get a good shave.</li>
      <li>My previous Braun was excellent but this model I would not wish on my greatest enemy</li>
      <li>I and my husband have ever seen, leave my head as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and the cleaning station is absorluly  great, so sanitary</li>
      <li>I have own and used this shaver for 10 months.</li>
      <li>As far as electrics go, this is the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I know what I&#x27;m talking about after using electric shavers for more than 30 years.</li>
      <li>I then got a Norelco and while it was ok</li>
      <li>Much better than Norelco or Remington.</li>
      <li>A right-angle plug (like the ones on every 20-dollar hair dryer) would be much better.</li>
      <li>The Braun is heavier than the Norelco -- maybe evincing better build quality --</li>
      <li>, I just love &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>the cord can&#x27;t fit with it!</li>
      <li>Its the best, very close shave, not as close as a Mach 3 but pretty close.</li>
      <li>Bottom line, if you shave EVERY day, it does a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>Cutter\\&quot; light to come on, and its battery seems to hold a charge as well as when it was new, which is pretty impressive.  </li>
      <li>As with other reviews this is a great shaver, however the bulky cord design, noisy cleaning system, and bright led light limit this to a four out of five stars.  </li>
      <li>But I quickly changed my mind, as I found it to provide a comfortable and close shave, with many fewer strokes than my Norelco.   </li>
      <li>, around the same price, what a great fine.  </li>
      <li>If you buy a Braum you have spend your money Wisely, enjoy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my Braun 360° Complete shaver for 2-1/2 years now, and it&#x27;s by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>Overall a very nice shaver.  </li>
      <li>The lubricant/cleaner helped, too, and shaving with a razor that is always thoroughly clean is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It really gives a better shave.</li>
      <li>Noise level is not bad.</li>
      <li>The foil head, the \\&quot;power comb\\&quot;, and especially the pivoting head combine to work exceptionally well.</li>
      <li>I used to wet shave with a Mach 3 and loved how smooth of a shave I got</li>
      <li>The Braun does shave close enough, provided you make sure to clean it with the enclosed brush after every shave.  </li>
      <li>Look at the picture...it doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning cartridge in it right now and hasn&#x27;t had one in over a year.</li>
      <li>Today, the shaver started making a very, very loud raspy sound as if someting inside was grinding.</li>
      <li>I went out and bought a new blade and foil thinking there might have been some type of defect in the original.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a few months now, and I echo the comments expressed by another reviewer, great shave (particularly after being cleaned).  </li>
      <li>When the battery does finally start to degrade, it looks like I&#x27;ll have to send it in for a replacement, instead of being able to replace it</li>
      <li>a day later it will decide that the razor needs a more thorough cleaning.</li>
      <li>The Norelco didn&#x27;t shave close enough to make the touch-ups worthwhile.  </li>
      <li>I am not always an &#x27;everyday&#x27; shaver, so an electric shaver is not always a good option for me.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve only done some light shaving, less cleaning solution is used, saving on cost, which is a nice touch.  </li>
      <li>Very close shave.  </li>
      <li>so much so that you might not want to carry it in a briefcase for end-of-the-workday touch-ups before going out in the evening.  </li>
      <li>I have a light beard only put on the cleaner every couple days.  </li>
      <li>It has done everything expected and more.</li>
      <li>I do really like the self-cleaning feature.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a Braum 360 Complete series Shaver for my husband in 2003 as a Christmas gift , he looked it over , said he loved it and never open the box , also at the time I purchased 2 boxes of cartridges which I though was extra razors ( I knew nothing about any type of razors ).  </li>
      <li>it purely a programmed response - for example, emptying the razor yourself has no effect, and if you put it back in its station but don&#x27;t clean it then</li>
      <li>I would just get a whole new razor.  </li>
      <li>I thought that my face just needed to adjust to it from my older Braun 7680.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend any of their shavers.  </li>
      <li>I have used mine for about a year now and it still shaves close just like when it was brand new and still looks like brand new since the cleaning system works very well also.</li>
      <li>But the quality of the shave makes the extra weight worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a few months now, and love it.</li>
      <li>but so worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>I figured instead of spending money on a new stand</li>
      <li>They consistently give the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever received, and they last for years.</li>
      <li>The cleaning cycle can be pretty noisy as it goes through its paces, so don&#x27;t fire it up when you are trying to be quiet.  </li>
      <li>The only time I&#x27;ve noticed it pulling was if I get pretty scraggly, I would say if you stick to shaving often you won&#x27;t ever have to worry about it pulling.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased one with the Clean &amp; Renew base, and honestly, I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a model without it.</li>
      <li>Over all I would steer clear of this shaver if you prefer comfort over speed.  </li>
      <li>I will say this is the second time I have purchased a Braun with the cleaning station, and I do really like this.  </li>
      <li>My Braun is almost 10 yrs old now.</li>
      <li>I have owned the 360 complete 8985 for over a year now.  </li>
      <li>It did give a slight razor burn when brand-new, but that quickly went away.  </li>
      <li>I generally use a blade, and have an electric for early evening touch-ups.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t think of something I&#x27;ve purchased that I&#x27;ve gotten as much use out of for as long.</li>
      <li>To make a long story shorter, several years go by and I became ill and needed to shave my head, looking around in the garage I found the Brium never opened a beautiful $ 450.00 plus tax shaving system never opened or used.  </li>
      <li>The plug on the end of the cord is huge and juts straight out from the wall, getting in the way and taking up a lot of counter space unnecessarily.  </li>
      <li>A little sand paper fixed her right</li>
      <li>The only reason I choose to get this shaver is because the cleaner system for my old shaver fell off of the shelf and broke.  </li>
      <li>The Complete does shave in fewer strokes than my 7680, but I would rather have to go over the same place 2 or 3 times than to have it pull at my hairs even once!  </li>
      <li>The Braun&#x27;s are a little higher than the Norelco</li>
      <li>During the first few weeks it would pull at my hairs.  </li>
      <li>Going strong as ever, and I dog this poor razor.</li>
      <li>The refills of solution are not cheap, but they do last 2-3 months of pretty regular use.  </li>
      <li>When I do miss a day or two, I go back to my old Braun 3612 or my old Panasonic (both at least 10 years old).  </li>

<li> I always have hated having to brush out and clean previous shavers, so this is a nice thing to have.  </li>
<li> Well expecting the worst after it&#x27;s been sitting for the pass 12 years , I opened the box , set up the system , waited for it to charge ( in the mean time my husband says to me nicely you can keep the shaver for your shaving needs,  ( how nice of him)  </li>
<li> but once every other day or 3rd day.    </li>
<li> One other power-cord-related issue: this shaver comes with a protective travel case, but the case ONLY holds the shaver...</li>
<li> All in all, the shaver itself is terrific, but if you&#x27;re strapped for counter space near your bathroom sink, I&#x27;d look for one of Braun&#x27;s units with the swiveling head and not the Clean &amp; Renew base.</li>
<li> The cleaning solution is dispensed from cartridges that are a little larger than a hockey puck, and come three to a package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> For the most part, this shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate too bad.  </li>
<li> I have a fairly heavy beard that grows in several directions, and that can mean going over an area several times.  </li>
<li> However, same issue it would pull at the hairs at least once during the shave.  </li>
<li> Since the cleaning cartridges are consumable items, and not particularly cheap, I&#x27;ve found that leaving the razor out of its cleaning station for 3 or 4 shaves is one way to conserve cartridges.</li>
<li> So I gave it a few months, and still it would happen.  </li>
<li> It has not given any trouble over the years</li>
<li> clean and charge, you insert the shaver into the base unit and press a button.  </li>
<li> I take that to mean that it is not much longer for this world!  </li>

    <li> I have own and used this shaver for 10 months. It has done everything expected and more. A good product.</li>
    <li> I am not always an &#x27;everyday&#x27; shaver, so an electric shaver is not always a good option for me.  As far as electrics go, this is the best I have ever used.  I have a fairly heavy beard that grows in several directions, and that can mean going over an area several times.  For the most part, this shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate too bad.  The swiveling head allows the shaver to reach around jawlines, etc.    I do really like the self-cleaning feature.  I always have hated having to brush out and clean previous shavers, so this is a nice thing to have.  The refills of solution are not cheap, but they do last 2-3 months of pretty regular use.  The cleaning cycle can be pretty noisy as it goes through its paces, so don&#x27;t fire it up when you are trying to be quiet.  I have seldom been disappointed in anything with &#x27;Braun&#x27; in the name, and this shaver is no exception.</li>
    <li> I have owned the 360 complete 8985 for over a year now.  During the first few weeks it would pull at my hairs.  I thought that my face just needed to adjust to it from my older Braun 7680.  However the 7680 never did this at all.  So I gave it a few months, and still it would happen.  I got to the point where I hated to shave because I knew this would happen.  Granted I do not need to shave but once every other day or 3rd day.    I went out and bought a new blade and foil thinking there might have been some type of defect in the original.  However, same issue it would pull at the hairs at least once during the shave.  I would not recommend this shaver, and because of the cost I&#x27;m hesitant to get another just to have it continue to happen.    I will say this is the second time I have purchased a Braun with the cleaning station, and I do really like this.  It is so convenient to just push one button and it cleans itself!  Because I do not shave every day, the cartridges last me about 2 months so the price for the cartridges does not out way the convenience factor for me.    Over all I would steer clear of this shaver if you prefer comfort over speed.  The Complete does shave in fewer strokes than my 7680, but I would rather have to go over the same place 2 or 3 times than to have it pull at my hairs even once!  The only reason I choose to get this shaver is because the cleaner system for my old shaver fell off of the shelf and broke.  I figured instead of spending money on a new stand I would just get a whole new razor.  I should have just found a cleaning stand instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a few months now, and I echo the comments expressed by another reviewer, great shave (particularly after being cleaned).  Overall a very nice shaver.  No complaints from me.</li>
    <li> I reluctantly bought this, after several years with a Norelco. But I quickly changed my mind, as I found it to provide a comfortable and close shave, with many fewer strokes than my Norelco.   The self-cleaning docking station is nifty, too.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver over a year now.  Bottom line, if you shave EVERY day, it does a pretty good job.  If you are prone to skip a day or two, like I am, forget using this shaver (after a day or so) because it will take your forever to get a close shave.  When I do miss a day or two, I go back to my old Braun 3612 or my old Panasonic (both at least 10 years old).  Not impressed with this shaver at all!! Do not recommend!</li>
    <li> I had problems with this razor from day one.  Did not shave well.  Would not hold a charge.  Cleaning function worked intermittantly.  Can&#x27;t return.  No Braun service centers within 100 miles.  Threw it away  Buyer beware</li>
    <li> Have used for 1 year.  Very close shave.  I have a light beard only put on the cleaner every couple days.  3 pack of shaver cleaner will last 1 year  $20.   I am very happy with shaver and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Braum 360 Complete series Shaver for my husband in 2003 as a Christmas gift , he looked it over , said he loved it and never open the box , also at the time I purchased 2 boxes of cartridges which I though was extra razors ( I knew nothing about any type of razors ).

If you buy a Braum you have spend your money Wisely, enjoy.  Naomi</li>
    <li> I bought this razor on a recommendation in Consumer Reports. I switched from a rotary head razor and, as the user&#x27;s guide predicts, it has taken a few weeks to get used to this one, but it does give a very close shave. The cleaning station is a cool idea, but it&#x27;s decision as to how dirty the razor is (which determines how much cleaning fluid it consumes) it purely a programmed response - for example, emptying the razor yourself has no effect, and if you put it back in its station but don&#x27;t clean it then a day later it will decide that the razor needs a more thorough cleaning. Since the cleaning cartridges are consumable items, and not particularly cheap, I&#x27;ve found that leaving the razor out of its cleaning station for 3 or 4 shaves is one way to conserve cartridges. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on the Braun electric shavers. I used to wet shave with a Mach 3 and loved how smooth of a shave I got but I just didn&#x27;t like the hassle. I then got a Norelco and while it was ok I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed so I got a little nicer Norelco and hated it. It did a worse job than the cheaper model and pulled like crazy and irritated my skin pretty bad at times. Then last year for Christmas my wife got me this Braun shaver. Its the best, very close shave, not as close as a Mach 3 but pretty close. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. The only time I&#x27;ve noticed it pulling was if I get pretty scraggly, I would say if you stick to shaving often you won&#x27;t ever have to worry about it pulling. I shave 2 to 3 times a week and I go through the cleaning solution about every 2.5 to 3.5 months. Also I&#x27;ve yet to replace the cutting foil either. The Braun&#x27;s are a little higher than the Norelco but so worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for six months now and am still waiting to get a good shave. My previous Braun was excellent but this model I would not wish on my greatest enemy</li>
    <li> This is the best electric I have ever owed and I&#x27;ve owned several.  It really gives a better shave.</li>
    <li> As with other reviews this is a great shaver, however the bulky cord design, noisy cleaning system, and bright led light limit this to a four out of five stars.  However, I am very happy with the closeness of the shave after boycotting electric razors.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric razor prior but checked Consumer Reports to get a recommendation.  After about one week I was used to the shaver and it works great! Best investment considering the amount of money blades have increased.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun 5 (now the 8985) for over a year. The IDEA is great! One push of a button and the razor gets cleaned and charged. The shave is also good. Noise level is not bad. The problems came when the silver finish started to peel off. I called Braun and they said that the \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; features were not covered by warranty. Today, the shaver started making a very, very loud raspy sound as if someting inside was grinding. I take that to mean that it is not much longer for this world!  I am considering giving Braun another chance with another model (perhaps with its Series 7 - 760 cc) but I&#x27;m not sure. I would hope that the shaver would last for longer than just a year!!!!</li>
    <li> My nephew has used this shaver for some years now and it works well. It has not given any trouble over the years and he is happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a few months now, and love it. I&#x27;ve only used electric shavers for about 30 years, and my last three were all Brauns.  They consistently give the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever received, and they last for years. The foil head, the \\&quot;power comb\\&quot;, and especially the pivoting head combine to work exceptionally well. I highly recommend any of their shavers.  However...    This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased one with the Clean &amp; Renew base, and honestly, I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a model without it. The base station unit adds a lot to the price, and I don&#x27;t think it adds that much value. In addition, the base and power cord are very poorly designed. The plug on the end of the cord is huge and juts straight out from the wall, getting in the way and taking up a lot of counter space unnecessarily.  A right-angle plug (like the ones on every 20-dollar hair dryer) would be much better. The other end of the cord is just as bad! The connection to the base station sits at an odd angle, sticking out from the side and making it almost impossible to sit the station against a wall.    One other power-cord-related issue: this shaver comes with a protective travel case, but the case ONLY holds the shaver... the cord can&#x27;t fit with it! You have to pack the cord separately.  Not a big deal, but it just seems like an obvious oversight.    All in all, the shaver itself is terrific, but if you&#x27;re strapped for counter space near your bathroom sink, I&#x27;d look for one of Braun&#x27;s units with the swiveling head and not the Clean &amp; Renew base.</li>
    <li> My Braun is almost 10 yrs old now. Going strong as ever, and I dog this poor razor. Look at the picture...it doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning cartridge in it right now and hasn&#x27;t had one in over a year. I occasionally brush it out. Its filthy and barely gets charged. The only problem I ever had was it stopped charging when put in the base and that was just because I let so much crud build up on the contacts in the base. A little sand paper fixed her right up.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of something I&#x27;ve purchased that I&#x27;ve gotten as much use out of for as long. When it finally dies I&#x27;ll probably bury it in the back yard and then immediately try to find the closest comparable razor.&lt;br /&gt;I use another electric for periodic detail work on my goatee but this is definitely my daily driver.</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric shaver -- much better than the Norelco I had.  I generally use a blade, and have an electric for early evening touch-ups.  The Norelco didn&#x27;t shave close enough to make the touch-ups worthwhile.  The Braun does shave close enough, provided you make sure to clean it with the enclosed brush after every shave.  It&#x27;s not enough to simply use the built-in cleaning system.  Maybe I&#x27;m belaboring the obvious, but I thought the built-in cleaning system would suffice and that the brush was for the times when you didn&#x27;t want to use up the cleaning fluid.  Wrong.  You should do both.    The Braun is heavier than the Norelco -- maybe evincing better build quality -- so much so that you might not want to carry it in a briefcase for end-of-the-workday touch-ups before going out in the evening.  But the quality of the shave makes the extra weight worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 360° Complete shaver for 2-1/2 years now, and it&#x27;s by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I used Norelco shavers, but they gave me razor burn.  When shaving with a new Norelco razor burned my neck so badly that it looked like it was covered in hickeys and stung for days, I decided to try this foil shaver.  What a difference!  It did give a slight razor burn when brand-new, but that quickly went away.  The lubricant/cleaner helped, too, and shaving with a razor that is always thoroughly clean is fantastic.  The swiveling head works well to follow the contours of your face, but you can lock it if you prefer.  Since the Braun is slim, the shaving head doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the trimmer like it does with the Norelco, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean and charge, you insert the shaver into the base unit and press a button.  Two sets of lights on the base indicate the battery level and amount of cleaning necessary.  If you&#x27;ve only done some light shaving, less cleaning solution is used, saving on cost, which is a nice touch.  The cleaning solution is dispensed from cartridges that are a little larger than a hockey puck, and come three to a package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took my shaver 2-1/2 years for my \\&quot;Change Foil + Cutter\\&quot; light to come on, and its battery seems to hold a charge as well as when it was new, which is pretty impressive.  When the battery does finally start to degrade, it looks like I&#x27;ll have to send it in for a replacement, instead of being able to replace it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve found with the entire system is that if you accidentally tip the base, cleaning fluid will leak out.  Hopefully Braun will add seals to its newer shaver bases.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I have used mine for about a year now and it still shaves close just like when it was brand new and still looks like brand new since the cleaning system works very well also. Much better than Norelco or Remington. I know what I&#x27;m talking about after using electric shavers for more than 30 years.</li>
