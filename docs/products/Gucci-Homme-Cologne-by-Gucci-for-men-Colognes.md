      <li>Very classic taste, very good.</li>
      <li>The smell is great - I love the rich tones.</li>
      <li>Favorite cologne ,smells great,would  order again.</li>
      <li>my husband picked the bottle up by the top and the lid wasnt on...</li>
      <li>Again, it may just be my nose and that I&#x27;m more used to wearing the cologne now.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Had to get more.</li>
      <li>You pay a bit more</li>
      <li>The top cover is magnietized and clicks in place.</li>
      <li>I wish I could describe the smell better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this spray.  </li>
      <li>I personally find this to be a wonderful men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
      <li>He is enjoying it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and i love it...</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, I could not find it anywhere for a better price than I found it for here.</li>
      <li>sample vial gave off a lot more sent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a safe cologne that can be worn anywhere.</li>
      <li>For the price, there are better, longer-lasting alternatives.</li>
      <li>Beautiful scent, but has a tobacco start, and ends with a soft flow of fresh air (which is my favorite part).</li>
      <li>are the best I have smelled not for little boys that is for sure this is a</li>
      <li>I immediately fell in love, and used it on special occasions.</li>
      <li>Does not smell fruity or sweet or too strong like most &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; fragrances on the market.</li>
      <li>I have liked this scent since it first came out in 2008.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful package but the bottle is so big it leaves no room for the spray itself</li>
      <li>While it seems a bit mainstream, it&#x27;s a brilliantly done fragrance that I consider a classic of our modern era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>A sophisticated, distinct, versatile (yet mild) scent that was a perfect go-to for both my week in the blazing summer of Singapore immediately followed by three weeks in the grey winter of Melbourne and Sydney.  </li>
      <li>Bottle is very pretty or handsome</li>
      <li>Its authentic, smells classic and sexy.</li>
      <li>I originally received this as a sample from Sephora and then came here to buy it for my husband for his birthday.  </li>
      <li>I would wear this for dinner or special occasion, not on a day to day trial.</li>
      <li>the fragrance is really mild...</li>
      <li>but then it quickly fades away and leaves you with nothing.</li>
      <li>Soft clean smell, not too strong or sweet.</li>
      <li>Luckily, it arrived on time, and I was relieved to be right.  </li>
      <li>Spray your torso, back side, and one \\&quot;warm spot\\&quot; on your body.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and it lasts.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line - There are many other scents I like a lot more than this one.</li>
      <li>The atomizer is one of the best, sprays are very evenly distributed and arrive softly yet firmly on their target.</li>
      <li>Buying a fragrance online without actually smelling it first is the most abstract thing, but I needed something quickly to travel with for a month-long business trip.  </li>
      <li>I saw it at my local mall for 100 dollars, but months later on amazon I found it for a great price, and immediately bought it.</li>
      <li>and I like this very much.  </li>
      <li>Its light, masculine and becomes close to the skin scent (like it should).</li>
      <li>I purchased samples of many different colognes to test before I purchased some</li>
      <li>1.7 is the bottle size not actually usable spray if if was more spray</li>
      <li>If you chose to wear it on a day to day bases, then be sure not to over spray, 3 sprays should be enough to cover you for 8 to 10 hours.</li>
      <li>I liked wearing it in a party or any other places. ....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s masculine and clean without being one of those \\&quot;slap you in the face\\&quot; scents.  </li>
      <li>I dont what wrong with those guys who gave this product excellent reviews i really doubt the reality of the reviews.</li>
      <li>The bottle the cologne is packaged in is pure class.</li>
      <li>It could very well be that they boost the cologne in the &#x27;samplers&#x27;.</li>
      <li>and this is one that I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great smelling cologne!</li>
    <li> I have most if not all the gucci colognes and some are a little on the not good side lol but this and Gucci pour homme are the best I have smelled not for little boys that is for sure this is a must try cologne</li>
    <li> This is a serious fragrance. I would wear this for dinner or special occasion, not on a day to day trial. Beautiful scent, but has a tobacco start, and ends with a soft flow of fresh air (which is my favorite part). If you chose to wear it on a day to day bases, then be sure not to over spray, 3 sprays should be enough to cover you for 8 to 10 hours. Spray your torso, back side, and one \\&quot;warm spot\\&quot; on your body.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  One of the guys at work was wearing it and I had to stop and ask him what it was.  I&#x27;m not really good with all of those scent snob decriptions like \\&quot;base notes of violet, pepper, cedar with secretions of a chimera which dry down to a pleasant musky aroma\\&quot; or some other monkey business.  I just know that I like what I like and I like this very much.  It&#x27;s masculine and clean without being one of those \\&quot;slap you in the face\\&quot; scents.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I first started using a small bottle of this cologne from a sample bottle my brother had given me. I immediately fell in love, and used it on special occasions. I saw it at my local mall for 100 dollars, but months later on amazon I found it for a great price, and immediately bought it. No regrets, and major compliments from my girl!</li>
    <li> This was a great smelling cologne in the bottle...but as soon as my husband put it on..No Smell. And you know women..they Love Love to smell their men!!&lt;br /&gt;Price was good for the bottle size...But...the lid had to be pushed down hard in order for it to stay. Well..needless to say..my husband picked the bottle up by the top and the lid wasnt on...Crash..all over our bedroom floor. We only had this bottle for 3 days!! So I just ordered him the Gucci Guilty...its WAY better!!</li>
    <li> I originally received this as a sample from Sephora and then came here to buy it for my husband for his birthday.  It smells wonderful and my husband LOVES it.</li>
    <li> This smells unbelievable when you first put it on but then it quickly fades away and leaves you with nothing.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loved it!! I was very happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I like Gucci by Gucci, I have tried a lot of men&#x27;s colognes and have came back to this one. Its light, masculine and becomes close to the skin scent (like it should). Does not smell fruity or sweet or too strong like most &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; fragrances on the market. Good choice to add to a mans collection.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent, and I would buy it again IF it lasted more than an hour.  But it didn&#x27;t.  At least for me.  For the price, there are better, longer-lasting alternatives.</li>
    <li> I have liked this scent since it first came out in 2008.  I have come close to purchasing it a few times, but never did for whatever reason.  I finally bit the bullet and purchased it, and am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give one of those eloquent reviews like they do on some of those fragrance websites with base note descriptions and dry off descriptions, not to mention all of those nuances in between, but I can&#x27;t.  All I can say is I bought it for me because I like it - for me.  To me the scent is clean and fresh, not overpowering, not too weak, just right.  If you have doubts, go to one of those box stores and try it before you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, I could not find it anywhere for a better price than I found it for here.</li>
    <li> The cologne is great this is my 3rd time buying it. its a chick magnet but the scense doesn&#x27;t last too long but it smells great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful package but the bottle is so big it leaves no room for the spray itself 1.7 is the bottle size not actually usable spray if if was more spray it works be perfect</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bf and this smells absolutely amazing. Draws you in... Should be illustrated like one of those AXE commercials. Magnetic scent</li>
    <li> My son said that he like it. I loved the scent when I bought it. He said that he would wear it.</li>
    <li> The presentation here is great. The bottle the cologne is packaged in is pure class. This is a safe cologne that can be worn anywhere. It has a very subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t have much projection. Bottom line - There are many other scents I like a lot more than this one. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Gucci by Gucci Spray isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but it also isn&#x27;t nearly as good as some of Gucci&#x27;s other men&#x27;s colognes (in my opinion).</li>
    <li> Buying a fragrance online without actually smelling it first is the most abstract thing, but I needed something quickly to travel with for a month-long business trip.  Since it was less than 3 ounces/100 ml and I could get it next day, it won by default.  At least it wasn&#x27;t one of those crap travel-sized bottles...and how bad could a Gucci fragrance be?  Luckily, it arrived on time, and I was relieved to be right.  A sophisticated, distinct, versatile (yet mild) scent that was a perfect go-to for both my week in the blazing summer of Singapore immediately followed by three weeks in the grey winter of Melbourne and Sydney.  The bottle is a little heavy and thick for traveling, but it was still easy.  Even landed me a few compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells incredible - I wish I got the bigger bottle. The smell is great - I love the rich tones.</li>
    <li> Its really good...!!!! Its not very good but its good..liked it ...the fragrance is really mild...I liked wearing it in a party or any other places. ....</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. He loves it! I noticed some of the other buyers saying it wasn&#x27;t a long lasting scent but I didn&#x27;t have that experience. He put it on in the early evening before heading out and I could still smell it on him hours later. Awesome price for an amazing bottle of cologne!</li>
    <li> Very good cologne smells really good.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great scent for a business type man.  It&#x27;s not really for teens, but for someone that is mature and confident.  I purchased this scent a few weeks back and love the scent and statement it gives.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent and the bottle should last me a long time. I agree with another reviewer that the scent itself doesn&#x27;t last a long time. I use one spray on my neck and it&#x27;s usually good for about three hours. The females seem to like the scent as well-- or maybe it&#x27;s just wishful thinking on my part. Not really being a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; kinda guy I&#x27;m happy I tried one of those sample scent pages that come in the mens magazines or I would have never tried this at all.</li>
    <li> I dont what wrong with those guys who gave this product excellent reviews i really doubt the reality of the reviews. it smells too strong with nasty scent and it does not last more than 2 hours!!! not worth a penny</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy this again, which I had bought the larger bottle.  Soft clean smell, not too strong or sweet.</li>
    <li> I purchased samples of many different colognes to test before I purchased some and this is one that I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;But for some reason, although it smells similar (I don&#x27;t think it smells the same), it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.&lt;br /&gt;Matter of fact after the initial spray on I don&#x27;t smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The sample vial gave off a lot more sent.&lt;br /&gt;So I give it 4 stars for the smell but 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Very classic taste, very good. Love it.</li>
    <li> Favorite cologne ,smells great,would  order again.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my honey. Its authentic, smells classic and sexy. He is enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I personally find this to be a wonderful men&#x27;s fragrance. Others have complained about its longevity and spillage but I get quite a few hours of wear before it dries to a skin scent. Is hard to describe the individual notes or layers of this one; it simply delivers a very cohesive, balanced fragrance that invokes warm, dark moods and creates interest in the wearer by his peers. While it seems a bit mainstream, it&#x27;s a brilliantly done fragrance that I consider a classic of our modern era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle is beautiful. The horsebit cap and smoky gray glass perfectly complement the fragrance contained therein. The atomizer is one of the best, sprays are very evenly distributed and arrive softly yet firmly on their target.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this spray.  It smells fresh and it lasts.  I wish I could describe the smell better.  The top cover is magnietized and clicks in place.</li>
    <li> Awesome cold weather scent. Shipping was good.</li>
    <li> Worry about buying any fragrance online due to the fakes but this and the last few we have ordered are the real thing.  You pay a bit more but it&#x27;s worth it to get the actual Gucci product!</li>
    <li> I had been given this as a Christmas present a year ago. Had to get more. And this was a great price.</li>
    <li> Bought this as Christmas gift for my fiance. He loved it.</li>
    <li> My son loved it. Very nice packaging. Bottle is very pretty or handsome I should say since its a mans cologne. :o) it smells wonderful we all thought. He likes it!</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is me or not, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the &#x27;sampler&#x27; at the store. It could very well be that they boost the cologne in the &#x27;samplers&#x27;. Either way, I&#x27;m very pleased with the cologne. Again, it may just be my nose and that I&#x27;m more used to wearing the cologne now.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT A BOTTLE FOR MY BIRTHDAY I LIKE IT SO MUCH I AM ALMOST OUT... TIME TO RE UP!!!!</li>
    <li> Great size, great price, smells lovely and its GUCCI!! lol it would be a great gift, what is better than a sale price on a fashion name!</li>
    <li> I love this Gucci fragrance!  The smell turns heads and it will stay with you all day.  This is a must have men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my husband as it smells very nice on him.  This size is great as he puts it in his travel bag.  Getting hard to find in department stores so I buy online.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! I love to smell my boyfriend in this fragrance!</li>
    <li> This cologne has a smell at the muskier end of the spectrum. I think it smells amazing, and doesn&#x27;t ahve me leaving the house smelling all floral and citrus and perfume-y.</li>
    <li> exactly as described; received on time and what can go wrong with a packaged fragrance for a christmas present, eh</li>
    <li> My son loves this cologne.  The product is exactly as it states and smells wonderful!  i would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It has a strong but not overwhelming scent to it. Something I wear all the time when going out to downtown or dinner with friends.</li>
    <li> i got it and i love it...shipped to fl and i love it. perfect fit....good quality . :D :D awesome</li>
