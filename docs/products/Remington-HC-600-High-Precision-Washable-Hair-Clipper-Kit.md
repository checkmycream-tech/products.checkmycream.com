      <li>This is easily washable too.</li>
      <li>These clippers are great because I am deployed, and I am not always able to have power in the same location as where I want to cut my hair.  </li>

      <li>Can get a good clean hair shave in the shower, which makes life that much easier since there is no cleanup of fuzzy hair bits all over the floor.</li>

      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Smooth cut and</li>
      <li>The storage slots inside the bag dont securely support the attachments their designed to hold.</li>
      <li>Just as advertised it works well in the shower and extreemly easy to clean.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>It charges well, holds the charge over time and cuts very nice, and its quiet too.  </li>
      <li>(However) I give the product 5 stars in this review because it does exactly what its advertised as being able to do.</li>
      <li>It has a nice quality feel about it &amp; cuts ok, but the battery only lasts about 10 minutes on a 16+ hour charge.</li>
      <li>Not bad when I use it every day.</li>
      <li>It has a strong motor, I literally charged it one time and have been able to use it three time so far without charging it.</li>
      <li>but then quickly things changed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, it works well in the shower, and it has held up just fine thus far.  </li>
      <li>It also comes with its own small shower bag for easy storage, blade brush, and many size attachments.  </li>
      <li>Great thing is I can unplug it, trim my dome in the shower and wash away the mess.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cleaner and very convenient to be able to cut hair in the shower.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice, quiet and doesn&#x27;t yank hairs.</li>
      <li>Well worth it,</li>
      <li>So far i am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>actually, in the shower is the best way cuz the mess is easier to clean up.     </li>
      <li>right there just saved me the cost of the clipper itself.</li>
      <li>This worked like a champ right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just the particular unit I received, but it kept making a high pitched squealing noise on &amp; off, sometimes on more than off.</li>
      <li>The product has worked fine so far,  </li>
      <li>This product does exactly what i was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this clipper set since Christmas and it worked well for the first couple of months</li>
      <li>You have to change a plastic adapter, and in my case I miss some more short lenght haircut adapters</li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is sharp, very accurate, quiet, and the guides go on and off very easy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a while since owning it, and it still works very well</li>
      <li>i used it in the shower, and the battery goes fast in the shower, for some reason, but it is definitively water proof.</li>
      <li>This clipper works very well.</li>
      <li>I tried cleaning &amp; lubricating everything really well, but to no avail.</li>
      <li>The older blades were much smoother to the touch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been used several times including a full head buzz, and it hasn&#x27;t run out of batteries yet.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is ok, the only thing that doesn&#x27;t last for a reasonable time is the battery.</li>
      <li>I like being able to rinse off the blades instead of banging it on the sink (which caused my previous clipper to break).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>BUT I AM TAKING LEGAL ACTION.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll pay for itself in 2 shaves since a trip to the barber is $15 here in New York.</li>
      <li>This was a complete rip off using a clever knock off.</li>
      <li>I think the trick is to let it charge a few days before using it the first time, otherwise it won&#x27;t get a full charge.  </li>
      <li>The newer version however does not glide over bare skin as well as the older version did.</li>
      <li>It comes with a lot of stuff and its a lot easier to wash than my old one    </li>
      <li>The charge time is a bit long, but keep it plugged in the first time and the battery life will peak.</li>
      <li>Cuts through my thick curly hair no problem for when I feel its time to cool off a bit, lose the fro, and go more or less bald.</li>
      <li>My old buzzer yanked hairs and required you to manually adjust the speed settings (it would make a lot of noise if set too high or pull hairs if set too low, settings setting that was a hair turn apart)    </li>
      <li>Slight problem with the postage, Shaveroutlet sorted this quickly.</li>
      <li>I generally cut my hair once a week so that speaks volumes for the strenght of the motor.</li>
      <li>this annoying intermittent sound combined with the extremely short battery life made it an unacceptable replacement for my current clippers, otherwise these would have been ok.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I plugged the trimmer in and charged it for about 30 hours, had my wife give me a haircut, and it ran out of juice in less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does run while plugged in though, so it wasn&#x27;t a very big deal.  If you can cut your hair in less than 15 minutes, than this will probably work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is sharp, very accurate, quiet, and the guides go on and off very easy.  If the charge lasted more like 30 minutes this would be world class.</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper. The newer version however does not glide over bare skin as well as the older version did. It also has a tendency to catch skin on occasion. The older blades were much smoother to the touch. The newer blade tip is very rough to the touch.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I&#x27;ve cut my hair 3 times already, and although i&#x27;m terrible at it... it works just fine. that right there just saved me the cost of the clipper itself. it comes with a ton of things which may or may not be of interest to you. since i suck at it, i use the basic stuff.    i used it in the shower, and the battery goes fast in the shower, for some reason, but it is definitively water proof. actually, in the shower is the best way cuz the mess is easier to clean up.     i like it a lot and although it is not a professional clipper, if you know what you&#x27;re doing you will make it look like its for pros. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what i was hoping it would. It has a strong motor, I literally charged it one time and have been able to use it three time so far without charging it. I generally cut my hair once a week so that speaks volumes for the strenght of the motor. Just as advertised it works well in the shower and extreemly easy to clean. The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this product is the storage bag. The storage slots inside the bag dont securely support the attachments their designed to hold. (However) I give the product 5 stars in this review because it does exactly what its advertised as being able to do.</li>
    <li> This is a very good Shaver, this is the 2nd one I have bought, the 1st one lasted 5 years. Not bad when I use it every day. Would recommend this, very easy to use and totally safe for the shower.  Slight problem with the postage, Shaveroutlet sorted this quickly.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Remington HC-600. What I received was the RMPRO CUT-UP HC600P. None of this was included \\&quot;storage bag, 3 sectioning clips, scissors, neck brush\\&quot; and there was a small bottle of clipper oil which Remington doesn&#x27;t provide with their Titanium models because they don&#x27;t require it. This was a complete rip off using a clever knock off. Shaver Outlet is going to the banned for life list.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to shave my head not completely though.  However the smallest attachments is only 1/8\\&quot;. There should be on that is 1/16th.  It would also be nice if the blade had it&#x27;s own adjustment built in.  As it is I occasionally use this now but since it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough the finish tends to look a little frizzy!!</li>
    <li> The product has worked fine so far,  It has got a precision cut.  I use it to trim my hair short.</li>
    <li> It works very well, excellent for shaving in humid place like a shower.  The battery could last longer, but it&#x27;s definitely enough for one shave.  Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am in my 70s and have been cutting my husbands hair for 30 years.  This is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. Stays sharp, doesn&#x27;t pull. It has lots of cutting options.</li>
    <li> It seems like cordless operation lasts only for a couple of haircuts.  Length of haircut is not that easily adjustable. You have to change a plastic adapter, and in my case I miss some more short lenght haircut adapters (there&#x27;s a big difference between the shortest and the following)   Apart from those comments, it&#x27;s good and reliable, and looks durable</li>
    <li> Having a cordless shaver has been great.  I can get a few shaves out of one charge.  I think the trick is to let it charge a few days before using it the first time, otherwise it won&#x27;t get a full charge.  Well worth it, and I&#x27;ll probably never buy a corded shaver again.  This is easily washable too.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great because I am deployed, and I am not always able to have power in the same location as where I want to cut my hair.  I am able to charge them in one place and then use them somewhere else.  Easy to clean.  Could use a little more cutting power, but they are cordless, so they perform well in that aspect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this clipper set since Christmas and it worked well for the first couple of months but then quickly things changed. The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge to get through one kid haircut. Then I had to use it plugged in, which is hard when cutting kids hair. The power seemed very weak and I had to go over the hair several times to get it to cut. I was very good about keeping it clean and oiled. The worst thing was that as I clipped my 3 yr. olds hair today, the cord started to get warm, smoke and all of a sudden there were sparks. I hope that this is a fluke and that it doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else</li>
    <li> I am in the Army, so I require the use of clippers quite often.  I have to say that the Remington HC-600 is the best set of clippers I have ever owned.  I enjoyed the luxury of shaving in the shower that these clippers provided.  I have owned them for several months and have yet to experience a problem.  There is absolutely no sign of rust or dullness in the blades.  After each use I do rinse and dry them thoroughly as a precaution.  The weight is nice and easily fits in my hand and I also like the non-slip grip on the handle.  The charge time is relatively low as well.  It also comes with its own small shower bag for easy storage, blade brush, and many size attachments.  They are all that I anticipated and more.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Can get a good clean hair shave in the shower, which makes life that much easier since there is no cleanup of fuzzy hair bits all over the floor. Cordless and waterproof features are wonderful. Product is sleek and well built. Good supply of attachments. Battery lasts a long time. Good price here on Amazon, plus free shipping. It&#x27;ll pay for itself in 2 shaves since a trip to the barber is $15 here in New York. You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is ok, the only thing that doesn&#x27;t last for a reasonable time is the battery.</li>
    <li> Its alright.  It does what it should, but it doesn&#x27;t run very fast, and the battery life on it is awful.  I just leave it plugged in all the time so the battery doesn&#x27;t discharge before I need to use it again.</li>
    <li> Got these after I borrowed a pair (I had half-mangled my head in an attempts to shave it with a beard trimmer). Cuts through my thick curly hair no problem for when I feel its time to cool off a bit, lose the fro, and go more or less bald. Great variety of length combs and included brushes make cleaning easy. Plus it&#x27;s washable which is the best part.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I like the feel of this product.  It charges well, holds the charge over time and cuts very nice, and its quiet too.  Nothing bad to say about this after using it for 1 month.</li>
    <li> Going to cordless clipper is great.  I can do it in my shower without worrying about electrocuting myself.  It is very quiet too.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time between charges, easy to clean (under running water) and does an excellent job of trimming.  It&#x27;s much cleaner and very convenient to be able to cut hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> This worked like a champ right out of the box.  Smooth cut and still  working 3 mos later.  Only complaint was one plastic guard was broken, but the rest work fine.</li>
    <li> I use this maybe once a month or so, and it works great.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, it works well in the shower, and it has held up just fine thus far.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and he thinks it is great. If you want to give your significant other something this would be the best gift.</li>
    <li> Received package, but the package did not contain the item ordered.  The package only contained accessories and not the clipper itself. WHAT ARE YOU DOING AMAZON?!?!?</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m cutting my own hair, I have found that the angle of the cutting head relative to the hand grip is to severe. I would prefer a cutting head that is much closer to being in line with the clipper body.    Of course, that could be just me.</li>
    <li> This clipper works very well. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months. I like being able to rinse off the blades instead of banging it on the sink (which caused my previous clipper to break).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The #1 (3mm) guard had a couple teeth break after a couple months. I&#x27;m still using it, but shopping for a replacement. This happened on my previous clipper as well. The #1 guard is the only one I use.&lt;br /&gt;So be careful of the teeth on the #1 and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll tell you what, if you&#x27;re looking for a great cordless clipper, get this one. Used it for the first time and it gives a great smooth cut, felt great compared to the other clippers I use. The batteries lasted about twenty minutes, plenty of time for a nice buzz cut. Very happy with the purchase and will probably get another.</li>
    <li> It has a nice quality feel about it &amp; cuts ok, but the battery only lasts about 10 minutes on a 16+ hour charge. I don&#x27;t know if it was just the particular unit I received, but it kept making a high pitched squealing noise on &amp; off, sometimes on more than off. I tried cleaning &amp; lubricating everything really well, but to no avail. I believe the noise was coming from internally inside the sealed motor area... this annoying intermittent sound combined with the extremely short battery life made it an unacceptable replacement for my current clippers, otherwise these would have been ok. Perhaps others have better luck.</li>
    <li> Works great and the best is it&#x27;s cordless. I shaved my head with it and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Comes with all the attachments and a nice bag to hold everything.</li>
    <li> They sent a color scheme that was girly and hideous!! The advertised product was silver and black not grey and purple blue. I was not warned that product might be different or colors might be different. Dissapointed with the shaver outlet, unsatisfactory customer service... Buyer beware! Shaver although ugly, works well.</li>
    <li> SO I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING THE PRODUCT IN THE PICTURE, THE REMINGTON CLIPPER BUT TURNS OUT SHAVER OUTLET SENT ME SOME KNOCK OFF, NO-NAME PRODUCT THAT LOOKS SIMILAR BUT ISN&#x27;T IT. WHY THEY WOULD STEAL MY MONEY BAFFLES ME BUT I AM TAKING LEGAL ACTION. SO BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY SHAVER OUTLET, THEY ARE CROOKS.</li>
    <li> I bought Remington, it was my second try with similar device. I am very pleased with the behaviour and results. It also has everything you need to make almost any style you want depending your experience. So far i am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been used several times including a full head buzz, and it hasn&#x27;t run out of batteries yet. The charge time is a bit long, but keep it plugged in the first time and the battery life will peak.It&#x27;s really nice, quiet and doesn&#x27;t yank hairs. It comes with a lot of stuff and its a lot easier to wash than my old one    Edit: It&#x27;s been a while since owning it, and it still works very well, the batteries hold the charge, it works even when in the shower and still doesn&#x27;t pull my hair when cutting. My old buzzer yanked hairs and required you to manually adjust the speed settings (it would make a lot of noise if set too high or pull hairs if set too low, settings setting that was a hair turn apart)    Still a great razor today, I&#x27;m glad I got it, great buy.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well. Easy to clean. My hair is sparse and I keep it about a 1/4&#x27;&#x27; long so haven&#x27;t used it to cut thick long hair, but it works like a charm for me. Great thing is I can unplug it, trim my dome in the shower and wash away the mess. Charge lasts long enough for my haircut. Does everything it needs to do well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; but It can totally be used in the shower.  It is a time saver for me. I really love this clipper</li>
