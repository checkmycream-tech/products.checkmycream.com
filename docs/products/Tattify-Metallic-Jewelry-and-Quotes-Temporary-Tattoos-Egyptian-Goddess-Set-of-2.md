      <li>These were delivered in 5 days, they are exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love and will use them again next suer.</li>
      <li>looks exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I would put it there knowing as much as I wash my hands and all the movement that goes on right there.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use very much of the tattoos themselves since they were all rather large and bulky.</li>
      <li>Expected something more realistic looking for the price</li>
      <li>Loved them, they last a long time, and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin</li>

      <li>Easily applied with just water, I put one on my ankle and it lasted over a week though I showered everyday.</li>
      <li>The tattoos were very pretty some did not fit my body very well and shipping was a nightmare</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>

<li> they just don&#x27;t stay on the skin very long.</li>
<li> It was not worth the cost; found same item elsewhere for 1/2 the price!</li>
<li> I wanted my temporary tat to last a little bit longer.</li>
<li> the only thing is its a little tooo pricey.</li>
<li> gold color isn&#x27;t as muted as I&#x27;ve seen on other tattoos.</li>
<li> I have had other tattoo  products like this</li>
<li> Stayed on longest and color was bolder longer than the other 2 company&#x27;s</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again in a not so active area.</li>
<li> my only complaint is that there were no instructions included.</li>
<li> Styles of tattoos were very cute but after applying them they flaked off within hours and looked terrible.</li>
<li> The quality was horrible  - within hours they started to separate and after one bath the tattoo was half off</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with these!</li>

    <li> LOVE THESE TATTOOS!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome pack! There was a lot more than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stay on for quite as long as advertised but is cool for the day or two it lasts.

    <li> Absolutely loved! Tattoos stayed on for 3 days without fading</li>
    <li> Loved them, they last a long time, and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I was hoping this one was one of the better ones because of the price. I wanted my temporary tat to last a little bit longer. I put one on my wrist in the crook, where y wrist bends (which was my mistake) I don&#x27;t know why I would put it there knowing as much as I wash my hands and all the movement that goes on right there. Suffice it to say, it lasted for about 12 hours....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again in a not so active area.</li>
    <li> not fond of the color of gold. gold color isn&#x27;t as muted as I&#x27;ve seen on other tattoos.</li>
    <li> looks exactly as pictured. beautifully packaged. my only complaint is that there were no instructions included. i&#x27;m guessing they should be applied just as any temporary tattoo is though.</li>
    <li> Is a great product. I wish more deigns were available.</li>
    <li> Very cute fast delivery they just don&#x27;t stay on the skin very long.</li>
