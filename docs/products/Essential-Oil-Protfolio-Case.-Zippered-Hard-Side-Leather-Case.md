      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>I had always hoped I would find a case for my oils that looked this good, and professional, and I finally have!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the storage that only allows you to see the top of the bottle</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>You have to have half of it filled with 5ml bottles if you want them all to fit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really like a portfolio that has a shoulder strap.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s enough room for all my bottles to fit</li>
      <li>The case itself is very well made and they also provide a strap for traveling.</li>
      <li>It holds my 5ml, 10ml and 15ml bottles very well.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed for my essential oils.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to see your oil labels, unlike other type cases.</li>
      <li>The elastic is normal elastic and there is a limit to the size, but it is what is advertised.</li>
      <li>This case holds the essential oils very well and is made in a way</li>
      <li>It is a little tight when holding all 15ml size bottles but still works and makes it very easy to find your oils at a glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only minus is that the pocket in the middle flap really doesn&#x27;t hold any material well at all, as items are constantly falling out.</li>

<li> The elastic is as expected and the case will hold half 5ml and half 15 ml bottles (Young Living is the brand I use).  </li>

<li> But I use the zippered pouch on the other side and the holder in the cover instead.</li>
<li> The product is useless to me if I have to go through that much just to get the thing zipped closed.</li>
<li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the zipper was hard to grasp and close.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed in it because according to the details I assumed that it held more bottles of oil.  </li>
<li> The only problem is the zipper is hard to zip up... which I&#x27;m hoping î will become easier after time.</li>
<li> zipper is a little hard to close after it has been fully opened</li>
<li> so it stands up in a small area</li>
<li> The zipper would not zip shut without using an excessive amount of force.</li>
<li> but I was given a tip to pinch behind the zipper with thumb and forefinger while zipping with other hand and that works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The elastic holds them tightly in place and there is space to hold pamphlets or a small thin book or charts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great case to store your oils. It is geared to store three different sizes (5, 10 and 15ml bottles).  I have this stored in our family room under our coffee table. It is so nice to have everything in one place. The case itself is very well made and they also provide a strap for traveling. I have never had a zipper issue as some reviews stated. If I keep buying more oils I will have to graduate up to the 64 bottle case!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and portfolio was in perfect condition. Haven&#x27;t had any troubles with the zippers. 5ml and up bottles of essential oils fit beautifully! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Case looks so good I like to leave it out so my customers can see it!  Looks like leather, sturdy not floppy.  Holds my square bottles of essential oil without seeming like the elastic straps will snap (problem I had with my former case by another brand).  I had always hoped I would find a case for my oils that looked this good, and professional, and I finally have! Love it.</li>
    <li> This is what was advertised but it&#x27;s nicer than what I expected. There are additional pockets to add notes, etc. The elastic is as expected and the case will hold half 5ml and half 15 ml bottles (Young Living is the brand I use).  It won&#x27;t hold all 15 ml bottles though, it&#x27;s not large enough.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what was advertised but more.  It&#x27;s really like a portfolio that has a shoulder strap.  You can carry papers and it has a handle, as well as a shoulder strap.  The elastic is normal elastic and there is a limit to the size, but it is what is advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent case for oils, handy for travel to. Also has convient space for cards or paper items. Comes with a strap for carrying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this case. It holds my 5ml, 10ml and 15ml bottles very well. The elastic holds them tightly in place and there is space to hold pamphlets or a small thin book or charts.It comes with a strap so you can easily transport your oils.</li>
    <li> It fits my 5ml and 15 ml bottles perfectly! It even comes with a handy detachable shoulder strap.</li>
    <li> Nice case.  Arrived without issue.</li>
    <li> Love the case but I wish it had a pocket on the other side to stick information sheets on the oils. Have only had it for a week so we will see how it holds up in the long run but for now it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy. Well made. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Almost a five star as I really love the way it holds all of my 5 ml, 10 ml and 15 ml bottles. The ability to have a place to carry brochures and pamphlets is great. The only minus is that the pocket in the middle flap really doesn&#x27;t hold any material well at all, as items are constantly falling out. But I use the zippered pouch on the other side and the holder in the cover instead.</li>
    <li> I really like it. I take my oils everywhere!</li>
    <li> The zipper would not zip shut without using an excessive amount of force. I got it zippered one time (it took 2 people and a wrench to do so) and was exhausted after the whole ordeal. When I unzipped it after that to get some oils out, I again struggled in an attempt to zip it closed. This time, I gave up. The product is useless to me if I have to go through that much just to get the thing zipped closed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product in the slightest!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Very good quality</li>
    <li> Nice!!! Exactly what I needed for my e-juice!!!!</li>
    <li> Great case for 5 ml bottles. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Received item promptly.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice case.  It is so easy to see your oil labels, unlike other type cases.</li>
    <li> Very nice case with a zipped pocket for brochures, oil samples, product cards, etc.  Also a spot for business cards.  It is a little tight when holding all 15ml size bottles but still works and makes it very easy to find your oils at a glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zipper is a little hard to close after it has been fully opened but I was given a tip to pinch behind the zipper with thumb and forefinger while zipping with other hand and that works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering another portfolio!</li>
    <li> Really love this except once you unzip it, you have to fight it to close it again.</li>
    <li> i have used many plant therapy products and been completely satisfied.  this is no different.  when closed, reminds me of a kiddo&#x27;s trapper keeper from back in the day.  i&#x27;m pleased.  holds a ton, and has a zipper pocket for pamphlets etc.  also holds business cards etc.  has a handle and a clip on shoulder strap.</li>
    <li> I like the case. It holds the 15ml btls. . The only problem is the zipper is hard to zip up... which I&#x27;m hoping î will become easier after time.</li>
    <li> Very nice portfolio for my oils. I just wish I had ordered two of them.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I was a little disappointed in it because according to the details I assumed that it held more bottles of oil.  All in all love it.</li>
    <li> This case holds the essential oils very well and is made in a way so it stands up in a small area so it is at my reach at all times.  Well made and good choice.</li>
    <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the zipper was hard to grasp and close. Sorta flimsy. Might just have been me but otherwise it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> Perfect case! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s enough room for all my bottles to fit and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Just what i needed to stay organized. Holds 32-15mL TFA flavor bottles easily. Clean presentation of bottle labels. Many areas for DIY recipe card storage. Nice product</li>
    <li> This portfolio is great for storing my 0.5 oz bottles and even the 1oz bottles. The 1oz take up two elastics, but you can easily store those bottles there. I don&#x27;t like the storage that only allows you to see the top of the bottle - I&#x27;d have to pull each one up to see what oil it is. Here I see them all beautifully displayed (in my case alphabetically), so finding the right bottle is super easy. Yes, I could label the tops, but this has never worked for me well. So, I found my perfect solution :D&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the flaps and pockets are very handy for keeping home made recipes and/or general info about the oils.</li>
    <li> It is a nice cas but I have mostly 15ml bottles and they don&#x27;t fit well in this. You have to have half of it filled with 5ml bottles if you want them all to fit.</li>
    <li> Was extremely happy with the product and it came very quickly!</li>
