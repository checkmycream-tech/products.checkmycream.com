      <li>Works well at keeping the skin nice and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It is an awesome product, but is a blend of oils (natural vitamin E + safflower oil + lemon</li>
      <li>I have even applied it (very lightly) on my face and it has cleared up some of my blemishes, and it didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
      <li>All came ok...</li>
      <li>I love this oil I use it in a rub I make for pain relief.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this before and was so impressed with it that I now order it regularly for use in making lotions and body butters.  </li>
      <li>Love the price.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does absorb fast and surprisingly it does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>and now it dispenses easily and drip free.</li>
      <li>Use it to make homemade shampoo and works fine.  </li>
      <li>Real Vitamin E Oil; not soybean oil like many others!</li>
      <li>Is great in making at home lotions, hair treatments, or facial treaments!!!</li>
      <li>Easy clean up for with the massage tool.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipment!!!</li>
      <li>and I love the fact that I know exactly what is in my sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Nothing special to me.</li>
      <li>but, if you need 100% vitamin E oil that is not in a blend, you will have to look elsewhere, but just make sure you buy real vitamin E oil and not the synthetic..  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and leaves your skin soft and supple.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>She used to use their Sweet Almond Oil, and it containts Vitamin E.</li>
      <li>I love it and believe its natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Might be good as a whole body oil, but is not thick/pure enough to be used on lips, cuticles, etc</li>
      <li>Overall a really nice product.</li>
      <li>and the price is right.</li>
      <li>It is synthetic Vit E in cheap safflower oil and lemon oil, which is used as a solvent in furniture polish to remove old wax.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this oil.</li>
      <li>Works great combine with other products !!!!</li>
      <li>I was looking for pure 100% vitamin E.</li>
      <li>% Pure Vitamin E Oil&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just as expected, why do you have to have more words</li>
      <li>It works fast</li>
      <li>I realized I really have to start using it.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It has a blend of safflower oil and lemon oil, and there&#x27;s no indication how much of a blend of each of the oil is included.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, soft scent and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin like other vitamin e oils I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>But there is a very lemony smell to it and the consistency is not thick like a pure vitamin e oil would be.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely lemon scent due to the lemon oil they&#x27;ve added.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and this is my favorite (nearly) 100% vitamin E oil.  </li>
      <li>Shipping delayed 1 day from normal...</li>
      <li>So I ordered this product because the listing says pure and there are no other ingredients listed.</li>
      <li>Natural, indeed!  </li>
      <li>Natural Vitamin E Oil stimulates collagen, helps to fade dark spots and blemish marks (over time) and even softens fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>and there is no such thing as &amp;#34;100% Pure Enriched Vitamin E&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Not enough to mess up my lotions, but enough to smell nice when you put it on your skin directly.</li>
      <li>tocopherols would be natural.)  </li>
      <li>It will change the texture of your hair so, if your hair is soft like mine, it will become softer.</li>
      <li>It has a subtle lemon scent that is really refreshing.  </li>
      <li>is this enough or do you need a few more, finally</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything major on my skin</li>
      <li>oil-- which use only for specific recipes that I would normally add the additional ingredients to---</li>
      <li>It has a nice feel on the skin, and has a faint citrus smell (orange? lemon?).</li>
      <li>One bottle goes a long way as you just need a few drop and is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Use it daily after shower, then just pat dry for soft skin.</li>

<li> Use it daily after shower, then just pat dry for soft skin.</li>
<li> Im not sure as to how pure it is, so thats</li>
<li> Believe me, if you use it to masage your face everyday, you don&#x27;t need those expensive name brand beauty products sell in stores.&lt;br /&gt;The sweet almond oil by Hobe smells nutty and like real food smell.</li>
<li> Contrary to product label, this is NOT a &#x27;natural&#x27; product; it is made with tochopherol acetate, a manufactured product.</li>
<li> None of my mixes have gone bad, but I only mix as needed and use them pretty fast.</li>
<li> but does take a very long time to absorb into skin.</li>
<li> Seriously, my mom is 60 years old and her face skin feels younger than mine</li>
<li> so I transferred some into an empty eye drops bottle</li>
<li> Not as thick as some more expensive brands, but works well</li>
<li> If it was un-blended, it would get a higher rating, but as far as blends go, it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
<li> I was using Trader Joe&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s mostly soybean oil... :(  </li>
<li> Cheaper than some of the other options, too.</li>
<li> Moisturing in other carrier oils for the hair and body, but I use it as a preservative in my body butters.</li>
<li> I take a small amount and put it directly on the trouble areas and the result is less visible stretch marks and wrinkles!!</li>
<li> Contrary to the label, this is a very thin, liquidy vitamin E solution largely comprised of safflower and lemon</li>
<li> I really like this natural vitamin E oil a lot, but I hate the teensy-weensy sizes of the bottles.  </li>
<li> However, due to the slightly lemon scent of the oil, I feel like a salmon filet every time I apply it!  </li>
<li> It is a bit oily, so you don&#x27;t want to apply it heavily.</li>
<li> I have a pretty bad eczema and use this on my face twice a day and within two days of using it I can already tell a difference in the redness in the dryness of my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen improvements in my skin over the past few weeks, and i will continue to buy this.</li>
<li> it keeps my skin soft and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell even though it&#x27;s mix with other oils.</li>
<li> God bless America  and get us past this president</li>
<li> It is very weak -- I.U. is a measure of strength, not quantity</li>
<li> (I suppose there are worse things to want to eat during pregnancy!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great to add to your lotion as an additional skin toner. Quality product! Soaks well into skin and is non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for skin care and lotion making. It has a nice feel on the skin, and has a faint citrus smell (orange? lemon?). Not enough to mess up my lotions, but enough to smell nice when you put it on your skin directly.</li>
    <li> Nice. Just what we wanted. Shipping delayed 1 day from normal...used USPS vs. UPS or FedEx. All came ok...just not when projected,</li>
    <li> This is great I use it in making deodorants</li>
    <li> Just as expected, why do you have to have more words is this enough or do you need a few more, finally</li>
    <li> I use this for my wrinkles and stretch marks and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how well it works! I take a small amount and put it directly on the trouble areas and the result is less visible stretch marks and wrinkles!! It works fast so I recommend using for 2 weeks and taking a before and after picture, you will be amazed!! I also use it in makeup, deoderant, etc recipes and to add a sheen to my hair. AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> Great for adding to your own oil formularies or/and naturally extending the life of your homemade products containing aloe vera or water...  Natural Vitamin E Oil stimulates collagen, helps to fade dark spots and blemish marks (over time) and even softens fine lines and wrinkles. And layered under Jojoba or Coconut oil leaves skin O-So-Soft!!  It is an awesome product, but is a blend of oils (natural vitamin E + safflower oil + lemon oil-- which use only for specific recipes that I would normally add the additional ingredients to---but if you have Vitiligo issues you should avoid products with citrus fruits or citric acids) but, if you need 100% vitamin E oil that is not in a blend, you will have to look elsewhere, but just make sure you buy real vitamin E oil and not the synthetic..  I really like this natural vitamin E oil a lot, but I hate the teensy-weensy sizes of the bottles.  (On a side note, if you are in need of bulk oils you can try:  Fromnaturewithlove.com or Mountainroseherbs.com )  Hope this helps!  Overall a really nice product. If it was un-blended, it would get a higher rating, but as far as blends go, it isn&#x27;t bad.  Grade: B or Four Stars!</li>
    <li> product says 100% vitamin e oil, but i smelled lemons. saw that the ingredients had vitamin e oil, lemon oil, and sunflower oil.&lt;br /&gt;It does absorb fast and surprisingly it does not leave a greasy feeling. it feels lightweight. I like it, however, I had to give it four stars bc I thought the ingredients contained only vitamin e.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything major on my skin but I like it...it keeps my skin soft and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell even though it&#x27;s mix with other oils.</li>
    <li> Real Vitamin E Oil; not soybean oil like many others!</li>
    <li> Contrary to product label, this is NOT a &#x27;natural&#x27; product; it is made with tochopherol acetate, a manufactured product. (The d-alpha, -beta, etc. tocopherols would be natural.)  It is very weak -- I.U. is a measure of strength, not quantity and there is no such thing as &amp;#34;100% Pure Enriched Vitamin E&amp;#34;.  It is synthetic Vit E in cheap safflower oil and lemon oil, which is used as a solvent in furniture polish to remove old wax.  Natural, indeed!  The mfg does not reply to inquires about its prodcuct.</li>
    <li> I read that vitamin E was good for hair so I got this without reading anything about it. Not for hair, which is my fault for not noticing. I used it on my skin, and had the same feel as lotion on. Nothing special to me.</li>
    <li> Bought this to add in as an ingredient to my chapsticks. It definately helped make them ultimate moisturizers. One bottle goes a long way as you just need a few drop and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I added this ingredient to my sunscreen recipe. It works great and I love the fact that I know exactly what is in my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I use it on stretch marks on my stomach and after about a week of continuous use they did begin to fade but not disappear</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly and was as described.  I have ordered this before and was so impressed with it that I now order it regularly for use in making lotions and body butters.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> was mailed to me the next day!&lt;br /&gt;i like the ingredients &amp; lemon smell.&lt;br /&gt;glad it came as 4oz!!&lt;br /&gt;i will buy again!!</li>
    <li> No complaints on this product.  Use it to make homemade shampoo and works fine.  Cheaper than some of the other options, too.</li>
    <li> Use it daily after shower, then just pat dry for soft skin. Satisfied with this purchase. God bless America  and get us past this president</li>
    <li> Works well at keeping the skin nice and moisturized.Im not sure as to how pure it is, so thats why gave it a 3 star.</li>
    <li> Works for what I need it to. Moisturing in other carrier oils for the hair and body, but I use it as a preservative in my body butters. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Great product but does take a very long time to absorb into skin. I&#x27;ve seen improvements in my skin over the past few weeks, and i will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and this is my favorite (nearly) 100% vitamin E oil.  It has a lovely lemon scent due to the lemon oil they&#x27;ve added.  I was using Trader Joe&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s mostly soybean oil... :(  Definitely a staple for me now!</li>
    <li> I love the oil!  I use it on my hair, face and in my home made body creams!  It has a subtle lemon scent that is really refreshing.  I could not be happier with the product!</li>
    <li> Love the price. I use to make my spa products.</li>
    <li> I was looking for pure 100% vitamin E. So I ordered this product because the listing says pure and there are no other ingredients listed. However, it arrived and contains additional ingredients not listed.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as some more expensive brands, but works well and the price is right. Gave it a four because my bottle fell over sideways, and it leaked out of the top, so be sure to keep it upright at all times.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty bad eczema and use this on my face twice a day and within two days of using it I can already tell a difference in the redness in the dryness of my skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> It has a blend of safflower oil and lemon oil, and there&#x27;s no indication how much of a blend of each of the oil is included. But there is a very lemony smell to it and the consistency is not thick like a pure vitamin e oil would be.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil and have bought it twice now. It has a nice smell and leaves your skin soft and supple. It is a bit oily, so you don&#x27;t want to apply it heavily. I have even applied it (very lightly) on my face and it has cleared up some of my blemishes, and it didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using Hobe&#x27;s products for a while. She used to use their Sweet Almond Oil, and it containts Vitamin E. Seriously, my mom is 60 years old and her face skin feels younger than mine (I am only 30)! I am shocked by the result on my mom&#x27;s. I realized I really have to start using it. My mom is running out of her oil, and ask me to buy the vitamin E oil for her. I also get some for my own. Believe me, if you use it to masage your face everyday, you don&#x27;t need those expensive name brand beauty products sell in stores.&lt;br /&gt;The sweet almond oil by Hobe smells nutty and like real food smell. I love it and believe its natural.</li>
    <li> I love this oil I use it in a rub I make for pain relief. It also works great on the skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect companion to the massage tool. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky. Easy clean up for with the massage tool. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love vitamin e oil and this item is great.  I have no complaints at all and it has lasted for a while.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this oil. I really like it. It has a nice, soft scent and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my skin like other vitamin e oils I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> Contrary to the label, this is a very thin, liquidy vitamin E solution largely comprised of safflower and lemon oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be good as a whole body oil, but is not thick/pure enough to be used on lips, cuticles, etc</li>
    <li> Was just what I wanted to make my chapsticks.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment!!! Works great combine with other products !!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use for any at home remedies !! Is great in making at home lotions, hair treatments, or facial treaments!!!</li>
    <li> Use as a preservative in homemade mixes. No issues. None of my mixes have gone bad, but I only mix as needed and use them pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my hair and it is very good.  It will change the texture of your hair so, if your hair is soft like mine, it will become softer.</li>
    <li> Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure Vitamin E Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Safflower Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Lemon Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT?  How is that 100% vitamin E oil? If you add anything else, it stops being 100% and becomes an adulterated percentage of oil. Ugh.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help the appearance of stretch marks from pregnancy and also to aid in perineal massage prior to delivery.  The product has worked well for both uses.  However, due to the slightly lemon scent of the oil, I feel like a salmon filet every time I apply it!  (I suppose there are worse things to want to eat during pregnancy!)</li>
    <li> I am one who likes to tinker and tweak with my skin care products depending on the weather and condition of my skin. In winter I&#x27;ve been adding 3-4 drops of this and a dime size dribble of glycerine to my regular body lotion and I love it. The bottle drips from the cap a bit so I transferred some into an empty eye drops bottle and now it dispenses easily and drip free.</li>
    <li> I have read that vitamin E is a good replacement for an undereye cream. I was using it under my eyes at night before bed (I did not get any in my eyes) and it feels like the vapors or another ingredient stings my eyes and makes them water. It is not so bad that I can&#x27;t take it, but I will not use as an under eye cream replacemnt any longer. Will find another use for it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I have some skin issues and this is what the doctors recommended. I find this is the highest quality oil and at a good price too. I can feel the results.</li>
    <li> I used this in my homemade lotion and loved it.</li>
    <li> Some one recommended it for my scalps but It did not do anything but make my face greasy. I wear glasses and they slipped all the time.</li>
