      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aloe Gel for 20 years as a moisturizer for both face and body (though now my mature facial skin needs some creme on top).</li>
      <li>I figured I could easily afford to try it for myself, and after several months I must say WOW!</li>
      <li>I bought this after a lady that I learned was 45 years old (but looked easily 30)told me that she had been using this for years on her face as her only beauty treatment.</li>
      <li>even though the temps are not that high.</li>
      <li>I really like the prime shipping, all the local stores were out of stock during the off season.</li>

<li> Alcohol is NOT what you want on dry, burned skin.</li>

<li> It even helps temporarily relieve the itch due to hives.  </li>
<li> I got a sunburn a couple days ago and it was the usual stingy and red sunburn.</li>
<li> When apply it soothes and cools it down within minutes.  </li>

<li> The moment I put this on my sun-burned skin, it became intensely itchy and painful.</li>
<li> not sure of the year-</li>
<li> Aloe gel that has alcohol as an ingredient is not good for sunburns.</li>
<li> This BB aloe is part of my secret.</li>
<li> I am not even joking, this stuff is painful and irritating and should not be used EVER if you have a sun burn, even though the label specifically says that it is for sun burn relief.</li>
<li> It relieves the grief of sunburn and has helped me heal quicker for years.</li>
<li> This stuff is terrible.</li>
<li> This stuff is horrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I always use this after spending a day out in the sun. The north east US sun seems to be much harsher than India (where I am from) even though the temps are not that high. Aloe vera helps recover the sun burns quicker</li>
    <li> I love the aloe for a sunburn. It really helps it to feel good and get rid of the pain. I would tell everyone to buy the aloe gel not the lotion.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I have used this Gel for years. Nothing like it. It works great, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as the critics say.  Too much alcohol content still caused my skin to itch and become chaffe.  CVS 100% Aloe Vera gel did far better than the name brand Banana Boat. Will have to return and explore another product.</li>
    <li> Number 2 ingredient is alcohol - my 4-year-old son started screaming for 10 minutes straight after using this gel.  He did not stop until I gave him a bath and got it off of his skin.</li>
    <li> No additional comment</li>
    <li> Banana Boat aloe vera gel s the best of all the green goos.  No alcohol smell.  Not oily. Great healing of damaged skin. Even makes great hair gel.</li>
    <li> Aloe gel that has alcohol as an ingredient is not good for sunburns. It may feel cooling while it&#x27;s evaporating but it dries your skin. Find an alcohol-free aloe gel.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a lady that I learned was 45 years old (but looked easily 30)told me that she had been using this for years on her face as her only beauty treatment. I figured I could easily afford to try it for myself, and after several months I must say WOW! I have noticed the smaller pores on my nose and forehead, but my legs are sooooo soft now. When I shave them, my boyfriend comments every single time about how soft my legs are. He never used to say anything, so I am thrilled that he noticed improvement too!</li>
    <li> i despise this banana boat aloe jell. it itches and burns more then the burn does. why on earth did they put alcohol in it at all? most lotions that have a bottle with a pump use alcohol to make it easier to pump, but this doesn&#x27;t have a pump, and it&#x27;s painful on burns. i dont understand the point of this product. it is anything but soothing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years on my face daily after a shower and I highly recommend it. People ask me why I&#x27;m 52 and have no wrinkles on my face. This BB aloe is part of my secret.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aloe Gel for 20 years as a moisturizer for both face and body (though now my mature facial skin needs some creme on top). I&#x27;ve tried many different brands including organic, but this is my favorite by far. This does not have unpleasant smell, and it is very soothing and moisturizing, neither dry nor sticky. It is also great at alleviating irritation such as mild rash or even bug bites. I guess this will be my skin&#x27;s life time friend.</li>
    <li> not really but sure is nice on bad sun burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aloe feels good&lt;br /&gt;why do i need so many words?</li>
    <li> We use Banana Boat Aloe Gel for all sorts of skin irritations.  It&#x27;s cooling and relieves itchy skin.  It even helps temporarily relieve the itch due to hives.  This is a great product to have in your medicine cabinet all year round.</li>
    <li> I found it works great to relieve itching from hives. I really like the prime shipping, all the local stores were out of stock during the off season.</li>
    <li> I use this green goop whenever I get too much sun and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> got this for just in case, got sunburned working in yard, oops. it works great even tho I wasn&#x27;t planning to use so soon</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible! I got a sunburn a couple days ago and it was the usual stingy and red sunburn. I decided to buy some aloe gel to help soothe the pain and keep the skin moisturized so I went with Banana Boat Aloe Vera Sun Burn Relief. I immediately regret buying this after I applied it. There is way too much alcohol and I do not know why this product even exists. The moment I put this on my sun-burned skin, it became intensely itchy and painful. By the time I decided to shower it off, my skin and already absorbed it so I was just sitting there shouting in pain for the next 6 hours. I am not even joking, this stuff is painful and irritating and should not be used EVER if you have a sun burn, even though the label specifically says that it is for sun burn relief.</li>
    <li> Very good lotion, even as a day and night cream</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my mother who has burning on her fee in the summer time.  When apply it soothes and cools it down within minutes.  Great product!</li>
    <li> First, the bottle advertises 100% aloe, but the first two ingredients are water and alcohol. When you first put it on, you almost start to feel better. Then, a couple seconds later, you&#x27;re overcome by an itching sensation so unbearable it&#x27;ll make you want to tear your skin off. I&#x27;d stay away from this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using plain old Eucerin for now in place of this junk. It works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked outside in the elements all my life (farm, construction, oilfield) and no matter how careful you are to prevent sunburn, it happens. I&#x27;ve used this product since I first saw it in the late 1990s(? not sure of the year- but a long time). It relieves the grief of sunburn and has helped me heal quicker for years. Glad to be able to buy a three pack, I can keep some everywhere I might need it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. It has way too much alcohol, feels good at first but it will immediately start drying your skin and cause it to start peeling. I was doing great for a few days with another aloe vera gel, as soon as I started using this my skin started peeling. Extremely painful as well once your skin peels, makes your skin feel like it&#x27;s burning, had to shower to wash it off right away.</li>
    <li> I need some of this for my balls.. Right now!! It&#x27;s better now.. Cupping balls with aloe.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I&#x27;ve used for over 15 years now. I apply it almost daily and sometimes twice a day for maintenance of facial skin. It&#x27;s a great product for sunburn also and has helped me treat many bad burns through the years. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have to say that it&#x27;s a pretty good product. It saves us during the hot summar in north CA.</li>
    <li> As order. Been using this stuff for 20+ years as an after shave lotion and it works great. It&#x27;s also good for after sun exposure as well.</li>
    <li> THE BEST ALOE AROUND&lt;br /&gt;BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS,RUBS IN SMOOTH,NOT GREASY,NO WAITING TO DRESS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this since I was teenager and it always takes the sting away after you get a sunburn and helps to stop peeling.</li>
    <li> I became familiar with Banana Boat Sun Burn Relief in Hawaii. I ordered this product from Amazon. The packaging is excellent. I have been using this gel through the summer after burns, with quick relief and without losing skin. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Water and alcohol are the first two ingredients. Anything with the word &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t till the 5th item. Alcohol is NOT what you want on dry, burned skin. This stuff hurts!</li>
