<li> I have been looking high and low for ... ...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too watery &amp; not too heavy, it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
<li> I often apply lotion right away after a shower or after a serious freshen-up.</li>
<li> almost...as long lasting as Gold Bond, but the price is noticeably cheaper.</li>
<li> If you have dry skin, you&#x27;ll probably find the need to use it daily.</li>
<li> for as long as you sell it ..</li>
<li> There is no need to keep reapplying since both stay on me really long, though I don&#x27;t believe in the 24-hour claim.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like any other regular lotion out there.</li>
<li> Dry skin</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry skin.</li>
<li> I needed something that works well on my dry skin</li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> saves me the trouble of searching different stores for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t want that heavy sticky lotion that takes forever to rub in and ... ultimately NEVER does rub in ..</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even like other Keri lotions.  </li>
<li> For some reason, it began to be very difficult to find the Advanced lotion.</li>
<li> since there are a TON of the heavy lotiopns with heavy scents ... why NOT go for the OPEN MARKET ...</li>
<li> The ONLY negative ..</li>
<li> I have been using Keri products (previously Alfa-Keri) for mor than 45 years.</li>
<li> SO I GOT ON LINE AND FOUND IT, ORDERED IT AND HAD IT IN A FEW DAYS.  </li>
<li> NOT all the heavy, smelly, and takes forever to absorb lotions ...</li>
<li> Use it all year round, and have been using it for about 10 years.  </li>
<li> As usual, Amazon.com came through.</li>
<li> no more</li>
<li> I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND IT IN ANY STORE IN MY AREA</li>
<li> ASIDE FROM BEING HARD TO FIND, THE PRICES IN THE STORES ARE UNBELIEVABLE.</li>
<li> I am having a hard time locadting and purchasing it in retail stores.  </li>
<li> At times, I have a difficult time finding it in stores.  </li>

    <li> I have very dry skin &amp; sensitive, this is the BEST lotion ever especially for your legs in the summer after you shave. It&#x27;s not too watery &amp; not too heavy, it&#x27;s just right.  But care be hard to find in the stores, so glad for the monthly subscription.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is smooth and lightweight and it smells so good!  I wish I could find a soap with this same scent.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> As advertised, Prompt Shipment</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion is the best I have found for it.  I am having a hard time locadting and purchasing it in retail stores.  Thanks for much for have it available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this particular Keri version for years and years.  For whatever reason, I can&#x27;t find it at Walmart anymore, so I turned to Amazon.  It is a bit more expensive, but I was so happy to find it I bought three.  This lotion is the best lotion I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t even like other Keri lotions.  I like this non-greasy stuff, it is very, very smooth, absorbs instantly, has just a very slight scent.</li>
    <li> I rated this so highly because I could not find this particular lotion in the any of the stores that I had been in such as Rite Aid, WalMart, CVS or Walgreens.  I had been all over looking for this particular lotion.  When I saw it on Amazon, I was delighted.  I liked the promptness of the delivery of my order which was a couple days.  It was packaged well.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for this particular lotion.  This is the second time that this lotion has been non-existent in the stores.  I will be ordering from Amazon from now on which saves me the trouble of searching different stores for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION.  NO OTHER LOTIONS MAKE MY HANDS FEEL SO SOFT AND IT SMELLS GOOD TO. A GIRL AT WORK BROUGHT A BOTTLE IN AND LET ME TRY SOME AND I LOVED IT.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND IT IN ANY STORE IN MY AREA SO I GOT ON LINE AND FOUND IT, ORDERED IT AND HAD IT IN A FEW DAYS.  I TYPE ALOT AT WORK AND USE TOUCH TONE SCREENS FOR TELEPHONES AND RADIOS SO I NEED TO KEEP MY FINGERS MOIST BUT NOT GREASY AND THAT IS JUST WHAT KERI LOTION DOES.  GREAT STUFF!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS LOTION KEEPS YOU SKIN VERY SOFT AND SUPPLE.  I LIKE IT A LOT AND RECOMMEND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN TO USE IT.</li>
    <li> It soaks in really well and has a pleasant baby-lotion sent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  My mother has used it for years, and I only recently started using it.  If you have dry skin, you&#x27;ll probably find the need to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I still use it and after all I know what&#x27;s best for my leg&#x27;s ! Dry skin no more plus they fill smoother then ever before. Two weeks three weeks now going on forth week . I think I&#x27;ll shave . Hey for me it&#x27;s a no brainer Keri for soft skinn that last I use Keri..gg</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I used to use and LOVE Neutrogena fast absorbing lotion .... but unfortunately they stopped selling the product ... and it as GREAT !!! ... welll after a lot of research, I found KERI fast absorbting lotion and it is GREAT TOO !!!! .. so thank you for offering the same great lotion (fast absorbing) lotion ...

I think you&#x27;d make a TON of money since there is NO competitors filling this NICHE MARKET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY ... I LOVE your KERI fast absorbing lotion .... but it would be even better FRAGRANCE FREE .. and my entire family would love it too</li>
    <li> Best lotion out there for dry skin!  Use it all year round, and have been using it for about 10 years.  At times, I have a difficult time finding it in stores.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. This is the second best for my skin type, the first is Gold Bond with Aloe. Both brands do not clog up my pores, especially on my face. I often apply lotion right away after a shower or after a serious freshen-up. There is no need to keep reapplying since both stay on me really long, though I don&#x27;t believe in the 24-hour claim. Great absorption, though Keri seems to absorb too quickly that you end up feeling like rubbing skin to skin only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is almost...almost...as long lasting as Gold Bond, but the price is noticeably cheaper. I always look for sale on these two brands when I&#x27;m shopping for lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using Keri products (previously Alfa-Keri) for mor than 45 years. The original lotion felt thick and took longer to be absorbed. The &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; lotion goes on smoothly and is absorbed very quickly. For some reason, it began to be very difficult to find the Advanced lotion. As usual, Amazon.com came through.</li>
    <li> Good smell nice scent can complain at all.. I needed something that works well on my dry skin and this did the job...</li>
    <li> If you have super oily skin or dry skin this the lotion to buy. It claims to be non-greasy and yet extra moisturizing and IT IS!! this is my holy grail lotion and is also great for mixing with shimmers.</li>
    <li> The best lotion there is on the market for daily use for dry skin</li>
    <li> This has always been recommended by my dermatologist and it has always worked well.The whole family use this at home.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, local stores don&#x27;t stock it . Glad to know I can get at amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I specifically rated 2 stars because it&#x27;s not what everyone claims.  Reviews were so ecstatic they it was not greasy, but it is in fact greasy.  It&#x27;s like any other regular lotion out there.</li>
    <li> I WAS SO GLAD TO FIND THIS OLD STAND BY. ASIDE FROM BEING HARD TO FIND, THE PRICES IN THE STORES ARE UNBELIEVABLE.</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
