<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use the shampoo, conditioner and the scalp cream.  It&#x27;s early yet in the course of use, but the thin area I was concerned about really seems thicker and is not as see-through.  My hair overall seems healthier as does my scalp.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Need more time to see what long term results are. Head feels like it is tingling after application. Feels like blood flow is better.</li>
    <li> unfortunately for me it did not work</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells good, makes my hair very smooth. Can&#x27;t tell if it can stop my hair loss yet only used couple times.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen improvement in my hair loss :(</li>
    <li> Feels good, but I still needs time to prove it&#x27;s effect.</li>
    <li> A quality formula.  My scalp feels healthier than ever in 50 yrs or so.  Hair seems healthier and its hard to quantify but seems a small bit thicker on top feont which I was hoping for.  Male forehead trouble.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t write reviews, however I felt I should write one for this. I am using this shampoo for almost 4 months now, initially it felt good. However the more I am using it, it is making my hair very dry and dull. I have thin hair in front, however my hair was always very shiny and soft. Now it looks dull and moreover I am getting pimple like rashes on head which hurts. I ordered the last bottle few days back, which I am not returning back for the hassle, however I am not going to order anymore. Please do not go by the initial success stories, you might see different result in long run.</li>
    <li> I have let my bf&#x27;s sister test this out (along with the conditioner) for her hair. Her hair is damaged from all the &#x27;relaxer&#x27; she&#x27;s been using on her hair. She has very fragile, dry, thin hair and lately, she&#x27;s experiencing hair loss. When I saw that Rx 4 Hair Loss was promoting their hair loss shampoo and conditioner, I thought, hey this is what she needs for her hair since it has no sulphates, no parabens, no toxins and no harsh chemicals. I mean, it wouldn&#x27;t damage her hair and the ingredients are all natural and organic, so that means no serious side effects. Well, she has been using this for almost a month and her hair is so much better than before. Note that this is not going to work overnight and people are different, Jane Doe might see results in a month, but John Doe might see it in two months, so don&#x27;t get discouraged if it takes a little bit longer for you to see result on your hair. It&#x27;s been almost a month and her hair loss has decreased dramatically; hopefully, it keeps improving. Her hair is also not dry and it no longer looks dull nor lifeless. Give it another couple of months and her hair will be fully restored. Overall, she&#x27;s very happy with the results she has gotten from the Rx 4 hair loss system (shampoo and conditioner).  I got this for a great deal for reviewing and testing purposes and I have witnessed my bf&#x27;s sister gets good result from the Rx 4 Hair Loss system, therefore I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am ordering for the second time, as I am noticing less hair loss when shampooing and not noticing loss at other times.  Maybe, maybe it is working.  I used to have very thick hair and the thinning problem has started now that I am in my senior years.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have some of the harmful ingredients of other shampoos.  Hopefully, I can give it a five star rating when I start getting hair regrowth.  :)  Also, no offensive smell.</li>
    <li> This product came opened and a quarter of the ingredients spilled in the box. I was reluctant to try it, however the manufacturer offered to send a replacement only in the USA which was disappointing considering I live overseas.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff! I also love the way it feels in my hair. The conditioner is not very thick but it still makes my hair easy to comb in the shower. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s helping because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks. Every time I wash my hair it gets thinner &amp; thinner so I try to only wash it every 3rd day or so. I will write another review after I&#x27;ve been using it for another month or so to give feedback on my results. I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars at this point because I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s slowing my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am ordering my 4th bottle today, and for the 1st time the Scalp Cream. I have had great results with RX4 Shampoo! I used both Nioxin and Bosley for years and always had a red itchy scalp and no real results. I love the fact that RX4 has no harsh chemicals and is an organic blend so my hair feels so much healthier, and I no longer have the scalp irritation. My hair is definitely fuller and grows faster. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other product! My hair stylist agrees!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND 60+YEARS OLD. HE USE THIS SHAMPOO FEEL IT HELP HE NOT LOSE A LOT HAIR. HE LIKE IT. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> i like this product, i have definitely noticed less hair on my brush after a shower</li>
    <li> Good smell. Feel refresh after wash my hair. Will keep using it</li>
    <li> &#x27;m on my second bottle and the shampoo works great!!  I like the manageability of my hair and the fact RX-4 lacks harsh chemicals and is made from natural ingredients.  Lastly, I had a mild hair thinning in the front top.  This shampoo seems to have reversed that problem.  I defiantly notice a fuller appearance and the start of new hair growth.</li>
    <li> No results for it&#x27;s use so far..using another product instead..</li>
    <li> Edit: I think I&#x27;ve been using it for two year at this point. Hair is very full. I constantly have new hair growth.  Also, my new barber told me I have great hair so I guess it&#x27;s the shampoo and probably some GNC nourish hair that I take.   It&#x27;s been about 5 months since  I used it and I have noticed hairs along my hairline growing in. They are about a half inch long and somewhat thinner than the rest of my hair, but they are noticeable. I&#x27;m sure they will grow thicker with time.</li>
    <li> I use in combination with conditioner and scalp cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You achieve the same results of  shampooing and conditioning which is clean and softened hair, but this product improves the texture of my hair significantly and soothes my scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been using for a very long time, but so far happy with the results, my hair does feel soft but very healthy and on its way to fullness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got the opportunity to test these products knowing the issues I&#x27;ve been having with hair loss due to rapid weight gain and thinning hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all... Money back guaranteed huh</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
    <li> Since using this product for my thinning hair loss problem I notice that my hair is not falling out like it use to months ago. It leave my hair super clean.</li>
    <li> I had to quit using it. My hair started falling out even more. Sorry!</li>
    <li> Using three times a week prior to applying scalp cream. Satisfied with results so far.</li>
    <li> this is nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; must have</li>
    <li> Been using the shampoo almost daily for about 8 days and enjoy the latter and fragrance. Fragrances of all kinds bother me greatly, this does not. Hair and scalp feel nice and clean and if nothing else, this is a positive effect. I will update as I see the effect it has on my hair loss.  Comment about the  company service I give them 5 stars as well. They contact to make sure you have received the product and if you need help with anything.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo my scalp feels wonderful and my hair smells beautiful..  Thank you so much for this product...and the best thing is my hair loss has almost stopped!</li>
    <li> Great product just love the way it smells and now hair stopped falling as it was before... Use with Conditioner... Just Love it....</li>
    <li> Too early to tell yet. Shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much at all, but it does seem to be reducing the amount of hair in the drain every day.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shampoo, along with the conditioner and the scalp treatment. The texture of my hair has improved and it feels thicker and healthier after one month!  The ingredients are pronounceable, plant based and smell beautiful!  I have used other products and hair loss systems in the past that added volume but made my hair look dry, sticky and felt like a doll&#x27;s &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;...for 10 times the cost!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a week and a half now. I also used the Rx conditioner and my hair has considerably less breakage and not shedding like I have been for months. I am feeling very optimistic about this and the ONLY thing that has worked for my hair so far. Would definitely recommend for another. I personally have thyroid problems and even with my levels in range have still had hair loss. Really grateful for finding this product. I found the more you lather it in the scalp the better it works. People around me have even given compliments on how much better and fuller my hair looks and I am feeling growth coming back where it hasn&#x27;t grown in years!</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t pleasant.  Doesn&#x27;t lather well.  Have only used the product one time, will probably be returning.</li>
    <li> HI,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended by a friend to try this because I have an itchy scalp.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now and the itchy scalp is better and I also notice my hair is feeling thicker too. It feels good when I wash my hair as well. Totally satisfied.JVH</li>
    <li> Not so sure this product is really making any difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the conditioner for about three months now.  I am delighted with the results.  My hair seems to be thicker, almost fuller.  I have not noticed any new growth but my existing hair seems to be growing faster.  I like the fact that neither product has no purfume smell but instead a fresh, light fragrance to it. It may not be a miracle hair grower but it sure delivers what it advertises.  I will be reordering another 3-6 months supply and will be sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 1 month-I do feel my hair is better since I have starting using this product-I will continue to use &amp; buy this product</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  Advice for anyone when using products without the sulfates and other mess in shampoos and conditioners, rinse your hair with cool water just like they do at salons.  One of the reasons they do this is so make sure none of the chemicals/Big name brand shampoo and conditioner will have a bad reaction with products you have saturated into your hair and scalp ex. hairspray, gels, pomades, ...  Cool water, lukewarm and then cool water again pending on how much product and how often you wash your hair will determine if you need to do this for 3 min each or 5min of cool water(3or 5min) -lukewarm(3 or 5min)- cool water again.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Really made a difference in loss of hair.  Watch your medication levels too!</li>
    <li> Product seems to be helping my wife&#x27;s hair. She is not loosing as when she washes her hair!</li>
    <li> Prior to trying this shampoo I was using rogain foam, but I stopped using it because a read a bunch of negative side effects due to all the chemicals it has. I also noticed how rogaine tells you to keep it away from women and children but it takes hours for it to dry. I have a 1 year old daghter who is very attached to me and tends to pull my hair once in awhile. That&#x27;s why I diceded to go with something made with organic products and no chemicals so I don&#x27;t have to keep my girls away. It may not promote hair growth as fast as rogaine foam but it stops DHT, which opens up the pores allowing your hair to regrow again in a more natural form.</li>
    <li> This is the first time trying any shampoo for hair loss.  It took about a week of every day use to notice a difference in how much hair I was losing in the shower.  You only need a little bit----a little goes a long way.  I made sure I left it on my scalp for the full 5 minutes.  It has a great smell and made my hair feel very clean.  Although I did see a difference using this product, I am still not completely satisfied that my folicals are producing new hair.  So off to the hormone specialist I go to see what they have to say.  Who knows, they might say the shampoo is working great and to keep using it.  I will let you know.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and am balding. I have nothing to say but good news for me with RX4 Hair Loss Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t LOST any more hair and I have VERY noticeable VOLUME to my hair; much fuller to the eye.  I was initially attracted to these products because of the beautiful packaging. I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good for volume, but the jury is still out as to it will really help regrow hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Clean hair naturally, no build-up or unwanted sents.&lt;br /&gt;Keep scalp hydrated....</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t great,it was too strong for my hair bought a second shampoo to keep trying and didn&#x27;t work with my hair,if you will kindly take the shampoo,conditioner and hair cream and refund my money back,i will be so grateful,you should refund the customers money back when it doesn&#x27;t work with their hair,it a shampoo.need my money back</li>
    <li> See review on conditioner- fantastic product. LOVE the smell. I love this product so much already I bought 2 more bottles of the shampoo to have on hand. So far so GREAT!. Much less shedding/hair loss. UPDATE ON 07/07/15- AMAZING product, little to no shedding :D Highly recommend..  10 stars for product and seller</li>
    <li> Terrible. Does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product is recognized to be effective but it brought negative results for me. I used this product on the sides of my forehead area which is badly affected by the loss of hair. It did not turn out in the expected way yet, it brought this bad allergy to my skin and a certain eczema is now formed on my forehead as a matter of fact. So i suggest you should not purchase this product. The actual results which are expected from this product are very much of higher standards where the given results are concerned. Rather than forming new hair on the sides of my forehead, It weakened the remaining few hair on the sides and as a matter of fact i even loose the rest of the hair on the sides of my forehead. I strongly recommend not to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair much more manageable then the previous product I used.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use seems to promote waves in my hair that are not accomplished by curlers of&lt;br /&gt;any type.  I am very satisfied with this product altho it is quite pricey.</li>
    <li> Was noticing thinning hair on the top of my head, for a couple of years, I tried Rogain, and saw no improvement after 8 months, also took Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;Just happened to see this here on Amazon and thought I would order it. It really does WORK!! I love this stuff! it says to use 4 times per week, I use it as my daily shampoo and have had great results, not only do I have new growth on my hairline but also can no longer see my scalp, and my hair grows much quicker. I am on my third bottle. My only complaint is that the bottles are quite small, and my hair is slighty drier so I use a deep conditioner 2x a week,</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo for my husband. He likes it very much. It has a nice natural fragrance and cleans his head and hair very well. As far as hair growing back, we haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair yet.</li>
    <li> I had a child about 4 months ago and recently I have been losing my hair, which is common around this time postpartum. This is my 5th child and I had never experienced this symptom and was mortified when it started to happen. I was losing so much hair that the sides of my head where my hair is parted was getting small bald spots. Something had to be done!! So when I was offered this hair loss shampoo to purchase and review during a promotional period I jumped on it! The shampoo comes in a nice brown professional looking bottle and it smell really good! Awesomely enough there are no sulfates or parabens so that made me extremely happy! I noticed less fallout after a week of using the shampoo. I also purchased the conditioner so them together truly make a difference! I am happy with the results I have so far and will continue to use it until I achieve my desired results!! * I purchased this item to review during a promotional period and any opinions expressed are my own**</li>
    <li> So I started using this shampoo about a month ago, at first I didn&#x27;t like the smell and the texture felt like honey. The bottle is too small and I wish they had a bigger bottle. My hair is very thin and fragile. I am not sure if the shampoo is working for me since my hair still keeps falling.  I have learned that the honey texture actually makes my hair feel fuller, my hair looks healthier and my hair doesn’t look dry any more. I will purchase a new bottle and hoping it will work for me.  Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to regrow my hair post chemo and it still seems to be falling out some.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a short time but I have noticed a decrease in the amount of hair that is falling out.  This is such a wonderful thing as I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about my hair ever since I lost it all.  I would love if they had this product in a color safe line as well since I dye my hair from time to time. I purchased this product at a promotional rate for review purposes.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is already working.  My hair seems fuller with less hair loss.  I also like the way it smells and that&lt;br /&gt;its made of natural and organic products.  I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad a friend told me about this shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;m so happy with the results.  My hair looks and feels fuller and healthier already.  It smells so fresh and clean.  I&#x27;m very careful about what I put on my hair and skin so I read the ingredients and they really are all natural which made me feel very confident about using this product on my hair.</li>
    <li> Someone I met recommended this shampoo and I have been  more than satisfied with it.  It seems to be working and gives my hair a different feel.  Was not completely happy with the packaging as it came in a box open at the ends and not taped shut.  Since it came with the conditioner only one was in a prepackaged bag while the other was loose in the package.  But the shipping was timely if not well packaged.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ive used 2 bottles and have no signs of improvement.  The stuff does smell wonderful though.</li>
    <li> I like that this shampoo is almost unscented.  It is pretty expensive for the amount you get, especially since results likely won&#x27;t show for at least a month. I have curly hair and this doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it out as much as other therapeutic shampoos - I have yet to find one that doesn&#x27;t dry it regardless of what they claim.  So I&#x27;m giving this only 3 stars until I&#x27;ve used it for a month. If I see results, I will update the rating accordingly.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s much to like about this shampoo.  It suds up beautifully so it&#x27;s easy to massage it onto the scalp. Along with the shampoo and conditioner I use a Shampoo Scalp Massage Brush bought here on Amazon to help stimulate the hair follicles and wake up some brain cells.  I also find it easy to rinse both out  the shampoo and the conditioner, leaving my hair feeling squeaky clean. It leaves my hair looking fuller and healthier.  I do have a little hair regrowth, am taking biotin and Pantothenic Acid to help along the way.  I agree that this isn&#x27;t something that will happen overnight but feel good that this shampoo and conditioner has no harmful ingredients which is a huge plus.  Good luck to us all, we deserve it :)</li>
    <li> I have only used the product a couple times as I just received it last week. I realy like the scent of it, and you really only use a little tab. It has already made my hair feel fuller and more body so even that is an improvement in just a couple uses.It takes a little getting used to in regards to it really doesn&#x27;t lather like normal shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy so I am sure it is cleaning it.</li>
    <li> We love the smell of the shampoo! We have used the shampoo for 3 weeks &amp; have noticed improved health of our scalp. Thanks go out to the developers of the product!</li>
    <li> I am giving it a 3 start because this product leaves my hair really super dry. I have to use conditioner each time.</li>
    <li> Very overpriced product and doesn&#x27;t work!  My hair has never looked worse, it&#x27;s greasy and flat. I like the smell and that&#x27;s about it.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Shampoo smells great. Has a nice citrus lemongrass smell. I have been using it for a month now and even though I can&#x27;t say it helps grow more hair it definitely decreased the amount of hair I lose everyday as can be seen by the stray hairs found on my pillow and sink every morning</li>
    <li> Smell good and after applying that my hair condition rally become better!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this a little over a week and I will have to use it longer to see hair growth but I have already had a HUGE decrease in the amount of hair I have losing my hair is healthier and no longer dry and lifeless.and best of all it&#x27;s natural.I will definitely be ordering more as I can&#x27;t believe the difference a week made!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo (and conditioner) for several weeks now and absolutely love it! Love the scent and that it leaves my hair squeaky clean, but mostly the big reduction of hair \\&quot;fallout\\&quot; that I usually get in the shower. This shampoo has none of the nasty chemicals that are found in most other shampoos, another plus for me! I would recommend this shampoo without hesitation.  I love the conditioner as well...it&#x27;s light fresh scent and it never leaves a heavy residue on my hair. This shampoo and conditioner is fabulous! Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser, one of my clients first told me about this product about a year ago. When I recently did her hair I was surprised to see a huge difference in the quality of her hair. It normally was brittle and would not grow long or thick.. Now I see long thick and healthy hair. I&#x27;m recommending this product over the national brands to my many clients now. I&#x27;m excited to be using it myself .</li>
    <li> One of the best products on Amazon.  I have always had thinner hair (my hair dresser will tell you) and since using this shampoo the last 6 months my hair is thicker and easier to manage. I recommend using it as directed for the maximum results.  I also have to say that I had a few questions for the seller Michelle and was in contact her quite a bit and she was extremely helpful and professional in all manner.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few months ago when it was first listed on amazon. I purchased both the shampoo and the coordinating conditioner, and I LOVE them. I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in the 3-4 months I&#x27;ve used it. My hair loss is down to what seems like absolute minimum. Less in my brush AND my shower drain (yuck!). And my hair is the longest and fullest it&#x27;s been in forever. I love that it&#x27;s all organic (no counterproductive, nasty chemicals). The shampoo works into a rich, luxurious lather, and conditioner leaves my hair silky soft to touch. The smell is a bit medicine-e but SO worth it for the end result, and mostly rinses out with product. Shipping was fast, as well. I will definitely order again :)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner line. I started to use the about 3 months back when I started to notice that my hair was beginning to thin and fall out in the shower. It didn&#x27;t take very long before my hair started to feel healthier/stronger and fuller. I immediately noticed that over time less hair would to the shower floor. If you are in need of a shampoo and conditioner system to help strengthen and stop hair loss, you must try this one!</li>
    <li> I was pretty impressed with this shampoo and conditioner overall. As a younger dude dealing with thinning hair it can be a pain finding a relatively affordable product that actually works while combating the ever growing bald spot. This stuff smells nice and has a good consistency that washes out easily.  After a few months I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t think my hair loss has gotten any worse, I believe this has really slowed it down and has strengthened the hair that I have. The whole DHT blocker really must have something to it, because my hair just feels and looks better after using this. I&#x27;m pretty loyal when I find a product that works and I&#x27;m really impressed with the natural ingredients. I prefer something like this over dumping strange chemicals onto my scalp! If you are shopping around weighing your options, I can safely say this is worth trying. This is a good product-</li>
    <li> Ok I guess, still to early to see any results.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my hair.  It gave my hair a weird, greasy texture.</li>
    <li> Love this natural shampoo. My hair is thin and sheds easily and this is the only shampoo that works for my hair. It didn&#x27;t dry it out or anything. It made it stronger, healthier, and brings out my natural waves more. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have been regularly using RX4 hair loss shampoo (and conditioner) for 7 months now, for the sole purpose of reversing a clearly marked  male pattern baldness.    At the beginning I didn&#x27;t have much confidence in the products because I have not seen other reviewers with same problem as mine. I decided to give this product a try given that its natural and no risk or side effects associated with it.    VERDICT: After seven months of usage I have REGROWN hair in the balded area. Still the regrown hair is  thinner than the surrounding hair. I am very happy with the hair regrowth and hope to have fully recovered the thickness in about a year of usage given the current progress. My wife also loves the shampoo and conditioner. I should also mention that I loved the customer support of RX4</li>
    <li> Great product - have been using it for over two weeks now. Haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth yet as it may take at least a month or 2, but this shampoo leaves my hair so clean and smooth. I also do feel the tingling sensation I like when I apply it.</li>
    <li> It dries your hair and doesn&#x27;t prevent hair loss. I even have more hair loss.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this shampoo and see if it would add the fullness back into my hair that I&#x27;ve lost over the past year or so. I&#x27;ve also noticed a receding hairline and was hoping to at least see some new growth with this product - but I have not. I will say that as a shampoo, it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the product about a month ago and have been using it as directed, 4-5x a week. I have also found that it requires subsequent washes per shower/bath. With the first shampoo it lacks the foam/bubbly effect that normal shampoos have. Once you rinse out the first wash and apply again, there&#x27;s a rich foam and tingly feeling from the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this produced zero results in terms of hair regeneration or fullness, but I will continue to use it as a regular shampoo until I have to move to a product with real, proven results on blocking DHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to regrow hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. If you&#x27;re just looking for a great, all-natural shampoo, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Used according to instructions, I had less hair fall but made my hair like straw and very limp. Not full looking at all. Still looking for an effective product for &amp;#34;hereditary&amp;#34; female hair loss.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if less hair falling out! No change yet but will take at least 3 months to notice</li>
    <li> I am a 37 year old woman that used to have a head full of thick curly italian hair. I started losing it significantly maybe five years ago.  Thank god I started with so much to start with!  I bought this product after buying Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo and returning it because it was horrible.  I like this shampoo and I have had a SIGNIFICANT decrease in hair shedding since I started it.  In fact, I noticed less hair falling out in the shower on the second use and it&#x27;s consistently remained minimal.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed because before anytime I touched my hair one or two strands would fall out. It was incredibly disconcerting and at times embarrassing. I&#x27;m not used to using shampoos with no sulfate so I do feel like there is some residue on my hair and scalp which is kind of annoying but if it keeps me from losing hair and potentially regrowing some of what I lost, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Since I have received your shampoo and conditioner, my hair has been more manageable and feels and looks much thicker. The scent is wonderful as it smells very fresh and clean. Thank you so much for these products as they are definitely worth the money. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Started using this and the accompanying conditioner approx 6 months ago. I&#x27;ve noticed considerable improvement in the strength of my hair, as well as much less fall out. I use it every day! I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its o.k. but too thick....  there are many other shampoos for less money that do the same thing</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because I have only used it several times and I am not certain it works to prevent hair loss just yet. I will update my review once I use it for longer. Hope it works.</li>
    <li> love this, it really helps</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great so far. I received it as gift (a not so subtle hint) because of the hair I left in the tub after a shower. I have had issues with my hair with thinning and evidently falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within about 6 weeks of using this shampoo everyday my hair falling out had essentially stopped. My hair definitely feels thicker and I need my hair cut more often. I will be ordering Rx 4 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, this stuff smells good, lathers up nice and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from hair loss and he tried the chemical ones in the past with no results, but he was willing to try this one.  He has not been a fan of the shampoos I have bought him, but he loves this one.  Not sure about the hair growth (I need to take another after photo to see), but he really likes the way this shampoo makes his scalp and hair feel.  This is the 3rd bottle I&#x27;ve bought...I figure if he finally likes something I&#x27;ll stick with it!</li>
    <li> Review of Coastline Enterprises Customer Service - My rating of Amazon&#x27;s response to my complaint stands, but I want to clarify that the original one star rating was NOT about the product or about the seller. In fact, I was contacted immediately by the seller who was extremely helpful and clearly all about customer service. I haven&#x27;t used the product itself long enough to give a fair review, but if it is even half as good as the customer service I received, it will get five stars plus a huge thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review of package - I received this order yesterday, and I only received part of the contents. About a third of it leaked all over the inside of the carton because the cap was loose and the seal broken. The conditioner that came with it was ok, but the shampoo is not. At $25 a bottle, I estimate the loss of product at about $7. Unfortunately, my only alternative is to return the bottle for a refund. That leaves me with the conditioner and no shampoo. Why not offer to send a replacement bottle without asking me to return the one that leaked? What kind of customer service message are they sending? This was clearly something the packer should have seen, or possibly even caused. I&#x27;ve been ordering from Amazon for over ten years, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen such shoddy service and poor response. I&#x27;m rethinking my purchase habits.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just about 1 month and my hair loss has not improved.  I am sad because I thought it would work based on the reviews.  I</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and creme and have used it for 1 week. For years I have tried to find a hair thickening shampoo that works.  None did.  I also have been trying natural shampoos and every one has been awful.  It is a fine line between too much conditioning and not enough for fine, thin hair.  I was reluctant to try this product but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  Of course it is way too early to tell if it will regrow my hair but in the meantime I am blown away by how bouncy and fluffy my hair looks.  It is squeaky clean yet so well conditioned.  Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used!  I will continue to buy it whether it regrows my hair or not.  I love it and am so happy it is not a cancer causing chemical brew like most shampoos!</li>
    <li> I have been using it since Nov 22/14 and I can see less hair lost when I finish taking a shower. So far, it is working</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Loved it after first use.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were skeptical of this product at first but it was the only one we came across with a guarantee so we thought we&#x27;d try it out. OMG his hair has stopped receding  and actually looks fuller! We are both so happy with this product and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Using it for 4 weeks now and yet my hair is the same.</li>
    <li> I can not use often as like direction that make hair too dry. So I just as like normal shampoo and I can wash about one or two time per week if I wash more than that my hair so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and really like it. I thought the only shampoo I could use and have my hair turn out nice was WEN but this has the same affect on my hair. I take a med that is very harsh on my hair and it has changed it . Used to have healthy beautiful hair and now not so. The meds have caused hair loss and my hair lacks shine and body. The WEN was the only shampoo I could use and not have frizzies or dried out hair. This product seems to be the same and now I will have to see if it helps with new growth and repair. So far I love it!</li>
    <li> I do have to say that I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve tried for years to find something that would slow down my hair loss. This shampoo combined with the conditioner and scalp cream have slowed my hair loss down remarkably.  Still a little shedding after shampooing, but nothing like it used to be.  No new growth yet, but it has only been two months.  I will be patient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has EXCELLENT customer service and will take care of any problem you may have with the product.  I definitely recommend that you purchase from them if you are looking for a quality product that will help with your hair loss.</li>
    <li> I am perimenopausal and my hair is thinning out. I have only used this product twice...The first wash I didnt lose much hair but after using it a second time 2 days later, twice as much hair fell out when combing it. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because my hair got thicker and I have very fine hair. UPDATE: I  have used the whole bottle to see if my hair would improve but it continued to shed more, not to mention how dried out it became. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and always had very fine brittle hair, the situation worsened in the past couple of years, I have thinning spots on my temples now. Well I knew I shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles right away. I used this shampoo together with a conditioner every other day for two months. As a result I got a massive hair loss, that even my friends noticed. Now it is hard to hide just one track of clip-in extensions, thats how bad it is. My hair got dry and straw-like. In addition both shampoo and conditioner produces very little lather. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product two stars is because the customer service was really great... Now I&#x27;m trying to restore my hair back. I simply bought a six-dollar sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner from the pharmacy and added organic raw shea butter to it. And already my hair feels better, no more dryness and the hair loss reduced dramatically and it is a lot more manageable. Overall I definitely do not recommend this product and do not buy in all the fake positive reviews</li>
    <li> Excellent product. They always do a follow up with their customers. And I was able to get it on sale this time. I will continue to order from you for this product. Really does the job.</li>
    <li> So far has SAVED my hair !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not work overnight, but after about 4 months use I see my hair is stronger, falling out less, and starting to grow back. I have tried several other hair shampoos and pills and nothing comes close to this product. If you don&#x27;t believe me than don&#x27;t buy it and good luck in finding another product that works.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any solid results yeti be been using it for about two months now.notice a little bit of growth</li>
    <li> This shampoo is better than other from drug stores etc.  My hair loss seems to have diminished, but there is still some loss.  Also, this shampoo has caused my scalp to itch.  That is the only downside.  At least this shampoo does not contain sulfates and other bad ingredients.</li>
    <li> This was one out of dozens of shampoos I have tried to help thinning hair, and its actually one of the shampoos that did make a positive difference. I don&#x27;t have the same hair I had 20 years ago, but it does help thicken up the hair and minimize the thinning look. I assume that I will need to use this for 3-6 months before I could say if it prevents and cures any hair loss for me, but my iniial reaction is positive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks and have noticed (after some time) a decrease in hair loss.  MUCH fewer hairs in my comb after shampooing. The product itself also makes my existing hair have additional volume.  I have re-ordered!</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner as directed. I noticed an improvement in volume and texture, and manageability, right away. Less hair falling out too. I only wish the bottle was bigger so I had more. Buying again...</li>
    <li> All natural feel.  Foams great! Use just a little and it will foam nicely.  I wash , rinse, then wash again every day. It foams much more the second time. Works best with the conditioner too.  Took at least 4-5 weeks of using both the shampoo and the conditioner for me to start seeing results.  Be patient and diligent!</li>
    <li> Hair did not grow back. It left my hair dry and worse looking than before. I think I even lost more while using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m six shampoos in and am amazed by the changes in my hair. Ive gone from fear of shampooing because of the very scary hair loss where the more you rinse the more hair comes out.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely do an update at 30 and 90 days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner and cream.&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared this is not like most shampoos.  It&#x27;s thick but no heavy lather which is a good thing but may take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after I ordered I received an email from the company which was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing is to follow the directions and be prepared to shampoo and condition at least 5x per week. I know that may seem scary but even after the first shampoo I noticed just enough of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The real surprise was how my hair looked after drying - almost like I&#x27;d gotten a blowout.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the cream at night and shampooing in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love this. Being over 60 and my hair thinning. After a month ,I could see new hair growth . I can now wear my hair longer. Thank you for your product.</li>
    <li> My sister hit her mid 40&#x27;s and complained that she had hair that was thinning. She&#x27;s my half sister so I assumed it was from her other side of the family. Well 10 years later I find that&#x27;s not it at all, it&#x27;s definitely on our mothers side because about a year ago I started to get it too. As a women who has always had thick hair now struggling not to see the roots on top of my head has been a very embarrassing experience. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few months now along with the conditioner and I wouldn&#x27;t say I look 16 again but the hair is definitely coming back in. The thinning on top is much fuller and the roots are much less noticeable. My dry scalp has also subsided with less itching and no flaking. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any results yet.. Will keep using but so far seems like my scalp eczema got even worse...</li>
    <li> Hey just wanted to say thank you again for your great service, I just left seller feedback, sorry for the delay.  Love your products and I have notice the product quality has improved on the second shipment.  More luxurious that the first shipment.  Have a full head of hair so I hope this will help hair thicken fill in over time.  Is the scalp treatment available yet?  Looking forward to it.  Looks like you have got a good product here and so far so good.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> As a person with fine, light hair, this product has improved my scalp coverage and significantly thickened my hair!  Also, using both the shampoo and conditioner together seems to maximize the benefits.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I searched for something that wasn&#x27;t full of bad chemicals and found this. Other products I tried just seemed to make my scalp get worse. Really like the way this shampoo has been working for me. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and have been using for just few weeks. I notice that my scalp looks and feels better. I also have notices that I don &#x27;t seem to have as much hair in my hair brush as before. It has a good smell not to overpowering. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe my hair is thinning and that it is noticeable to me I never thought that it would happen to me. Needless to say I&#x27;m not happy about it. :) I have been using RX 4 for a week now I really like it-before I ordered it I did a lot of research on line  into the many different products out there that help with hair loss. I even tried a couple really didn&#x27;t care for the results are the smell no I didn&#x27;t.  So far I like RX 4  the smell is very do able it&#x27;s really not over powering it makes my hair soft and fuller. I hope to see results soon so far so good. :)</li>
    <li> This is my first review EVER! I&#x27;m not one to do reviews...but, some of them helped me decide to try this product. So, I thought I&#x27;d write a review to help those of you who are \\&quot;on the fence\\&quot; about ordering. I have only been using this product for almost 2 weeks. You should know I was kinda sceptical, too :) See, I am an instant gratification kinda girl. I like to see results immediately-lol. I actually waited until I got all three products: the shampoo, conditioner and scalp cream. I figured using them all together would work faster than using just the shampoo...and, it did!    I&#x27;ve always had thin &amp; fine hair. However, the reason I bought this system is that I recently went through a death in my family...and was having a hard time dealing. I think the depression &amp; not taking care of myself for several weeks after caused my hair to really thin and start falling out :( I have to admit...this product line has truly been a blessing! Within the 11 days I&#x27;ve been using the entire system, I have not only seen new growth, but my hair looks and feels thicker than it ever has before-YAY!. It&#x27;s crazy!!! I reallly noticed it when I pull my hair back in a ponytail...I didn&#x27;t have to wrap the pontytail holder around my hair as many times as I had before-COOL! I also have a lot of body...it&#x27;s AWESOME!!!    You also should know...the customer service is AMAZING! They are there for you anytime you need help. It blew me away! I had been putting the scalp cream on at night and noticed that my hair was kinda greasy in the morning...so they emailed me right back (within the day) to suggest trying putting it on at night, before bed, and then washing my hair in the morning. Worked like a charm!    I know this product line is kinda pricey, but (in my opinion) it is worth it. You do not use nearly the same amount as you&#x27;d use of any other shampoo and conditioner. They do suggest shampooing twice before conditioning...and I still use less shampoo. I have LONG hair (it&#x27;s like 1/2 way down myback)...and I only use about a dime-nickel size squirt. So, that lets me know that it&#x27;ll last a while-woo hoo! I do have to say, I usually don&#x27;t get suds until the 2nd time I wash, but that didn&#x27;t bother me. Oooh...oooh...I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less breakage. Before I started using this line, I made sure my brush was clean (no hair in it)...and there&#x27;s not much in it now. I&#x27;m excited to see what my hair will look like after a month of using it.    I know this is a LONG review...but, I hope it helps you :) Good luck &amp; God bless!      UPDATE!!!  I recieved my first order the beginning of July. My first review above was July 24, 2014.  Now...it&#x27;s November...and I&#x27;m just now starting my 2nd bottle of shampoo and conditioner.  Can I just say - wow!  My hair is REALLY long...over half-way down my back.  I used the first set for 4 months.  That&#x27;s pretty AWESOME if you ask me...especially if you wash your hair a lot.  Yes, this product is more expensive than what you&#x27;d buy in a wal-mart or target...but, if you consider how much of the generic stuff you use...I feel, this is a WAY better bargain.  I used to go through like 2 bottles of conditioner per 1 bottle of shampoo.  Not here...I end them almost the same time.  I still have a little left in my 1st shampoo bottle...which is nice.  But, on to the COOL part.  Someone I work with commented on my hair...asking if I had extensions...it looked so thick -woo hoo! :)  It made me smile!lol.  Apparently, it looks as full as it did when I was doing my fitness competition and actually had extensions in for a bit.</li>
    <li> I used both the shampoo and the conditioner together. I had a receding hairline but this brought it back slowly and surely. My hair has been a little dry as of late, and after I used it, it became more fuller and felt thicker like I wanted. It&#x27;s so easy to style now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has grown more, and I really wanted this because I want to try out new hairstyles with long hair. It helped my hair grow quicker, and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a good purchase also because they are natural and organic.</li>
    <li> worst product I ever bought, left my hair feeling like straw.</li>
    <li> smalls good, smooth, easy to use and wash. I would strongly recommend this products!</li>
    <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner.  The shampoo makes my hair tingle.  The conditioner not so much but I don&#x27;t think it was supposed to.  I really love the shampoo so far.  I just tried it and haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I do feel tingling when use it so I think it works by stimulating the hair follicles. Will follow up with my review in  month.  Received it for special promotion pricing so can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
    <li> Finally something that actually works and doesn&#x27;t smell like a batch of chemicals! I had been gifted a bottle and started using it just to try it out.  It lathers nice and smells great, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use something when done to cover the smell.  I have made this my regular shampoo and will buy it here from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the second time ordering this product. The first time was Great so I ordered it again But this time the shampoo was VERY watery it had no consistancy at all I could not leave it on my head to do its thing because it was running down my face and into my eyss.  It seems as if they changed the formula. I will not be ordering this shampooo again</li>
    <li> Gave this as the second part of the gift to my dad and as I stated for the Conditoner... He said that it feels nice when using it. His personal preference isn&#x27;t really fond of the smell... But others may actually like it! Will be updating at a later date when he has had time to fully test out this product and check on results.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> Was a gift to my friends who suffer from hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;The notice referred a friend to listen to heart glad.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is i will hear from him when to leave a review.</li>
    <li> I use shampoo and conditioner together, after i  washed my hair i can tell my hair loss is down. Less in my brush . but the it doesn&#x27;t smell good though.</li>
    <li> Awesome! My dad loves it</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really thick - like honey, and hard to work into my scalp for deep cleaning.  I like the lemony scent.  As for the hair loss, I still have that everyday.  If it&#x27;s less then before I started this product, I haven&#x27;t noticed yet.  Although I just started using this about 2 weeks ago. So time will tell.  I will continue to use this and the conditioner for a month maybe 2 and decide if its worth it after that time.  I do like the conditioner on that it does leave my hair silky soft and tangles work out with ease after towel drying my hair.</li>
    <li> As I get older I started noticing that my hair has began to be thin, year after year, its getting thinner and thinner. So one day I decided to  browse the web looking for products other than Rogaine, because I&#x27;m not bold yet. I wanted to look for a product I could use as a preventive measure and get my hair back thicker and fuller.  I stumbled across RX Hair Loss Shampoo, the shampoo is lite and has a gentle odor.  I tried it for two weeks, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a thickness coming back to my hair, even the small patches that have fallen out are starting to grow in peach fuzz. I will purchase more and continue to use this product, I highly recommend it to anyone who is starting to bald or there  hair is becoming thin. Its a great product and it works!!</li>
    <li> Made my scalp itchy, oily and made me lose even more hair.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if this works for hair loss but it left my hair feeling like the product was still in it and the smell was like Pine sol.  I used it twice and i wont be using it anymore. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> good. my friend like this</li>
    <li> It seems to be working some and my hair was very thin . Get this and the Modern Rapunzel to go in the right direction.</li>
    <li> This product really works. After a short time of using it, I have noticed that my hair hasn&#x27;t been falling out as much as it use to, Its growing thicker and stronger than ever before. I&#x27;m finally being able to get rid of my bald spot that has been bothering me for years. It delivers quick and definitely worth the price. A must have in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Together with their scalp cream, it has stopped my wife&#x27;s hair from falling out! Great!</li>
    <li> Expensive for the size of the bottle.  It did stop my head form itching, not sure about the hair loss.</li>
    <li> As of right now I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for about a week.  I must say my hair does have a night and day feel to it.  I have also felt that my scalp does feel a lot more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will updated this review and let you all know how it&#x27;s going. But as of now I&#x27;m feeling very optimistic about it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money!! I never write reviews but this is the worst hair thickening product I&#x27;ve ever used! My hair actually feels thinner using this compared to the cheap shampoo I buy at the store. The bottle is practically travel size and the price is outrageous for the results this product delivers. I do not care for the smell either. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little strong but seems to be working</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells SO GOOD!  I love it and only use high end shampoo&#x27;s.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and have noticed my hair is thinning so decided to try this shampoo, now I am hooked on the smell and the way my hair feels when I use it!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have been using this shampoo, and we like it well enough to order more.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and to my surprise my sudden hair loss that was due to an allergic reaction to a popular bottled shampoo immediately stopped and my scalp is on the road to recovery. I highly recommend a natural product such as this one to &amp;#34;reboot&amp;#34; your scalp as if to give it a vacation from the chemicals you&#x27;d normally buy at your chain store.</li>
