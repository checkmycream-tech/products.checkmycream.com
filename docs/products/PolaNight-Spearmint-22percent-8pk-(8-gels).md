<li> I will try again in a few months to get another comparison of the product.</li>
<li> In a few days your teeth  will get noticeably lighter and in a few weeks your teeth will become whiter  than they have been for years.        </li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> No longer will you be uncomfortable smiling on camera or in  public because of the fear that someone might see your discolored teeth.  </li>
<li> Tube size is too small for the price.</li>
<li> It is so much less expensive to purchase it this way than through the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
<li> I works the same as all the rest so anyone complaining about it not working might have received a bad batch.</li>
<li> I was always skeptical when it comes to using this stuff</li>
<li> Maybe they stored it incorrectly or past mfg date, not sure.......Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Needless to say I got 8 for under $20.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with a case like it shows in the picture.  The product itself works well and have used it for several years.</li>
    <li> I seriously think the product was old!  I had a pack of 18% that performed better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many whitening products in the past and this batch was completely ineffective. Maybe they stored it incorrectly or past mfg date, not sure.......Very disappointed. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product as expected.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing.I ordered pola night 22,and use it for 2hours daily for 2weeks ...maybe the best teeth whitening system for home .</li>
    <li> My dentist wants $125.00 for 10...told him to order here, will see if he does</li>
    <li> This is one of the best investments that you could ever make in yourself.   I was always skeptical when it comes to using this stuff but it actually works.  It&#x27;s affordable and best of all it works right away. In a few days your teeth  will get noticeably lighter and in a few weeks your teeth will become whiter  than they have been for years.        If you&#x27;re a single guy or gal who has stained colored teeth, this is the perfect  product for you. No longer will you be uncomfortable smiling on camera or in  public because of the fear that someone might see your discolored teeth.  Your odds of passing a job interview and getting laid will definitely improve.   After all, everybody likes to see a healthy white smile.      Mr. Twigenbary</li>
    <li> Better price and the same I get from my dentist</li>
    <li> good transaction &amp; product</li>
    <li> This package contained more tubes than I expected at this price! This product works great for whitening your teeth and provides good, quick results, especially when used overnight!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife to use with her trays from the dentist and she says this seems to work, just as good as the stuff from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping along with everything I expected. My dentist changed 20 per tube for this stuff. Needless to say I got 8 for under $20. I works the same as all the rest so anyone complaining about it not working might have received a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Tube size is too small for the price. Even if you apply a thin line, you can barely use it twice for upper and lower teeth.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item a couple times here. The recent order did not seem to be as fresh or the same strength as the first time I purchase it. They just did not whiten my teeth as well as first order. I will try again in a few months to get another comparison of the product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Easy to use, convenient.</li>
    <li> Although it tastes a bit different than what I received at the dentist&#x27;s office and the packaging is also different, it does whiten well.  It is so much less expensive to purchase it this way than through the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and it continues to deliver.  Will keep on using it.</li>
    <li> i had this shipped to australia.  I got what i paid for in a timely manner.  What more is there?</li>
    <li> Professional style whitening at home!</li>
    <li> This product works in only two hours.  It is dentist recommended and easy to use.  It is very effective for whitening.</li>
    <li> Not Spearmint as posted. Leaves me suspicious  of other claims.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this same product for a few years now and she hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it. It has significantly whitened her teeth, but we&#x27;re not looking for, or wanting, the fake looking super white that so many people seem to desire these days. She is very happy with this product and only uses it a few times a week now that her teeth have whitened to the level she is happy with.</li>
    <li> This product did not whiten my teeth. I have used this brand of whitener in the past and purchased it at my dentist&#x27;s office and it worked great.  But the whitener I purchased online appeared diluted.  I tried contacting the seller but received no response.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its the best to whitining</li>
    <li> These things are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in orders with this product, some times the products work and other times not</li>
    <li> Stuff worked okay, but doesn&#x27;t taste good and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as it should be.</li>
