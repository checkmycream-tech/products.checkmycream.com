<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great true red matte eyeshadow. Perfect for Halloween!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s red ! Lol iWas hoping that it was a lot brighter but it&#x27;ll do:-)</li>
    <li> I used this for my halloween costume, but I think in the right situations I could use it regularly.  Very pigmented and a good amount of product for the money.  A little goes a long way but is very easy to build up and blend.  I&#x27;ve seen this sold as eye shadow and blush, could really be either.</li>
    <li> Red eye shadow is really hard to find. I&#x27;m so glad I found this! The color is absolutly amazing and vibrant. Also it doesn&#x27;t smudge or fade during the day/night.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeshadow; I had been looking for it for a long time, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;The one problem is that it&#x27;s pretty hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been searching for a matte red eyeshadow forever and this one is perfect. This is highly pigmented but blends easily. It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. It does crease so I wear it with a primer. The color does seem to fade after several hours so if you plan on wearing it all day it might need a touch up, but it&#x27;s fine for a night out with just one application.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an Anna Sui pigment-intensive red that I&#x27;ve misplaced.  Unless you do a lot of garish costume-y dress up, this stuff should last a lifetime.  You only need to touch the brush to the shadow to get enough for a \\&quot;tasteful\\&quot; application.  I use it as blush.  It&#x27;s a great true/blue red -- no orange-y tones at all.  And I&#x27;m pretty sure it costs a mere fraction of what I paid for the Anna Sui color!</li>
    <li> Very lovely eye shadow/blush, whatever purpose you want to use it for. Great quality, and does not need to be reapplied constantly, would recommend it :)</li>
    <li> This stuff covers very well,and is one of the few shadows I have found that can withstand the Texas heat and prolonged wear.The color is so vibrant and pretty,it is amazing.</li>
    <li> About this product,ill give some good things about it, and the bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great color,its so vibrant!Its such a true,deep blood red!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to apply,and blends so easy!!BUT it almost blends to easy,&lt;br /&gt;example?if you apply it and dont want a harsh line,you can only blend it with a brush very little, if you do it very much it makes another harsh line with the eyeshadow,and then youll have to blend that,its a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT does NOT crease or fade,WHICH IS SO GREAT!!! (well it diddnt crease OR fade to my noticeabilty).Plus,The eyeshadow was such a great size for the money,its about twice the size of usuall single eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little does go a long way!but if your like me and you want TONS AN TONS of red on,you have to apply it a bit more than usualy,which is no biggie,because I have normal eyeshadows where I have to apply a ton get the color impact,but with this I dont:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A down fall!!I dont know if anyone elses was like this, or If they had this problem,but this eyeshadow is SOOOO hard!:( example?,I tapped on the eyshadow with the stick end of my brush,and it sounded as if I was knocking on wood!! its one of the hardest eyeshadows I think ive ever seen! For me I had to kinda scrap the product off to get what I wanted,so eventually I just broke it up and put it in a little plastic pot,Im not dealing with scraping it everytime I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also,as for the shipping and packeging,it was just wonderful!!! I got this in four days!As for the pakage,it was in a small bubble wrap package,and the eyeshadow was protected with TONS of newspaper!It was wrapped so getnley but tightley around the eyshadow.Then the eyeshadow was placed within a little sealable baggy.&lt;br /&gt;So it has no chance of moving to become broken.Which I think is just great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I think its an ok eyeshadow,with a good price,but its not great,if this product works good for you,than awesome! but if your looking for something a bit brighter,softer and less smudgy,look elsewhere.hter,softer and less smudgy,look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This red eyeshadow has the best coverage. I can use a little along with purple to make a great pink color or use it alone for a stand out true red. Love it and will certainly buy more.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a red eyeshadow for awhile but the company I usually get my makeup from discontinued the red so I saw this goth vampire red I couldn&#x27;t believe it I finally found the perfect red I will always buy my goth colors from manic panic you should try them too</li>
    <li> i love this eyeshadow.. i could just patt the brush on it a little and you get this amazing color:) i love it it was worth the money spent for it!!! i highlyy recomend it:)</li>
    <li> I ordered this red and a black by the same company. The black is truly black. The red is sort of red... but not as strong as I would have preferred. It looks something like what eyeshadow would look like hours after you&#x27;ve applied it... very faded. Not sure what I would have to do to get it to really pop. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s easy to remove with makeup remover wipes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a red eyeshadow for months now. I&#x27;m so glad I found this one. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I love the deep red color &amp; the price was fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is eyeshadow/blush was exactly what I was looking for! This shade of red is very hard to find and the pigmentation is wonderful. I need very little and it lasts all day. If you are using it as an eyeshadow or liner, be warned, it takes a really good makeup remover to get it off completely.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my daughter has been looking for red eyeshadow for months and cant find it. This is a nice powder that goes on very dark ( a little goes a long way). She dresses goth/alternative and it looks fantastic. Not exactly my style, but even I can appreciate its coverage. It comes in a fairly big compact. Not little and tiny. Good product, excellent price.</li>
    <li> I Love the Vampire Red Eye Shadow !!  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get it until after Halloween.....but it&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be !  Can&#x27;t wait until next Halloween to show it off !</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It stays on all night...even after sleeping.  Very smooth and doesn&#x27;t crease.  The color is nice.</li>
    <li> Very strong. I use it as a blush sometimes but i have to use a very little bit.</li>
    <li> I am always worried about ordering a color based off of a picture online, but this one is really close. A very good solid shade of red and it is a great powdered product as well!</li>
    <li> I can use the tiniest amount of this and it makes a very nice blush.  It lasts all day on me where most blushes are gone by lunchtime.  You have to be careful not to apply too much as it is very dark.  The bristles of the brush just barely tap the surface of the cake and it&#x27;s plenty.  As a blush it will last me absolutely forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I was disappointed in it as eye shadow.  It doesn&#x27;t come off as truly red on me.  I have an olive complexion - so possibly it&#x27;s me.  On me this comes out as a pink hue (like it does on my cheeks).  The more I apply, the darker it gets, but it&#x27;s still pink.  The problem with applying a ton of it to your eyes, like with most shadows, is it starts looking caked on an creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of great reviews for this product, even as an eye shadow, that claim this is truly red.  So I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s my complexion.  Just realize that results will vary.  I think it would work nicely as a pink blush for everyone.</li>
    <li> Vivid. I like to put on a bit of purple or red lipstick, then dab this on top to give me a deep rich color with a matte look. You don&#x27;t need much, a little goes a long way. It stays in place pretty well too. When worn as eye shadow, it blends easily across the lid. If you use very little, you can make it look pink for a less intense look. Layer on a little more and it becomes more and more red. I like it on my green eyes, with the majority of the intensity focused in the crease. Also blends well with some of my other eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> I found the the right color for my Amaterasu cosplay and it was difficult to find red eyeshadow and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> love the color but don&#x27;t like all the excess that comes off when you apply your brush.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Perfect!!! A rare color to find, I couldn&#x27;t even find red eye shadow at a huge makeup store like Ulta.  I wear it beneath my eyes and it gives a nice effect.</li>
    <li> was exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Oh this is the best red I&#x27;ve seen ever. I am also using it as blush. The color is so great for goth and it&#x27;s great stuff like a lot of Manic Panic&#x27;s stuff. Nailed it.</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars just because it arrived on time. I was looking for a nice dark red. When I finally used it was not as red as it appears. I  had to apply several times. Still looking for a dark red.</li>
    <li> This product is a true matte red. The color builds easily. And the color pay off is nice. By far the best red eye shadow I have in my collection.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It is so true to color and it goes on very smooth. I received so many compliments the first time I wore it, even from a 7 year old boy from church commented on it! I LOVE IT! I have been looking for a red shadow for some time. I am known for matching my shadows with my outfits. Therefore I have a LOT of colors in my collection and this was the perfect addition to the \\&quot;family\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Look all over for Punk colors in make up....  was very impressed with the Vampire Red and   was very happy with the color and how quick  I got it......</li>
    <li> Great for blush, or eye shadow. I do a lot of different looks with makeup, I&#x27;ve used this as a red eye shadow and it was very very red. Now i am currently using it as a blush, i have to be careful how much i put on my brush; a little bit goes a long way.  This eye shadow/blush lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Wore it with a costume and the color popped</li>
    <li> This was a high quality eye shadow that didn&#x27;t wear off easily.</li>
    <li> After searching everywhere for a long time , I&#x27;m very happy for this product. It blends very well, just make sure to have makeup remover, soap and water won&#x27;t do the job. That&#x27;s how good it sticks. So if you are in the middle of a downpour there are no worries.</li>
    <li> Absolutely stunning pigmentation, very velvety application. I am a big fan of their dyes and now their eyeshadows. Gorgeous colour, very true to the palette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for a halloween costume and I&#x27;m pleased with the color, however, the entire eyeshadow was broken into tiny pieces when I recieved it. I don&#x27;t have time to return it so I have to deal with it but I know this will create a huge red mess in my future. Good luck with yours.</li>
    <li> My daughter had been looking for an eyeshadow that is no longer on the market. We tried this and it is spot on! Just what was wanted. Came in less time than expected! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color. I needed something to help my checks look brighter, so I slightly use this along with my regular pinky rose blush. It works wonders, I highly recommend ! The product arrived on time, which I was extremely happy about :)</li>
    <li> really like the way this red applies</li>
    <li> This was perfect for Halloween. It is REALLY pigmented and goes on evenly. It isn&#x27;t streaky at all with little to no fall out.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is absolutely perfect. It is very pigmented and looks great with or without an eye shadow primer. It also works well as a blush. So I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice red color but not as deep as I wanted.</li>
    <li> I knew this would be red..but this is an insane red! i love it! it does not work at all with my current hair color but it will look amazing when i go back to black or blonde. This color does NOT work with red hair at all! if you are a red head, DONT DO IT! i dye my hair often enough, it wont matter in a couple of months, i will change my hair color and this shadow will look amazing, but if you are a red-head for life, i wouldnt opt for such an intense hue!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blush in my makeup case. It gives you just the right tint. Great for eye shadow effects as well.</li>
    <li> This shadow is so beautiful! For a while now I&#x27;ve been looking for a really deep red eyeshadow, because I remember having some when I was younger. I am absolutely in love with this! It&#x27;s really pigmented and shows up extremely well, even if you don&#x27;t use a lot. Definitely worth investing in.</li>
    <li> Awesome !! Builds good very little fall out. Can be used as a blush, eyeshadow dark too very light. If you wear a red lipstick you can mattyfy your lip.</li>
    <li> its not really that red or bold &amp; its really blush not eye shadow I would go find another red some where else.</li>
    <li> I got it as eye shadow because I could never find red but the color pay off is very weak unless you apply alot in a few coats, even then it creases fairly easily and looks washed out by nights end. As a blush though its just enough red to do what you expect</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking but not bad</li>
    <li> Great product ! A little goes along way . I have been looking for this color for a long time . Worth every penny .</li>
    <li> I loooove this eyeshadow. It makes your eyes pop in a goth-y, vampy, My Chemical Romance &amp;#34;Revenge&amp;#34; era way. This eye shadow works especially well with using Manic Panic&#x27;s &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation as a primer. It stays on even longer.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for red eye shadow for a while. This is a great color!!</li>
    <li> This is such a bold red! I had been searching for a red eyeshadow forever, and this one is RED! It takes a bit of layering to get the color to pop, as it is a really translucent color, but when it does, wow. Maybe using a primer will help. It has a little tiny bit of a pinkish cast to it, but not so much as to call it &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; for sure.</li>
    <li> So hard to find red eye shadow these days! I love the strong brightness of the color, only down side is that it kinda broke apart rather easy in the case. Still works great tho</li>
    <li> great red color! I have to use a eye shadow primer though because if I don&#x27;t apply enough of the product it comes out looking a little pink.</li>
    <li> Hottest red I could find. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> Its too dark for me. It doesn&#x27;t look good. I wish I could have returned it before it was sent through the mail to me. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how many stamps I need know to return it.</li>
    <li> II wanted to buy this a long time ago and I finally did. The product is just amazing, high quality !! Got lots of compliments! It&#x27;s well worth the money and the wait. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. :)</li>
    <li> i love this brand of eyeshadow after trying this color, it is the only red i could fond anywhere...cant wait to try other colors too!!</li>
    <li> Great color. Was a gift, and my granddaughter loved it.Product was shipped quickley. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It took me forever to find some red eyeshadow for the dragoncon for my vampire outfit it was perfect red and it stays on forever great buildup as well goes perfect with my georgia bulldogs too wonderful item to have</li>
    <li> Nice bit not as dark looking as the photo still too light. I had wanted something deeper but alas still not dark enough. :(</li>
    <li> This is really a red eyeshadow!!!  I have looked for months trying to find a red eye shadow.  This is it.  When I searched online I was advised from a demo site that some red eyeshadows have a tendency of having a skin reaction because of the true color pigment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t happen to me.  I am not sure if anyone else would be so fortunate.  So I ordered 2 and if I did have a reaction then I would give it away as a gift.  Just a FYI, I am an African American and this was still a true red.  Some products show differently on darker skin tones.  But anyway, I just love it.  I wish some of the more popular products would experiment in making this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to run out fast so order more than one.  The price is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this! It stays on all day and all night even through the heat!</li>
    <li> Excellent pigment. Large and nice quality. Good to layer.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old grand daughter is into the goth look and was dying for red eye shadow.  I looked everywhere to no avail until I checked amazon.com.  I was so excited to find exactly what she was looking for and really didn&#x27;t think anyone would find and on Christmas morning she was thrilled with her red eye shadow that was the perfect color and could also be used as blush.</li>
    <li> Wow. so impressed! I have been searching for sooo long for a true red that is full of pigment, that is truly RED. Not Red Orange Not Red Pink!! This was Perfect!! Also the shipping process was professionally done all the way!! Thank you soo much Tish &amp; Snooky for MANIC PANIC Vampire RED!! God Bless!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Super pigmented and definitely worth the money! Shipped extremely fast!</li>
    <li> Such a rich pigmented color. A little goes a long way. The only thing, when I blended it with white on the upper lid, it appeared more of a hot magenta/pink. Overall I was pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, but comes off a lighter red, almost pink-ish.</li>
    <li> Arrived to me completely broken.</li>
