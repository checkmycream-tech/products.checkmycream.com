      <li>For better results i use both vitamin c...</li>
      <li>and if I had used a numbing agent then I am sure you would not feel a thing.</li>

      <li>I love IT...</li>
      <li>glad I did.</li>
      <li>Love the design and ergonomics of the handle.  </li>
      <li>to read the instructions to use carefully for best results</li>

      <li>I will recommend this roller as it is of very high quality and comes in a nice holder.</li>
      <li>it went on smoothly</li>
      <li>I have been using retinol cream for a while now and just found out that I can use something like this to make the product better absorbed in the skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth.</li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I m very pleasured about this product!!!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and take great precaution when using certain products on my skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and felt results after the first use.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love my new Derma Roller, I saw a difference within the 1st couple of days…</li>

      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>My skin seems to react to the needles as it described in some useful follow up emails.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
      <li>I bought the roller mainly for fine lines.</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast, received it four days after ordering it (first time I ever received mail on a Sunday!)and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
      <li>Works really well!  </li>
      <li>I use it on a weekly basis and can see the difference the next day and even more so in the weeks to follow.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I used this product</li>
      <li>but I do notice that my skin definitely does look better and tighter after each use.</li>
      <li>Used it for the first time on Friday...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited with my results so far</li>
      <li>and I believe that in the long run the results will be even better.</li>

      <li>I will post again as I proceed through treatments and am excited about the changes I see happening already and am anxious to see more improvement as time progresses....</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my second order, which I am ordering for a friend as I have seen such amazing success so far with my Dr. A Microneedle Roller.  </li>
      <li>I cannot believe after spending years  and a whole lot of money on treatments, this product did the trick.</li>
      <li>but I think it is very tolerable</li>
      <li>So about the roller itself, on a scale of 1-10 pain was very tolerable, like a 4.</li>
      <li>Great results so far in only a few uses!</li>
      <li>Was very surprised on the results.  </li>
      <li>So far it has preformed the way the ad says!</li>
      <li>just received my Derma Roller couple days ago, when i first used it the feel was quite strange</li>
      <li>So far there haven´t been radical results</li>

    <li> The shipping was super fast, received it four days after ordering it (first time I ever received mail on a Sunday!)and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I also ordered a hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin C, so I applied that after cleansing my face and before using the derma roller. I was surprised it was not painful, as I had heard it might be, so I did not need lidocaine to numb my face. My first experience was great and I am looking forward to the results.</li>
    <li> Was very surprised on the results.  Thank you for letting me purchase this item</li>
    <li> Great results so far in only a few uses! I can tell my acne scars are diminishing dramatically! I use a Vitamin C serum after cleansing then my moisturizer or a sculpting cream after using the roller. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new Derma Roller, I saw a difference within the 1st couple of days….I have found my fountain of youth!!!!</li>
    <li> not used to it yet , still not sure how my skin is reacting to this therapy . it makes me look like I have been badly scratched . and my skin looks that way for days after using . it seems to be doing what it says it does , I am even using it on my small varicose veins . after each use the varicose veins are where I can see a change rite away !</li>
    <li> This is great I love this product. It makes my skin feel really smooth. I will use this product again very regularly.</li>
    <li> Love the design and ergonomics of the handle.  Easy to use, and felt results after the first use.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Order #112-2684594-1938616&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order, which I am ordering for a friend as I have seen such amazing success so far with my Dr. A Microneedle Roller.  I use it on a weekly basis and can see the difference the next day and even more so in the weeks to follow.</li>
    <li> So far it has preformed the way the ad says!</li>
    <li> I started using this roller on some scars I had from a bad case of chicken pox and I&#x27;ve been noticing how amazing my skin looks around the area so I started using it all over my face.  I&#x27;m excited with my results so far and I can&#x27;t wait to see my results months from now.  The derma roller has given me back some confidence and I feel so much better about myself because of the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far.  I&#x27;d of never thought it could do what it says and work the wonders it&#x27;s working.  A great product for anyone who wants to improve their skin:  wrinkles, stretch marks and more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a 5 start rating because I&#x27;m so pleased with the performance and because it&#x27;s not painful like it looks to be.  My skin actually feels alive for the first time in many years, after use.</li>
    <li> just received my Derma Roller couple days ago, when i first used it the feel was quite strange but i must admit after i applied my serum it went on smoothly and my face felt smoother i just can&#x27;t wait to see results and scars dissapear as it claimed it in the description but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love IT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to read the instructions to use carefully for best results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of my roller!</li>
    <li> I only left 4 stars because I have only been using this product for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great durable product. Ergonomic handle and pins are tiny. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon. It arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now. My skin seems to react to the needles as it described in some useful follow up emails. It gets red after use, my skin starts to flake which I take a sign of the product being working. I can&#x27;t wait to see the final result!</li>
    <li> I had suffered with acne scars since I was a teenager. I am now in my thirty’s and still breakout. After using the Derma Roll in just a few days I noticed results. I have very sensitive skin and take great precaution when using certain products on my skin. I have heard about this product on the Doctors show and am happy to say it works.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Perfectly packaged...great instructions...excellent product!!! Used it for the first time on Friday...now just waiting until I can use it again...I will post again as I proceed through treatments and am excited about the changes I see happening already and am anxious to see more improvement as time progresses....Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this one time and I have already received amazing compliments about my age. I have never had bad skin but since I am now 30 I thought it would be a good idea to start a regimen. At first I thought I was going to hate the routine of sterilizing the roller and washing my face with disinfectant before and after but it is quick! So about the roller itself, on a scale of 1-10 pain was very tolerable, like a 4. I could see my lip trembling in the mirror but that was more because I was nervous but I think it is very tolerable and if I had used a numbing agent then I am sure you would not feel a thing. I ordered the 1.0 and glad I did. I Would maybe get a smaller size for the crows feet area and between the eyes, maybe around the lips. Over all very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use different products to help me with my stretch marks around my thighs there are really  bad because i lost weight. I read up about this Dermaroller  that it helps to get rid of them. This  Dr A Dermaroller is an excellent product. I cannot believe after spending years  and a whole lot of money on treatments, this product did the trick.</li>
    <li> I m very pleasured about this product!!! Actually my skin seems fresh and healthy!!! For better results i use both vitamin c...</li>
    <li> Great item. Nice package! Purchase process was great!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used this product and I love it. I have been using it regularly with my skin care regimen for acne scar and thinning hair. I have been using retinol cream for a while now and just found out that I can use something like this to make the product better absorbed in the skin. I made several trips before to my dermatologist for microdermabrasion until I purchase this product and that was very expensive. In addition, I am also using this before I apply my rogaine 5% foam in my hair. I can see that my hair is getting fuller.  I am very satisfied that I bought this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you for an amazing item!!</li>
    <li> The description said I was buying 2 of these, but only received one.</li>
    <li> I bought the roller mainly for fine lines. I have used it 5 times already and only every 2-3 weeks to give the skin enough time to heal properly before using it again. So far there haven´t been radical results but I do notice that my skin definitely does look better and tighter after each use. I will keep on using it and I believe that in the long run the results will be even better. I use it with a numbing cream which helps so I can press the roller a bit harder on the skin. I will recommend this roller as it is of very high quality and comes in a nice holder.</li>
    <li> Works really well!  East to use and getting results.</li>
</ol>
