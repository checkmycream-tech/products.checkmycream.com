### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are awesome.</li>
      <li>Have been using this on my baby and it has been great</li>
      <li>Works as described, and was great while it lasted.  </li>
      <li>Dr. Sponge is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good seller.</li>
      <li>I tried this Sponge after I heard its a good dupe for a Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I loved the way that the sponge removed all the makeup and oil from my face.</li>
      <li>I learned from their website that after the 2-3 months when its no longer suitable for use on your face you can use it to water your plants!</li>
      <li>I purchased this sponge and was initially very pleased.</li>
      <li>My skin has never been better!</li>
      <li>I use it morning and night with my favorite cleanser!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
      <li>This however is amazing.</li>
      <li>My skin felt amazing after I scrubbed it using this sponge and my cleanser.</li>
      <li>Konjac sponges are a great alternative to those who use cruelty free and/or vegan products because popular exfoliating tools like The Clarisonic mia are owned by parent companies that tests.</li>
      <li>I really liked how this sponge scrubbed all my make up off.</li>
      <li>That was nice.</li>
      <li>This sponge is really nice.</li>
      <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
      <li>My sponge deteriorated after 3 months and I switched to using the My Konjac Sponge brand because the shape is better for using on your face and dries better because its thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with an attached string</li>
      <li>Love the sponge</li>
      <li>love Dr. Sponge</li>
      <li>So glad that I got the opportunity to test out this product.</li>
      <li>For the first two weeks this sponge was amazing!</li>
      <li>Nice sponge for mildly exfoliating the skin.</li>
      <li>and you feel so clean afterwards!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect dupe for the Boscia kojac sponge for $10 less.</li>
      <li>Great for daily cleansing.</li>
      <li>This is really mild and I found works great in the morning without a cleanser because its not really necessary to wash your face in the morning unless you&#x27;ve been sweating through the night.</li>
      <li>I love it so much!</li>
      <li>Originally tried out as a material in a bra for its absorption and yet contour shape.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended ! :)</li>
      <li>so you feel like your skin is really getting washed and clean!</li>
      <li>I would say the only drawback is that they don&#x27;t include a suction cup hook to hang it with, you have to provide your own.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and works well with both my cleansers.</li>
      <li>I would have thought for as much as I paid for the sponge it would have held up a lot longer then just 3 weeks!</li>
      <li>It leaves my face so clean and soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super gentile, all natural and biodegradable.  </li>
      <li>Gentle but has some exfoliating texture to it</li>
      <li>It gently polishes and helps to get all of the make up and grime off from the day.</li>
      <li>but the last few days it&#x27;s been getting more and more moldy.</li>
      <li>Works well, but very pricey.</li>
      <li>My skin is left clean and exfoliated but never irritated.  </li>
      <li>I love how this sponge goes from hard to soft in seconds of warm water,  I have used my Clarisonic for years but there r spots a bit hard to reach around my nose and all but with this sponge</li>
      <li>This sponge is a very mild exfoliate, and with my sensitive skin, I can use it everyday.</li>
      <li>I really loved this little sponge, but after just three weeks it ripped and little pieces from the sponge would get everywhere when I used it to wash my face.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive to EVERYTHING.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of days, and it&#x27;s making my face washing a real pleasure.  </li>
      <li>It has a sort of a squishy texture, but works very well with or without facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Which I do all the time now with my old sponges</li>
      <li>I find it really helps to get the last traces of makeup off.</li>
      <li>After two weeks, it completely fell apart.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, try this.</li>
      <li>But the sponge is soft, and leaves my face feeling cleaner than just using my cleanser and hands.</li>
      <li>It was really hard to clean though.</li>
      <li>The boscia sponges (and other brands) are more expensive, but last much longer.</li>

<li> It was really hard to clean though.</li>
<li> The boscia sponges (and other brands) are more expensive, but last much longer.</li>
<li> I never experienced an issue with bacterial growth because I would disinfect it once a week in a bowl of hot water and very thoroughly squeeze out excess water, towel dry, and then hang it from the frame of my chair that i put a thumbtack on so it can dry on all</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t previously aware of a &#x27;residue&#x27; left behind by my face wash, but after using this sponge, I definitely notice that it&#x27;s being removed!</li>
<li> When wet, it&#x27;s slightly bigger than the palm of my hand.</li>
<li> Squeeze all the water out and hang it to dry where it is exposed to the air.</li>
<li> When dry, it&#x27;s about the size of a golf ball.</li>
<li> so you can air dry it.</li>
<li> I received the large rectangular sponge but thought I was getting the small half circle face sponge.</li>
<li> The string broke on day 2 and it started falling apart after a few weeks of moderate use.  </li>
<li> Such a huge disappointment!</li>
<li> After reading some other reviews about the sponge getting moldy, I am going to be very careful to hang it up by its string every time I finish with it.</li>
<li> Not worth the investment.</li>
<li> Nifty little sponge.  </li>
<li> Really disappointed as I have always been careful to wring it right out after each use and hung it by the string.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with mildew.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s so small it will reach anywhere</li>
<li> Buying a new one each month can get very expensive.</li>
<li> I find it to be annoying that I have to take the time to wet it each use to get it soft and malleable.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t even last one month</li>
<li> Seriously !</li>
<li> It feels like I&#x27;m washing my face with a dirty sock..</li>
<li> Like when I&#x27;m running water over the sponge for it to swell up, I&#x27;m afraid for the string to get tangled in my fingers, and I snap it in two.</li>
<li> My make up would get stuck in the sponge and it began to look really dirty.</li>
<li> but those things are so expensive!</li>
<li> Horrible product!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are awesome. Originally tried out as a material in a bra for its absorption and yet contour shape. I used it on my face too. That was nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sponge and was initially very pleased. After using it for just under a month it started cracking. Therefore I recommend you don&#x27;t spend your money on it. Not worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Works well, but very pricey.</li>
    <li> WHAT THE HECK! I LOVE THIS! I will never wash my face with anything else!</li>
    <li> Good product. Good seller.</li>
    <li> Works as described, and was great while it lasted.  The string broke on day 2 and it started falling apart after a few weeks of moderate use.  The boscia sponges (and other brands) are more expensive, but last much longer.</li>
    <li> It feels like I&#x27;m washing my face with a dirty sock.. Seriously ! Wish I could get my money back, Horrible product!!!</li>
    <li> You must try for yourself. It feels like you&#x27;re rubbing a cloud on your face. It&#x27;s super gentile, all natural and biodegradable.  All a plus in my book.  It&#x27;s a perfect dupe for the Boscia kojac sponge for $10 less. It&#x27;s gentile enough I use the body sponge on the kiddos.</li>
    <li> I really loved this little sponge, but after just three weeks it ripped and little pieces from the sponge would get everywhere when I used it to wash my face. Such a huge disappointment! I loved the way that the sponge removed all the makeup and oil from my face. I would have thought for as much as I paid for the sponge it would have held up a lot longer then just 3 weeks! Bummer!</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> Great for daily cleansing. This sponge is a very mild exfoliate, and with my sensitive skin, I can use it everyday. I wasn&#x27;t previously aware of a &#x27;residue&#x27; left behind by my face wash, but after using this sponge, I definitely notice that it&#x27;s being removed!</li>
    <li> Nice sponge for mildly exfoliating the skin. Konjac sponges are a great alternative to those who use cruelty free and/or vegan products because popular exfoliating tools like The Clarisonic mia are owned by parent companies that tests. This is really mild and I found works great in the morning without a cleanser because its not really necessary to wash your face in the morning unless you&#x27;ve been sweating through the night. My sponge deteriorated after 3 months and I switched to using the My Konjac Sponge brand because the shape is better for using on your face and dries better because its thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with an attached string so you can air dry it. I never experienced an issue with bacterial growth because I would disinfect it once a week in a bowl of hot water and very thoroughly squeeze out excess water, towel dry, and then hang it from the frame of my chair that i put a thumbtack on so it can dry on all sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I learned from their website that after the 2-3 months when its no longer suitable for use on your face you can use it to water your plants! Which I do all the time now with my old sponges</li>
    <li> So glad that I got the opportunity to test out this product. I love it so much! Highly recommended ! :)</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive to EVERYTHING. This sponge has been a life saver. My skin is left clean and exfoliated but never irritated.  If you have sensitive skin, try this. No soap needed.</li>
    <li> I tried this Sponge after I heard its a good dupe for a Clarisonic. I really liked how this sponge scrubbed all my make up off. My skin felt amazing after I scrubbed it using this sponge and my cleanser. It was really hard to clean though. My make up would get stuck in the sponge and it began to look really dirty. After a couple weeks it fell apart and I had to throw it away. Buying a new one each month can get very expensive.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge.  I&#x27;m not totally sold on it though.  I find it to be annoying that I have to take the time to wet it each use to get it soft and malleable.  Also it seems to get smaller each time I use it so I&#x27;m guessing it will fade away eventually and I&#x27;ll have to re-buy.  It does help with exfoliation even though the product doesn&#x27;t make that claim.</li>
    <li> Nifty little sponge.  Gentle but has some exfoliating texture to it so you feel like your skin is really getting washed and clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of days, and it&#x27;s making my face washing a real pleasure.  I can&#x27;t say anything about long-term results yet.  It has a sort of a squishy texture, but works very well with or without facial cleanser.  After reading some other reviews about the sponge getting moldy, I am going to be very careful to hang it up by its string every time I finish with it.</li>
    <li> This sponge is really nice. When dry, it&#x27;s about the size of a golf ball. When wet, it&#x27;s slightly bigger than the palm of my hand. My only problem is that the string it&#x27;s attached to feels so flimsy. Like when I&#x27;m running water over the sponge for it to swell up, I&#x27;m afraid for the string to get tangled in my fingers, and I snap it in two. I would describe the string as a step below twine, but a step above a thread. But the sponge is soft, and leaves my face feeling cleaner than just using my cleanser and hands.</li>
    <li> Have been using this on my baby and it has been great but the last few days it&#x27;s been getting more and more moldy. Really disappointed as I have always been careful to wring it right out after each use and hung it by the string.</li>
    <li> Love the sponge but it&#x27;s not the one that was pictured. I received the large rectangular sponge but thought I was getting the small half circle face sponge. I use this 1-2 times daily on my face. It gently polishes and helps to get all of the make up and grime off from the day. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Dr. Sponge is amazing! It leaves my face so clean and soft. It is very gentle and works well with both my cleansers. Squeeze all the water out and hang it to dry where it is exposed to the air. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with mildew. I would say the only drawback is that they don&#x27;t include a suction cup hook to hang it with, you have to provide your own.</li>
    <li> love Dr. Sponge but when I got my package the boxes were torn and looked like they were sat on.</li>
    <li> My face loves it. I find it really helps to get the last traces of makeup off. I like how it feels jelly like on my skin.</li>
    <li> For the first two weeks this sponge was amazing! After two weeks, it completely fell apart. I&#x27;m a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t even last one month</li>
    <li> I love how this sponge goes from hard to soft in seconds of warm water,  I have used my Clarisonic for years but there r spots a bit hard to reach around my nose and all but with this sponge it&#x27;s so small it will reach anywhere and you feel so clean afterwards!</li>
    <li> I looooove this product! I learned about it from YouTube and thank god! I&#x27;ve been wanting a Clarisonic forever but those things are so expensive! This however is amazing. My skin has never been better! I use it morning and night with my favorite cleanser!</li>
