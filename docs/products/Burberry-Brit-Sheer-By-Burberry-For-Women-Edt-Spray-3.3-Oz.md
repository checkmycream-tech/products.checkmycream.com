      <li>So I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I can truly say I love the smell of this perfume.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>I used it before and one of my Favorite perfumes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d be convincing if the seller would write it on the description somewhere.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and thought I would get a good deal since its real, but I guess I was a wrong.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
      <li>I got it as a sample, it came with another perfume I had purchased, and I loved it so much I purchased</li>
      <li>She wears it all the time, and the bottle is super cute too.</li>
      <li>It is not too strong but rather light and feminine-</li>
      <li>I have steered away from Burberry cologne since the original one which was too strong and gave me headaches.</li>
      <li>It is timeless, light and fits me well.  </li>
      <li>If you are okay with a less-than product being advertised as the real thing, then this is for you.  </li>
      <li>By the end of the night, there was still a strong nice floral scent on my clothes and especially on my wrist.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly what I was looking for, it came in a protected package, there were no \\&quot;scratches\\&quot; on the bottle packing, so can easily come as a gift.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a real strong smell its pretty soft.</li>
      <li>i love it.i like the smells but would not take whole day fragrance ,in general i love it still though..</li>
      <li>I had bought the smaller bottle at an airport duty free shop and just love the sweet, floral scent.  </li>
      <li>I love that the bigger size was such a good price.</li>
      <li>order from Amazon every time if the price is right.</li>
      <li>Purchased as a gift and it arrived right on time.  </li>
      <li>This one is sweet without being too much.</li>
      <li>the full perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fresh, a little sweet, and strong.</li>
      <li>She is picky and she loved the sweet but subtle smell.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a fresh, light floral scent that doesnt stay in the room after you left, this is it!</li>
      <li>I love the cologne its the same as what you get at the high price stores just much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>When my wife opened the bottle and sprayed it, the scent smelled like straight alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t quite tell really,</li>
      <li>so I guess I&#x27;d like to know if it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>stars for the fast shipping</li>
      <li>My perfume arrived so fast.</li>
      <li>My order arrived in 2 days in brand new condition!  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>(I sprayed onto my right and left wrists).  </li>
      <li>Then I decided to buy it on amazon since it was almost 40 percent less than the original price.</li>
      <li>When I compare the 2 bottles side-by-side, they smelled exactly the same, and both scents lasted equally long</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of amazon since i can get what I want right to my place, but this product is fake.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t buy this specific fragrance in a department store for anywhere near this price.</li>
      <li>I ordered this perfume after reading good reviews, but was disappointed to find that the packaging is different from the real Burberry product, and the perfume itself had been watered down, making the smell last for far shorter amounts of time than the real Burberry.  </li>
      <li>Strong in the sense that while it is smells subtle, it lasts a while, and people around you will definitely notice.</li>
      <li>It smells real but at the same time, the effect is a little bit different than the ones I&#x27;ve tried at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstorm.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love it.i like the smells but would not take whole day fragrance ,in general i love it still though..</li>
    <li> Ordered this cologne based on reviews and the combination of scents in it. I have steered away from Burberry cologne since the original one which was too strong and gave me headaches. This one is sweet without being too much. Very light scent which explains the \\&quot;Sheer\\&quot;. Good scent for summer wear. You will not overpower your seat mates on the plane or have people complaining your cologne got there before you!</li>
    <li> I love the cologne its the same as what you get at the high price stores just much cheaper.  It doesn&#x27;t have a real strong smell its pretty soft.</li>
    <li> This is my personal signature scent and I have been coming back to it time and time again.  It is timeless, light and fits me well.  If you are looking for a fresh, light floral scent that doesnt stay in the room after you left, this is it!</li>
    <li> The perfume smells great but I&#x27;m not too sure if it&#x27;s real or fake. It smells real but at the same time, the effect is a little bit different than the ones I&#x27;ve tried at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstorm. I can&#x27;t quite tell really, so I guess I&#x27;d like to know if it&#x27;s the real deal or it&#x27;s some knock-offs? It&#x27;d be convincing if the seller would write it on the description somewhere. So I guess because it&#x27;s not written, it could be fake?</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance!  It&#x27;s subtle yet let&#x27;s people notice. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with Burberry products!</li>
    <li> I wore this once and never touched it again. The smell is too alcohol-y. I suspect it&#x27;s fake. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the spray at Nordstrom&#x27;s. Eck.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume after reading good reviews, but was disappointed to find that the packaging is different from the real Burberry product, and the perfume itself had been watered down, making the smell last for far shorter amounts of time than the real Burberry.  If you are okay with a less-than product being advertised as the real thing, then this is for you.  Personally, I will be going elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> I love my perfume! I fell in love with the scent and the price and customer service were amazing. My perfume arrived so fast. I love that the bigger size was such a good price. I wear this every day -- smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> My wife received this for our 5th anniversary. She loved it.  Won brownie points. She is picky and she loved the sweet but subtle smell.</li>
    <li> ordered nov 16th and still waiting.wrote seller 3 times and no response.terrible service or should i say no service at all.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to get this fregrance but I decided to listen to a friend and order it anyway.  I can truly say I love the smell of this perfume.  I will recommend to others and this is on my list of keepers.</li>
    <li> My order arrived in 2 days in brand new condition!  I had bought the smaller bottle at an airport duty free shop and just love the sweet, floral scent.  When I compare the 2 bottles side-by-side, they smelled exactly the same, and both scents lasted equally long (I sprayed onto my right and left wrists).  This is a great vendor.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews,I was unsure as I have never smelled this,wat a nice surprise,this is wonderful.nicely packaged&lt;br /&gt;A great product.</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.  I USE IT SPARINGLY AND THE FRAGRANCE IS JUST WHAT I LIKE TO COMPLIMENT ME.</li>
    <li> When my wife opened the bottle and sprayed it, the scent smelled like straight alcohol.  It does not smell at all like the Burberry Brit purchased at Macy&#x27;s.  Stay away from it!</li>
    <li> smells perfect, very feminine but not too strong. however, it does not last at all. i apply 6-8 spritz and the smell is gone even before i step out of the bathroom.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells lovely, and it was a great buy. You can&#x27;t buy this specific fragrance in a department store for anywhere near this price. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I went to sephora recently and decided to try this perfume out so I sprayed it on my wrist and literally everywhere. By the end of the night, there was still a strong nice floral scent on my clothes and especially on my wrist. So I fell in love with it. Then I decided to buy it on amazon since it was almost 40 percent less than the original price. Unfortunately when I received the item, it seemed nothing like the real perfume. When I sprayed it on my clothes and my wrist, the scent was not there anymore. When I smelled my wrist, it seemed really faint! When I headed to the sephora store and compared both bottles, they were different on the bottom of the packaging. When I looked at the bottle that I bought from amazon, it was definitely faulty. There was very small hair like shape stuck to the glass.. For some odd reason. I read the reviews and thought I would get a good deal since its real, but I guess I was a wrong.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for the fast shipping I guess.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this perfume for a long time, so I finally got it for her for Christmas. The package arrived just in time on Christmas Eve evening. 3.4 Ounces should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and it arrived right on time.  Smells heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;Would order from Amazon every time if the price is right.</li>
    <li> it is v ery good womans fragrance  my daughter at us loves this one for the past ten years.she never uses other scent</li>
    <li> I baught Burberry brit sheer and I think its afake one! I am a huge fan of amazon since i can get what I want right to my place, but this product is fake. I used it before and one of my Favorite perfumes but I it doesnt have a the smell at all.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! My mistress too... jk... maybe. Now one can&#x27;t tell if the other has been around... jk... again... maybe.</li>
    <li> The product is offered in a good price and a good package. It is a  valuable product and I like it.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly what I was looking for, it came in a protected package, there were no \\&quot;scratches\\&quot; on the bottle packing, so can easily come as a gift.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes. It is not too strong but rather light and feminine- but with a touch of sophistication.</li>
    <li> It came qiuickly and the price was really good.  I love this perfume.  It is light and good for every day wear.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend, and she absolutely loves it. She wears it all the time, and the bottle is super cute too.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I will start by saying that I am NOT a fan of Burberry perfumes, but I really loved this perfume. I got it as a sample, it came with another perfume I had purchased, and I loved it so much I purchased the full perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fresh, a little sweet, and strong. Strong in the sense that while it is smells subtle, it lasts a while, and people around you will definitely notice.</li>
