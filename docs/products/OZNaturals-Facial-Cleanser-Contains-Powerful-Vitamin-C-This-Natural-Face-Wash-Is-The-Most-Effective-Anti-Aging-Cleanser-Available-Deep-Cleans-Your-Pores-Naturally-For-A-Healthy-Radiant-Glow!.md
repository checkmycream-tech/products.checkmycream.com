<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  Skin feels so soft and clean after using it.  No scrubbing to remove eye makeup or lipstick. It just melts off it seems! Love!</li>
    <li> Works great! As described. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> this cleanser irritates my eyes a lot.  I will not recommend this to someone who has sensitive eyes..</li>
    <li> Do not like it at all. I feels like a very cheap hand soap. No no no....</li>
    <li> I love all these OZ products. Just knowing I am putting good natural products onto my skin feels good. Just ordered my second bottle. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I obviously did not see any results after finishing a whole tube, and it IRRITATES your eyes a lot.</li>
    <li> Great company, great products! I am always looking for clean, healthy and effective products and I have not been let down by OZ Naturals. Love this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this facial cleanser!  It cleans my skin and leaves it bright, soft and smooth.  I will be being Oz naturals in my next cleanser purchase.  Good for all skin types due to it being all natural - free of parabens and sulfates.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser by OZ Naturals that I received for review, I love that it lathers like a soap but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like some of the other harsh cleansers I have tried in the past. It has a light citrus scent that reinforces the Vitamin C power in it and my favorite part is how clean my skin feels after each use. It is a nice size too and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m glad I have this cleanser!! Now I just need to try their moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always willing to review cleansers for companies because I&#x27;m always in need. I absolutely loved this one! I feel that my face is brighter because of it. I feel cleaner than what I normally do and not as oily.</li>
    <li> Anti-oxidants in a rinse off cleanser are a scam. To have any affect they must stay on your face.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling clean with nothing left behind.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! Makes your skin feel amazing. I highly recommend this as well as all their other products.</li>
    <li> it dries up your skin.</li>
    <li> Worst products ever. I have no idea how this brand can garner all these positive reviews. I bought 4 of their products all I got was very agitated skin and acne that I have ceased to have since I was 15. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive oily skin and this has really helped my skin. I&#x27;ve used proactive for years and this beats it. With proactive I felt I was over medicating my face and skin and this is light and natural. Great product</li>
    <li> Great buy for acne/oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, let me say that the packaging of the OZ products are great and the size is just right. I have been using this cleanser for a while, and as someone with oily and acne prone skin, I always have a difficult time buying a cleanser because either they leave my skin too oily due to the oils added in the formula, or they make my skin so dry that within 3 days I am peeling  off, and when I apply foundation my face looks a mess. Thankfully, this cleanser has been great. It smells amazing, keeps my skin clean, fresh, and yet dry and soft for many hours. I use it twice a day because my schedule is crazy, but used combined with my oil free make up, prevents my skin from shinning towards the end of the day, which is something my other cleansers could not provide me. Nevertheless, this is not an exclusive acne treatment product, so it works great for other skin types as well. This is a must item, and I definitely recommend it as an effective, and the best of all &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> This face wash is great. It smells wonderful and it just seems to make my skin GLOW! I have roscea on my right cheek and while it isn&#x27;t clearing it up I have noticed it&#x27;s not as red. Also it hasn&#x27;t seemed to upset my sensitive skin. Overall I love this product and will for sure be picking some up for myself and my mom. The product is 72% organic which is a huge plus for me because I actually like to be able to know what items are going into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample for review, regardless all opinions are my own. I would never endorse a product that I would not use myself.</li>
    <li> One of the best face cleaners I have ever bought. And I have tried a lot!! Refreshing, really makes your face feel and look clean. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Flatline - just blah.  Nothing special, definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I currently use OZ brand face serum and really love it. I decided to try their Vitamin C face cleanser to see if I liked it as well. Let me preface this by saying that I am a product junkie, am willing to pay a higher price for good skin care, am extremely picky about what I use on my skin, as I believe it is so extremely important to take good care of our skin, and have somewhat sensitive skin. I have used this facial cleanser now for a couple weeks and I really love it. It makes my skin feel so clean, soft and smooth. It also smells nice. I use this nightly and follow with OZ serum and my nightly moisturizer. I am extremely impressed with the results so far.</li>
    <li> Been using this for sometime, it is working my sun spots on my face are slowly  deminishing.  Love my Oz</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed! Just like any other cleanser just more expensive!</li>
    <li> Really love this cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry like so many others.</li>
    <li> Smooth my skin and lighten my dark spots good product. Just need to make product a bigger size.</li>
    <li> This I really love. It is smooth, looks like honey from the container, smells like freshly dried sheets when the come off the clothesline in the summer. Feels great, not drying on my face.</li>
    <li> Simply put it!!!!!  Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad but little irritates my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on Skin Deep database and the recommendations from this page....This a a GREAT product. It&#x27;s gentle, mild and I can see a significant difference in just a few days I have been using it. My pores are smaller and less visible. My dark spots are brighter and my pimple marks are lighter. I have acne prone skin and I can already tell that acne will no longer be an issue for me. This is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use this with Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum &amp; retinol moisturizer &amp; hydrating spray. First use skin is significantly softer, glowing. Several weeks in, fine lines are fading; people ask me what I&#x27;m using. Unsurpassed quality/ingredients at a great price. Outstanding customer service - answer product questions, etc. Dr. Oz has created a line of natural skincare that is my new standard. Oh! and the undereye cream *works* - no more dept store products/prices/ingredients for me! I have sensitive skin - no issue there at all.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to do a fine job cleansing my face, however I had two issues with it. The first, and less important, issue was the smell. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell of this product, but it was definitely something that could be gotten over considering that it isn&#x27;t on your face for very long. My big issue was the packaging. After the first time I used it, the flip top lid broke and got all over the rest of the items in my gym shower bag.</li>
    <li> I have super long hair and have always needed an additional product for anti-frizz. Not since using this conditioner. The matching shampoo helps too!</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Cleanser  is a really great anti-aging cleanser and probably one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it with my Soniclear by Michale Todd True Organics and it gives a deep clean while providing vitamins and minerals that help my skin really glow. It&#x27;s a cloudy colored gel with no scent and there are no irritants in it like a lot of the scented facial washes seem to have. You get a deep clean without having to use those rough microderm abrasive cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received product sample for review</li>
    <li> This is a terrific cleanser!  It lathers easily  and does a great job of removing dirt and traces of makeup.  I use it after I have removed my makeup with a creamy cleanser.  It is definitely gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> What scent is everyone talking about? I just recieved the cleanser today and the smell it has is like a metallic smell to it. Did I even get the original product? I was very optimistic about this cleanser but I would have loved the nice scent to it too. The cleanser itself is nice so far. I washed my face twice with it and I like it. I will update very soon with my experience tho. But I wish it smelled good :(</li>
    <li> I really like how it feels on my skin when I wash my face. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like manmade chemicals or make my skin feel dry worths 5 stars. And I just start to notice how my skin looks better after I have been using it for over a month.</li>
    <li> I purchased OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser Contains Powerful Vitamin C, OZ Naturals Facial Mask, OZ Naturals -  Retinol Moisturizer Contains 2.5% Retinol Cream, Vegan Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + VITAMIN B5 and OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyaluronic Acid Serum, four items total.  I&#x27;m 48, light brown skin black American.  I want anti aging and skin brightening products.  Now, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve already have gotten some hot days here in DC which my skin tends to oil up compared to winter months, but I got a pimple above my right eye brow, then two small pimples on the left side  of my of the jaw, which I do use a rotary razor.  Then another one where I shave left side side face.  I&#x27;m light brown skin and don&#x27;t&#x27; have severe acne, but they may pop up here and there. Today, I have another small pimple right side shaving area. But before OZ, I used another brand which uses all natural 100%, men anti aging; don&#x27;t know if I should name it, RSVP. But I thought I would try OZ.  RSVP products were used during winter when my skin is dry, not oily and no problems.  I have some pigmentation spots due to chicken pocks when I was 19, so they didn&#x27;t totally go away. But my face looked pretty good.  So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll return OZ or stick it out. On my second week at least with the products.  I don&#x27;t think my face can take a lot of lotions and creams, maybe with the warm days, oily skin and such, my pores getting clogged. I do a mud facial mask and use apricot face scrub too; store brands.</li>
    <li> Very effective and gentle cleansing product.  Will re-order</li>
    <li> Great cleansing product.  I love that this also combines the benefits of vitamin c.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but liking it so far. If that changes I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> I have used some of the Best cleansers on the market . I used Purity from Philosophy for years . This cleanser , hands down is the BEST I have ever used !! It takes away makeup , dead skin , and afterwards your skin is clean and baby soft . I will Definately be buying it again !!! I was given this product to Honestly review . I love it , try it you will also .</li>
    <li> Smell is okay - on the unpleasant side&lt;br /&gt;it stings like a motha trucker if it gets in your eyes, more than anything ive used before!&lt;br /&gt;its an alright product, doesnt do much, it is okay for taking off makeup, but needs extra help like with a toner.&lt;br /&gt;i am starting to break out, and am not sure if it is from this product, but in time I will update my review -- as for my skin it is combination (cheeks a little on the dry side and oily t-zone, and i have acne, but mild although cystic sometimes around my time of the month but usually just normal pimples)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a month on changes to my skin while using this product</li>
    <li> Ingredients not compatible to my skin</li>
    <li> I love the foamy action and the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I have always used a facial cleanser, but I have allergies and chemical sensitivites so sometimes I start sneezing after I cleanse or my skin becomes irritated.  But I have NOT had any problems with this OZ Naturals cleanser, and I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;Currently I have this product on my sink and use it almost every day to take off my makeup.  There is a nice light scent which occurs naturally, no added fragrances of course, and it feels refreshing to use.&lt;br /&gt;I always look for skin care that is as natural as possible, for a reasonable price.  The cleansing is effective and makes my face feel refreshed.  Now that I am in my 30&#x27;s I appreciate the anti-aging qualities that this provides as well.  I am hoping that my increased efforts to care for my skin now will pay off in the future with less signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this cleanser.  My face feels well cleansed and maintains it&#x27;s moisture.</li>
    <li> Not a good product wouldn&#x27;t buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Skin feeling hydrate, firm and soft.</li>
    <li> Love This Will Order Again</li>
    <li> Overall, it is a good product.  It helps me my skin soft and clean.  I have enjoying the feeling after washing my face.  One downside is the cap of the tube is not securely closed no matter how tightly I have tried it.  It keeps leaking the content although it is just small amount.  It made my bathroom messy.</li>
    <li> Very drying but I use it e/o day now to help avoid that dryness. Hoping it will be of better use to me in the summer when my skin is a bit oilier.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Just love this facial cleaner.... it does not dry my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;I can avoid spraying my face with a thermal spring water after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C facial cleaner keeps my skin moisturize and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my new favorite facial cleaner product... will sure keep using it, no regret of my choice :-)</li>
    <li> This is a great Natural product. As a man I use to use those 3 on one shampoo on my face and i got to say this face wash is by far one of the best i have ever used. As soon as i was exfoliating it off of my face i felt the difference. My face felt so smooth and soft. And the blackheads on my nose are starting to disappear little by little.</li>
    <li> OZ cleanser burned my face &amp; cause painful red bump like blisters. I&#x27;m yellow toned and this product left my face very red &amp; uneven looking. This stuff really burns &amp; stings after application. Thought the burning &amp; redness would get better over time but it&#x27;s getting worse. Do not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen any changes at all in my skin.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling my entire teen/ adult life (31 years old) to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and doesn&#x27;t dry me out. I have tried everything from over the counter brands you get at target/walmart to higher end products such as obagi skin care, chanel gel purete, arbonne, bioelements, to even Cindy Crawford meaningful beauty. etc. I decided to give this a try and I am so glad I did. I just ordered my second tube, and OZ Naturals has a customer for life. My skin is not dry and my break outs have been contained. I am so so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using their exfoliate, and I am about to purchase the Vitamin C serum for hyper-pigmentation I got while pregnant (baby is now almost a year and it never faded) I have loved their product so far, and cannot wait to slowly add their entire line. I would recommend this to anyone in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> clean, clear and bright shiny skin</li>
    <li> SImple cleanser, works for me, inexpensive and does the job. A little product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t any better than any store bought cleanser</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 4 months.  I am not overwhelmed but this product however, I have noticed some improvement in my skin but not much in the way of reducing any wrinkles.  It has helped minimize my breakouts.  I feel good using it compared to most other cleansers I have used.  The fragrance is on the bitter side but not intolerable. The only downside is I have noted random rough patches show up near my jawline and cheeks.  I never really had those prior to use this product so I am not sure if it is a result of the product or just new changes in my skin as I start to age.  I am going to stick with it for a while and will be trying some other OZ products to complement this cleansing regimen.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is a mostly clear liquid with a slight tint to it.  It has a light scent which I can’t quite identify.  I am not crazy about the scent but it is light and fades pretty quickly.  Just a small amount of cleanser is needed with water for the face.  It doesn’t lather as well as some.  The cleanser has initially worked well at cleaning my face without drying out the skin.  It so far has not irritated my skin and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased for a friend. I don&#x27;t know how well the product worked!</li>
    <li> Really great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Very gentle face wash leaving my skin feeling fresh and clean</li>
    <li> Works well for keeping face clear of blemishes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!! It leaves my face smooth &amp; clean. It even kept my hormonal breakouts gone. My skin tone is even &amp; skin is radiant. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars because I have not used it long enough to give a review.</li>
    <li> This cleanser leaves my face feeling really clean.  It is thicker than their Ocean Mineral Cleanser and easier not to squeeze too much out of the tube.  I do like the squeaky clean feel but need to apply moisturizer very soon or my face starts feeling dry.  I use it alternately with the Ocean Mineral Cleanser, which seems to clean a bit more gently.</li>
    <li> Great .... Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used ...</li>
    <li> I liked it, but the cap easily broke off so now the liquid spills everywhere in my makeup case when I travel &amp; all over my sink at home.  Good regular facial cleanser though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it was cleaning your face any better than a store brand.</li>
    <li> Noticed a positive difference on my skin within two weeks. My brown spots have lightened and it has helped even out the texture of my skin. Would definitely recommend and purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this product and the entire OZ Naturals line.  I use many of the products (serums and moisturizers) but never really gave cleanser a second thought until I tried this product.  It&#x27;s a great product if you are looking for a more natural and organic cleaner to put on your skin rather than chemicals that harm the environment.  Will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It feels like it cleanses deeply without drying my skin.  I will definitely buy more when it is gone.</li>
    <li> this product is ok for my face, but it stimulates my eyes when I use it, so don&#x27;t open your eyes before you wash it out completely.</li>
    <li> I  just started to  use this product but I can see a difference. My face looks  fresh and clean and little bit more less  wrinkles after I put serum and moisturizer</li>
    <li> To be fair, I have only used the OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser for a few days so far, however was really disappointed with the fragrance.  I was hoping for at least a hint of natural orange or lemon but instead it has an almost medicinal smell ..... not overwhelming, just not in the least bit citrusy.  I also don&#x27;t like the fact that it can&#x27;t be used to clean off eye make-up since it will have a stinging effect.  I was aware of that problem when I ordered, Just didn&#x27;t think it would be such a big deal to have to use 2 different products to clean my face, but it kind of is.  Hopefully upon using the product for a greater length of time, the pros will outweigh the cons on this cleanser. For now, I will just rate it as being &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Whatever is in this cleanser cleared up my skin and keeps it clear.</li>
    <li> Super disappointing, this product is not good for acne prone oily skin, it contains olive oil which can clog pores, not only that but is so damn expensive, I regret buying this, never agin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser actually helped with my mild acne prone skin. It does foam up quite a bit, and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foaming cleansers, but my skin did not have any negative reactions to this product. I didnt notice any improvement in skin tone or texture, but it was gentle enough on my skin not to cause any breakouts. It also has a nice smell to it. This product arrived on time. I am not sure if I would order this again, but I would try more products from OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> Seem to be doing a good job cleaning up my face.It burn a little when rubbing it on your face but it leaves your face tingling clean and refreshing after use.</li>
    <li> Has done nothing for my skin but break me out. I have very oily acne prone skin and every time i used this,i would break out. Very expensive also, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> not sure , but i expected more from this product</li>
    <li> I am SO happy with this  OZ Naturals Vitamin C Cleanser!  It&#x27;s a wonderfully gentle cleansing gel that lathers nicely, cleans my skin very well, rinses off without leaving any slimy feeling, leaves my face feeling squeaky clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out in the process.  In fact, after washing with this cleanser my skin feels softer than it has in a long time and I&#x27;m seeing far less blackheads, so it must be cleaning my pores out better than my former cleansers did, and that makes me very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin C facial cleanser is full of vitamins, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and essential fatty acids that help reduce and repair the damage free radicals do to our skin, while also improving cell function, increasing collagen production, improving elasticity, correcting dark spots, and reducing fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the key ingredients and what they do:&lt;br /&gt;1. Topical vitamin C has now been shown to provide up to eight times the skin&#x27;s natural protection from UV damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM): This sulfur compound is stored in every cell in the body where it forms an important structural component. MSM is thought to be especially beneficial to hair, skin, nail and joint renewal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Rose Seed Hip Oil: Rosehip seed oil regenerates the skin, reduces scars and wrinkles, prevents the advancement of wrinkles and aging. Helps skin to regain its natural color and tone. Rosehip seed oil contains Vitamin A, which helps to delay the effects of skin aging, assists with cell regeneration, and promotes collagen and elastin levels. Rosehip seed oil also contains a high amount of essential fatty acids and Vitamin E, which further promotes healthy skin tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Tea Tree Oil: Has the potential to improve your skin by treating acne, psoriasis, eczema and many other conditions. Contains anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antiseptic properties that work to heal many kinds of skin ailments. Soothing properties for red, inflamed skin while also helping get rid of dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Aloe Vera: Soothing and can reduce skin inflammations, treats acne, contains antioxidants such as beta carotene, vitamin C and E that can help improve the skin&#x27;s natural firmness and keep the skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and have learned to be particular about what you use on your skin, then you&#x27;ll appreciate know that Oz Naturals Vitamin C Facial Cleanser is made in the USA in a state of the art FDA registered facility and all of the ingredients they use come from either the US or France - none comes from China!  In addition, this cleanser is 72% organic, does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates, and is completely cruelty free (no animal testing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product at no cost for evaluation and testing, and I&#x27;m so glad I did because it works very well for me and I love it. It&#x27;s safe for daily use, for all skin types, and works equally well for men or women. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover this years ago. Seriously, the sooner you start using this instead of harsh products that strip your skins natural oils like soaps do, the better.  The same for the antioxidant protection this cleanser provides - the sooner the better.  I&#x27;m using this twice daily followed by rose water toner, vitamin c serum and a good moisturizer every evening.  I think this is helping my skin look and feel much more youthful and I believe you&#x27;ll like it too!kin cells.  5.

    <li> Love the vitamin C cleanser on my 44 year old skin! Does&#x27;t dry out my face and smells great! Can&#x27;t wait to try more of the Oz naturals</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the fact that OZ naturals does NOT test on animals. That&#x27;s a huge win for me. Great face wash..a little pricey. But like it.</li>
    <li> Does a very good job of cleansing my face. Can feel the difference after each use.  I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> Best product for cleaning, face and neck look smooth and very clean. Love the smell!</li>
    <li> This is a great face cleanser - love the smell and the texture it makes my skin!!!</li>
    <li> like the way it cleans my face</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for only two weeks now and already my skin looks better. I can tell it is softer,too. And my T- zone isn&#x27;t quite so shiny anymore. The scent is pleasant and not mediciny or sweet.</li>
    <li> I love all the OZ Naturals&#x27; products. The quality is just as good, if not better, than the much higher priced products I&#x27;ve tried. The Facial Cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or strip the oils, but leaves my skin smooth and clean. I only use in the evening, but it&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice a day, if desired.</li>
    <li> Love this and all the oz natural products</li>
    <li> soso, not so good, so four star</li>
    <li> this product is good for my oil skin and it feels fresh and comfortable</li>
    <li> did not like this product .I needed something different.&lt;br /&gt;  thank you  claudine bigelow</li>
    <li> This is a awesome product. It makes your face feel so clean</li>
    <li> Good product. Great for spouse. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! I purchased it based on the reviews and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I noticed a difference immediately. My skin was much smoother. I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Too strong for me. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals entire product line is just great..and the cleanser is no exception. Gentle, effective and a terrific value.</li>
    <li> its a OK product! its not frothy as i was hoping. it feels like a serum. I probably wont buy it again</li>
    <li> Ordered the same item twice (was happy after the first order, obviously). The second time around, received a different substance; different color and smell. Disappointed in such a big inconsistency.</li>
    <li> THIS is my second purchase of this clenser&lt;br /&gt;I think it is working,I was seeing some&lt;br /&gt;Uneveness around my chin area.but has&lt;br /&gt;Gotton clearer, and is gentle enough for&lt;br /&gt;Everyday use.I wish it was&#x27;nt so expensive&lt;br /&gt;But is a decent product.I don&#x27;t know If I order&lt;br /&gt;Again after the summer.</li>
    <li> I like the lathering and the feel of this cleanser, however, it burns the hell out of your eyes! I noticed that quickly. Even if you don&#x27;t get it IN your eyes, any where near them, it effects them.</li>
    <li> Really great face wash.  No strong smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.  I can really tell a big difference after using it for just a month or so.  My skin is smooth and blemish free.  Even some wrinkles have disappeared.</li>
    <li> Love this and all OZ products.  Removes make-up well and leaves skin feeling soft with just a hint of tightness.  Pleased with results.  Follow with OZ serum and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it made my face breakout. My son now&#x27;s uses it and he likes It. I did feel like It cleaned my face just maybe wrong for my skin.</li>
    <li> I got to try out the facial cleanser from OZ Naturals. The cleanser does not have a smell, which I prefer and liked. I tried it out for four days and I liked how it made my face feel refreshed. I started seeing results. It definitely does clean my face very well and gets rid of dirt. I would recommend this product to someone whose suffering from acne problems. Since, it is hard to find products that clean the face, but I feel like this product helps.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and have become obsessed with skincare. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and love using vitamin serums and moisturizers. The reviews for the face wash were great so I thought I&#x27;d love it the same as the other vitamin c products that I use. An hour after I washed my face, it was completely greasy and oily all over again. With continued use, I have started breaking out. It has been 2 weeks of twice a day use and my skin is more oily and breaking out more every day. I gave it a fair shot and allowed my skin to adjust to a new product, but this is absurd. If othe OZ products are like this, forget it! I&#x27;ll stick to Clinique Oil Control Facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very taken aback by the size of the bottle when I received it. I read the description but didn&#x27;t realize it would be so small. For the price alone, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this only a few days and so far I love it. It has a great scent, and really works well to clean without drying my face. I have oily skin, and it keeps my skin clean all day!</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner! Leaves my face soft and smooth without over drying.</li>
    <li> It made my face break out.</li>
    <li> This destroys Proactiv and all those other TV endorsed products.  For once I want left with dry, flaking skin with red marks.  This cleared it up in less than 2 days.  I used it twice a day with cold water and I got immediate results.</li>
    <li> I received this oz Naturals Facial Cleanser for free to give my honest opinion. I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I really love it. I have never use OZ Naturals Cleanser this is my first time using this product. I use this cleanser in the morning I wash me face with it. After I wash my face with OZ Naturals Cleanser I apply OZ Naturals vitamin c Serum after . With this two product I feel that my face is healthy.  I do this proses every day that I started using it and I Will continue doing it. So far I love this product.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin very soft and fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is gentle and a great way to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her to only substitute this for her witch hazel that she uses daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of a week, she noticed an overall softer and cleaner skin. Now she has a supple clean face that is ready for her nightly serum. I even used it on my manly skin, it left me with a refreshed feeling. Also, it did not dry my face out like soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides just cleaning the skin, there are special ingredients like aloe, vitamin c, and tea tree that will help to protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the gentle nature of the cleanser, it is safe for skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> Very nice face wash. Deep cleanse without over drying!</li>
    <li> Hated this. I have dry skin yet this cleanser made my skin look and feel oily and shiny.</li>
    <li> My favorite night cleanser. Love how clean my face feels after. I recommend using all the Oz products for best results. The Oz line totally changed my 50 yr old skin; more moisture, less adult acne, less wrinkles. Super happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this before applying the vitamin C serum. they work very well together. I keep it in the shower so I remember to use it every morning.</li>
    <li> This was to strong for my face.  My face became very dry with dark patches.  I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I love all the other OZ Naturals products except this facial cleanser. It is low/no foaming - and just didn&#x27;t seem to cleanse my face thoroughly. It just feels like its doing nothing. I usually use Origins foaming facial cleanser which lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling parched. In addition, the cap on my cleanser broke almost immediately so it won&#x27;t close properly and the product leaks if accidentally turned upside down (which is unfortunately since it means I have to try to prop it up on its narrow top side for storage in the shower).</li>
    <li> I think this Vitamin C facial cleanser by OZ Naturals is fabulous!!! I am always weary of trying new cleansers on my combo acne prone skin but I truly believe this is great for all skin types. My acne is clearing up but my skin is firm and radiant. What I noticed first was how clean my face looked and felt and pore size reduced immediately without drying out my skin nor oiliness. Just really balanced and my face was glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the consistancy of a gel but foams up on the face nicely and removes makeup really well. I am a skincare junkie so own tons of facial cleansers and rank this up in with my ultimate high end cleansers without the added price tag. I noticed firmer and brighter skin with lessened sun damage and I am using it regularly. This was my first Vitamin C cleanser; I use C serums on a daily basis and will never be without them EVER. My skin is bright and glowing. Vitamin C has amazing benefits for aging and sun damage as well as dull skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to look younger and have glowing skin then I highly recommend this cleanser to be added to your skincare regimen. I love the natural ingredients also; that is very important to me and that it is definitely effective. You cannot beat the price!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely looking into all of OZ naturals skincare products now; really impressed with the quality and price. The packaging is also nice; not cheap at all. Definitely high end luxury at an affordable price. I received this free for testing and review and opinions are 100% of my own. I love skincare and probably wouldn&#x27;t have known about OZ naturals without the opportunity to test and review. I had some doubts on the product living up to my expectation but I am VERY impressed that I am already looking at all the other products from this line as well. I want them all. Shipping was fast; seller was great and packaging safe. Thanks OZ Naturals! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it; I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> The best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Fair. I won&#x27;t buy again. It&#x27;s okay and I saw no changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> A great shower cleanser, easy on sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cleansers that I have yet to use. I have noticed that my skin and neck have improved and really gets all of my makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is pleasant and not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for a true and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Nope. Made my face break out and I&#x27;m still dealing with a blemish as a result of this expensive crap.</li>
    <li> nice product leaves your face fresh and glowing!!</li>
    <li> Love this clenser. When I saw my hair stylest after using this for a few weeks, she asked what I had done to my skin and that it looked awesome.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is awsome.  It leaves my skin very clean yet balance.  I have seen a major improve mentioned since I have been using it.  Thanks oznaturals</li>
    <li> This is a very nice foaming cleaner with a lot going for it .I loved working with it .and the vitamin C makes my skin look really sooth and ready for my other beauty products. It is great at cleaning off makeup  yet is so much more natural that other facial washes.&lt;br /&gt;This one give you 8 times the antioxidant protection so that makes it a really fantastic value . It has a nice natural clean scent and it easy to use and rinse off the face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for three days now and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have perfume, but it still feels so fresh. I have a sensitive skin, so I get breakouts easily if I don&#x27;t use right products. I use it with my Clarisonic Mia and I like the feeling of my skin squeaking in the morning. It definitely removes everything accumulated throughout the day on your face, which is very important for skincare routine. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Vitamin C is necessary in a cleanser. Does it really stay on the skin long enough to have any effect? Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main requirements in a cleanser revolve around my using it post-swimming:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It should come in a tube, so it&#x27;s easier to find and slip back in my shower tote.&lt;br /&gt;2. It should cut through the strong sunblock I put on my face before swimming.&lt;br /&gt;3. It should not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this product fits all three requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one thing I really like about these OZ naturals products is that each product is uniquely colored, for quick differentiation for those of us with imperfect vision. This orange is really orange and clearly says &amp;#34;Vitamin C.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I never find that the contents need shaking.</li>
    <li> I felt very disappointed by this product.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job at makeup removal and don&#x27;t get it anywhere near your eyes or you will be sorry.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great for my skin. I use it mainly on my face and my neck right before I get in the shower. I leave it on until the steam opens up my pores some, then rinse it off in a circular pattern. After, I use a moisturizer to keep my skin from drying out in the cold weather. I dont think my skin has been this soft in a long time. I gave up on a lot of other skin products, because they took so much time to work. I have work, school, house, and kids to take care of, I do not have a lot of time for a long beauty routine. I will stick with this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> Just a drop...I love this face wash.</li>
    <li> This cleanser smells fresh &amp; citrusy- it has a light pleasant scent! I usually wash with bar soap and water to get a really clean feeling, but, this liquid cleanser made my face feel equally clean &amp; not dried out like bar soap can. I am definitely going to switch to this formulation in the future because it is cruelty-free and effective!</li>
    <li> Little too strong for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels , glad I discovered oz naturals , the best products I have ever used !!</li>
    <li> My skin is amazing! It is getting easier and easier to find food and products that are not loaded with chemicals. Actually not so much for skin care products but it&#x27;s getting there thanks to OZ Naturals. I try to eliminate toxins in my food and in my life from my skin care products to my clothing to my household cleaning products. It is amazing how toxic our lives have become and how sick we all are. No one is going to take care of you but yourself. The doctors feed you jello in the hospitals, the government allows companies to poison you. It is up to you. I am so happy to have discovered OZ products. Not only are they good for you but they are not expensive! I have used cremes that cost four times the amount and had objectionable ingredients. I was diagnosed with Hep C in the 1980&#x27;s and MS 6 years ago. Both are gone now because of a pristine lifestyle, reading labels, and reducing the amount of poison in my life. If a healthy life is important to you you will do the same!</li>
    <li> the product was not as dicribed</li>
    <li> nice product, feels fresh, definitely want to keep away from eyes, not tear-proof!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed. I haven&#x27;t seen a different after switching from my previous face cleanser to this one. I may have expect to much since I have had such great results with the other Oz Natural products I use.</li>
    <li> After using this along with a few other OZ Naturals products for almost a month, I have to say that I&#x27;m very disappointed. None of them lived up to the hype. I like the idea that they&#x27;re all natural but I saw no results at all. Thank goodness for the 30 day money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of cleansing, and is pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> Before this, I didn&#x27;t even know that there was such a thing as an anti aging facial cleanser. Now that I&#x27;m just a year shy of forty, I need all the help I can get! I recently ran out of face wash so it was the perfect opportunity to try the Oz Naturals Vitamin C Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it contains Vitamin C, known to be good for your skin and I already use their Vitamin C Serum on my face. I like to use the same brands since they probably work best together. Here is their recommended skin regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;81eNgiei+6L._SL1500_&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do all of them every day but cleansing is a must! It comes in a tube where you squeeze out a small amount into your hand after you&#x27;ve wet your face and lather up! It doesn&#x27;t get super sudsy but does thicken as you scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight smell to it but not very strong and is gone when you rinse. The only way I can think to describe it is a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how easily it lathered and quickly it rinsed, leaving my skin feeling clean. I can&#x27;t guarantee that it has any anti aging effects since I&#x27;m using several products to fight aging but I do know my skin looks better since using all of their products. If you have to pick a facial cleanser, then why not get one with anti aging components?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also made to reduce the appearance of fine lines and sun spots. I do have one that has been reduced using a combination of products. I&#x27;m hoping I can completely eliminate it with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit pricier than the ones I used to buy at the drugstore at $26.99 but I&#x27;ve decided my skin is something worth spending money on! It&#x27;s the only face I get and I&#x27;d like to take care of it to keep it as youthful as possible. The Vitamin C Cleanser is a part of my routine and they are all working together to take care of my skin!</li>
    <li> This is one of THE most disappointing beauty products ever. If I had blind-tested this cleanser, I would have thought it was the cheapest of the cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Any drugstore brand I have tried is infinitely better. It doesn&#x27;t foam or cleanse decently and it smells bad. I&#x27;m tempted to throw it out, haven&#x27;t decided yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price &amp; all the glowing reviews, which I can&#x27;t begin to understand, I expected decent, at least - and it isn&#x27;t even close to decent. Beware. I also bought the toner, also terrible.</li>
    <li> It is good to my facial skin and good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C cleaner for over a week and I can&#x27;t believe how much different it has made to my face. My face is much softer and much more clear . I can&#x27;t wait to try another product by Oz Natural.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is great. It makes my skin look better than it ever has. My skin feels fresh and tingly and alive.</li>
    <li> I really liked this Cleanser. It smells good and feels really good on your face. It is easy to use and wash off. My face felt refreshed after using it. I would highly recommend and Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My face felt really clean and not dry after using this cleanser. No residue was left afterwards either... definitely recommend this one and I&#x27;m so happy that I was sent it to review!</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry skin but this makes it feel much healthier. Still looking for an astounding moisturizer to match this awesome wash. Hopefully, they can help me with that too!</li>
    <li> I have used it about a week and a half and it has completely dried my face and after I break out . My skin is very sensitive. I heard a lot of great things about this product but I guess I Wasn&#x27;t so lucky with this one. It was my first time trying it. I was so excited to try it too..</li>
    <li> Great product,  great price,  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love all their products so far.</li>
    <li> Cleans without drying, I am going to order again</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for a couple of weeks now and I am hooked.  I know it is a little expensive but all you need is a small dot about the size of your little fingertip.  It takes all the makeup off and tightens  your pores.  I honestly see a difference - really  and it saves me time since I don&#x27;t have to take my makeup off and then  wash my face. In the long run I have saved the price of the makeup remover as well. I wash my face with this cleanser at night and put  on my night cream and I am off to relax.</li>
    <li> Love it !  This works great. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The return policy should have provided me insight into the quality of the product line but I was too impressed with so many glowing reviews.(Now I wonder how many are real).  I also read a business news item about  the products flying off shelves and how well the company is doing.  Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  It&#x27;s a sham.  Did nothing for my skin.  Beware of companies that don&#x27;t back up their product with a generous return policy:  there is a reason</li>
    <li> This is an amazing face wash. It appears at first that it is very expensive, but you only need a very small amount. I use it most days and it has already lasted me nearly a month. My face feels very soft for the whole day and looks good for days to come. I would recommend this product and brand to anyone.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased OZ Naturals face moisturizer, Vitamin C cleanser, toner, and eye serum. I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years: I. Love. These. Products.&lt;br /&gt;Do they smell like the ocean? Yes. Is that a wonderful thing? No. Does my face look and feel better, clearer, and more even than ever before? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been a soap and Aveeno guy his entire life. I asked him to try it out and HE loves it! I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m going to copy and paste this review to the products I&#x27;ve listed above to avoid finding a new way to say the same thing!</li>
    <li> clease and refreashes my face and like the vitamin C</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser better than many others I&#x27;ve tried. It does not leave excess residue on skin.</li>
    <li> This product had no effect on my skin. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great. They don&#x27;t have any overpowering fragrance or any at all, and a little goes a long way. To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning. My forehead is completely smooth! Great products! I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients. They now only need to make a face scrub and sunscreen and then I am set :) Purchased the Vitamin C facial cleanser, Vitamin C 20% serum, Facial Toner, Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is really great! When I first tried it, I honestly didn&#x27;t think too much of the cleanser. But after using it again at the end of the day, after wearing makeup, I noticed how amazingly clean my skin felt! There was just the right amount of oil left in the skin to keep it healthy. This is surprisingly not too harsh for a Vitamin C cleanser, so I&#x27;m positive most people could use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested this cleanser on a variety of skin types, and I haven&#x27;t seen any harmful or bad results yet! In fact, everyone seems to love the subtle tightness they feel to their skin afterwards - and I agree! It&#x27;s a really great cleanser overall! Especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can say for sure, is I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell. It&#x27;s a TINY bit citrusy, but mostly kinda...off. Though the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin, so you&#x27;ll get over it! ;please&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[This product was sent to me for review purposes, though that does not affect my opinion in any way!]</li>
    <li> I must say I have tried many of the OZ Natural skin care products and every time each one has delivered as promise.  I love really &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; their products, they are alcohol, parabens, pabas and sulfate free(big plus.) It really cleanses my face and removes the makeup, dirt and leaves my face feeling refreshed.  I follow this up with the OZ Naturals vitamin c serum next.  It makes my skin so much smoother and radiant.  I also pair it with the OZ Naturals whole skin care regimen.....the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> I love vitamin C cleansers and serums. Used to make them myself using a DIY approach using ascorbic acid. Easier to get the ones and this is well packed in a dark bottle. Had no side effects and was excellent. A sample was sent in exchange of a review.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser--fresh citrus scent.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My face feels so soft. I am really liking this product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; Fresh cleansing.  I love all the OZ Naturals products we have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this OZ Naturals cleanser for a few weeks and I dig it. The vitamin C in it is supposed to be good for your face, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural, and 72% organic, which are big reasons to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little high, but I think it&#x27;ll last for awhile. I use this 4 times a week, and a facial scrub 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should probably update the review in a month or two after I&#x27;ve had a bit more time to test it, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Nice product and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser, it smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and squeaky clean. Since using it I have noticed a marked reduction in the size of the pores around my nose area, and my skin tone seems to have evened out. Products that WORK, amazing customer service, affordability AND organic?! Sign me up, OZ has a lifetime supporter in me!</li>
    <li> Did not help my skin at all and burns in my eyes like crazy</li>
    <li> I recently started using this line of OZ Naturals and I have to say my skin is looking and feeling really good. This cleanser removes light makeup (I don&#x27;t wear a foundation or heavy makeup so I am not sure how it handles that) It smells great and leaves your skin feeling fresh and preps it for serum and cream.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty solid beauty routine, and it always starts out with cleansing my face.  I love cleansing my face in the morning because it gives me that fresh &amp;#34;wake up&amp;#34; feeling!  With the OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser I don&#x27;t feel any harsh scrubbers trying to tear my skin off.  This is a great and a gentle cleanser, and that being said, it definitely has moisturizing properties that leave my skin feeling silky, soft and smooth all the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love wearing makeup, and I put it to the test by cleansing my face after a lot of makeup on, and I love how it removes every bit of it!  I have even used it with the Clarisonic cleanser, and it has made an amazing difference on my skin, more than any other cleansers that I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a very mild and a great pleasant scent to it, but since I know that this is an all natural product, it feels good to know that I am not smelling a fake fragrance that has been added to cover up the chemical smells that some other cleansers give off.  The only thing I wish is that I could order a bigger bottle of this cleanser!  Yes, it&#x27;s THAT good!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product it has beyond exceeded my expectations, i would recommend this product to anybody that wants to improve the look and texture of your skin.</li>
    <li> Face feels so clean with just alittle</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser; a tiny bit foams up nicely, leaves face a little dry actually, feeling very clean...definitely need moisturizer after cleansing. Feels like all the dirt/grime/make up is gone. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A light, fresh scent that was effective in removing all makeup.....the Vitamin C is an added bonus! Thought this cleanser was one of the best</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. Ingredients are very natural and no artificial color or fragrance. In general, it cleanses my face really well removing at least 90% of my makeup which is a good result compared to other good cleansers on the market. I follow it by the toner to remove the rest.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin very smooth and ready for my night regiment (serum and moisturizer). Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Overall a nice face cleanser.  It produces nice suds and has the slightest fresh scent.  I ordered the whole OZ Naturals line after my son was born and use it once a day - he&#x27;s 3 months old and I&#x27;m still using the original products.  It is a little more expensive than what I would normally buy at the drug store but it has lasted a long time and I like that the ingredients are natural and organic and that the product is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser. Didn&#x27;t leave skin feeling dry after washing like most do. Easily removes makeup. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I tried this cleanser several times before writing my review. I was expecting a better smelling cleanser - it&#x27;s not pleasant. I was really disappointed in the feeling that it gave my skin after each use. I didn&#x27;t feel as if it removed all of my makeup. It also left my skin feeling dry. I have oily skin and usually it takes a lot to make it even feel the slightest bit dry. I like a few of the other Oz Naturals skin care products but this cleanser is not one of them.</li>
    <li> This product is all natural, which is great; however my face didn&#x27;t like it very much...I would like for Oz to produce a cleaning oil</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out in a rash. I have never had that problem before.</li>
    <li> too expensive seem like a normal cleanser</li>
    <li> So far, I like the OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser.  I would like to see another toner and an exfoliator as well as a facial mask.</li>
    <li> Great product cleans away all the make up &amp; makes ur face feels fresh</li>
    <li> This cleanser leaves my skin feeling nice and squeaky clean without feeling stripped.  My complaint is that it burns my eyes and it&#x27;s almost impossible not to get in eyes because I use it in the shower.  If it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face nice and clean,A little goes a long way on one of those bathroom scrunches.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser and does what it says.  My skin is looking better each week.</li>
    <li> The product does not have a particular scent and is transparent. After few days of using this, i have notice remarkable changes on my face. It feels softer and i have not experience any over drying after using the product. Some of the minor acne scars i had from my breakout few years ago appeared to have lighten, which is a big plus. So giving this product 5 stars. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> run-of-the-mill cleanser - nothing special to report.</li>
    <li> I did some research and found that vitamin c oxidizes when it comes in contact with water.  Cleanser is great though and very gentle. I have sensitive skin and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of really expensive skin care lines (SKI, Natura Bisse&#x27;) and I must say this is right up with their results but at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser and the results however, it burns if it gets in my eyes.</li>
    <li> OZ naturals is the cosmetic company that I can trust. I am changing my products to OZ naturals one by one.</li>
    <li> fragrance free, refines pores, deep cleaning love it</li>
    <li> This cleanser lathers up well, and leaves my face feeling clean without feeling tight or dry. My skin is looking clearer and brighter with each use.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample for review.</li>
    <li> This is a amazing product! It makes my skin feel so soft and clean. It is very gently on my skin and does not sting at all. Has a great smell and I really enjoy using it everyday. I will be purchasing this product when I run out of the current! Highly Recommend! I was given this product free to test and I am giving my honest opinion! Don&#x27;t wait,try it today :)</li>
    <li> Such a failure product 👎🏼</li>
    <li> I like this product enough - it&#x27;s extra gentle on your skin. I personally need something with a little more acne treatment in it. If you are looking for a gentle skin cleansing product, this is great! I supplement it with another face wash, and a facial scrub. Works well!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! Works great &amp; leaves my face feeling so refreshed!</li>
    <li> I adore this company! I am not one to follow skincare regimes. I usually buy a couple cheap things a year, use half a bottle, see no results, and toss it in a drawer. And repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore! I started using the toner, Hyaluronic acid+ vitamin C serum, Vitamin C facewash, and Super Youth moisturizer twice a day a few weeks ago and have seen a great improvement in the texture, softness, redness and dryness of my skin. Most importantly, I saw a dramatic improvement in my nasolabial/marionette lines. I am 32 but have thin skin and spent many years working in the sun, and was considering fillers for the ever deepening lines from my nose to the outer edges of my mouth because of how they were aging me and making me look tired and unhappy.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to lessen them but they continued to get deeper and more pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of these products has saved me from the needle! The creases are much more shallow, smoother, and less noticeable after only a few weeks. And I am a skeptic, folks, but I LOVE this product line. It has saved my skin. Though they are powerful, they are not harsh. I have sensitive skin prone to redness around my nose and eyes, but this has evened it all out. It is gentle on skin but tough on signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to seal the deal, they are USA made, Vegan (no animal testing!), all natural, and the prices can&#x27;t be beat. You CAN afford an entire line of this stuff. I probably go through two entire bottles in a year of each product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser. Really gets all your makeup off without leaving face felling dry.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. And I thought it was too expensive. I would have continue to purchase if it had worked really well but it didn&#x27;t. Regular facial soap works better for me.</li>
    <li> It does leave your skin smooth, but it cannot take off the makeup very well</li>
    <li> Love the way all the OZ Naturals make my skin feel and look.  I use the cleanser, Retinol Moisturizer, C Serum, AHA Serum, Eye Gel, Amino Herbal facial mask, and the Retinol Serum.  The cleanser does not leave traces of make-up like other cleansers I have tried nor does it make my skin feel tight and dry.  I have always had oily skin but do not wake up in the morning anymore with an oily feel.  Of course I do not use all the products at once.  I have a morning and evening routine.  They last a very long time.  There is no need to overload.  2 drops of the AHA and 3 drops of the C Serum cover my face and neck.  Try these!  I think you will love them also!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cleanser and makes your skin feel very clean, unlike most cleansers I have used. It leaves a little shine and firmness to the skin. I waited a while to write this review to give it a fair chance and have noticed a nicer skin tone. This product also lasts a very long time...you only need to apply a very small amount, which is nice because you don&#x27;t need to purchase it on a monthly basis. I do believe if you use to much of this product it can have a slight drying affect to the skin (most likely becase it is vitamin c) so again I think a small amount is best. I am happy with this product and plan to purchase it again. Customer service is also very responsive and informative.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide if i like the facewash or not because I cannot get over the smell. I really dislike the smell. It looks like it should smell citrusy - it does not.</li>
    <li> Wanted t like this, but I find it a bit drying and no better than any other drug store brand.</li>
    <li> I just receive my purchase a couple of days ago, so far I love this cleanser. it gets into the deep surface of the skin .I am amaze at the way this product works. Highly recommend, It is a must buy!</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s clear and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s gentle and has a mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;- It makes my skin feel refreshed and it has started to help clear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full List Of Ingredients (72% Organic):&lt;br /&gt;Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Aloe Vera), Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine (from coconuts), Cocamide MIPA, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Olea Europaea (Olive Oil), Organic Rosa Canina (Rose Hip Oil), Borago Officinalis (Borage Oil), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange Peel Tincture), Origanum Compactum (Oregano Oil), Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review by: Oz Naturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC</li>
    <li> very good but SO expensive and it dries out my skin (I have oily skin ).</li>
    <li> 10 days back when I bought Oz naturals cleanser, I was a lil skeptical about using it as I had a severe adult acne break out and didn&#x27;t want to make it worse. But I went ahead and started using it and now my face looks a lot better. It&#x27;s the best cleanser for acne or for sensitive skin. I absolutely love it&#x27;s feel. I will recommend this to any one who wants to clear acne and looking for a gentle, effective cleanser.</li>
    <li> Before trying OZ cleansers I was using Dr. Hauscka. I wanted something natural but would deep clean my pores more. I started w OZ ocean cleanser it did just what I needed but I felt it was a little too drying on my skin so I just started using this vit C cleanser and am in love with it. Deep cleaning, doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin &amp; only after a couple days I can see an improvement in my complexion. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works fine and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  But watch out...it will burn your eyes if you aren&#x27;t careful!  I will use it (carefully) until it&#x27;s gone but will buy another brand going forward.</li>
    <li> My favorite all time cleaner!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using it but feel there are products on the shelf that would do the same.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now. It cleanses your face nicely but I dont notice any miracle changes in the way my skin looks. I am 29 years old and have a few sun spots I would love to fade but this product is just not doing that for me. That being said, it cleanses dirt and makeup off nicely and makes my skin feel clean and soft. Don&#x27;t get this in your eyes even a little bit! You will definitely regret it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s all natural (no animal testing which is quite the BONUS these days). I love the way it makes my face feel and I&#x27;ve noticed quite a bit of brightening up and even some of my &#x27;brown spots&#x27; fading. I don&#x27;t know how or why this stuff works, but it does. I&#x27;m pushing 60 and I can use all the help I can get. I adore OZ Naturals products.</li>
    <li> Love this product. No more acne since I started using this.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial wash I use. It provides deep cleansing and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
    <li> Terrific cleanser!  You can&#x27;t ask for much more in a cleanser, it removes my mascara, I use just dab and my dry skin feels comfortable and oh so soft after use.</li>
    <li> Leaves my  oily skin bright and really clean without that stripped dry feeling, I&#x27;m only a few days in and I am a fan</li>
    <li> Definitely brightens the completion I love how clean the skin feels without drying. I ve already reordered.</li>
    <li> I got 3 Oz natural products for my wife and she is hooked!  She is using this as a cleanser as she has a few sun blemishes as she is fair skinned (a red head).  She said it makes her skin feel refreshed and seems to firm up her skin.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is light and fresh and is gentle on my skin. It thoroughly but gently cleanses my face and isn&#x27;t harsh at all. I like that all the dirt, grime and impurities are gone and my pores feel so clean and renewed. It includes soothing aloe so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin but leaves it feeling hydrated and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> This Oz Naturals Vitamin C Cleanser really is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve come across...leaves skin with that fresh bright look without being a bit drying...gentle enough to use in both your morning &amp; evening routine...very pleased with this purchase &amp; plan to continue using long term....</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve sensitive and combination skin and this is perfect. It conditions, softens and cleanses the skin. Will definitely but it again. A real deal for this price! I previously use eucerin, la Roche posay and kiehls</li>
    <li> This gentle yet effective cleanser comes out of the tube as a simple gel, lathers up well, and gets my skin exceptionally clean of oils  without stripping it or making my skin feel dry or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle cleanser, but that cleanser has such a strong scent that even though I like how it works, I find it occasionally makes me sneeze. This cleanser by contrast, has very little scent; just the natural scent of the ingredients. I appreciate this. Who wants their facial cleanser to perfume their skin? I can wear perfume for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I noticed fewer breakouts when using this cleanser, and yet no tight, dry feeling. It&#x27;s a great all-purpose cleanser for people like me with combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to test; opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This cleanser will get your face squeaky clean and feeling amazing!  I wear makeup everyday so finding a cleanser that will take all of it away while keeping my skin moisturized is pretty important. This does not lather up like a foam but it does suds up nicely and feels so silky smooth. I think it is also important that it is paraben free. I got this product to review and I think this will be my new go to facewash. This is a natural product that will leave your skin feeling amazing and provides extra vitamin c to keep it looking amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about two months. I&#x27;m 30 and have combination skin. My skin goes between oily, to somewhat dry, to annoying bouts of breakouts. This lathers very nicely for a gel like substance. It smells super nice, too. After the first time I used it, it made my skin super soft. After a while of use, I noticed that I needed to apply more moisturizer as it tended to dry out my skin. Nothing too serious though. I read all the rave reviews about it being so helpful with acne, which is the main reason I purchased it. I used to get horrible cystic acne, the deep, under the skin, painful, takes forever to go away kind of acne. I will say that since I started using this, I have yet to get that kind of acne. I still do however breakout occasionally, but nowhere near like I used to. It&#x27;s not a miracle wash, but I will say it&#x27;s extremely helpful. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skins quality as others had said. No youthful glow, no disappearing fine lines, and no firmness. I&#x27;m hoping with time, maybe I will see more of an improvement as vitamin C is pretty darn good for the skin. I also feel as though it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as much as I&#x27;d like it to. I will say that this is a fairly good face wash though. Better than any other natural face wash I&#x27;ve used before. And way better than any other drugstore brand you can find. The verdict is still out on this one for me but in my opinion it has more pros than cons so I most likely will be purchasing again. But I honestly can&#x27;t rave about it as much as others have. It&#x27;s a pretty good face wash though, worth a try.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, cleans skin amazingly</li>
    <li> I do like this facewash. A little goes a long way. My skin feels softer after using it. I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker or anything. I usually use my facewash to remove eye make up but you can&#x27;t do that with this or it will leave your eyes stinging for a minute. The smell is very faint, which is a good thing in my opinion. I like to use several different products so right now I switch between 3 different facewashes. This has lasted for several months so far and would probably last 3 months for an every day user. It does not leave a residue film.</li>
    <li> My review is based on 6 weeks usage.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely mild fresh scent and has light gel texture. When you put it on your skin it becomes less gel-like, it feels cool and liquefies upon contact. When you rub it in it looks like a thin layer of soap on your skin, which is easily washed off. You only need a few drops to cover the face and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;It really does give you a nice deep cleanse. The skin feels softer, cleaner and a lot more refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say OZ Naturals seems to really becoming a  massive contender in the skincare business. Their products are of superb quality and do what it says on the box.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of OZ Naturals for purposes of review.</li>
    <li> I really like these products, they seem to be very effective and working!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
