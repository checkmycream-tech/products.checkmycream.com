    <li> I love this parfum!  I get so many compliments when I am wearing it.  I just wish the scent lasted longer.  It seems to fade over just a few hours.</li>
    <li> i got the perfume in a large bottle, as i knew from before that i like it.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a very feminine, fresh, flowery fragrance, good for day and nigh-time. i love the jasmine and lilly of the field notes.&lt;br /&gt;it stays a long time- i can smell it on my skin even after the shower.</li>

    <li> Heavenly roses and &amp;#34;guerlainade&amp;#34; base. Gorgeous, I get many compliments! Can&#x27;t go wrong, but also try the Lilas and Jasmin Duet, too!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume... but it smells a lot like Narciso Rodriguez Eau de Parfum. The price is great! Would buy it again...</li>
    <li> the fragrance is something that you wouldn&#x27;t want to miss. the packaging was perfect and intact. I recommend this product to every lady that loves smelling good and expensive. its a 5 star perfume</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I did not know that the shipment perfume banned in my country I did not own this beautiful fragrance that he bad feeling</li>
    <li> Fast and as described. Absolutely positive.</li>
    <li> I love Guerlain perfumes. Been using them since Shalimar. Have a soft floral, citric scent to them. I frequently get questions about the scent that I&#x27;m wearing</li>
    <li> Lovely French parfume, worth the price. came shipped well, I Love the parfume&amp; the designer bottle. You&#x27;ll feel Sexy in this parfume.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It not change the fragance in my skin.</li>
    <li> The 3.4 ounce bottle arrived in a package with a tube of the body lotion. The box was sealed and looked authentic. Some reviewers are saying that this is a fake. I&#x27;ll have to go to Saks or Neiman Marcus or Disneyland (Marie Antoinette&#x27;s Parfumerie!) to compare. Will comment later. The bottle sprays a fine mist. I&#x27;m thinking a fake wouldn&#x27;t work this nicely. Anyway, I&#x27;ve become a fan of parfumeur Thierry Wasser. This scent is delightful.</li>
    <li> I knew this product long before and I made an informed decision, I have to say that it smells really nice, and I love it, I ordered it and the shipping was really fast, I received it in 3 days, BUT I think that the product was opened before! :(, the way the plastic wrap and box are looking, I believe that it was opened and not sealed. I hope that it&#x27;s not one of those Chinese fake products...</li>
    <li> A nice floral scent, not heavy nor sweet. Delicate an subtle. It can be used the whole year round, day or night.</li>
    <li> WOW! This perfume is awesome! It smells exactly like what you would purchase in department stores. So soft and elegant! I will definitely purchase this one again.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Brown</li>
    <li> Great price, great perfume!</li>
