<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The size of the product has been cut down. I Initially ordered on QVC and the soap size was larger. Product is still excellent!</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES these...</li>
    <li> This was a gift to nephews that love rocks.  They found each one was different in shape and color.  Finding out they were soap was even more exciting.  The nephews&#x27; ages are 4, 6 &amp; 8 and all of them loved this gift.</li>
    <li> I was totally disappointed when I received these rock soaps, because of their small size.  They are so much smaller than rock soaps you typically see in gift shops.  I had intended to give them to someone as a Christmas gift, but felt they were not good enough to be a gift. They definitely are not a good value.</li>
    <li> I rated the soap rocks 4 star because I thought I was buying the same ones I purchased many times before but they are actually the palm stones and 1/3 the size of the ones I have been purchasing. They are the only ones (and I have tried many) that keep my hands from drying out and skin from peeling. Excellent product for troubled hands and fingers.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a birthday gift for my geologist friend and these are perfect.  Three of them look fairly real, but more colorful than real rocks, and the fourth is nice looking, but not very rock-like.  They have a nice scent and will make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I love the Soap Rocks set, they cool !!!</li>
    <li> I expected some variations but nothing like what I got.  I ordered 2 sets and BOTH sets had 3 soap rocks that were colored,  completely clear &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; with absolutely no striations whatsoever.  Nothing remotely like what the picture shows.  Each set had (only) 1 rock that had any striations.  That one rock in each set had the turquoise/white/black stripe.  I guess the manufacturer felt that if you got one decent rock, you&#x27;d be satisfied.  I  have ordered several sets of soap rocks before and have been very happy.  This company&#x27;s picture is very deceptive.  ORDER YOUR SOAP ROCKS FROM ANOTHER COMPANY!!!</li>
    <li> Cute little soap sampler. They are small and only last a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> These soaps were disappointing in that they are so very small.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to find a good sized bar of the turquoise soap bar that&lt;br /&gt;has the dark brown line through it.  It is the only one that has a&lt;br /&gt;scent to it.  I was given such a bar and was trying to replace it so&lt;br /&gt;when these tiny little pieces of soap arrived I was sorry I had&lt;br /&gt;purchased them.</li>
    <li> Quick service, but I did not receive the pretty blue or purple rocks.  I got two of the green and two of the red.  I still gave it four stars because I like the flexibility of getting a set to give as gifts to co-workers.</li>
    <li> They are small and last about a week or two. My favorite one is the amethyst. Great scents. But I really like my soap bigger..it&#x27;s a good sampler!</li>
    <li> I love soap rocks, so I was excited to find a set of 4 on here.  But, the are small palmstones, not actual rocks as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these soaps for almost 20 years. I always shop around for the best deals and have bought them through Amazon often. I love these soaps.</li>
    <li> The size of these is TINY.  You are paying over $4 and ounce for soap!  Don&#x27;t assume these are the big, beautiful soap rocks you would buy in the gift store.  The four of them together don&#x27;t make one of the regular sized bars.</li>
    <li> These are really gorgeous, and I&#x27;m glad I ordered them in a group this way b/c the singles were beyond expensive considering you&#x27;re buying soap.  They work well, have a nice smell to them, and are still lasting now.  My only complaint would be packaging which was super tight around them, and difficult to remove, once removed it had rubbed a good bit of the actual soap off which wouldn&#x27;t have happened if it had been packaged differently.  Still happy about the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps.I prefer the bigger ones cause they last longer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set because I was no longer able to find soap rocks locally.  I figured I&#x27;d take a chance and order...they look like rocks but are glycerin soap. The details are there; fracturing, layering, translucence throughout the soap.  Keeps its look down to the last sliver.</li>
    <li> These are nice, but I was very disappointed that there was NOT the assortment pictured AT ALL.  They were almost all like the red/green in the photo- I got them to give as mini-gifts, and had in mind certain colors for certain people- then I didn&#x27;t receive those colors.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be larger. I have others and they are twice the size of these.</li>
    <li> Soap was a lot smaller than I expected!!!!</li>
    <li> At Christmas I received one of these soap rocks as a present..I loved it so much that I bought more..I have friends that didn&#x27;t even know it was soap.  They are beautiful to look at and they smell amazing!</li>
    <li> my wife loves the soap rocks , what a great idea , i buy them every christmas for stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.....4 artsy crafty amateur.....way overpriced</li>
