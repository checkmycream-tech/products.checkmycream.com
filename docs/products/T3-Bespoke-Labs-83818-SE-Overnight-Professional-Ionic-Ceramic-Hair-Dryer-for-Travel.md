### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>(2)  The dryer is wonderful, while it is working.  </li>
      <li>Greatest dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>Have to admit, when it works it is very nice!</li>
      <li>Great product, until it breaks.  </li>
      <li>The BL curling iron is also a great product, so the Overnight seems to be an an anomaly.    </li>
      <li>So I use it happily from February 2010 until the fan breaks in November 2010.</li>
      <li>I loved this dryer.  </li>
      <li>Mine works, and it&#x27;s a good dryer - but 2 things you should know</li>
      <li>It dries my hair as quickly as my full-size dryer and is compact for traveling ... great!</li>
      <li>I found this on Amazon, and it was such a great deal, better than any on Ebay!!!!!</li>
      <li>It folds up nicely and I was able to pack it in my carry-on with no problems.</li>
      <li>I bought this dryer for the great price, despite the large number of reviews from people with quality problems.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is compact and I just love the way it dries my hair.  </li>
      <li>Ironically, the same thing happened to my best friend.  </li>
      <li>Tried to exchange through Amazon, but because it has been more than 30 days, they will not exchange it even though it is defective.  </li>
      <li>This is a somewhat powerful, get the job done, but not as great as my full size at home hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>I should start by saying that I bought this from Sephora (for full price!), not Amazon, but wanted to let people know that they should avoid this hairdryer at all costs.</li>
      <li>I paid for the product, the company got their money, and I am without the product (not that I would even want it at this point)and didn&#x27;t even receive a full refund!</li>
      <li>The hair dryer breaks very quickly,</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re fine with them breaking all the time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cheap piece of junk.    </li>
      <li>I have the regular T3 dryer which is so great for your hair.  </li>
      <li>being that I now think this dryer is a cheap piece of junk.</li>
      <li>Powerful, performs like a full-size dryer, love that it has dual voltage.</li>
      <li>It did not break down after 4 months like many reviewers have experienced.</li>
      <li>Have purchased many items from Amazon and now the first time I have an issue, they will not help.  </li>
      <li>Even though this dryer is meant for travel, I liked the size/weight of it for normal at-home use.    </li>
      <li>I just bought a Conair travel dryer with a cool button at Target.  </li>
      <li>I too, paid full price at Sephora.  </li>
      <li>We received the previous version of this dryer as a gift and it worked great for about a year until it almost caught fire.  </li>
      <li>First was broke as soon as I plugged it in!</li>
      <li>HIghly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>but it is worth every cent you spend on one.  </li>
      <li>The company BL stands by its products, and promptly replaced my first dryer after the fan broke.  </li>
      <li>The first unit lasted 10 minutes before it went up in a cloud of smoke.</li>
      <li>Be aware that the warranty does not cover the dryer if you drop it.</li>
      <li>I am confident it will last for years.</li>
      <li>Both times I just switched it on and something inside made a loud, clunking, breaking sound.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I read these reviews first.  </li>
      <li>(5)  I&#x27;m pleased that the fan on my third dryer did not break.</li>
      <li>For real.</li>
      <li>but I just didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
      <li>Very compact for traveling, and dries the hair without harshness.  </li>
      <li>I think I was one of the fortunate ones and received a properly functioning one that I purchased on sale.</li>
      <li>I spent $130.00 I had better dryers from the drugstore for about $10.00  </li>
      <li>Absolutely, positively DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  </li>
      <li>The price is more than an average hairdryer that you would normally purchase</li>
      <li>Never heard back from The Beauty Center (only after I contacted the Better Business Bureau) and still have not received a full refund for this product.</li>
      <li>The Beauty Center doesn&#x27;t stand behind their own motto \\&quot;customer satisfaction is our #1 priority\\&quot;!!</li>
      <li>I had terrific, salon-perfect hair the first time I used this dryer.</li>
      <li>I only wish I read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>Figuring that replacement charges could easily add up to the cost of a new hairdryer over the course of a few months, I threw the dryer into the trash.</li>
      <li>I purchased my first one for full retail price (not cheap!)</li>
      <li>The dryer cuts down drying time and always leaves my hair soft and shiny...even more shiny than the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i that I purchased several months ago for $250.</li>
      <li>While the airflow is not as strong as my other 1875 and 2000 watt hair dryers, it still dries in almost the same amount of time.</li>
      <li>Well, the new dryer worked for less than 2 months and then the fan broke, sending smoke into the room and almost catching fire like the previous one.  </li>
      <li>Bf fixed it</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste your money...</li>
      <li>The whole process has been a total hassle!</li>
      <li>The dryers appears to have a fairly obvious design flaw, the filter for the air intake has pretty large holes compared to other dryers I have used.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think for this big a profit margin the company would make a decent product.</li>
      <li>After that the dryer just made this tiny little whining sound with no air flow.    </li>
      <li>Other reviewers have bespoken the downside, so I will focus on positive aspects.  </li>
      <li>My cheap dryers can withstand a common accident; this one cannot.</li>
      <li>Sent the dryer back on my dime to have it fixed.</li>
      <li>The person using the dryer has very average hair - not thick, not thin, not long, not short.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had two of these in three months, and both broke the same way, with no rough treatment.</li>

<li> So I smartened up and went on amazon.com to buy my second one, for considerably less.</li>
<li> The dryer had worked well before it broke, so when we saw there was a new version, we erroneously assumed they had fixed the problem.  </li>
<li> Purchased this hair dryer and when I received it the fan was broken, returned it for a new one, but now 4 months later, the fan on this one has come lose.  </li>
<li> WARNING - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!(ESPECIALLY FROM THE BEAUTY CENTER)!</li>
<li> The dryer stopped working for other reasons.  </li>
<li> The reviews I&#x27;ve read, including those for other sites have generally been poor for this hair dryer.</li>
<li> I had this product just a few months (and didn&#x27;t even use it every day) and like the other reviewers, the fan blade came flying off.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the fan propeller shaft shattered the second time that I used it, and I&#x27;m currently waiting for instructions from T3 re:</li>
<li> We went through 4 of the T3s in less than 1 year.  </li>
<li> It was less than 25 bucks.  </li>
<li> It worked well and dried my hair in a fraction of the time my conventional dryer took, until it broke.  </li>
<li> I am adding my negative review to the long list of dissatisfied customers.  </li>
<li> I admit it, I drop my dryers due to small bathroom space, but I&#x27;ve never had a dryer break as a result.  </li>
<li> Although inconvenient for travel because of its size, the Featherweight has been highly reliable.  </li>
<li> No static no matter what the weather.</li>
<li> I spent $79.00 on it and want to get credit for my account, or AMazon credit!!!!!</li>
<li> Something is very wrong with this product as we all seem to be having the same problem.</li>
<li> RIDICULOUS.    </li>
<li> But they offer a replacement for $49.95 (or something like that) + $15 shipping ish if I&#x27;ll send my broken one in.</li>
<li> Seriously?!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this repair issue is typical for this dryer, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> It has been a frustrating ordeal!</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but want to get the word out about the very poor quality.</li>
<li> The product and The Beauty Center are the worst!</li>
<li> HOW annoying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even though this dryer is meant for travel, I liked the size/weight of it for normal at-home use.    I purchased my first one for full retail price (not cheap!) at Sephora about 1.5 years ago. After maybe less than a year of normal usage, the fan broke. Fab. Bf fixed it but it shortly died. For real. Thinking it was probably a fluke, because who would think that such a pricey dryer (or something along that price line retail) would break so soon? So I smartened up and went on amazon.com to buy my second one, for considerably less. So I use it happily from February 2010 until the fan breaks in November 2010. GAH. It almost starts smoking.    HOW annoying. Seriously?! Bf now blames ME for it breaking! Not sure how it&#x27;s my fault exactly, being that I now think this dryer is a cheap piece of junk. It&#x27;s a cheap piece of junk.    I contact T3 and ask for a replacement. Nope, no replacement, because I didn&#x27;t purchase my second one from an authorized retailer/seller. But they offer a replacement for $49.95 (or something like that) + $15 shipping ish if I&#x27;ll send my broken one in. So for like $65.00 for the replacement and like $10.00 if I had to send it in, I&#x27;d be paying another $75.00 for my THIRD hair dryer in 1.5 years?! I DON&#x27;T THINK SO. RIDICULOUS.    I would NOT recommend the purchase of this hair dryer in any way. Unless you&#x27;re fine with them breaking all the time.</li>
    <li> The T3Bespokes hair dryer I ordered is VERY expensive, and it BROKE the first month!!! I spent $79.00 on it and want to get credit for my account, or AMazon credit!!!!! Please advise!!!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this hair dryer and when I received it the fan was broken, returned it for a new one, but now 4 months later, the fan on this one has come lose.  Tried to exchange through Amazon, but because it has been more than 30 days, they will not exchange it even though it is defective.  Was not asking for a refund, only an exchange.  Have purchased many items from Amazon and now the first time I have an issue, they will not help.  Will not purchase from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> First was broke as soon as I plugged it in! Present for my wife from Sephora. Had to go back and exchange it the same day. Second one worked only  twice!!! Same thing.  Expensive junk!!! Do not buy it!  Have to admit, when it works it is very nice!</li>
    <li> I admit it, I drop my dryers due to small bathroom space, but I&#x27;ve never had a dryer break as a result.  The swivel handle on this one is not designed to withstand a drop. The handle parts separated and the plastic in the interior swivel mechanism cracked. I thought, well I have a 4 year warranty, I&#x27;ll contact the company.  Be aware that the warranty does not cover the dryer if you drop it. My cheap dryers can withstand a common accident; this one cannot. How about a redesign, especially since it&#x27;s a travel dryer, and we can find ourselves in cramped quarters as we travel.</li>
    <li> Greatest dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  Who knew a dryer could affect the condition of hair.  No static no matter what the weather.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer to take with me on business trips because the hotel hair dryers are just awful for my hair.  This is a somewhat powerful, get the job done, but not as great as my full size at home hair dryer.  It folds up nicely and I was able to pack it in my carry-on with no problems.</li>
    <li> Save your money. I&#x27;ve had two of these in three months, and both broke the same way, with no rough treatment. Both times I just switched it on and something inside made a loud, clunking, breaking sound. After that the dryer just made this tiny little whining sound with no air flow.    Something is very wrong with this product as we all seem to be having the same problem. You&#x27;d think for this big a profit margin the company would make a decent product. I notice Sephora doesn&#x27;t have any in stock anymore, anywhere -- maybe they&#x27;re finally being pulled from the shelves.</li>
    <li> I Wish I had read this review before I purchased this dryer. The first unit lasted 10 minutes before it went up in a cloud of smoke. The second unit self destructed the moment it was switched on. Perhaps these should be sold as pyrotechnics devices. Stay away from this company.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when traveling because my long hair always get sucked in by the fan on the tiny hotel-room hair dryers.  It dries my hair as quickly as my full-size dryer and is compact for traveling ... great!</li>
    <li> I rarely write negative reviews for products.  I loved this dryer.  It worked well and dried my hair in a fraction of the time my conventional dryer took, until it broke.  I had only used it a handful of times and the fan just flew off and came loose in the housing.  Now no air blows at all.  My dryer is still under warranty, so I am awaiting instructions from the manufacturer to replace it.  I never dropped it and can&#x27;t imagine why it is so flimsy.  Please save your hard-earned cash.  I wish I had.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for the great price, despite the large number of reviews from people with quality problems. Mine works, and it&#x27;s a good dryer - but 2 things you should know: 1) my dryer did not come with the necessary information to register it with Bespoke, so I will not get the 1 year warranty I was counting on; 2) the written materials with the dryer reference an air filter to be inserted before use, but on closer inspection they only include this air filter for models other than the Overnight. The dryers appears to have a fairly obvious design flaw, the filter for the air intake has pretty large holes compared to other dryers I have used.</li>
    <li> WARNING - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!(ESPECIALLY FROM THE BEAUTY CENTER)! I had this product just a few months (and didn&#x27;t even use it every day) and like the other reviewers, the fan blade came flying off. Tried to fix it but to no avail. I finally received an email from The Beauty Center (after about a month of no reply from them)with a Return Authorization Number. Sent the dryer back on my dime to have it fixed. Never heard back from The Beauty Center (only after I contacted the Better Business Bureau) and still have not received a full refund for this product. I only wish I read the reviews first. It has been a frustrating ordeal! I paid for the product, the company got their money, and I am without the product (not that I would even want it at this point)and didn&#x27;t even receive a full refund! The Beauty Center doesn&#x27;t stand behind their own motto \\&quot;customer satisfaction is our #1 priority\\&quot;!! The whole process has been a total hassle! The product and The Beauty Center are the worst! I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would even do business with a vendor like this - it&#x27;s appauling.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is compact and I just love the way it dries my hair.  The price is more than an average hairdryer that you would normally purchase but it is worth every cent you spend on one.  I like it so much I plan on giving a few in 2010 for gifts.</li>
    <li> I received this dryer as a gift. Powerful, performs like a full-size dryer, love that it has dual voltage. I had terrific, salon-perfect hair the first time I used this dryer. Unfortunately, the fan propeller shaft shattered the second time that I used it, and I&#x27;m currently waiting for instructions from T3 re: return, warranty &amp; repair. I don&#x27;t know if this repair issue is typical for this dryer, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, positively DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  We received the previous version of this dryer as a gift and it worked great for about a year until it almost caught fire.  The person using the dryer has very average hair - not thick, not thin, not long, not short.  The dryer had worked well before it broke, so when we saw there was a new version, we erroneously assumed they had fixed the problem.  Well, the new dryer worked for less than 2 months and then the fan broke, sending smoke into the room and almost catching fire like the previous one.  The vendor we purchased from said they&#x27;re having problems with all of these dryers and agreed to replace ours with an alternate dryer.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying that I bought this from Sephora (for full price!), not Amazon, but wanted to let people know that they should avoid this hairdryer at all costs. I used it five times before the fan broke off. That&#x27;s over $25 per use! I have replaced it with a $36 hairdryer that has yet to give me a single problem.</li>
    <li> I have the regular T3 dryer which is so great for your hair.  It was big to pack, and I bought another smaller dryer but I just didn&#x27;t like it as much.  I found this on Amazon, and it was such a great deal, better than any on Ebay!!!!! I bought one for my daughter as well.  Very compact for traveling, and dries the hair without harshness.  HIghly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, until it breaks.  Same problem as the other reviewers.  The fan comes off.  Husband glued it back on, and that lasted for about 2 uses.  The thing is fried now, smoking and everything.  I was going to buy another one, thinking that it was just an isolated incident.  Thankfully I read these reviews first.  NOTE:  I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but want to get the word out about the very poor quality.</li>
    <li> I used it once...the second time it broke..it just blew...I spent $130.00 I had better dryers from the drugstore for about $10.00  I would like to get my money back</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have bespoken the downside, so I will focus on positive aspects.  (1)  The hair dryer breaks very quickly, so there won&#x27;t be any worries about out-of-warranty replacements.  (2)  The dryer is wonderful, while it is working.  (3)  The company BL stands by its products, and promptly replaced my first dryer after the fan broke.  (The defective unit must be shipped back to the company.)   (4)  After the replacement&#x27;s fan broke, BL again swiftly sent another replacement dryer.  (5)  I&#x27;m pleased that the fan on my third dryer did not break. The dryer stopped working for other reasons.  BL recently sent another replacement.  (6) I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with my fourth dryer.  But I haven&#x27;t yet unpacked it.  Note: While waiting for replacements to arrive, I&#x27;ve been using BL&#x27;s Featherweight dryer.  Although inconvenient for travel because of its size, the Featherweight has been highly reliable.  The BL curling iron is also a great product, so the Overnight seems to be an an anomaly.    December 3, 2009 update:  The fourth time was not a charm; the fan broke off shortly after the dryer came out of the box.  This time BL wanted to charge for shipping and handling to replace the unit.  That was the last straw.  Figuring that replacement charges could easily add up to the cost of a new hairdryer over the course of a few months, I threw the dryer into the trash.</li>
    <li> I am adding my negative review to the long list of dissatisfied customers.  I too, paid full price at Sephora.  It broke immediately. I got a replacement since it was under warranty and the replacement broke immediately.  Ironically, the same thing happened to my best friend.  We went through 4 of the T3s in less than 1 year.  Do NOT waste your money...I just bought a Conair travel dryer with a cool button at Target.  It was less than 25 bucks.  I am confident it will last for years.</li>
    <li> The reviews I&#x27;ve read, including those for other sites have generally been poor for this hair dryer. I think I was one of the fortunate ones and received a properly functioning one that I purchased on sale. I&#x27;ve had the dryer for over 3 years and only use it when I travel. It did not break down after 4 months like many reviewers have experienced. I don&#x27;t know if it has anything to do with the fact that I only use it for traveling. The dryer cuts down drying time and always leaves my hair soft and shiny...even more shiny than the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i that I purchased several months ago for $250. While the airflow is not as strong as my other 1875 and 2000 watt hair dryers, it still dries in almost the same amount of time. The airflow is actually stronger than the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i.</li>
