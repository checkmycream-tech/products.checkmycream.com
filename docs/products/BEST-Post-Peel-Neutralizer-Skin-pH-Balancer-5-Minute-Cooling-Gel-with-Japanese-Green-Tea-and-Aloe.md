    <li> It seemed to tingle a bit, but I could not tell if it was working our not, maybe because the peel used prior to using the cooling gel didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
    <li> The item is frequently paired with at home acid peels and is advertised as a post peel neutralizer.  It is very soothing and didn&#x27;t make me break out(4 stars), but, I use baking soda and water to neutralize acids.  I would reccomend this for relief after prolonged sun exposure but not post peel.</li>
    <li> Too pricy compared to its effect. I am disappointed. May work better for others than for me. Will still try to use it after my laser.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality organic neutralizer.  Since I am saving tons of money doing peels at home I wanted a good product that was spa quality.  This is a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; not water.  The cheapy water products felt like I might as well just use water.  This cooled my skin instantly.  It also did not irritate my sensitive skin.  I think it will be good for about 15 after peels and I can even use it as a moisturizer after being in the sun.  I really like this brand and will continue to purchase more of its products.  Always A+ thanks!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really looking for a neutralizer so much as something with antioxidants in it that would be a rich moisturizer for post-peel. After I used this product, not only did it not really moisturize (it is a gel) but my skin became very sensitive and peeled, which I&#x27;ve never had after the use of the peel I use (35% glycolic). It may work for others, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I use this after my home peels and it does as described and I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> As I mentioned earlier on the 5 minute Peel, makes me break out.  Loved their Caffeine Eye Cream. I am working on my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> Way to oily and unnecessary after a chemical peel. I just use SPF and a moisturiser from sephora and/or the body shop.</li>
    <li> This product does it&#x27;s job better than the usual baking soda and water. It does provide a cooling feeling that is much more pleasant. I did still need to use cold water compresses to complete the cooling process. It was well liked by both my clients and myself. One bottle provided for 6 glycolic peels and 4 TCA peels. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> A gift to my wife and she is thrilled!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and get chapped just tending to outside chores, so this is the main reason I ordered this.  It really works great, it is very gentle.  I apply moisturizer afterwards and my skin no longer looks red and irritated.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Does exactly what it say. Very good when used after a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> Great cooling moisturiser for tired skin. Feels a little sticky after application those.</li>
    <li> You can feel the relief after apply ! It&#x27;s perfect after peeling or laser, or anything that makes your face burning !</li>
    <li> This cooling gel does exactly what it says, imagine that. I use it after rinsing off my chemical peel and immediately the burning stops. I never refrigerated the product for the extra cooling effect, but it still works just fine. The product is very light on my skin and after applying it to my skin, it is absorbed very fast with no residue.  My skin doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.  I do have to be very careful with what I put on my skin, as I can and will break out.  Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Used this product after my chemical peel. I was pretty nervous about the chemical peel, (never had one done at home), so I did not leave it on too long. I applied the cooling gel and noticed a minor cooling sensational.  I suppose you could say it works, good luck everyone, who tries this product!</li>
    <li> This product works as stated and for first time chemical peal users this is a must have.  I had no issues using it. It minimize the after effects of using a chemical peel leaving your face refreshed and smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use after a peel, and it works fantastic. After a peel, it truly calms the skin and removes the irritation that typically occurs after a peel. However, in addition to that, it is amazingly effective as a moisturizer. I have been using it for additional hydration, and my skin feels and looks so much more youthful. Thanks to Passport to Organics for creating such a special product!</li>
    <li> Ordered a 40% glycolic peel and purchased this anticipating a bit of discomfort.  After properly neutralizing per the peel instructions, I applied this and boy was I glad I had it handy.  Very soothing and I anticipate a bit more discomfort in the next few days and put it in the fridge to apply as needed.  I put it on under my moisturizer and anytime during the day I feel my skin becoming a bit \\&quot;hot\\&quot; or tight.  Not sticky or tacky like aloe gel, left my skin feeling very soothed and satiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was super fast and I recommend the investment if you&#x27;re going to be using a peel</li>
    <li> It is a nice tick gel that absorb nice into the skin leaving nothing behind , leaving my skin smooth and fresh after , I do not rinse since it there is nothing left to rinse my skin suck every drop of that ..  I smell something in the beginning like herbs then it get neutral , I would buy it again as it work well after L-acid peel ..</li>
