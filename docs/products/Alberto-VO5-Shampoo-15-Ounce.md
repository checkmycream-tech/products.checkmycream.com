      <li>So cheap, but works so well!</li>

      <li>Gets my hair clean with a nice refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a lot since and it&#x27;s been perfectly OK.nt dry while using it.</li>
      <li>There were only two brands available, and this one just smelled wonderful.  </li>
      <li>All their shampoos are sulfate free and therefore color safe</li>
      <li>today, it lathered reasonably well, then I noticed it didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
      <li>It actually lathers up nice and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>This smells wonderful compared to other clarifying shampoos.  </li>
      <li>This is a really strong shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to use to remove product buildup or if your hair is especially oily.</li>
      <li>It looks fabulous, even though I say it</li>
      <li>and I dont use it cause I am cheap.</li>
      <li>It has a light smell</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was cheap</li>
      <li>This really is a great clarifying shampoo, especially for the price!</li>
      <li>This is a great clarifying shampoo for several reasons.</li>
      <li>There are so many that have WONDERFUL scents and are rich &amp; thick.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so clean, light, and fresh!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very reasonable and if it&#x27;s on sale, even better.</li>
      <li>so this is a very good shampoo to clear out your scalp follicles and get them really clean so hair grows healthy which is a key to getting longer hair.</li>
      <li>I then wash with my normal product which today was herbal essence rose conditioning cleanser and voila springy curls, no frizz and no dryness.  </li>
      <li>This is not only a very affordable shampoo -- it&#x27;s also very good, if all you want is detergent to clean your hair.  </li>
      <li>I also like it because it leaves my hair feeling clean, but it doesn&#x27;t feel stripped.</li>
      <li>and it does indeed remove product buildup, leaving hair really clean.  </li>
      <li>gives a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>No conditioners or special chemicals here.  </li>
      <li>However, after a lot of conditioning (see mall my other reviews on conditioners LOL) I can have build up.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is really great if you&#x27;ve colored your hair too dark and want to lighten up the color somewhat.  </li>
      <li>Their masks are excellent too, really thick and rich and very moisturizing and strengthening.  </li>
      <li>The first reason is the price!</li>
      <li>great decision, this is as described and the shampoo seems to last longer than most other brands i have tried.</li>
      <li>Now, I have tried many, many other shampoos.</li>
      <li>It should not be used daily or even more than once a week since it isn&#x27;t a moisturizing shampoo, and my hair can tell the difference when I&#x27;ve used this vs. my usual intense repair shampoo, but for the price and the great smell, you can&#x27;t beat it!  </li>
      <li>and this works really well!</li>
      <li>/&gt;After I rinsed it, I used &#x27;Alberto V05 Moisture Milk Conditioner&#x27; which I was also using for the first time.</li>
      <li>that doesn&#x27;t make since haha save money!</li>
      <li>so I moisturize and seal with Blue magic grease, which over time gives me a buildup.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free but removes any trace of sticky styling products and hairspray and leaves hair really shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>Together they give me light, silky, soft, shiny hair that reacts really well to my styling efforts.  </li>
      <li>While for some people just using a clarifying every so often to remove product build up works best for them, this is a perfect daily solution for a teem pr pre-teen who suffers from constant daily oily hair.</li>
      <li>Love it when something is reasonable AND actually works!</li>
      <li>as I heard a long time ago, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s better for your hair not to get used to one.</li>
      <li>Found it in a large pump bottle at the store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fruity and sweet, like no other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  </li>
      <li>but I did need to use a really moisturizing conditioner afterward.  </li>
      <li>The honey formula is available only at Target and Ulta.  </li>
      <li>It very thoroughly cleanses the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair too often because shampoo can be very drying.</li>
      <li>I also really like the matching conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I also use the Manuka Honey formula shampoo and conditioner, which is really hydrating and smells like wildflower honey.  </li>
      <li>It works about the same as using a bar of soap on your hair, you get what you pay for, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to leave my hair silky smooth, and it didn&#x27;t,</li>
      <li>I only bought this to meet the minimum dollar amount to get the free shipping on another order I placed.</li>
      <li>I have very oily hair and have struggled to find a shampoo that gets rid of all the oil with each wash.  </li>
      <li>When I saw this I thought I&#x27;d buy it, as my hair hasn&#x27;t been looking as good lately, and the reviews were so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Consumer Reports says that almost all shampoos get your hair equally clean, and the only difference in shampoos is scent, thickness, lather, some additives and price.</li>
      <li>I actually purchased this item so my total order would qualify for Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Free Super Saver Shipping\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy this item in the future at such a good price($.99).</li>
      <li>Just the basics, particularly recommended for anyone with oily hair.  </li>
      <li>I love that when I use it I can see and feel a difference and my curls spring back instantly</li>
      <li>Being a guy, I am not to particular about shampoo</li>
      <li>I would recommend this shampoo to anyone, as long as you can get a good deal on it (.99 or less).</li>
      <li>I have super thick hair that gets greasy easily</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this got it in time and it is good shampoo. good value for money. I can recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells great but leaves your hair dry, dull, nd feeling dead.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap and it does its job as well as a gazillion other such shampoos.  Nice smell; lathers well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great value.  I have very oily hair and have struggled to find a shampoo that gets rid of all the oil with each wash.  This stuff does!  Makes my hair so clean, light, and fresh!  The scent is very nice, too.  I also really like the matching conditioner.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a whim while on vacation in the 1000 Islands last summer.  1000 Islands vacations &#x3D; lots of swimming in the St. Lawrence River, which leaves my hair feeling dirty, gunky, and dry.  I forgot my shampoo at home last year, and it dawned on me while at the drugstore that a clarifying shampoo would be my best bet. There were only two brands available, and this one just smelled wonderful.  It&#x27;s fruity and sweet, like no other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  I was also surprised at how much it lathers up and cleans my hair given the price.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped and dry either.  So this is my savior from river water and chlorinated pools, and I use it every couple weeks or whenever I&#x27;ve used a lot of styling product in my hair (which isn&#x27;t that often).  It should not be used daily or even more than once a week since it isn&#x27;t a moisturizing shampoo, and my hair can tell the difference when I&#x27;ve used this vs. my usual intense repair shampoo, but for the price and the great smell, you can&#x27;t beat it!  It&#x27;s just what I need for river water emergencies and occasional \\&quot;deep cleaning.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I am african american and have arm pit length natural hair. My hair is naturally dry so I moisturize and seal with Blue magic grease, which over time gives me a buildup. I use this clarifying shampoo once week and it gets my hair clean without the really strip feeling I get with other shampoos I use. I am really surprise as I expect really dry hair after using ythis cheaper clarifying shampoo. But this isn&#x27;t bad at all. I will continue using.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really great if you&#x27;ve colored your hair too dark and want to lighten up the color somewhat.  It&#x27;s really quite harsh but it definitely strips the color, so if you have color treated hair and want to maintain your color, don&#x27;t use this.  I used some hair color that was too dark and needed to strip it out of my hair so I picked up some of this shampoo for $2 at Kmart and proceeded to lather up twice.  It definitely lightened it up but I did need to use a really moisturizing conditioner afterward.  If you have virgin hair, this shampoo probably won&#x27;t cause a problem for you and it does indeed remove product buildup, leaving hair really clean.  I do use the Kiwi Lime VO5 conditioner for cowashing though.  I find it works as well as Wen and unlike the shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t affect my color at all.  It leaves my hair light and fluffy with plenty of body.  If your hair is color treated, try Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  It&#x27;s sulfate free but removes any trace of sticky styling products and hairspray and leaves hair really shiny and soft.  The companion SM conditioner is excellent too, btw.  Together they give me light, silky, soft, shiny hair that reacts really well to my styling efforts.  It&#x27;s more expensive than typical drugstore products, but worth every penny.  SM is available at Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Ulta, Target and Sally&#x27;s, but only Target has the Jamaican Black Castor Oil conditioner, for some strange reason.  I also use the Manuka Honey formula shampoo and conditioner, which is really hydrating and smells like wildflower honey.  The honey formula is available only at Target and Ulta.  If you want to protect your color treated hair, then SM is the way to go.  All their shampoos are sulfate free and therefore color safe and there&#x27;s a formula for every hair issue.  I also like the Raw Shea Butter and the 10 in 1 Renewal formulas.  Their masks are excellent too, really thick and rich and very moisturizing and strengthening.  I recommend this VO5 shampoo for the above reasons but if you have color treated hair and are looking for a clarifying formula, then try SM.sturizing and strengthening.  I recommend this VO5 shampoo for the above reasons but if you have color treated hair and are looking for a clarifying formula, then try SM.</li>
    <li> Great affordable shampoo my son loves the smell, his hair doesn&#x27;t smell like wet dog anymore</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo once a week or whenever I do a deep conditioning treatment in my hair with oil. I usually use coconut or castor oil which are very thick oils so this shampoo gets that out without having to double wash. You shouldn&#x27;t shampoo your hair every day so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this every day or every other day. You should only use clarifying shampoo if you have a lot of build up from products and oils. I&#x27;m in the process of growing out my hair so this is a very good shampoo to clear out your scalp follicles and get them really clean so hair grows healthy which is a key to getting longer hair. This only costs .99 cents at the dollar store so don&#x27;t spend anymore then that for this product or you&#x27;ll be ripped off.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best and most inexpensive clarifying shampoo that I have used.  I love that when I use it I can see and feel a difference and my curls spring back instantly but DO NOT FEEL DRY!! This is a great thing for my hair type 4a/4b.  Usually when I have used clarifying shampoos my hair has always felt so dry and stripped...not with this one.  Anytime my hair is not behaving and my curl pattern looks off I generally use this shampoo which cost me $1.00 at CVS..yes $1.00.  I then wash with my normal product which today was herbal essence rose conditioning cleanser and voila springy curls, no frizz and no dryness.  Give this a try.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Love it when something is reasonable AND actually works!</li>
    <li> I like the cleaning. this is good for cleaning the gunk out of hair from oils and gels. gives a clean feeling. not the best but for one dollar its good.</li>
    <li> This is excellent clarifying shampoo at a good price. Gets my oily scalp clean but doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone, as long as you can get a good deal on it (.99 or less).</li>
    <li> I bought 3  bottles of this because i like to buy in bulk. great decision, this is as described and the shampoo seems to last longer than most other brands i have tried.</li>
    <li> So cheap, but works so well! I had major product build-up from those new thickening shampoos, and this returned my hair to that squeaky-clean, just-washed feeling I was missing.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo we use. I have super thick hair that gets greasy easily and this works really well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two flagrances and both do a similar and decent job cleaning your hair. I managed to snag this when it was $1 a bottle and would not have paid more for it. I say this because it seems rather watery and not as lathery as some other shampoos so you might have to use more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair too often because shampoo can be very drying. However, after a lot of conditioning (see mall my other reviews on conditioners LOL) I can have build up. This is a great clarifying shampoo for several reasons. The first reason is the price! It&#x27;s very reasonable and if it&#x27;s on sale, even better. I also like it because it leaves my hair feeling clean, but it doesn&#x27;t feel stripped.Another thing that I like about this shampoo is that it has a very nice clean smell. I tend to shy away from strong perfumey scents.  I initially bought it because I was having a reaction (itching) from hair color I had used a few days earlier and this shampoo really did the trick in relieving the intense itching that I had from a hair color job.So all in all, this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> Does the job -- completely strips my hair of all product build-up, but also strips it of all oil. Know its purpose, and you&#x27;ll be happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is not only a very affordable shampoo -- it&#x27;s also very good, if all you want is detergent to clean your hair.  No conditioners or special chemicals here.  Just the basics, particularly recommended for anyone with oily hair.  Nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I used to use Suave for clarifying but this rocks it.  Wonderful fragrance--not overpowering but really pleasant--awesome lather, bubbly, doubles as a body wash. Found it in a large pump bottle at the store. The matching conditioner is very light also and I even used it as a leave-in. The other one I love is the Extra Body shampoo. They both remove gunk and leave a nice scent behind. I like when it lingers on my pillow at night.</li>
    <li> I was dying my hair lighter (every 6 months) a few years ago. My hair is almost as fine as a babies, It couldn&#x27;t take the harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped dying it, and once a month I used a clarifying shampoo I found in a local store (not this brand it was more expensive). I&#x27;ve also been using 4 different, other kinds of shampoos, as I heard a long time ago, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s better for your hair not to get used to one. It took a while for my hair to look good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a couple of years now I wasn&#x27;t using clarifying shampoo any more. When I saw this I thought I&#x27;d buy it, as my hair hasn&#x27;t been looking as good lately, and the reviews were so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time today, it lathered reasonably well, then I noticed it didn&#x27;t feel good. As I lathered it into my hair, it didn&#x27;t feel the same, my hair felt really dry like straw, I was very worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed it, I used &#x27;Alberto V05 Moisture Milk Conditioner&#x27; which I was also using for the first time. The prices are so good for this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001715WH2 Alberto Vo5 Moisture Milk Conditioner, Strawberries and Cream, 15 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, when I put the conditioner on and massaged it into my scalp, it smelled really delicious! My hair still felt really dry though. I&#x27;d never experienced this dryness before after washing it, even with the clarifying shampoo I used years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about the outcome of this product. As usual, I let my hair dry naturally, I was surprised when my hair began feeling lovely and soft. I just looked in the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, I thought my dark hair had turned white in places. Yikes! I then realized it wasn&#x27;t white at all, it was the shine. It looks fabulous, even though I say it myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I found this clarifying shampoo. I&#x27;m going to use it every month, with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Only the first time I used this, my hair went dry while using it. I&#x27;ve used it a lot since and it&#x27;s been perfectly OK.nt dry while using it. I&#x27;ve used it a lot since and it&#x27;s been perfectly OK.</li>
    <li> Does the trick - clarifies, removes &#x27;product&#x27; build-up - without over-drying the hair.  And it smells good, too.  At this bargain price, what more could you want?</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this item so my total order would qualify for Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Free Super Saver Shipping\\&quot;. Being a guy, I am not to particular about shampoo so I used it. It actually lathers up nice and has a pleasant smell. I would definitely buy this item in the future at such a good price($.99).</li>
    <li> This really is a great clarifying shampoo, especially for the price! It very thoroughly cleanses the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I recently discovered that with my very curly, very dry hair that I should not be using sulfates of any sort and this product contains sulfates (the chemical that makes the product lather but strips curly, dry, frizzy hair of much-needed moisture). If they made this sulfate-free, I would definately continue use!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, this product is NOT for daily use. Daily use of any clarifying shampoo will dry your hair out terribly because it strips those much needed keratins and natural oils.</li>
    <li> You can get this at most Dollar Trees</li>
    <li> Under $1.00 on here via prime and most stores. I love this stuff and I dont use it cause I am cheap. Great lather and smell feel very clean after each shower. If you are looking to save money use this stuff</li>
    <li> This year, pre-teen daughter has gone head first into puberty and has been suffering many of the less then fun side effect, including terrible oily skin. Even with taking a shower every morning before school, and not using any conditioner at all in her hair, by the time she gets home her hair looks like she has washed it in a week. And on gym days, it&#x27;s even worse. A hairdresser recommended she try using a clarifying shampoo since she had such a constant build up of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using this VO5 Kiwi Lime Clarifying shampoo, I&#x27;m starting to see a bit of a difference. On days when she has gym, her hair is still a little rough by the time she gets home from school. But on days when she has music class instead of gym, she comes home without her hear looking oily and stringy. After running a brush through it, it even gets fluffy again. She likes the scent and says she likes how it makes her hair feel. I just with I had realized sooner that this shampoo would work so well for her! While for some people just using a clarifying every so often to remove product build up works best for them, this is a perfect daily solution for a teem pr pre-teen who suffers from constant daily oily hair.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. Gets my hair clean with a nice refreshing scent. I don&#x27;t mind that it makes my hair squeaky because it&#x27;s a clarifying product. It&#x27;s supposed to do that. I use natural hair products for my low porosity natural hair, I like to use this to get rid of the build up. Plus, it&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;s under a $1.00 at any retail store.</li>
    <li> why would you pay 6 dollars, when you can go to the dollar store and get it? .. that doesn&#x27;t make since haha save money!</li>
    <li> I only bought this to meet the minimum dollar amount to get the free shipping on another order I placed. It works about the same as using a bar of soap on your hair, you get what you pay for, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to leave my hair silky smooth, and it didn&#x27;t, so yeah, it met my low expectations.</li>
    <li> This is a really strong shampoo.  It&#x27;s great to use to remove product buildup or if your hair is especially oily. It has a light smell but you do need a good conditioner to get a comb through your hair after using.</li>
    <li> I buy clarifying shampoos in place of nasty smelling bathroom cleaner.  This is perfect for getting rid of the greasy tub rings :-)</li>
    <li> VO5 Shampoos saved me a LOT of money for a LONG TIME!  Consumer Reports says that almost all shampoos get your hair equally clean, and the only difference in shampoos is scent, thickness, lather, some additives and price. I used VO5 shampoo for more than a decade during financially difficult times, and it worked fine. Now, I have tried many, many other shampoos. There are so many that have WONDERFUL scents and are rich &amp; thick. My biggest complaint I have about VO5, now that I am more informed, is that it isn&#x27;t very thick &amp; rich so I have to use a little more to get enough lather. That is my only complaint! It is a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful compared to other clarifying shampoos.  I use it once a week to remove build up of styling products.</li>
