      <li>I think these will be fun for halloween.</li>
      <li>Looks great for St Patricks Day Parade</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t pull very much when removing.  </li>
      <li>They were exactly as they look in the photo and performed exactly like they should.  </li>
      <li>The body vine painting took an hour and half so when it came time for my face make-up, these made it easy and quick!</li>

      <li>No negative comments.  </li>
      <li>My only issue with them is that the left upper lash sticker is much wider top to bottom than the right upper lash sticker.</li>
      <li>Definitely might consider getting more for shoots or other</li>
      <li>I would not recommend for daily wear (might be a bit much).</li>
      <li>I saw these for as much as 24 dollars and as low as 14.</li>
      <li>I first received the kit I was worried because it looked nothing like the makeup on the model, but fear not, you can definitely get the same look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I left room on the eye-lid and filled in the rest with green and gold glitter eyeliner....</li>
      <li>apparently they will not allow you to return item.</li>
      <li>The instructions could be a little better though, it took me a little work to figure it out correctly.</li>

    <li> Easy to apply. Fake lashes stayed on all night even though I put them on poorly (have never had to apply them before). Many compliments received.</li>
    <li> Looks great for St Patricks Day Parade</li>
    <li> I think these will be fun for halloween. My only issue with them is that the left upper lash sticker is much wider top to bottom than the right upper lash sticker. They are not symmetrical. The base of the piece, the green background sticker part, is larger and will take up more space when applied. I&#x27;m concerned it will cause the effect to be lop-sided once I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the whole package was inclusive. Upper eye stickers, lower eye stickers, false lashes, glue and filler paint. I saw these for as much as 24 dollars and as low as 14. I&#x27;m glad I spent the lower price, seeing as they are not as well made as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just for one night, or two if I go to a party on the weekend. Nothing to get annoyed about. These are really cool looking eye pieces.</li>
    <li> I loved this makeup, I used it for my Poison Ivy cosplay/ Halloween costume.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a dramatic look but I loved it. Definitely might consider getting more for shoots or other cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the eyelash glue that came with it though, it was a liquid and I didn&#x27;t really trust it. I used a nicer eyelash glue I already had instead. But all in all I was pretty pleased with this. The price also dropped after I purchased it, from $20 something to $13, which is a lot more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the kit I was worried because it looked nothing like the makeup on the model, but fear not, you can definitely get the same look.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend putting the green strips up a little higher on the eyes so they&#x27;re more comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> They were a little hard to get on and off but with a little elbow grease and determination they looked amazing. Only flaw is that the eyelash glue doesn&#x27;t work. So make sure you go buy your own.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of the eyelashes and stick on shadow but sometimes the glue is dried up and sometimes it is great, it just depends on the individual package.</li>
    <li> easy to apply looks great and alot of fun!! lasted all night and got tons of compliments on it! love it</li>
    <li> Make sure you want this item bc apparently they will not allow you to return item. All sales are final. I bought this,nothing great...I can do a better job just putting my own make up on! It gets 2 stars because it comes with some cute falsies,but you can buy those at any drug store...</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money because as soon as you open the product, you can&#x27;t return it. But you don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s completely dried out until you open it.  Buying this is the equivalent of putting your money in a paper shredder.</li>
    <li> too big for my eyes :(</li>
    <li> I wore this for St. Patricks day party nd I recieved alot of compliments. This was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was amazing to use and easy to apply!! I wore it for my Poison Ivy Halloween costume which I put A LOT of work into....The body vine painting took an hour and half so when it came time for my face make-up, these made it easy and quick! I left room on the eye-lid and filled in the rest with green and gold glitter eyeliner....I was very satisfied and will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> My daughter is on a dance team and these look great on and easy to apply.  I would not recommend for daily wear (might be a bit much).</li>
    <li> Very nice product, easy to use and apply. Was comfortable the entire night, from about 7 pm to 4 am!!  The instructions could be a little better though, it took me a little work to figure it out correctly.</li>
    <li> Fun! Wore them for poison ivy costume on two separate occasions and they looked great both times! I will definitely buy this brand again!</li>
    <li> These are FANTASTIC!!!!  Everyone that saw them was amazed and loved them.  No negative comments.  Stayed on perfectly.  didn&#x27;t pull very much when removing.  They were exactly as they look in the photo and performed exactly like they should.  1st one we put on partially and realized we had it a bit off kilter, but we just pulled it off gently and set it up correctly.  No problem with that  weakening the adhesive.  We used GlitterGlam (fabulous too) on the lid portion since this is for above the crease of your lid.  100% pleased.</li>
    <li> These worked sooooo good for Grenada Carnival Pretty Mas costume.  They stayed put all day, never moved once at all!</li>
    <li> Went on easy and looked great! Lots of complements!</li>
    <li> I am definitely keeping this site at hand.  Great product for costume, easy to put on, stayed on all night.  Everyone at party thought I had created this look from scratch, they were shocked to see it was an all in one adhesive... for the inexpensive price I will be doing this again when I can</li>
    <li> I got them for my wife for her flapper Halloween costume. They looked fantastic. People kept commenting on them and asking how she did it. Plus, after reading one of the other reviews, she was extra careful removing them, so they didn&#x27;t stick to themselves. That way, they&#x27;re reusable. Very sexy.</li>
