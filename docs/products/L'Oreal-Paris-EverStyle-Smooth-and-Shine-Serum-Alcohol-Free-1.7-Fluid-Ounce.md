      <li>Nice hair</li>
      <li>It just does not do as nice a job and leaves the hair feeling dirtyish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for keeping my somewhat course hair smooth and manageable.</li>

      <li>smooth and shiney!!first class:)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s alcohol free because alcohol can cause brittle dryness</li>
      <li>It does not absorb and leave the clean shine Texture Expert does.</li>
      <li>My hair was super damaged and frizzy.</li>
      <li>I really like that it is alcohol free, so</li>

      <li>It brings out the colors in my hair, adds a boost of shine, and isn&#x27;t messy like most serums.</li>
      <li>My hair is long and really curly and everyone who has any kind of curly hair knows that it tends to be dry, so it needs to be hydrated on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>This product is very heavy on my fine, but thick, hair (compared to Texture Expert) and has a very strong smell.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, it totally softened my hair even though I have colored it.</li>
      <li>I did not like this product as it made my hair messy and oily, instead of making it smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
      <li>So far as smoothing, my hair didn&#x27;t need it</li>
      <li>When I decided to let my natural color grow out after decades of coloring my hair, I guess I wasn&#x27;t really surprised that I had very little original natural color left.  </li>
      <li>For real, this stuff helped me get my hair back to being soft and beautiful after a horrible salon experience where the girl basically fried my already color damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I have 53 year old grey hair, cut in a short pixie style.  </li>

<li> I have 53 year old grey hair, cut in a short pixie style.  </li>
<li> You also must really use it on damp hair, while, with Texture Expert, you could add touch up shine that controlled the odd frizz, even when dry.</li>
<li> I decided to embrace the new natural, but I didn&#x27;t want it to be dull.  </li>
<li> I use it - especially on my ends - when I wash my hair, but also occasionally when my hair is dry, and it does not make my hair greasy.</li>
<li> My hair was very dry before using it , this is the second bottle i bought !!</li>
<li> all day long....</li>
<li> It lasts a long long time as I use just about 1/2 pump  per day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only need a tiny bit, so it lasts forever.  </li>
<li> I use this in dry or wet hair!</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, I have long hair and use it every day and this bottle lasts me 6 months!</li>
<li> I got my order today, that is faster than i expected.</li>
<li> I have to apply when my hair is wet, blow and brush.  </li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not greasy-feeling like other products I tried.  </li>
<li> recommend trying other alternatives.</li>
<li> Two little squirts and my hair goes from gray to shiny silver.  </li>
<li> This gives it just a little bit of shine so it doesn&#x27;t look quite so &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in my area</li>
<li> Too gooey, hard to spread evenly on hair.</li>
<li> and unfortunately it&#x27;s in almost every hair product out there.</li>
<li> recommend it for sick hair.</li>

    <li> I have been using this for 3 months.  This is a second bottle. I have to apply when my hair is wet, blow and brush.  My hair was super damaged and frizzy. It makes my hair very silky and smooth. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair was very dry before using it , this is the second bottle i bought !!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended 👍</li>
    <li> My hair is long and really curly and everyone who has any kind of curly hair knows that it tends to be dry, so it needs to be hydrated on a daily basis. This serum is ideal because it is alcohol free. I use it - especially on my ends - when I wash my hair, but also occasionally when my hair is dry, and it does not make my hair greasy. Besides, the L&#x27;Oreal name is a guarantee.</li>
    <li> Like the product&#x27;s results, except for the perfume scent.  Nice hair but my allergies kick in.  Wish they&#x27;d make it without the scent.  Then it would be perfect.  Meanwhile, don&#x27;t try it if you have scent allergies.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Makes my hair easier to brush.. highly recommend it .. I bought for myself and for my sister as well</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it totally softened my hair even though I have colored it. I don&#x27;t use it too close to the scalp, just on the length and there is no greasy feeling at all, just softness.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. This product is very heavy on my fine, but thick, hair (compared to Texture Expert) and has a very strong smell. The smell is not unpleasant, just intense. It just does not do as nice a job and leaves the hair feeling dirtyish. It does not absorb and leave the clean shine Texture Expert does. You also must really use it on damp hair, while, with Texture Expert, you could add touch up shine that controlled the odd frizz, even when dry. I understand they don&#x27;t make the Texture Expert shine product anymore, but hope I can find some here on Amazon. :-) Wish companies would stop getting rid of stuff that works.</li>
    <li> Got this for our daughter. She battles frizzy hair and this tamed it. Doesn&#x27;t leave her hair feeling and looking oily.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal products have proven very satisfactory to me, and this one is no exception.  It works well for my hair.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product. restores damaged hair tips. I use for years.</li>
    <li> I have 53 year old grey hair, cut in a short pixie style.  This gives it just a little bit of shine so it doesn&#x27;t look quite so &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  It lasts a long long time as I use just about 1/2 pump  per day.</li>

    <li> It brings out the colors in my hair, adds a boost of shine, and isn&#x27;t messy like most serums. I like the fact it&#x27;s alcohol free because alcohol can cause brittle dryness and unfortunately it&#x27;s in almost every hair product out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s hard to find in my area so I get it here.  It&#x27;s good for keeping my somewhat course hair smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while; it gives good results.  It made my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for sick hair.</li>

    <li> When I decided to let my natural color grow out after decades of coloring my hair, I guess I wasn&#x27;t really surprised that I had very little original natural color left.  I decided to embrace the new natural, but I didn&#x27;t want it to be dull.  I tried several products for shine, and this is the winner, no question about it.  Two little squirts and my hair goes from gray to shiny silver.  It&#x27;s not greasy-feeling like other products I tried.  It&#x27;s a small bottle, but you only need a tiny bit, so it lasts forever.  I really love this stuff.</li>
    <li> great..... most amazing for frizzy hair.. works like magic... all day long.... definitely use after washing your hair.... daily!! Must buy</li>
    <li> I thought this would give my hair a nice shine, but it was a disappointment as I didn&#x27;t notice any difference although I did apply the serum  as per the instructions.  So far as smoothing, my hair didn&#x27;t need it so I can&#x27;t comment on that claim.</li>
    <li> For real, this stuff helped me get my hair back to being soft and beautiful after a horrible salon experience where the girl basically fried my already color damaged hair. I keep a spare bottle in my cabinet at all times!</li>
    <li> smooth and shiney!!first class:)</li>
    <li> Too gooey, hard to spread evenly on hair.</li>
