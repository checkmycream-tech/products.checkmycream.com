### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I purchased another to replace it as I already knew that I would be receiving an excellent product.</li>
      <li>I will not part with the Hai though because it is still awesome.      </li>
      <li>You will not believe how awesome your hair will look after you do this.      </li>
      <li>This is really an awesome iron.  </li>
      <li>but from all of the ones i tried this one is the best for me.</li>
      <li>The best thing I like about it is the 2\\&quot; plates which lets me finished my hair in minutes.</li>
      <li>Works GREAT!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect width for bangs and the rest of the hair.</li>
      <li>Works great, makes my hair shiny and doesn&#x27;t cause breakage or damage.</li>
      <li>Received this very quickly.. and works great!  </li>
      <li>and it is still in good condition</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a good 2 years now</li>
      <li>HAI products are some of the best heat styling tools available.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with mine all these years.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE this iron!!</li>
      <li>I own this flatiron.</li>
      <li>If it was lighter and more ergonomic, it would make the experience more pleasant.  </li>
      <li>The most you will be able to do is create a flip and nothing else.      </li>
      <li>With the 2inch plate you will not be able to do this.  </li>
      <li>It has worked fabulously for four years!</li>
      <li>I love the 2 inch model for my hair type</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
      <li>I bought both the 1inch and 2inch to see which worked better</li>
      <li>and i love it as well.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this flat-iron.</li>
      <li>The HAI 2\\&quot; Ceramic Flat Iron is one of the best out there.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with how long it lasted and how well the cord stood up to damage</li>
      <li>I am sure that the 1 inch plate is just as great, but you will spend more time on straightening smaller sections of your hair.  </li>
      <li>Definitely was a good investment!</li>
      <li>It works well and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I bought a second one about 6 months ago and it works great.  </li>
      <li>It leaves hair smooth, silky, and shiny.</li>
      <li>I had purchased the original HAI about 6 years ago</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s pretty safe on  your hair</li>
      <li>My first one lasted many years.</li>
      <li>This is the brand he (stylist) uses and he&#x27;s a very chic salon, so I&#x27;m happy I got it and after searching around, after counting shipping, Amazon offers the best price (50 bucks less than stylist, guess I&#x27;m just not that chic ;)  ).</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s ceramic it won&#x27;t burn your hair like the old metal style ones do, sure they&#x27;re cheaper and that&#x27;s why!  </li>
      <li>I love it so much acts like it did the first day :)</li>
      <li>Most effective flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>and i loved it until it burned out recently.</li>
      <li>(somehow I think my first one used to heat up more when I first had it, but I might be imagining things).</li>
      <li>Ceramic coating plates wore quickly</li>
      <li>I can straighten my hair completely in five minutes and it looks like a great professional blowout.</li>
      <li>I bought this flat iron from a local beauty supply and absolutely loved it!!!!  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s fast and easy for a lay-person to use.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this hair iron regularly for more than five years with no problems!  </li>
      <li>Received on time - my original hot iron (which was a HAI 2 also) had been overused -</li>
      <li>and it is stick straight after using this and SO smooth.  </li>

      <li>I find that washing my hair at night actually works better for me for some reason.      </li>
      <li>I had to come find an exact replacement.</li>
      <li>It gets incredibly hot (a bunch of heat settings), but never &#x27;sizzles&#x27; or drys out my hair.</li>
      <li>It provides a smooth style as long as it is cared-for properly (clean styling-product-buildup off the plates).</li>
      <li>Make sure your hair is dry when you use this.  </li>
      <li>It heats up really fast</li>
      <li>It gets my hair stick straight and doesn&#x27;t break the ends or fry it.</li>
      <li>A low setting straightens my hair great and it doesn&#x27;t curl back up later in the day</li>
      <li>and it really flattons out curly</li>
      <li>and she really recommended, it´s an excelent product.</li>
      <li>I looked around for something similar and cheaper, but after trying some of my friends&#x27; better priced irons, it was clear...</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and maintains its heat throughout (which is good, because I have long, thick hair).</li>
      <li>This model has been around for a long time - I had my first one of these for about 9 years until I dropped it one too many times and the plate came loose.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money for this salon-quality iron.</li>
      <li>The first only lasted 2.5 months.</li>
      <li>The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then.</li>
      <li>Ladies with my type of hair would do good to blow dry a bit first and then use this flat iron, but I can use it to straighten my hair from its curly state if I run it through my hair slowly and use lots of moisturizing hair product (</li>
      <li>I only gave it four stars because I wish it had the option to hear up a little more</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get the bone straight look you want with this flat iron.  </li>

<li> and I think that if you have thin hair, there is no reason to get the 2 inch unless you want to spend that extra money.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s lighter because this is hard to handle and hard on my wrists and feels heavy.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so clunky, bulky and hard to handle.</li>
<li> If you have thick hair like me, GET THIS ONE.  </li>
<li> That was back in June, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
<li> NOT WORTH $150!!!!  </li>
<li> With HAI, you can never go wrong.</li>
<li> I was, at the time, using some crappy flat iron that was horrible and took almost 30 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
<li> I know that some people who bought this seem to have bad experiences with theirs, but I think they just got a bad egg.  </li>
<li> &quot; I have never been so frustrated with a company.</li>
<li> (she wraps it around the iron, very bad for the wiring).     </li>

    <li> I was first introduced to HAI flat irons when I borrowed my then-boyfriend&#x27;s sister&#x27;s convertible flat iron. I was impressed with how long it lasted and how well the cord stood up to damage (she wraps it around the iron, very bad for the wiring).     I was, at the time, using some crappy flat iron that was horrible and took almost 30 minutes to straighten my hair. I went to my local beauty supply store and examined each of the flat irons in the aisle (seriously, I was there for almost an hour). I took the HAI 2 over the 1 since I have a ton of hair. That was back in June, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet! Takes me less than 7 minutes to straighten, my hair is shiny and sleek, and the iron never pulls at my hair. It&#x27;s a bit hefty, but check out my guns sometime! ;)    My roommate&#x27;s girlfriend has borrowed my iron a few times in the past and absolutely loves it! Definitely was a good investment!</li>
    <li> Works great, makes my hair shiny and doesn&#x27;t cause breakage or damage. A low setting straightens my hair great and it doesn&#x27;t curl back up later in the day</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair iron regularly for more than five years with no problems!  It provides a smooth style as long as it is cared-for properly (clean styling-product-buildup off the plates).</li>
    <li> I bought mine over 5 years ago from a local salon and it only broke because it kept dropping it. It&#x27;s wonderful! It leaves hair smooth, silky, and shiny. It heats up quickly and maintains its heat throughout (which is good, because I have long, thick hair). I recommend it to everyone. I looked around for something similar and cheaper, but after trying some of my friends&#x27; better priced irons, it was clear...I had to come find an exact replacement.</li>
    <li> i buy the HAI 2 Ceramic Flat Iron for my wife, and she is amazed with the ceramic flat iron and she really recommended, it´s an excelent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 8 years, so it&#x27;s durable enough.  It heats up right away.  The wide design saves lots of time compared to all those skinny models out there.  I noticed that the weight isn&#x27;t listed on here, and I&#x27;d like to know so I can find another 2\\&quot; or wider model that&#x27;s lighter because this is hard to handle and hard on my wrists and feels heavy.  If it was lighter and more ergonomic, it would make the experience more pleasant.  It&#x27;s so clunky, bulky and hard to handle.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the original HAI about 6 years ago and i loved it until it burned out recently. Then i found HAI 2 so i bought it and i love it as well. It heats up really fast and it&#x27;s the perfect width for bangs and the rest of the hair. I know there is a lot of different hair straighteners out there but from all of the ones i tried this one is the best for me. If you buy it you won&#x27;t regret it, i guarantee it.</li>
    <li> Received on time - my original hot iron (which was a HAI 2 also) had been overused - I&#x27;m talking I had it for years and the cord had become unraveled exposing some of the internal wiring (not safe and it would no longer heat as quickly) - so I purchased another to replace it as I already knew that I would be receiving an excellent product. I LOVE LOVE this iron!!</li>
    <li> I own this flatiron. It has worked fabulously for four years! It&#x27;s worth the extra money for this salon-quality iron. I can straighten my hair completely in five minutes and it looks like a great professional blowout. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other. I&#x27;ve had a few friends throw theirs away and buy this one after trying mine at my house. It gets incredibly hot (a bunch of heat settings), but never &#x27;sizzles&#x27; or drys out my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought an even nicer version than this one for $120 at a store. I bought the Copper-T and had 2 stop working on me in the span of 7 months. The first only lasted 2.5 months. The third one I got through the warranty was not put together correctly and ripped out my hair. The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then. I was told I could not have a refund because \\&quot;the store I bought it from is the company that took my money.\\&quot; I have never been so frustrated with a company.</li>
    <li> This model has been around for a long time - I had my first one of these for about 9 years until I dropped it one too many times and the plate came loose. I have voluminous, frizzy/curly/wavy hair from my Colombian side and the ceramic plates work wonders without damaging my hair. Most effective flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I only gave it four stars because I wish it had the option to hear up a little more (somehow I think my first one used to heat up more when I first had it, but I might be imagining things). Ladies with my type of hair would do good to blow dry a bit first and then use this flat iron, but I can use it to straighten my hair from its curly state if I run it through my hair slowly and use lots of moisturizing hair product (Moroccan oil, Kerastase oleo-relax are my favorites).</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair like me, GET THIS ONE.  I am sure that the 1 inch plate is just as great, but you will spend more time on straightening smaller sections of your hair.  You will not believe how awesome your hair will look after you do this.      I have had some people ask me about singeing hair so just in case you are curious about that...  Make sure your hair is dry when you use this.  You can either just blow out your hair with a regular blow dryer and then use the HAI, or do what I do.. Wash your hair at night before you go to bed and wake up in the morning to dry hair and go straight to the HAI.  I find that washing my hair at night actually works better for me for some reason.      I know that some people who bought this seem to have bad experiences with theirs, but I think they just got a bad egg.  This is really an awesome iron.  It is totally worth a try.  I bought both the 1inch and 2inch to see which worked better and I think that if you have thin hair, there is no reason to get the 2 inch unless you want to spend that extra money.  The only reason someone might want to get the 1inch plate over the 2inch plate is to create curls.  With the 2inch plate you will not be able to do this.  The most you will be able to do is create a flip and nothing else.      I&#x27;ve had mine for a good 2 years now and it is still in good condition but I just purchased a kiyoseki flatiron today because I wanted a 1inch plate.  I will not part with the Hai though because it is still awesome.      Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Still use this everyday yrs later! I love it so much acts like it did the first day :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used HAI irons for about 7 years. My first one lasted 5 years without issue, before the electric connection just came loose and I couldn&#x27;t fix it. I bought a second one about 6 months ago and it works great.  I have super thick, very curly, course hair and this flat iron rocks.  It gets my hair stick straight and doesn&#x27;t break the ends or fry it. Sounds like other people have had some issues with HAI irons but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with mine all these years.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses these in both 1 and 2 inch models.  I have long coarse, thick thick hair (think Brook Shields/Kirstie Alley) and it is stick straight after using this and SO smooth.  It comes with five heat settings and takes only seconds to heat up (10 I think).  I love the 2 inch model for my hair type, it&#x27;s fast and easy for a lay-person to use.  Since it&#x27;s ceramic it won&#x27;t burn your hair like the old metal style ones do, sure they&#x27;re cheaper and that&#x27;s why!  You can even use these on permed or damaged hair on lighter setting.  This is the brand he (stylist) uses and he&#x27;s a very chic salon, so I&#x27;m happy I got it and after searching around, after counting shipping, Amazon offers the best price (50 bucks less than stylist, guess I&#x27;m just not that chic ;)  ).</li>
    <li> Received this very quickly.. and works great!  The only problem is that because I purchased on Amazon I couldnt get the warrenty they offer... FYI</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron from a local beauty supply and absolutely loved it!!!!  That was until it shorted out on me after about the tenth use...  I tried to return it to the store, they wouldn&#x27;t take it back, mostly likely I&#x27;m thinking because this happens a lot?  They said I had to contact \\&quot;HAI\\&quot;.  Well I have had no such luck.  They have an answering machine set up that they obviously never check.  I have yet to receive a call back, and it&#x27;s been a month.  I guess all I can do is keep trying???  NOT WORTH $150!!!!  I would never buy a HAI again!</li>
    <li> The HAI 2\\&quot; Ceramic Flat Iron is one of the best out there. I purchase it and I&#x27;m in love with it. The best thing I like about it is the 2\\&quot; plates which lets me finished my hair in minutes.</li>
    <li> HAI products are some of the best heat styling tools available. I&#x27;ve been a user of HAI tools for almost 6 years, and I&#x27;ve never bought anything else. I have long, thick, wavy hair, and on the highest heat setting, it does the trick. With HAI, you can never go wrong.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll get the bone straight look you want with this flat iron.  It works well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> My first one lasted many years. Works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this flat-iron. It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s pretty safe on  your hair and it really flattons out curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it a 5-star rating, but it&#x27;s the only one i&#x27;ve owned so I&#x27;m not sure I have much to compare it with!</li>
    <li> Ceramic coating plates wore quickly</li>
