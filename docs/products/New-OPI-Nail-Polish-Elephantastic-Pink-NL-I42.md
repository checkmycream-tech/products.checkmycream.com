    <li> Gift for a granddaughter.  She loved it for herself and her girls.</li>
    <li> Will always be my favorite.  It goes very well with my Winter colors as well as any season.  It is my version of red since I started into my senior years.  I don&#x27;t use red or dark colors on my face and nails because it draws too much attention.  This is My Red!</li>
    <li> Love this color....really nice.</li>
    <li> Love this shade. It&#x27;s not too soft of to neon bright. It appears to be a smooth coral type hue.</li>

    <li> Wonderful pink color!</li>
    <li> Accidently received this when I had ordered Cajun Shrimp.  It is fine tho</li>
    <li> Husband loves the color on me - says its sweet and sexy.  Anything that gets him to want to massage my feet and kiss my hands, I&#x27;m for!</li>
    <li> Loved it! OPI nail polish is the best nail polish, lasts longer than most.</li>
    <li> Works great only took two to one coat love the color  looks great got here in time I would deffently recommend</li>

    <li> Very fun color. Perfect for the summer</li>
    <li> This is a great color if you&#x27;re going for a fun, summer, girly pink. Suits both toes and hands. My color lasted 2 weeks after 3 coats. It took about 3 to be non-transparent. But I think as it ages it&#x27;ll be less runny and only take 2 coats.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s OPI! Beautiful, long lasting color. I get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> I bought this color after choosing it at a nail salon. It looked so great on my nails that I wanted to buy it for myself!</li>
    <li> Great color and pharmapacks shipped it in a timely manor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair-skinned so I have a hard time finding colors that don&#x27;t overpower or wash me out. This is a gorgeous, perfect pink. Bright without looking tacky, but also feminine. It is more of an orange based pink, slight orange undertones. The picture is true to the color.</li>
    <li> The color is great it pops when it&#x27;s on your nails. It&#x27;s fun and I get compliments on it whenever I wear it!</li>
    <li> this is such a great spring/summer color. i love all of my opi polishes. they haven&#x27;t let me down. always love to see new colors.</li>
    <li> You have to do like 4 coats it&#x27;s too see thru</li>
