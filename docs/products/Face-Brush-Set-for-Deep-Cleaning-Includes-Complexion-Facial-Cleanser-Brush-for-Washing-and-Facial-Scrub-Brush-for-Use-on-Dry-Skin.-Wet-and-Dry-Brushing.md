      <li>received this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>My 60 year old face looks and feels much better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and after using these brushes for a week my pores have significantly shrunk leaving the texture of my face looking silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>I began using these brushes right after I got them almost a week ago.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t see spending that kind of money on the expensive battery operated facial cleansing brushes, these are too perfect for do</li>
      <li>the construction of the bristles used 100% genuine boar hair, I simply run brush under hot water and use a fingertip or shampoo or soap to clean bristles.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and gentle but very effective at removing the dry skin build up.</li>
      <li>I love these facial brushes!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>any more that give that extra touch.</li>
      <li>The exfoliating capabilities are exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
      <li>They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>My beauty products and brushes are used so frequently that often I feel the need to replace the item to remain sanitary and clean.</li>
      <li>Not only do these brushes do a better job of exfoliation than my previous skin care products, they are saving me several hundred dollars a year and are considerably better for the environment than many of the alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better used when brush is wet and face moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>works very well.</li>
      <li>These are very well made brushes.</li>
      <li>Every time I use it, my skin feels much cleaner and softer.  </li>
      <li>The brushes were shipped very promptly.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>I like how I can gently exfoliate my skin with them.</li>
      <li>I love the softness in the one brush and the firmness on the other brush.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the wet brush, and it does a good job</li>
      <li>There was an inventory issue that happened to be an error because the page had not updated quick enough when attempted to purchase.</li>
      <li>The combination of the wet and dry brush in my skin cleaning routine really makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
      <li>They were gentle on my skin and did not irritate my already sensitive skin by leaving any marks.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t feel hard like the cheaply made ones, and they help to make my skin soft, clean and glowing at the end of a cleaning routine.</li>
      <li>the dry brush to use on dry skin (gently of course) also gives pleasant results, but the wet brush is what makes the purchase a no-brainer.</li>
      <li>Paired with your choice of cleanser, they will easily replace your previous skin care solutions.</li>
      <li>It gently exfoliates and deep cleanse my skin, and you can really feel that it removes dirt and make up residue.</li>
      <li>It has a nicely made wooden handle but is a much firm bristle brush.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s made a decent leg scratcher.</li>
      <li>Even though they are small its easier to handle so that you can control and rub for better results.</li>
      <li>The brushes arrived quickly &amp; customer service emailed me after the fact to see check that I was satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes seem to be decent enough, especially for how inexpensive they are.</li>
      <li>so I have nothing to compare it too, but the wet brush bristles are a nice midpoint between sturdy enough to get the dirt off and soft enough not to scrape your skin off.</li>
      <li>but when you start using it for face it doesn&#x27;t feel soft</li>
      <li>It is soft and worked well.</li>

    <li> The brushes are small and rough.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful!  I ordered these for myself to use as part of my daily facial regime.  The exfoliating capabilities are exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.  They&#x27;re made of quality materials, easy to use and fit nicely in your hand.  My face and neck were noticeably smother than when using just an exfoliating scrub.  I&#x27;d recommend it for any skin type.  I was able to purchase this in a promotional launch.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Does a great job exfoliating my face. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> What a great product for the face, gentle and perfect for cleaning your face. The bristles did not dig into my skin and cause red places. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What makes these better that the electric ones is the fact that you don&#x27;t need batteries! I like the wooden one for my body and the plastic one for my face. These are really nice and leaving you feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> It felt great on my skin. It wasn’t harsh or anything – it’s just right. Every time I use it, my skin feels much cleaner and softer.  It gently exfoliates and deep cleanse my skin, and you can really feel that it removes dirt and make up residue. I like using makeup so this is definitely just great for me—it allows my skin to breathe.</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;BrusyBrush is a great company to purchase from. I&#x27;ve never had issues with Customer Service, inferior products, or usage being unappealing. My beauty products and brushes are used so frequently that often I feel the need to replace the item to remain sanitary and clean. No desire to do this now having this facial brush.&lt;br /&gt;With the construction of the bristles used 100% genuine boar hair, I simply run brush under hot water and use a fingertip or shampoo or soap to clean bristles. I like the handle because its wood and doesn&#x27;t collapse after frequent use. My skin is softer and little to no sensitivity when first using the product. Better used when brush is wet and face moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In favor of customer&#x27;s loyalty and satisfaction problems or concerns easy to return or have issue resolved. There was an inventory issue that happened to be an error because the page had not updated quick enough when attempted to purchase. Thank you for taking care of me.</li>
    <li> These are very well made brushes. I love the way they make my skin feel, so smooth, soft, clean and glowing. The bristles are soft and gentle but very effective at removing the dry skin build up. I use the brushes everyday as past of my skincare routine. They clean my skin way better than just using a cleanser alone. Highly recommended, they would also make a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> My skin is softer after a few days of use! I no longer look dry and scaly- and my skin care products seem to be working better for my skin! Great product!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews on skin brushes as our daughter is dealing with Lyme Disease.  This brush is not only good quality but is also at a reasonable price.  Lyme Disease can be a very complicated and expensive disease to treat so every little bit helps.  I ordered both the full body brush with removable handle and face brushes. This company provides fast shipping and great personal customer service.  They care about their customer and want to be sure each order is filled and approved of to meet their expectations.  Not too many companies out there any more that give that extra touch.</li>
    <li> I used for dry brushing and dead skin is removed.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The plastic one is good and it gives a gentle exfoliation.  The wood one didn&#x27;t work at all. I threw it away.  The bristles were falling off and sticking o my face every use.  So, I occasionally use the plastic one and started using a loofah for cleansing.</li>
    <li> Really good quality brushes!</li>
    <li> works very well. thanks.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good brush set for the money. I actually bought a more expensive &amp; highly rated brush at tgthe e same time. I sent that one back because of quality issues.</li>
    <li> What an awesome set of brushes, I’ve been using my set for about a week and I can tell a very big difference in the way may face is starting to look.  The brushes seem to bring out the shine and the natural beauty.  I love the softness in the one brush and the firmness on the other brush.  The brush I use depends on what I’m doing i.e., cleaning my face or messaging it.  Prior to using the brushes I had a problem with my pores being clogged and getting blackheads, since using the brushes I have seen that problem slowly diminish and with continued use I’m sure can be free of my blackhead problem.  Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> purchased this brush last week, i haven&#x27;t tried the brown brush yet so i don&#x27;t know what to say with that - but i use the blue brush regularly, it kinda hurts though whenever i use to scrub my face when you touch it, it feels soft but when you start using it for face it doesn&#x27;t feel soft but since i bought it, I use it anyway to avoid the hassle of returning it. I guess you get what you pay for. But take note that i guess it varies on peoples skin and sensitivity, im not saying this is what everybody would feel when you start using it - but for me, it does hurt especially on the sensitive part of my face like cheeks below my eyes and overall cheeks - my forehead too before but i guess i got used to it on my forehead now.</li>
    <li> These little brushes are useful for a lot of things besides facial cleansing:  I use them for cleaning/polishing shoes, pre-treating stubborn spots on laundry/scrubbing collars, cleaning jewelry, etc etc.  The sturdy plastic zip- bag the brushes come in I use as a soap container when I go the gym or bagging snacks.  The wooden brush is great for scrubbing the mini carrots that grow in the garden without shredding them.  You get the idea!  I ordered a half-dozen to use around the house and am glad I did.  Cheaper than buying them individually in the store and then just throwing away the packaging...</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, wish I used them sooner. Who needs the expensive gizmos , this works just as well.</li>
    <li> I am 81 years old and my face had started to feel like sandpaper. After using the Brush is feels more like it did when I was 21 years old. I may not look as good as I did 60 years ago but my face feels just as good as it did then. Iove my Brush!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the wet brush, and it does a good job (but so does a wash cloth). I just can&#x27;t help but feel these brushes are overpriced. They are tiny. The facial brush could stand to be a tad more firm. And I don&#x27;t even know what to do with the wooden brush. So far it&#x27;s made a decent leg scratcher.</li>
    <li> Was excited to use them and love the fact that they have a brush cover to protect them. Even though they are small its easier to handle so that you can control and rub for better results.</li>
    <li> Love it - tried it for the first time and it was awesome!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second brush product I bought from MCC Global Trading LLC. This facial brush is the best one I have tried so far. I used it on my wet face to remove peeling skin and dirt not wash by ordinary soap. I also used it even when my skin was dry to removed my unwanted dry skin which is very visible after applying dry face powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel of it and very soft on my skin. I usually use face towel to clean my face when showering to remove dry and peeling skin but it is coarse and sometimes will leave itchy and red patches. This facial brush really done its wonders.</li>
    <li> I love these facial brushes!  I&#x27;m 61 years old and after using these brushes for a week my pores have significantly shrunk leaving the texture of my face looking silky smooth.  I still have smile lines and crow&#x27;s feet, of course, but my skin looks and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I used the small clear/blue brush. It is soft and worked well. I did not use the other brush yet. It has a nicely made wooden handle but is a much firm bristle brush. Not sure if it is to firm for use on face. I will give it a try at some point and expect it will work as well as the other.</li>
    <li> The brushes were shipped very promptly. They appear to be well made, and they are an excellent value for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several days after I received the brushes I was contacted by one of the company co-founders to see whether I got the brushes and what I thought of them. As I told the co-founder, I&#x27;ve recently had to replace my microbead exfoliants because of their environmental impact and had not found a satisfactory solution before I tried these brushes. Not only do these brushes do a better job of exfoliation than my previous skin care products, they are saving me several hundred dollars a year and are considerably better for the environment than many of the alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am incredibly impressed by the quality of the product and the dedication of the company to customer satisfaction. If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliant I can&#x27;t recommend these brushes enough. Paired with your choice of cleanser, they will easily replace your previous skin care solutions.</li>
    <li> These are quality brushes. They don&#x27;t feel hard like the cheaply made ones, and they help to make my skin soft, clean and glowing at the end of a cleaning routine. I even liked these so much that I bought some for my sisters and mother for Christmas. The price is good and it could be a good gift for any woman in your family.&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the fact it came in a set of two. That makes it even more of a deal, and with the economy, I am always looking to do whatever I can to save a buck or two.</li>
    <li> These brushes were awesome, went beyond what i expected these brushes to be.  They were gentle on my skin and did not irritate my already sensitive skin by leaving any marks.  Leaves skin feeling fresh, clean and exfoliated.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Excellent for men who get ingrown facial hairs!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  Need to use them more than I do.</li>
    <li> These brushes are provide deeper and more effective way for facial care. Well made and much more hygienic then a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> good brush and good quality for a reasonable prize. I am glad I picked these set.</li>
    <li> Both wetand dry brushes work really well. My skin is smoother and brighter!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t see spending that kind of money on the expensive battery operated facial cleansing brushes, these are too perfect for do it yourselfers like me.  the soft brush, to use wet, really removes makeup at the end of the day, and refreshes in the morning before you put on makeup new.  Use your normal cleanser and a circular motion on your skin, it is marvelously refreshing. the dry brush to use on dry skin (gently of course) also gives pleasant results, but the wet brush is what makes the purchase a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> My 60 year old face looks and feels much better.  This was what I&#x27;ve been needing!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> First time ordering from this Amazon seller &amp; I&#x27;m super pleased. The brushes arrived quickly &amp; customer service emailed me after the fact to see check that I was satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes seem to be decent enough, especially for how inexpensive they are. I&#x27;ve never used a dry brush before so I have nothing to compare it too, but the wet brush bristles are a nice midpoint between sturdy enough to get the dirt off and soft enough not to scrape your skin off. I&#x27;d recommend this inexpensive brush set to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love my face brush set. It is excellent with accomplishing that clean face feeling. Something else I stumbled on by surprise was that the dry brush got rid of my headaches. I made gentle circular motions on face and down neck and repeated. When I was done I no longer had the headache. A few days later I had a headache and so I ran to my dry brush and began gentle circular motions on face and neck. Just like I was expecting, the headache went away and I did not have to take any meds for my headache. The dry brush did it all. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I use them daily in the shower.  They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I like how I can gently exfoliate my skin with them.</li>
    <li> I began using these brushes right after I got them almost a week ago. I can already see a difference in my acne on my face! I havent used the dry brush it on the rest of my skin because I bought it solely for my face. But I may end up buying another for my body!  The combination of the wet and dry brush in my skin cleaning routine really makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
