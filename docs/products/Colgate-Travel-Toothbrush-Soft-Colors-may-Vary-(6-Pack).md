      <li>This was a nice fine on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this again at my dollar store</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>Just wish there were more color options.</li>
      <li>My toothbrush travel case was a two part tube that I had been using for a decade (or more).  </li>
      <li>Will get you through many travels.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen much better folding toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I love the way they fold in on themselves for packing and they don&#x27;t feel flimsy when extended.</li>
      <li>That may just be because I don&#x27;t travel a lot, but I guess I&#x27;ll never know for sure.  </li>
      <li>We have taken them on many trips and they hold up well.  </li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush cause I can fold it up</li>
      <li>in China - I would love to find a travel toothbrush made in the US or Canada.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is the perfect length when folded at the cost of a larger girth.</li>
      <li>I love these folding toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>This tooth brush folds up nicely and if it falls I&#x27;m cool with it.</li>
      <li>The bristles are relatively strong compared to most toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>make sure you clean them often though.</li>
      <li>I prefer to brush after every meal, this makes that easy.</li>
      <li>They fold up and can be easily thrown into a bag or pocket.</li>
      <li>These toothbrushes work well, travel easily and most importantly, stay clean while traveling.  </li>
      <li>but I feel like it won&#x27;t unlatch so that is fine by me.</li>
      <li>I generally brush my teeth about 3 times a day and having a great toothbrush is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works fine for me.</li>
      <li>Fantastic, compact,  toothbrush.</li>
      <li>the brissles is fantastic.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>But they fold up nicely and are decent brushes.  </li>
      <li>The price for this pack is well worth it!</li>
      <li>Aside from being a first rate travel toothbrush, the kids will love opening and closing it.</li>
      <li>hubby and I&#x27;d been looking for a travel toothbrush, one that was easy to pack, extended beyond the single use of airplane toothbrushes, and was reasonably nice!</li>
      <li>You also get a good idea on the size as compared to a standard deodorant.</li>
      <li>As an adult, I am pretty good about brushing after meals whenever I am out.  </li>
      <li>These are effective, fine toothbrushes when open.  </li>
      <li>These are great for backpacking / camping, as well as other travelling.  </li>
      <li>Super for travel.</li>
      <li>The head is not as nice as some of the newer brushes I have seen, but it&#x27;s still a nice basic soft bristle brush.</li>
      <li>The main downside is that it takes quite a strong grip and good fingernails to open it.</li>
      <li>I love how it&#x27;s a full size once folded out, and it colses completely up when compacted.</li>
      <li>This Colgate toothbrush is very smart, and even though it&#x27;s just a toothbrush, I&#x27;m pretty excited about it.</li>
      <li>That trade off is worth it to me.</li>
      <li>It would have been nice if all were different colors as I was looking for brushes for each member of my family so that we would know whose is whose.  </li>
      <li>and these new ones are definitely nice and soft.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fantastic, compact,  toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes work well, travel easily and most importantly, stay clean while traveling.  They fold up and can be easily thrown into a bag or pocket.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and I like a folding toothbrush. This is a nice one. It has a good toothbrush head and the handle has a nice feel in the hand.  Unlike some travel toothbrushes, it holds up well to vigorous brushing and brushes like a regular toothbrush. I gave it 3 instead of 4 or 5 stars because I find it very hard to open. It is nicely compact when folded and great for brushing when open, but moving it between the open and closed states is a challenge.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a good idea, but, it is a little hard to open and close it back up. Once open, you see what a great design it is, and it feels solid. And closed, it is nice and small and protected for travel. It&#x27;s just that opening the catch involves a lot of finger strength and wrestling with the catch.</li>
    <li> + Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to open and close&lt;br /&gt;+ Stays open or closed&lt;br /&gt;+ Bristles are soft compared to most travel toothbrushes (but not as soft as a regular toothbrush)&lt;br /&gt;- As the brush gets worn, the bristles splay outwards and can get caught in cover when closing, making them even more wonky</li>
    <li> I recently got braces and found myself needing to have a toothbrush handy in a lot of strange places.  These fold-up travel toothbrushes worked perfectly for that.  They fold in half and stay tightly sealed to keep the bristles clean.  Two not-so-great elements keep me from giving 5 stars: The handle has a goofy, bulbish shape - I don&#x27;t know if this is supposed to be ergonomic or what - that results in the brush being larger than it needs to be when folded; The hinge mechanism on the handle/case can be difficult and I have had one break on me from normal use within a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Common travel toothbrushes usually seem flimsy in the bristles or the design, so I thought I&#x27;d try a name brand.  We gave these as gifts at Christmas since they come in a 6-pack and we don&#x27;t travel often (we used ours for backpacking).  The design is great, but the bristles are quite hard.  I enjoy a medium, or sometimes a soft bristle rating, but this toothbrush was a hard or extra-hard.  It&#x27;s fine for occasional use, but it was a small disappointment, since this brush carries Colgate&#x27;s name.  It would be nice if some in the six-pack had feminine colors so my husband doesn&#x27;t forget whose is whose.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Great Deal for the money! These are great! I seem to always lose the caps that go on separately or they come off in my little toiletry kit. This toothbrush closes in on itself so neither is an issue any longer. The latch that closes on this is very tight, almost too tight but I feel like it won&#x27;t unlatch so that is fine by me. These do fold down small enough that I have put one in my purse and car glove box as well.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my travel bag. Fold up very small and take up about as much space as a travel size toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I used the standard toothbrush and travel case for years that would gather moisture and would leak all over my bag. It wasn&#x27;t very sanitary. I saw these about a year ago in my grocery store and have been hooked ever since. They are very compact, contain slits to allow for proper drying, and all parts that go in your mouth remain completely covered. Some reviews I&#x27;ve read complained that the bristles were too rough, but to me they seem just like any other soft toothbrush on the market and are just fine. I definitely will keep buying these for my future travels!</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but the best I&#x27;ve found. It doesn&#x27;t leave toothpaste on the bag and doesn&#x27;t drip, although it isn&#x27;t s dry as the desert either. The main downside is that it takes quite a strong grip and good fingernails to open it. Arthritis sufferers need not apply.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is so compact and discrete it is unbelievable. It can fit in my small purse and I don&#x27;t feel bad if I lose it. It great for overnight stays, and mid day brushing after that tuna sandwich with extra onions. It is a great thing to have for guests and family that visit for the weekend. I only wish it came in medium firmness. Gets the job done anyways. Great thing to have in your \\&quot;travel size&#x27; arsenal.</li>
    <li> These are great!  I had been looking for travel toothbrushes for a while and finally decided to buy online.  I disagree with the reviews that said they were not soft... I thought they were a typical soft toothbrush, not too hard, not too soft.  The handle opens up and the toothbrush folds in half and the toothbrush head is inserted inside and then you can snap it shut so the toothbrush head is completely covered.  These are great for traveling and I have been very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes for my kids!!</li>
    <li> This travel toothbrush gets the job done.  When folded, it is about half as long as a regular toothbrush.  The mechanics of it seem to be durable.  The only bad part is that it is not particularly comfortable to brush your teeth with.  The bristles are relatively strong compared to most toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I received the items as described before the estimated delivery date.  Great for use at home and for travel.  A bit too hard, but doesn&#x27;t impact negatively my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great travel toothbrushes, they do the job and fold up inside their own handles. Very compact and convenient.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but it is NOT soft.</li>
    <li> These are great for travel! make sure you clean them often though. I like to soak mine in boiling water and then rinse really quick under ice cold water.. Gets rid of any germs that may acquire from being kept in a bag.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel and the office.  Great travel toothbrush!</li>
    <li> We buy packs of these before every trip. They are cheap enough to be disposable after a trip, and save a huge amount of space in the 1 qt plastic TSA toiletries bag. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a superior design to previous travel toothbrushes I have owned.  the brush head swings into a compartment that is closed by a hinged lid so that when not in use the brush is kept clean.  When the brush is swung out into position, the same hinged lid forms part of the handle and keeps the brush head in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult orthodontic patient I have to brush regularly, particularly after meals.  If I&#x27;m out at a restaurant or at a friend&#x27;s house, I can carry this pocket brush (together with a 1 ounce travel-size tube of toothpaste) in my pocket, and use the brush discreetly in a rest room or bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brush itself is concerned, I would say that it is comparable to other non-travel toothbrushes of its size.  The head is definitely adult size, and works as expected for a manual brush.  I&#x27;m very happy to have the convenience of this folding design so I can carry it with me as needed.</li>
    <li> I love these folding toothbrushes. They are perfect for the gym, the office, and for travel. I usually keep one with me at all times in my bag too. They are a good size, with a sturdy grip/handle for brushing. I would recommend these to anyone who appreciates proper dental hygiene like I do.</li>
    <li> I have opened one of the six and used it.  I like the softer bristles.  the design is very pleasing with the head folding completely into the base and the base closing over it with breather holes for the bristles to dry out between uses, but small enough to probably not let lint in from your pocket.  light weight and sturdy and different colors.  I like to carry a toothbrush all the time, especially when traveling to refresh my mouth.  it is about half the size folded as a regular toothbrush, which invariably does not fit well in the pocket and gets in the way and dirty too easily.  there is no place to carry a tiny tube of toothpaste like some airline ones, but I did not expect that.</li>
    <li> Exactly as stated. Great for travel bag.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and these are what I use on a regular basis. Easy and compact, perfect for the business traveler!</li>
    <li> must have for the road warrior. makes it easier to pack a smaller sized toiletry bag that can&#x27;t hold a regular toothbrush + cover.</li>
    <li> This is what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> These are just as described.  I like the fact they fold into itself and makes it compact to carry.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, travel toothbrush. I received all 6 as advertised, they sent 2 of each color (red, green and blue).</li>
    <li> Excellent travel toothbrush, you will never lose the cap. Nice handle and it unfolds to a full-size toothbrush. Nice size when folded. Best price you&#x27;ll find.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush cause I can fold it up so I don&#x27;t have to worry about something getting on my bristles. Can&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
    <li> Love these. Super for travel.</li>
    <li> Purchased because of the folding capability. Small, but don&#x27;t seem very durable. I guess that is is why they come in a six-pack. After a four-day camping trip the brush bristles are no longer straight.</li>
    <li> Love these one piece travel toothbrushes!!</li>
    <li> I bought this pack for use on my honeymoon as well as other travels I might take. I love how it&#x27;s a full size once folded out, and it colses completely up when compacted. The price for this pack is well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for.  I find the usual cases for travel brushes just get moldy.  This brush cleverly folds in to the handle, so it gets plenty of air to dry properly, while still being well protected.  The head is not as nice as some of the newer brushes I have seen, but it&#x27;s still a nice basic soft bristle brush.</li>
    <li> These are the bestbestbest travel toothbrushes EVER! We love them- especially for camping! There&#x27;s no cases or caps to use, and they fold up super small and portable</li>
    <li> A perfect design for traveling or your purse.</li>
    <li> i loved it&lt;br /&gt;great for travelling&lt;br /&gt;light and good performance</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I still have no cavities.  That may just be because I don&#x27;t travel a lot, but I guess I&#x27;ll never know for sure.  I love the way they fold in on themselves for packing and they don&#x27;t feel flimsy when extended.</li>
    <li> These are effective, fine toothbrushes when open.  I don&#x27;t find them easy open.  Small children or someone with arthritic hands would have difficulty. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this to take to work with me so I could brush after meals. It&#x27;s very easy to carry in my pocket with my keys and it&#x27;s ability to fold to hide the brissles is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and so far there isn&#x27;t any mold or yuckyness growing inside the case from the water left on the brush. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My toothbrush travel case was a two part tube that I had been using for a decade (or more).  I looked inside it and was absolutely disgusted by the mold and junk growing in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush folds down into the handle.  It is very easy to clean.  When open it is very stable.  There are very small air holes to let your toothbrush dry out, but small enough not to get the inside of your toiletry bag all wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a six pack of various colors - all pretty neutral.  (I gave my daughter the purple one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush head itself is soft and full size.  Works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I found these are great for traveling, emergency kits and company that shows up. I have since made up guest gift boxes and include these each time so my guest do no have worry about dragging toiletries around in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> The brush part of this does not seem as good quality as non-travel brushes but it is adequate and convenient because it folds and locks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but mine keeps growing mildew in the area near the bristles, which is pretty gross, and when you fold it up, the bristles don&#x27;t fit neatly into the thing.  There&#x27;s very little margin around them, so a few get pushed out and bent, and that causes more to get pushed out and bent, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel, to carry with me when out and about seeing the sights. I prefer to brush after every meal, this makes that easy. Compact enough for my pocket.</li>
    <li> Good for travel - no need for a carrying case. Good size to fit into a pocket. The ones I received: not soft, not hard, just medium or so.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- folds up into the handle, so it takes up little space&lt;br /&gt;- the bristles are protected when folded up&lt;br /&gt;- the handle has vents to help prevent bacteria buildup on the bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the handle is a bit hard to open</li>
    <li> These are very convenient.  They fold in half so take very little space in the luggage.  We have taken them on many trips and they hold up well.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Great idea! It&#x27;s a real, quality tooth brush also. I&#x27;ve tried other travel toothbrushes, that are junk, but this one actually cleans your teeth, and doesn&#x27;t shed bristles the first time it&#x27;s used.</li>
    <li> I generally brush my teeth about 3 times a day and having a great toothbrush is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hubby and I&#x27;d been looking for a travel toothbrush, one that was easy to pack, extended beyond the single use of airplane toothbrushes, and was reasonably nice! This Colgate toothbrush is very smart, and even though it&#x27;s just a toothbrush, I&#x27;m pretty excited about it. And it&#x27;s not just for travel. This can encourage you to pack a toothbrush in your purse and brush your teeth immediately after meals when you are out and about. It&#x27;s a great habit to get into so carrying a toothbrush becomes an essential part of your daily packings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included pictures to show you just how it snaps open and acts like a normal toothbrush and then closes up neatly so you can pack it up. You also get a good idea on the size as compared to a standard deodorant. Notice that the brush itself is protected, whereas with normal toothbrushes, you always need to think of a cap so the brush doesn&#x27;t get dirty or disinfected when it comes into contact with whatever else you pack it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is beyond reasonable. Each of these toothbrushes come just over one dollar, and you can use it for one trip and then discard. Brilliant! Love Colgate and this brilliant travel and hygiene product. Don&#x27;t travel without it. Hope this was helpful and happy brushing :)!</li>
    <li> Amazon was the only place I could find these.  Great item and great price!</li>
    <li> I always seem to lose travel toothbrushes, so being able to get these for about a buck a piece is great. The toothbrushes are good quality and work just fine. I managed to lose one already on a camping trip, but I have seven to go! This was a nice fine on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Compact and works great. Will get you through many travels.</li>
    <li> I usually hate travel toothbrushes because I never have found any that work half as well as a regular tooth brush. I really like these though.  They have real heads on them, they have strong handles, they fold up super easy and protect the head well when closed, and lastly they have a little vent near the head so the moisture can escape.  These are very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this same 6-pack last year when I got braces.  As an adult, I am pretty good about brushing after meals whenever I am out.  The toothbrushes definitely did not seem soft as the label indicated, but they were fine for brushing on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought another 6-pack and these new ones are definitely nice and soft.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who needs a travel toothbrush.  It folds up nice and compact.  It has little airholes for ventilation, however I still like to keep mine open for as long as possible until it is dry.</li>
    <li> I first found this at a dollar tree. I bought two, one for work and one for home. Buying the 6 pack so I&#x27;ll have 1 for work,home, and my backpack. I know it&#x27;s a travel brush but I always loose toothbrush covers, I live alone so those containers to hold toothbrushes seem unneccesary and I hate it whenever my toothbrush falls or if the bristles touches something, it&#x27;s an OC thing I know.  This tooth brush folds up nicely and if it falls I&#x27;m cool with it. It&#x27;s not a supersoft bristle but I like that. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this again at my dollar store but it&#x27;s worth the extra 75 cents each for such a handy brush.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect travel toothbrush for your work bag, your suitcase, your overnight bag, etc. My favourite travel toothbrush so far.</li>
    <li> It is hard finding quality travel toothbrushes, but I found them here.  Very satisfied.  Brush folds conveniently into handle for storage.</li>
    <li> These are small but they get to all the right places. I am definitely going to be purchasing some more.</li>
    <li> My son just got braces, so he needs to take the toothbrush to school. This is \\&quot;stealth\\&quot; enough that he is comfortable with it. It folds up into it&#x27;s handle to carry around in his pocket with out the pocket lint getting on this bristles. (not that I think he would care about that)</li>
    <li> I ordered and paid for a 6-pack of toothbrushes and received a single toothbrush...what gives???  Is this a case of bait and switch???</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrushes overall.  They are difficult to open the first 7-10 times but after that they work great.</li>
    <li> The product title says, \\&quot;soft\\&quot;.  I tried one brush and it is as stiff as any brush I have ever used.  I do not see how any dental organization ever approves brushes this hard.  It feels like a paint scraping steel brush.  Thanks Colgate for the bait and switch.</li>
    <li> Vents enough to prevent things from getting horrible, sealed enough to keep the horrible from getting in, manufactured to feel like about the quality of a normal toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Aside from being a first rate travel toothbrush, the kids will love opening and closing it. Therefore, they will look forward to brushing their teeth. A win-win.</li>
    <li> Just one thing to consider before buying this product : the toothbrush tends to wear off quiet quick. I have brushed my teeth with this for about 1 to 2 weeks and it was already beaten up. Yes, it was still usable, but one would think &amp;#34;Travel&amp;#34; toothbrush would be little more sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is cost-effective brush for backpacking, no doubt.</li>
    <li> Best travel toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!  I keep it in my purse.</li>
    <li> These are great for backpacking / camping, as well as other travelling.  I put one in my pack, one in my travel kit, and gave one to each of my sons for their backpacks.  I have spares for the future too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fold up nicely and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes! Perfect for those with Invisaligns and needing to brush their teeth after every meal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a good travel toothbrush so I&#x27;m happy with these overall.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Well-designed - the top part folds down and snaps into the handle.  I think it will stay cleaner than those that just fold down.&lt;br /&gt;Good price - these 6 should last me for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are not soft - it says soft but they are definitely not.  Since it&#x27;s just a travel toothbrush and not my main toothbrush, it&#x27;s not that big a deal, but if you need soft bristles, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Made in China - I would love to find a travel toothbrush made in the US or Canada.</li>
    <li> very sturdy. I used it on a tahoe trip and got hooked on the convenience. I carry one on me at all times now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my camping trip to Yosemite and it was perfect. I usually use a protective cap on my regular toothbrush when I travel, but the length makes it awkward to pack with all of my backpacking supplies. This toothbrush is the perfect length when folded at the cost of a larger girth. That trade off is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Best travel toothbrush I&#x27;ve found yet, and perfect for the office - discreetly folds away into your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the similar GUM folding toothbrush, these ones are much better built.  The GUM ones tend to have a wobbly joint between the handle and brush when the brush is extended for use, these ones are fairly solid.  These Colgate ones also have a slightly slimmer profile when closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing to complain about is some of the garish colours.  I&#x27;m not going to take a lime green toothbrush to work...</li>
    <li> I gave them away because they were really hard to pry open. I&#x27;ve seen much better folding toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I received 6.  It would have been nice if all were different colors as I was looking for brushes for each member of my family so that we would know whose is whose.  But they fold up nicely and are decent brushes.  Just wish there were more color options.</li>
