      <li>This provides excellent coverage and has a wonderful texture.</li>
      <li>skin and everything makes me break out; this product doesn&#x27;t and covers so perfectly that no foundation is needed.</li>
      <li>I guess maybe it&#x27;s good as a concealer?</li>
      <li>Good color and covers well for a light formula.</li>
      <li>It seems to have more cream in it and therefore goes on smoother.</li>
      <li>product is more dense than the BB creams, therefore covers better.</li>
      <li>prefer lighter more natural.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as nicely as the Tarte, not as smooth.  </li>
      <li>This product goes on very smooth, and does a fantastic job of delivering light/moderate coverage, smoothing out skin&#x27;s appearance, all the while moisturizing my fact.  </li>
      <li>Tried this one knowing that Clinique is known for fragrance free &amp; hypoallergenic products.  </li>
      <li>I like Clinique products and I was excited about this cream.  </li>
      <li>I also had a reaction to it right away.  </li>
      <li>On occasion I might throw some powder on top of it, but it is not need for a daily basis.</li>
      <li>It is much better than de BBcream because  you only have to use one cream for all and it have 30 hight sun protection</li>
      <li>It looked like a mask at first</li>
      <li>I have tried several BB creams but I like this one better.</li>
      <li>And since it has SPF and I&#x27;m pretty concerned about preventing sun damage</li>
      <li>After I covered my whole face</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>but it was quickly absorbed and looked natural in a minute.</li>
      <li>Be careful about the color selection, I picked medium light</li>
      <li>Caveat: I don&#x27;t normally wear foundation or powder on my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t take it off fast enough.  </li>
      <li>Again, not having used foundation and powder regularly, I&#x27;m surprised that maybe this is what wearing makeup is like?  </li>
      <li>I have used a few different BB creams before and was excited about CC cream when I heard it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>While I do wish that Clinique made this in a slightly lighter shade, this cream is amazing because it literally blends away imperfections, and a little goes a very, very long way.</li>
      <li>but I am afraid I have to wait till fall to use it because I have a slight tan and medium light looks too light on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good color and covers well for a light formula.</li>
    <li> Caveat: I don&#x27;t normally wear foundation or powder on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample tube of this while a Clinique moisturizer purchase.  And since it has SPF and I&#x27;m pretty concerned about preventing sun damage, I figure I&#x27;d try it out without actually knowing what CC creams are.  My experience with it is all cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cakey-looking: I thought it was just a tinted moisturizer but felt very heavy - both in weight and in color - putting it on.  I felt like I was basically putting a layer of paint over my face and I was very careful not to use a lot.  After I covered my whole face and I took a close look in the mirror, all the faint lines in my face were exaggerated if I should crack a smile.&lt;br /&gt;* Heavy and greasy: I felt like my face was inside a grease mask.  Again, not having used foundation and powder regularly, I&#x27;m surprised that maybe this is what wearing makeup is like?  How do other women put up with this?&lt;br /&gt;* Looks unnatural: With the above two cons, I can only say that I looked so unnatural after putting this product on my face that I will never ever again try to cover my face up with foundations or tinted creams or whatever this might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t take it off fast enough.  Thankfully it was a sample.  I guess maybe it&#x27;s good as a concealer?</li>
    <li> Feels caked-on&lt;br /&gt;I prefer lighter more natural.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it has ingredients that actually breaks down collagen.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I have used a few different BB creams before and was excited about CC cream when I heard it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is more dense than the BB creams, therefore covers better. It looked like a mask at first but it was quickly absorbed and looked natural in a minute. Be careful about the color selection, I picked medium light but I am afraid I have to wait till fall to use it because I have a slight tan and medium light looks too light on it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s expensive compared with the other products in the same line, especially BB creams. I don&#x27;t know why you should pay $50 for this cream when you can buy a decent BB cream for half this price.</li>
    <li> I read reviews that the CC is heavy, personally I do not agree. The Clinique BB cream is twice as heavy and thick. I have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin and everything makes me break out; this product doesn&#x27;t and covers so perfectly that no foundation is needed. On occasion I might throw some powder on top of it, but it is not need for a daily basis.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a big piece. It&#x27;s color is a little darker than my skin color. I don&#x27;t say that I recommend it but it&#x27;s convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I used to use Tarte BB Cream but became allergic to it.  Tried this one knowing that Clinique is known for fragrance free &amp; hypoallergenic products.  It doesn&#x27;t go on as nicely as the Tarte, not as smooth.  I also had a reaction to it right away.  Had to send it back.</li>
    <li> It is much better than de BBcream because  you only have to use one cream for all and it have 30 hight sun protection</li>
    <li> While I do wish that Clinique made this in a slightly lighter shade, this cream is amazing because it literally blends away imperfections, and a little goes a very, very long way.</li>
    <li> This product goes on very smooth, and does a fantastic job of delivering light/moderate coverage, smoothing out skin&#x27;s appearance, all the while moisturizing my fact.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Product as expected, but not really a detailed reference work.</li>
    <li> This provides excellent coverage and has a wonderful texture.</li>
    <li> I like Clinique products and I was excited about this cream.  I found it to be too greasy on my skin, it felt heavy.  I have dry skin and I look for moisturizing products, but this was just greasy.  I returned it to Nordstrom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have tried several BB creams but I like this one better. It seems to have more cream in it and therefore goes on smoother.</li>
