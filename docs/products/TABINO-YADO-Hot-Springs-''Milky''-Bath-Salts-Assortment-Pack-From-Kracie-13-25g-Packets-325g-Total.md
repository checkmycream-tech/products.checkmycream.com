      <li>These really make taking a bath more fun, great for people who like japanese stuff ^_^</li>
      <li>Super relaxing.  </li>
      <li>Why aren&#x27;t more Japanese products available in America?!</li>
      <li>so ANY flowery smell is too much for me).&lt;br /&gt;The milky bath was a pleasant experience and it left my skin soft and body more relaxed.</li>
      <li>It keeps my body warm and reduced my lower back pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The assortment of scents are nice to change it up once in a while if I want a different scent.</li>
      <li>I love these, especially in the winter time for a relaxing bath.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re exactly what I wanted and the bath they make is milky and smells like relaxing in an outdoor onsen.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>I love how there is an assortment and each one has a different color, scent, and minerals.</li>
      <li>I want to try other scents sometime too, especially the ones for beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>I am super sensitive to smells though, so some of the packets that contained flower fragrance were not to my liking (I am migraine prone</li>
      <li>They provide extra relaxation in the bath and are in measured packet to make it easy.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really do too much in helping with my eczema</li>
      <li>Very relaxing</li>
      <li>The smell is really calming.</li>
      <li>It really adds to the experience.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product! ^-^</li>
      <li>They also seem to be very beneficial to the skin.</li>
      <li>but I noticed that it is slightly cheaper off of amazon :)</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more from this brand in the future.</li>
      <li>The scents are not too strong either, not overpowering fruity or floral, just relaxing scent like an actual Japanese onsen!</li>
      <li>Some of the scents dont smell very natural but they are pleasing.</li>
      <li>The colors are vivid and yet they won&#x27;t stain your tub.</li>
      <li>and they leave my skin soft and silky!</li>
      <li>They use ingredients from Onsens (the Japanese word for Mineral Hot Springs).</li>
      <li>but I love that they don&#x27;t dry out my skin like other products.</li>
      <li>like the milky but prefer the clear.</li>
      <li>I was sad that I may not be able to enjoy these after returning to the USA but low and behold AMAZON</li>
      <li>An amazing product especially for those rough,stressful,tired and exhausting days.</li>
      <li>I lived in Japan for 11 years and always used these Milky Bath Salts (as well as the Clear Bath Salts by this same company).</li>

    <li> Love these! Helps you relax and wind down - especially if you&#x27;ve had an eventful day. I have eczema and these salts don&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. They don&#x27;t really do too much in helping with my eczema but I love that they don&#x27;t dry out my skin like other products. The smell is really calming.
