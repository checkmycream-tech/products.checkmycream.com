      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t even know which metal bit</li>

      <li>you thank you :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>I absolutly love this product.</li>
      <li>: 1) extend the time between fills; and 2) make sure I have my nails</li>
      <li>It is better than going to the nail salon</li>
      <li>but i guess if i just settle to use one its ok.</li>
      <li>that is like everything, don&#x27;t keep it running forever :)</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>I like being able to shorten my nails to</li>
      <li>i was really happy to get it so fast tryed it out and works</li>
      <li>It works well, but overheats easily</li>
      <li>It not flimsy but strongly made.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s a little haiku I wrote before I bought this wonderful product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap price,</li>
      <li>Well, I also like to wear nail polish and my own nails bend too much to keep polish on.  </li>
      <li>Great deal, especially for Prime members.</li>
      <li>This product is not the best it works for the 1st few mins</li>
      <li>I thought it was a good idea to purchase this, the price was right and other reviews seemed good.</li>
      <li>Once you master this which is not hard you will fall in love!</li>
      <li>worked ok the first couple of times and then lost its torque.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product but ended up being ruined.</li>
      <li>I was excited to get my nail drill</li>
      <li>but this last time it doesn&#x27;t work as good and</li>
      <li>Good if your only going to use it every once in a while.</li>
      <li>first time worked fine</li>
      <li>Overheats quickly and can&#x27;t maintain speeds when using on acrylic nails.&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>This drill lets me accomplish my task quickly and efficiently.</li>
      <li>I love this nail drill, I got it to do my own pedicures, it works just like a professional nail drill, I am not sure if it is good for Acrylics</li>
      <li>VERY FAST!</li>
      <li>The drill bits seem to be good enough to user for a more professional nail drill</li>
      <li>lol I&#x27;m planning on investing a bit more durable and long lasting</li>
      <li>First let me say that this drill is not meant to use if you are a nail tech!</li>
      <li>If you want to have it in your house for those days when you absolutely cannot make it to the salon, and you break it out every now and again to save some money then this is fine.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that it is comprable to the drills that I have observed in use at most professional salons, especially for a in home use product.</li>
      <li>ITs worth the $.</li>
      <li>It takes a moment or two assemble it right.</li>
      <li>I will just invest on a better quality drill for a little bit more money.</li>
      <li>I am also able to file down the thickness of the nails easily.</li>
      <li>It is on the loud side, but then again for the price it is not bad and almost worth it.</li>
      <li>However, this drill worked exactly the way I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>Con: Drill gets hot by the on/off</li>
      <li>i used it last night and it was ok,</li>
      <li>then it starts to get hot</li>
      <li>It get&#x27;s hot the longer you use it,</li>
      <li>I love this drill you have to hold the button in the middle and unscrew then place the bit in you can find this on youtube!</li>
      <li>That was the first turn off.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>First of all, let me say this: I am not a nail technician.</li>
      <li>The pink color is fun, but otherwise it is very professional looking and says it supports most types of attachements on the box.</li>
      <li>Its cheap so dont expect it to last at all.</li>
      <li>I do enjoy the occasional pair of sandals or flip flops</li>
      <li>so much easyer</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This product is cheaply made--to the point where it doesn&#x27;t even work, actually.</li>
      <li>and I received it really fast</li>
      <li>and I literally had to use an allen wrench to make the opening bigger to fit the bits.  </li>
      <li>an the moter slows down need to get a better one soon</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I also used this for one of my crafting projects when I need to sand down some edges. :)</li>
      <li>Who wants a used nail drill that was/is listed as brand new.?</li>
      <li>I honestly found it a complete waste.</li>
      <li>After short time working it just stop and feels very hot.</li>
      <li>I received this pretty fast which was the only plus.</li>
      <li>works well, got it for my thick and overgrown male nails, works well good power thanks for the item s</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know what the specific uses for each file are</li>
      <li>When I got the product it worked the first day and the second day it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on anymore</li>
      <li>do not waste your money on this one!</li>
      <li>It is out of stock at other sites, and even then sold for ten to fifteen dollars more not including tax and shipping.</li>
      <li>I would much rather spend a little extra for something a bit more professional and functional.</li>
      <li>I found it a bit tough to open the tip to allow the bit to fit comfortably in and lock into position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I mean in comparison to the other reviews, I made it last as long as I could (about 3 months more or less I cant rember I bought it last year and I&#x27;m writing the review waaaaay later). If you want to have it in your house for those days when you absolutely cannot make it to the salon, and you break it out every now and again to save some money then this is fine. But If you&#x27;re a hard core nail fanatic like me and love having you&#x27;r nails on point, this is not the drill for us lol I&#x27;m planning on investing a bit more durable and long lasting</li>
    <li> It does what it needs to do. Not professional, but it works for at home purposes. ITs worth the $.</li>
    <li> I received my product in the mail today. The best part of it was that it came way before the delivery date, however, the worst part was that it came in a small plastic package which wasn&#x27;t even in a box.  That was the first turn off.  The main issue I had was actually putting the drill bits into the machine itself.  The drill bits were too big for the opening and I literally had to use an allen wrench to make the opening bigger to fit the bits.  There was also a tool missing, which clearly says on the directions that it isn&#x27;t included, but when purchasing this item, it does not say anything of that nature in the description.  I thought that this product was going to be simple and at least get the job done.  I did everything by the directions so I know I wasn&#x27;t going crazy.  You definitely get what you pay for.  I did use it, it seems to work for a short period of time but now the drill bits don&#x27;t sit in properly.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  I would much rather spend a little extra for something a bit more professional and functional.</li>
    <li> I love this nail drill, I got it to do my own pedicures, it works just like a professional nail drill, I am not sure if it is good for Acrylics but it has a lot of power and I received it really fast, I ordered it on a Monday and it was delivered on Wednesday.</li>
    <li> Broken ! After short time working it just stop and feels very hot. I have no idea what I should do with this</li>
    <li> I like it so far, took me a few seconds to figure it out(changing the bits that is), and as the person before me said, it might not stand up to a professional e-drill, but for personal use its perfect and does a great job, hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> i was really happy to get it so fast tryed it out and works great wish he had longer cord but it will work no problems with it it will make doing my nails so much easyer thank you thank you :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because the reviews were mostly good. It broke after the second use every time I try to  use it the drill falls out. I don&#x27;t know what to do with it now I tightened it and everything but it still falls out. Pissed</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this product. It works really great! I do my own nails at home and have had no problems with this. It did take a bit to figure out how to change the bits but i highly recommend this product for small tasks at home. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I just got this item yesterday and am pleased with the results of the product after having used it for a manicure and pedicure. The pink color is fun, but otherwise it is very professional looking and says it supports most types of attachements on the box. I can honestly say that it is comprable to the drills that I have observed in use at most professional salons, especially for a in home use product. It may not stand up to 10 pedicures/manicures in one day as a commercial product would but should get the job done well with normal usage. The button on top is used to lock and help remove the drill attachments. The dial clicks to turn on the device and can be used to increase or decrease the power, which can be changed at any time for purpose or comfort. It is out of stock at other sites, and even then sold for ten to fifteen dollars more not including tax and shipping. Great deal, especially for Prime members.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a good idea to purchase this, the price was right and other reviews seemed good. Couldn&#x27;t even turn it on when I got it out of the box. I have to roll te dial on and jiggle the tip around to get it to come on. Then it always dies shortly after that, making a weird buzzing noise. The tip will not lock into place either. If I were you I would spend a little extra money and choose something else, I would NEVER buy this again.</li>
    <li> i used it last night and it was ok, the pieces are pretty hard to get in and out but i guess if i just settle to use one its ok. it does overheat but it didnt turn off on me yet. i got it for pedicures for me and my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> None of the attachments stay on, no instructions. I honestly found it a complete waste. Donated it last month- maybe someone can use it. Not me</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say this: I am not a nail technician. I honestly don&#x27;t even know which metal bit I am supposed to use. However, this drill worked exactly the way I was hoping it would. I like my artificial nails to be short. I mean ultra short. Why even have them? Well, I also like to wear nail polish and my own nails bend too much to keep polish on.  I like being able to shorten my nails to: 1) extend the time between fills; and 2) make sure I have my nails the length I want them prior to going to the salon. This drill lets me accomplish my task quickly and efficiently. I am also able to file down the thickness of the nails easily. (I did stop at Sally&#x27;s to pick up a good filing board and one of those buffing foam things.)  The price is just right on this drill, the color is great, AND it came with all sorts of bits. Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I also used this for one of my crafting projects when I need to sand down some edges. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister who loves doing nails... and now I am no longer going to the salon.. she does them and they are great. Not sure why other reviews said it broke right away; this one is going strong. We love it.</li>
    <li> worked ok the first couple of times and then lost its torque. seriously would have been furious if i had spent the origianl asking price of $109. do not waste your money on this one!</li>
    <li> It stop working in the next 2 weeks after I got it ...it  just fell apart it just stop working for me</li>
    <li> I received this drill yesterday. First thing I noticed the box was open on one end, and had several dents in the box. The charger is not a U.S charger, and not compatible with any outlet I have ever seen. The drill and charger both look like they have nail filing dust all over them , DISGUSTING. Who wants a used nail drill that was/is listed as brand new.? No thanks! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I got ahead of time, and I opened it and the plugs are not like the united states plug these are pointed not like ours any solutions any body besides sending it back? please advise</li>
    <li> This product does not even deserve one star. I am so disappointed!!!!! it wont even turn on and when you turn it upside down the bit falls out DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> When I got the product it worked the first day and the second day it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on anymore I was so excited to get this product but ended up being ruined.</li>
    <li> It works good. I just thought it was a little confusing to use. I don&#x27;t exactly know what the specific uses for each file are and I couldn&#x27;t find any instructions or info about it. Great price though!</li>
    <li> I received this pretty fast which was the only plus. I plugged it in, turned it on, it came on for about 1.66587455 seconds and then shut off..........hasn&#x27;t worked since. Waste of money and time. I will just invest on a better quality drill for a little bit more money. Period.</li>
    <li> works well, got it for my thick and overgrown male nails, works well good power thanks for the item s</li>
    <li> Con: Drill gets hot by the on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Awsome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews for this product and a lot of people gave this drill a negative review. First let me say that this drill is not meant to use if you are a nail tech! I love this drill you have to hold the button in the middle and unscrew then place the bit in you can find this on youtube! Once you master this which is not hard you will fall in love!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this nail drill. It not flimsy but strongly made. I got a dark pink one. It has drill speeds from very slow to WHOA! VERY FAST!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s amazing tool. Took me a bit find out how it works, but result was awesome! It get&#x27;s hot the longer you use it, so just give it a break sometimes, but that is like everything, don&#x27;t keep it running forever :)</li>
    <li> Its cheap so dont expect it to last at all. The little engine or rotar inside seizes and cannot handle the job its intended to do. The drill bits seem to be good enough to user for a more professional nail drill</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item.  I had an issue to discuss with the company and the service could not have been better, they walked me through, step by step and this has gone to my 5 star rating in less than a week.  I plan on telling all of my family and friends what a great item this is and how wonderful the team I dealt with is also.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. I have had this product stop working for me so I had to take it apart to try and fix it. I dont know what I did but it started working again. The tips dont stay in that great. The tips that are included arent very good quality. Good if your only going to use it every once in a while.</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations and works great. Customer service is very valuable and they go above and beyond to keep their customers. I would shop with them again.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was a finger nail polisher. That&#x27;s what I was searching for. Turns out it was for industrial use.</li>
    <li> Overheats quickly and can&#x27;t maintain speeds when using on acrylic nails.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality motor. Be wary, you are getting what you pay for with this item.</li>
    <li> I really hate for someone to touch my feet soa salon pedicure is almost like torture for me. I do enjoy the occasional pair of sandals or flip flops so I ordered this file to maintain nice pedicure feet and it has worked wonders. I absolutely love it and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tool, to help with my business, I&#x27;m just starting so I did not want to invest into a heavy duty one just yet.&lt;br /&gt;I received the drill in a timely manner as promised. At first I was not entirely sure how to assemble it. After carefully reading the instructions, which were very limited I was able to assemble and use the drill. It takes a moment or two assemble it right. I found it a bit tough to open the tip to allow the bit to fit comfortably in and lock into position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This drill is not meant for heavy duty use, so if you have to file excessive acrylic down I strongly suggest that you let the drill have a few rest periods, because if you allow it to run continuously it will over heat and may very well stop working. It is on the loud side, but then again for the price it is not bad and almost worth it.</li>
    <li> When receiving this product everything was broken!! I ordered it for a customer that needed me to travel to do her nails and ended up having to lose one of my best clients. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Came quickly. Cheap price, but in some ways you get what you pay for. It works well, but overheats easily and sometimes the bits come undone while using. Would have liked more instructions, but google &amp; youtube can be your bestfriend. Not really sure which tips are for what though.. works well.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with this product.  All the drill bits that came with it the nail drill did not fit.  It looks like the nail drill were not inspected when it left the  company/factory.  :-(</li>
    <li> I had to chunk this.  it was not strong enough.</li>
    <li> A great but at a cheap price..works perfect and arrived when said it would.i would do Business with them again I Recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s bed to doing nails.. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is cheaply made--to the point where it doesn&#x27;t even work, actually. I chose it to replace a battery-op one I lost, thinking it would be stronger and save $ on batteries. Should have heeded my anti-made-in-China instinct. So weak, if you press it against anything even lightly (such as, for example, a NAIL) it stops turning (though the motor revs wildly, no filing is taking place). The file heads are also of poor quality--not very abrasive. Save your money and the trouble of returning it. Sorry, seller; this ones&#x27;s a piece of trash. I would not recommend it to anyone, for any purpose. P.S charged me \\&quot;re-stocking fee\\&quot; of $3. Are they going to sell it to some other poor customer??</li>
    <li> This is useless the adaptor cord could not even be used in the UNITED STATES, waste of money!!!! Please dont waste your time purchasing</li>
    <li> I disliked this product because I&#x27;ve only used it twice and it already stopped working. first time worked fine but this last time it doesn&#x27;t work as good and it kept falling apart.</li>
    <li> I use this to gind down my toenails so they&#x27;re not there anymore. I hate the way they feel when I&#x27;m drinking milk. Here&#x27;s a little haiku I wrote before I bought this wonderful product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain each step I go&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like the nail to grow just&lt;br /&gt;not into my toe</li>
    <li> This tool works well but in the directions it says u need the wrench but it didnt come with the tool like it was supposed to but it works well other than that fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product works good and will get the good done. This nail drill is better than any of the ones that are being sold in stores that I have used. It is better than going to the nail salon and it is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is not the best it works for the 1st few mins then it starts to get hot an the moter slows down need to get a better one soon</li>
    <li> I was excited to get my nail drill but was disappointed. This was the first time ever purchasing something online that it came to me broken. Did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and some acrylic nail supplies to do my own nails. Its obviously not as powerful as the ones they have in the nail salons, but its not bad. Worked pretty good!</li>
