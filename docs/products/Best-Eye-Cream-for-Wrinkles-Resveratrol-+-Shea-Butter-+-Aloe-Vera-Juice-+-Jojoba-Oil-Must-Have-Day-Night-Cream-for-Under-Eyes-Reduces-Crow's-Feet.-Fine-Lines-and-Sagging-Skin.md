<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far so good! I just received this and have used it a few times. My eyes are very sensitive and this is great so far. It helps the puffiness. I love that there is not a strong perfume smell. It is very light and not greasy! I love it so far. I will keep using this great product!</li>
    <li> This is some serious eye cream. I had not read directions first and used as a night cream. The next morning the top layer of skin could all be rubbed off and fresh skin underneath. I&#x27;m planning on repeating this at least once a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days now but I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and made my makeup look great! I&#x27;ve bought under eye cream before and usually you get a small tube (and I&#x27;ve spent more!) but they give you a lot! So far I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> I instantly felt a difference.  The skin around my eyes felt firmer. The skin feels tighter and I look more refreshed. I would definately recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream.  Sure makes the skin under my eye look smooth.  Also has helped with my crows feet.  I highly recommend this eye cream</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing eye cream</li>
    <li> I picked Andre Lorent Eye Wrinkle because I have heard wonderful things about it and wanted to see how it compared to my usual brand. First I may say the packaging is very nice. I love the size of the product and the jar was easy to open..not fifty million things to open before getting to your product.(that makes me crazy lol) I loved the way it smelled and the texture of the cream was silky, not heavy or greasy. After I did the three minute treatment I saw a difference in the way my eyes looked.They looked plump and smooth and it lasted all day. I am pleased with the great list of high quality ingredients including ..SepiLift, Resveratrol, Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice &amp; Jojoba Seed Oil. With those  5 top notch ingredients you know you are getting the best product on the market. I am beyond happy with my choice in selecting this product as part of my beauty routine. The only thing I was upset about this product was that I didn&#x27;t find it and use it sooner !!  I am a customer who is very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing. It feels cool and smooth going on and I&#x27;ve alrea noticed a difference in the appearance of my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Andre Lorent&#x27; s Crazy Beautiful eye creme is a must have.  I am 34 and my skin is pretty thick.  However; I can see small wrinkles by my eyes and figured why not nip it in the bud early.  The eye creme is odor less and it goes on smooth.  As others have mentioned, a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using the eye creme for a week and my skin did not break out.  The product is gentle on my skin.  Some products I be used in the past were harsh on my face and made it red and blotchy.  Not the case with this eye creme.</li>
    <li> I choose to try this one for my eyes and just use twice but I can see the difference my dark circle lighten and it feels tighten...thanks</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is a beautiful product and I can already notice lines diminishing and under eye shadow and puffiness as well. Highly recommend!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently received my order but so far it&#x27;s seems to be a great product.  It is easy to apply and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! I apply it at night before bed it goes on smooth and has a pleasant scent.  I have been using it for about a week now and have noticed the skin around my eyes is smoother and the lines I had are already less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I received this eye wrinkle cream yesterday, so this will only be a partial review.  I&#x27;ve used it twice (yesterday and today), it has a nice creamy feel to it without feeling oily.  As it dries, it does make my skin feel slightly tighter.  I have not noticed any reduction of wrinkles yet, but didn&#x27;t expect to after less than 48 hours. If the cream worked that fast, it would be priced in the thousands and available only to the rich.  I will edit my review in 30 days and let everyone know what changes I have noticed. So far I like the cream and the hydrating feel of it.</li>
    <li> Hello i purchased your eye cream and i must say i was truly impressed.my sin is very sensitive and i can&#x27;t use just anything on my skin,but i can say that i like you cream it made my skin feel really wonderful and smooth looking .i most definitely will be ordering some more.thanks again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate five stars because I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know it&#x27;s long term effects.  But I the product arrived quickly.  Works great so far!  I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review after more use.</li>
    <li> I received this eye cream just two days ago, but my immediate thoughts are these- it reduced the puffiness around my eyes, and kept the area soft and smooth. I still felt it at the end of the day when I removed my makeup. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> This is the first eye cream I  have used but so far am satisfied with results.  I have only used it for three days but am impressed enough to continue using it</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It is light, not greasy, and the circles under my eyes look better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a few days but find myself wanting to use it more than twice a day (per directions) because it feels so good on the skin around my eyes! The little fine lines around my eyes seem to even out in minutes after dabbing it under and around my eye. Using natural ingredients in cosmetics is important to me, especially on my face and this cream gets an A+ rating from me.</li>
    <li> I received the Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Eye Wrinkle Cream a few days ago and I already am loving it!  It moisturizes and softens the area around my eyes wonderfully and I am already seeing an improvement with my fine lines.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great product- feels very light and has a nice cooling effect for puffiness. Absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve used for a few days and will definitely continue.</li>
    <li> I love the light feel of this eye cream!  It is very smooth and not heavy on your skin.</li>
    <li> Vitamin c along with everything else I wanted in a creme to get rid of of crows feet</li>
    <li> What a pleasant surprise.  I am 54 years old with sensitive skin. I have a few fine lines around my eyes. Used the cream in the evening and by morning I could really see the difference.  Will be a regular customer.  A great product and a great value.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Super fast delivery! Awesome product. I tried it as soon as I received it. It has no odor. It made the skin around my eyes so soft. I have tried others but they would leave a film or a slight odor.. I am so happy I decided to try this eye wrinkle cream. I have very dry skin and I just can&#x27;t get over how it makes my skin around my eyes feel so soft.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I just received Andre Lorent&#x27;s eye cream and I am very impressed. I have very sensitive skin and other eye creams are extremely harsh and tend to irritate my skin, this was not. It didn&#x27;t have a chemical smell and did not have a greasy feeling on my skin like other products. It is nice to finally find an eye cream that was made for me!</li>
    <li> I am loving the Andre Lorent Cream!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of days and I have already seen a deference in my skin:-)&lt;br /&gt;Is was very smooth and didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Being 55 I have noticed the fine (just a few mind you) lines increasing around my eyes and after reading the great reviews I decided to give this product a try.  I received the item quickly and the packaging was good.  The cream has a pleasant smell, not overpowering.  The cream is light and easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes of applying the cream I noticed the fine lines had decreased and the my eyes look more refreshed (not bad after a day of chasing around 4 kids!) I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the cream. I have been using it on the top of my hands because they have the most wrinkles. I use on my face too. Now I would like to have something got dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this 2 days, but I&#x27;ll give it a 5 stars based on the delivery (which was super fast) and the product so far.  It feels good on the face with no funky smell.  I am anxious to see how it works over the next few weeks, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I really do love this eye cream.  I think I can already see the lines around my eyes softening.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after I have used it for a few weeks! It is very creamy and I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> From the first day of use I was able to see the lift in my upper eye area!  I find it so hard to find products that are natural &amp; soy free as well as SLS free products.  This product will be a stable in my daily routine.  It is light in scent which is also a bonus since I am extremely sensitive to scents.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with you purchase of this product!</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream!!! I have been using this cream for 6 mornings and nights now, and I continue to be impressed with how soft and nourishing it feels on the skin around my eyes. My skin is very sensitive, and I have found very few products that I can use without irritating my skin. This eye cream goes on so smoothly and feels great!</li>
    <li> I received this eye cream four days ago and I already love it.  I use Crazy Beautiful eye cream twice a day. It goes on very smooth and creamy and immediately makes your eyes look brighter. I can definitely tell after just four days that this is a product I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Have only used it for the past 3 days. The cream is very smooth and it does not  irritate my skin around my eyes. Looking for some great results!</li>
    <li> The Andre Lorent Eye Creme is refreshing.  I am allergic to most eye products and had no negative effect.  I would recommend trying Andre Lorents Crazy Beautiful Eye Creme.</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream. I have extremely sensitive skin and it&#x27;s the first under-eye cream I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t burn or cause redness or sting. It&#x27;s completely without scent of any kind which is a big plus for me. I&#x27;ll keep using it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I received the Crazy Beautiful eye cream 2 days ago and while I have to await the long term results, I will say the cream goes on smoothly and I can almost feel it working. It has a tingling, tighten sensation after applying it which makes feel it&#x27;s doing its job. Does not have a strong smell which is a plus. Looking forward to the results!</li>
    <li> Very creamy hydrating.I love that is unscented!</li>
    <li> I Had the opportunity to get this eye cream (normally I just get the cheap stuff), now I&#x27;ve only had it one day, but I could actually feel it on my skin tightening. It felt tingly.  Its not too greasy or oily and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I only gave it 4 stars because I obviously can&#x27;t determine the long term effects as I&#x27;ve only had it one day.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased the Andre Lorent Eye Cream. It is very thick and a little goes a long way. I am always concerned about trying new creams due to my sensitive skin. I have used it a few days and I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. I like that it seems fragrant free. (I do not like when cream are strong smelling).I will continue to try it and see how the skin around my eyes turns out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a week now.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and shear.  You really need only a scant amount and it goes a long way.  I have extremely sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all.  As for the wrinkles...well, I think I need to use it for awhile before I can attest to it.  I am guilty of not giving things a chance (usually due to my sensitive eyes) but will continue to use this product to see if I can see any real improvement.  All in all, I would recommend this eye cream!</li>
    <li> Lovely eye cream, hopefully with more usage I will see definite benefits.</li>
    <li> Only used for a short while, but so far I like it better than any other eye creams. It is light and doesnt leave an oily or greasy film. Also the smell is very light. Just a few little dabs goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have received the cream and I gotta tell you, I&#x27;m impressed.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all. When I put it on my skin quickly absorbs it and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.  I woke up the next morning and my skin around my eyes looked great and felt so soft and smooth.  My crows feet are not as noticeable and under my eyes my dark circles are so much lighter.  I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is SO awesome. I don&#x27;t have eye wrinkles yet... But I am using this so that I don&#x27;t ever get them!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product.  It made my eyes feel absolutely smooth and fresh upon use.  Upon waking this morning no dry areas and kept the skin hydrated through the night.  Love this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It is really creamy and smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any offensive odors which is really nice for when I am putting a product in my sensitive eye area! It really does leave my eyes looking brighter and more refreshed in the morning, which is huge! I am a fan!</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail eye cream.  It hydrates while firming my eye area.  Worth every $!</li>
    <li> I really like the way it feels on my skin. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> great product works just like expected and very fast shipment!</li>
    <li> This worked instantly. I could feel it tingling and tighting at the same time!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a week now.  I am seriously loving it!  I use it in the morning and at night and have noticed that the tiny wrinkles that have started to appear these last several years are just about gone.  I honestly didn&#x27;t think that I would see results that quickly , but I have.  I like that there isn&#x27;t really much of a smell to it, so no strong perfume scent to it.  I have tried several of this sellers products and I think that this one is my favorite, although, I have to say that all of them are great!  The seller really cares about customer service.  I received my order quickly , within a day of placing my order!</li>
    <li> This cream is great!  I have only been using it a few days and can already tell a difference.  The lines around my eyes are fading!  I am excited to see my final results!</li>
    <li> My skin looked smooth and radiant the next morning!  Awesome cream!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days, but already my dark circles are going away! The puffiness is gone too. As soon as I apply it I can feel it working. It is not greasy and you only need a tiny bit to get great results! I recommend it to ask my friends, when they notice that I always look like I have had my beauty sleep.</li>
    <li> This cream is so light and gentle to use around the eye area. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my crows feet within a few days. I highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Received this product and tried it right away. So far it seams to&lt;br /&gt;Be working well. My legs look smoother. Thank you</li>
    <li> Since I turned 30. I thought that it would be a good time to treat my skin better. Wish I would started this sooner! Best thing I could of done for my face. I feel like it is already turning back the clock on my face.</li>
    <li> The cream goes on so well! Very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell or texture!! Perfect for your face!!!</li>
    <li> Received cream on time and tried a spot on my hand immediately. The next day on my hand I could tell where I had put it. Soft and not dry like the rest of my hand. It&#x27;s non-greasy and not scented so that&#x27;s a plus! I want to give it a week on my face and will add to my review. Expecting great results!</li>
    <li> I just received this product and have been using it for about 3 days. It is lightweight and fragrance free which is awesome! I&#x27;m can&#x27;t wait for the results!</li>
    <li> It is very rare for me to find an eye wrinkle cream to which my skin doesn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction at all, and in fact my eyes felt great! Time will tell if I continue to see results, but so far it&#x27;s been great. It might seem pricey for such a small container, but a little goes a long way. I look forward to trying more Andre Lorent products.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love the cream. It feels great on my skin. Thank you so much.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream !!! I could see very quick results from using it. I apply it twice a day. Morning and evening and can feel it working as soon as I apply it. Great product !!</li>
    <li> I am hoping this will help with eye dryness that I am having. Not to sure if it is allergies or not. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I found that after using this eye cream for about a week I could already notice firmer skin around my eye area.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great. I have only used it for two days but I do see some improvement. The cream doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which I like, it&#x27;s not greasy and goes on your skin very smoothly. I have very sensitive skin so I am very careful about what I use on my skin. I like the results I have gotten  so far and would recommend this to anyone who wants or needs an eye cream product.</li>
    <li> I noticed less wrinkles around my eyes after 3 days of use.  I have also noticed the puffiness around my eyes are diminished</li>
    <li> Bags, what bags?? This cream is awesome!</li>
    <li> Happy with the product  Am hoping for great improvement with my eye wrinkles</li>
    <li> I did not think this eye cream would work, but my skin has changed drastically in the few days I&#x27;ve been using it.  The skin under my eyes is smoother and very much softer looking, but also looks a little tighter.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens as I continue using it!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with results. Non greasy, leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I am just starting to notice small lines around my eyes, and  I have only used the cream a few times and already have seen a difference. I like the way it hydrates around my eyes.  The directions say to use twice a day and I usually don&#x27;t like to wear cream to bed, but this one is so light it didn&#x27;t bother me or feel heavy.  I also like that is does not have a scent.</li>
    <li> I have only used this cream for a couple of days but so far I love it!  You only have to dab it on rather than rub (I feel like rubbing only adds to the lines) and it is absorbed no problem! I also like that it is not too greasy like some creams, I don&#x27;t really like using eye creams (and I know I should) because it tends to affect my make up throughout the day but I have not had that problem at all using this cream.  I look forward to see the results with continued use!</li>
    <li> I am not really the reviewing kind of person. I wanted to say that this eye cream is amazing! I gave it some time before writing this review, I wanted to give it some time to work it&#x27;s wonders! I was not disappointed, it has started to even out the wrinkles around this 61 year old lady&#x27;s eyes. It is light, comfortable,  and being one with very sensitive skin didn&#x27;t cause me any discomfort. I would whole heartedly recommend this product to anyone looking to erase their signs of aging. Five Stars!</li>
    <li> I noticed a little difference at first. But after a week a definitely notice a difference with the &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; when I smile and when my face is at rest. a good product I will probably order again.</li>
    <li> Just like Andre Lorent&#x27;s facial cream, this leaves my eye area feeling incredibly smooth and soft. I find myself reapplying it several times per day. I know the directions say to gently press or tap the creme onto the eye, but I cheat and massage it  in with no ill effects.</li>
    <li> This cream dried out my eyes and made  my wrinkles  more visible</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My skin feels so smooth and flawless. I have been using it for awhile now and have noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> So far I have only been using this product for over a week and I love the feel, smell, and just the way my puffy eyes seem to respond to the cream. I am hoping that after continued use it will help with the wrinkles.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> good stuff!! really like it!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice! Goes on smooth and leaves my eyes soft and wrinkle free for the most part.  I&#x27;ve noticed a lovely difference in my skin since using these products.</li>
    <li> Really feels like it&#x27;s tightening the skin around my eyes and reducing wrinkles</li>
    <li> I would prefer better package. I liked the cream and its not sticky but I could not say if truly minimize under eye wrinkles because I have used for a week.</li>
    <li> I received this cream a few weeks ago &amp; have been using it most days.  Loving the results!  I&#x27;m looking less tired &amp; see no new wrinkles appearing...I think they are even reducing in appearance!  Love this cream!</li>
    <li> I love Andre Lorent products. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. I&#x27;m only in my late 20s but I&#x27;m definitely worried about wrinkles. This has made a definite difference!</li>
    <li> I love this product....and the customer service is way beyond my expectations these days with everything being automated.  If you are looking for a product that really works and really diminishes those dark circles, bags, wrinkles etc...this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I got the Cellulite and I&#x27;ve seen a big improvement I use it for my abdomen area and ist tightning my skin really good...i would recommend this...</li>
    <li> Great eye cream!  Goes on smooth</li>
    <li> good for under eye circles but a little drying</li>
    <li> This really has exceeded my expectations.  It does a really nice job with the fine lines around the corners of my eyes and has improved the color under my eyes quite a bit.  I noticed a really nice glow just a few days after I started using it.  Ordering was quick and easy with Amazon as usual.  Would def be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because of the ingredients and the excellent customer service. I layer a lot of products, so when I put this on, it pilled. However, if you have questions about the product, the customer service rep is great! Also the ingredients are prime anti aging products. It just didn&#x27;t work for my purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few day BUT I really see an improvement in the skin under my eyes. The part that was sagging when I awoke every morning is sagging no more! I&#x27;m amazed and thrilled.</li>
    <li> Love the company itself, and the cream I like also.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream, 2 times a day for a few days now. I think it&lt;br /&gt;this product performed very well, for what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I did not think it moisturized that well...&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it did not have an odor, and it did&lt;br /&gt;not seem to irritate the sensitive skin around&lt;br /&gt;my eyes... I received a sample of this product&lt;br /&gt;for testing purposes, and the statements above are&lt;br /&gt;my own opinions..</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference yet.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I love it at this time.  I have only used it for a week or 10 days.  It is a good product.  I do appreciate the attention I have received from the company.  It is small privately and owned.  I do intend to try their other products as I need them.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I can tell a difference in the feel and texture of my under eye skin.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! It&#x27;s reasonably priced! It is not greasy at all. I just put a small dab underneath my eyes, let it soak it for a few minutes, then apply my makeup. Love it!</li>
    <li> Update June 3rd 2015&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company complaining about the smell and color of my eye cream and they answered that the color was because it has resveratrol that comes from the skin of red grapes. And then I wrote again about the smell, and this time they offered me a free bottle of the eye cream, even after the 90 days window they give have passed. I can&#x27;t say anything yet about the cream, because I haven&#x27;t received it yet, but all I can say is that they care about what their clients thinks about their products. and have  a great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2nd 2015&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this cream. The smell is like rancid oil, and the face cream smells the same. It seems like the same thing toe. I&#x27;ve applied it to my face twice, and I have had to stand that smell for long before it is gone. I have used many creams before, and I can tell when one cream is spoiled because one of my best senses is my nose.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT~LOVED IT!!</li>
    <li> Not quite as moisturizing,but seems to soften eye area.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this product with the face cream I fine that they work very well for a wrinkle softening cream. I was very skeptical about if anything would be noticeable and was very surprised to see a softening of the line around my eyes. Another nice benefit was it didn&#x27;t react to my rosacea and actually calmed down the reddening on my face. None of these product remove all the lines but soften them. For the $20 it is well worth a try. So many very expensive creams do nothing at all for wrinkles but are great moisturizers or charge a ridiculous amount of money to do the same thing. Over all I will enjoy the effect of the creams and plan to continue using the.</li>
    <li> Got here quickly and well packaged. To soon to tell how well it will work overtime, but I am quite please. First, a little goes a long way and it goes on easily, without having to rub it in. Very little smell. I put it on the first evening I got it and was pleased, but the real surprise was in the morning and the skin around my eyes just felt soft and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;.  Will post again in a few weeks to see how well it continues to work.</li>
    <li> Like it so far especially as it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which can be a problem for me. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough or consistently enough yet though to really review, trying to use up some of my other eye creams first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance  and feels silky going on.  I&#x27;m using it as a prevention for wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have any yet so I can&#x27;t comment on improvement in that area.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a few days and it moistures ok however it gave me a burning/stinging sensation and my eyes were red after. You definitely can&#x27;t rub it in. It may just be a reaction on my skin but I won&#x27;t be reordering. The customer service is very nice though with follow up emails.</li>
    <li> It diminishes wrinkles under your eyes. You notice the difference within a week.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on all the positive reviews I read.  The item arrived quickly and I started using it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a very long way.  Just a dab on my finger covers the entire area under my eye from inner corner to outer corner.  The scent is very light, almost non-existent, which I greatly appreciate.  The container is a nice size and I like the rounded shape.  It absorbs very quickly and dries with a matte finish, which makes applying any makeup over it very easy.  As for all the results the company claims the cream accomplishes, I cannot honestly conclude as I haven&#x27;t quite used it 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con, I can really list is that the company began emailing me daily almost immediately upon receiving the eye cream asking for a review.  It&#x27;s an eye cream, not a vacuum or a blender.  I can&#x27;t use it once and say, &amp;#34;yes, all my fine lines immediately vanished, my skin softened instantly, my dark circles are completely gone, best cream ever.&amp;#34;  A previous eye cream I used had results listed on the side of the box that said x% people saw certain results in 4 weeks, y% in 8 weeks, and z% in 12 weeks.  That&#x27;s weeks, not uses.  So while I can understand wanting feedback about your product especially if you are new company, perhaps wait a couple weeks and then send a polite reminder to buyers asking them for feedback, not daily emails for the first several days.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye cream!  It is by far the best I have ever used. I saw a noticeable difference the first time I used it.  I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> A very nice cream.  Leaves skin feeling soft and silky.  Eye area looking smoother in just one week.  Will keep using.</li>
    <li> I stopped using this eye cream because it didn&#x27;t work as well as others that I&#x27;ve purchased. I think if you are not using an eye cream at all this would be a good starter one but if you really need an eye cream. I do and have a tendency to get bags, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as some other more expensive varieties.</li>
    <li> Been using the cream for about a month only at night.  it does hydrate your skin but it feels a little greasy.  I don&#x27;t really mind that but it hasn&#x27;t helped the fine lines.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in wrinkles from before I used it and now.  It does have this refreshing tingling when you just put it on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received the correct product. What I received is an odd pink foam like matter, rather than a white cream as pictured. I used the product for a week and saw no visible change at all. There was no &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; results. I am 45 years old, just as a reference, and I am thought to be in my late 20s, early 30s by most people. However, I have begun the perimenopausal stage and have noticed a bit of dryness, more fine lines and my &amp;#34;11s&amp;#34; seem to be more pronounced : /&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I have found to have noticed improvement in my skin with the Philosophy with retinoids pads and eye cream. I have also taken to a bit of &amp;#34;face taping&amp;#34; to stop myself from furrowing my brow, as I have a tendency to do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another product that I see good results in is the CeraVe SR cream and their eye cream. Both contain ceramides and are pretty reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: the best way to see if the Philosophy products work for you is to buy them on beauty.com. You can get a trial pack for 41.00 of the tetinois pads, the moisturizer, and the retinoid eye cream. And, no joke, the trial moisturizer jar amount is more than you receive of this product alone! I would say to save your money and put it towards Philosophy, which actually works : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this is all my personal opinion, but I have tried and used a fair amount is skin care products and supplements.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, has helped the puffiness and dark circles. Have purchased again!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have been using it now for 1 week and do notice a difference.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the color.  It seems funny putting something brownish on my eyes.  I do recommend using it despite the color.</li>
    <li> I found this cream to be very gentle and soothing.  I used this product for about a month and l look at least 10 years younger. I have several allergies, but this cream did not affect my sensitive skin- no break outs or rashes. Feels like silk and leaves no residue.  I would recommend this product to all age groups.  Great price/value for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while now and haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. I like the feel of the product, not greasy and absorbs quickly. As far as wrinkles go I can&#x27;t say anything yet. I would order again to see how the long term benefits are. I like the product, I don&#x27;t love it (yet). I&#x27;m hopeful this product will work</li>
    <li> WOW! Best Eye Cream is fabulous! I have very dry sensitive skin and I am not able to use a lot of products. The eye cream really helps and does not bother my skin. I would highly recommend to any one.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to younger appearance!  I just started using the cream, but I like the smell and feel and can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
    <li> Works great! Only need to use a small amount. Should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love everything Andre Lorent. I think this company deserves more recognition. I am not getting paid to say this. I highly recommend this product. You have to try their makeup brushes, they are to die for!</li>
    <li> This eye cream works! A great price and is perfet for someone with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Been using now for over a month and am seeing lines smoothing around eyes. Nice product. Will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Only takes a small amount.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. I have been using for about a week and really enjoy it so far. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just received this product and I think I&#x27;m going to like it. Texture is good and lines seem to be less noticeable after application. Will continue to use. And have ordered a second time</li>
    <li> It feels good going on. A little goes a long way. I love the way it feels on my eyes. The tender skin around my eyes looks and feel better.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer but my under eye area has not changed in texture or look. I should give up on buying expensive eye creams. This one is a good as any and none of them work to reduce wrinkles or sagging skin as description suggests.</li>
    <li> I like it in that it is quickly absorbed, but will hold off speaking to its effectiveness for a while.</li>
    <li> I think the eye cream is wonderful. My eyes feel moisturized and awake. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Generally a good product, no complaints.  I will update as necessary.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this wrinkle eye cream. It seems to be of great quality and I believe works well. I have only used it for a few weeks but I can tell results. This eye cream does not smell bad and does not leave a sticky residue like some others i have tried. I will continue to use this eye cream and look forward to a even better updated review. Updated review 6/15/15 I have been continuing to use this eye cream at night and have been enjoying it. I like the way my skin looks and feels, soft and smooth. I have also used this eye cream for after a day of crying and I am happy to report that it helps so much with the under eye puffiness.  It was hard to tell I had cried so much earlier that day.</li>
    <li> Really LOVE this eye cream so far, such a nice smooth consistency, feels great at night after taking off my make-up, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any major results...but so far I truly have noticed that I wake up looking well rested, and fresh. No more tired puffy eyes, and dark circles for me! This is exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered this product, can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results! Thank you so much Andre Lorent for such a beautiful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days and I love it. This cream makes the skin around my eyes look refreshed and smooth. It is not oily and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes in any way unlike other creams that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  It also helps with my puffiness. I highly recommend this eye wrinkles cream.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is smooth, light, and non greasy. I haven&#x27;t used the cream for an extended time but it feels so good and hydrating, that it has to work! The smell is very mild and seems to have no fragrance at all (which I love)...A++ purchase! I love Andre Lorent products.</li>
    <li> Love this product, does a great job moisturizing around the delicate eye area. Within three days I could notice improvements in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have truly enjoyed my new eye cream.  It is lightweight and non greasy.  This has become my new go to eye cream.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and mouisturized. Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling. The smell is great. It doesn&#x27;t cake up. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot, so the jar should last a while.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this anti wrinkle cream. I ordered this cream as I have other Andre Lorent products I love! This is the newest love on my list. The anti wrinkle cream is smooth, non-greasy and not much scent which I love. It goes on easy and absorbs quickly. My face especially around my eyes have never looked so wonderful and youthful. Would deffinetly try this out......</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream! I have extremely sensitive mixed skin and this cream does not have any smell or perfumes. I have been using it for about a week and I can tell a difference. My eyes look brighter and the tiny little wrinkles are not as visible.</li>
    <li> This product  smells so good and fresh. I would  recommend this to  anyone  who wants to look and feel great!</li>
    <li> The eye cream arrived in small box but it definatly packs a big punch. I&#x27;ve only used the eye cream for two days and feel a difference already. My under eye puffiness has been lessened and the skin feels softer. I&#x27;ve actually dabbed the eye cream on the forehead and around chin ares to see how the does . No smell And the feel is not greasy so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I have b3n usibg the cream for 3 days now, and I already see and feel a difference. I was nervous about trying the cream because my skin is very sensitive and prone to allergies and rashes but I  was very please to see that my skin had not adverse reactions. The skin around Mr eyes feel softer, tighter, and I can see less wrinkles. My eyes makeup comes on more easily. I like the product and will continue to use it and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Have only used this product for 3 days but like the results I&#x27;m seein.  Noticed smoother skin around the eyes.  Light, non greasy cream with no heavy perfumes.</li>
    <li> I love the eye cream.  I noticed changes within just a couple days.</li>
    <li> Feels so light on my face. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to skincare products around my eyes.  So much so that I have stopped using them.  With some trepidation  I purchased Crazy Beautiful eye wrinkle cream and I am super impressed.  It is COMPLETELY fragrance free, not a trace of fragrance.  Even that nasty fragrance called &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;.  The cream did not migrate into my eyes and make them burn like every other cream I have tried.  It was a nice base for my eye makeup and didn&#x27;t slide it off as the day wore on. In this short time I have been using it, especially at this dry time of the year, I am so pleased to be able to moisturize this tender skin and plump up those burgeoning wrinkles.  Thank you Andre Lorent.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product.  Light and silky texture with no greasy or oily residue.  Even after the first use you notice an increased brightness around your eyes.  It firms, tightens and helps you keep that young bright eyed look.  So glad I came across this product and will definately keep using.  This cream easily compares to or beats those high dollar department brands.  This is my new must have</li>
    <li> This eye wrinkle cream seems to work as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so this will not be reviewed as long term.  The cream has a very light scent.  The jar is very small but a very small amount is needed to cover both eyes.  This should last at least a month if not more.  It goes on cool and does seem to help with reducing puffiness and moisturizes the eyes perfectly. The only reason i&#x27;m knocking a star off is because of the price.  I&#x27;m a guy, so i&#x27;m not sure if this is the going price for eye creams.  This is the first time using this sort of eye cream.  Just a note....the face cream is excellent especially after shaving.  The creams are not greasy and absorb really well into the skin.  My wife is using both as well and she says she really likes Andre Lorent products.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly without leaving a greasy feel!</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing cream without being oily on my combination skin.  Skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this eye cream. So far, I am loving the results. When first opening the package I found the cream to have a pink tint to it. There seems to be no detectible fragrance. The cream itself has a very smooth texture. It is very easy to apply and somewhat cooling to the skin. I have noticed less under eye puffiness. I am happy that the product is paraben free. For the short amount of time that I have used it I would have to say it is a good product. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best anti aging creme that I have used in a LONG time.  This product contains the Resveratrol +SepiLift.  I can see it working the first 24 hours I used it.  I swim a lot outdoors and the fine lines appeared quickly.  This wonderful cream reversed a lot of the damage that the sun caused in not time.  I highly recommend this product and you will not be disappointed.  Thank you, Andre Lorent!!!</li>
    <li> Great eye cream.  Leaves me feeling fresh and non-greasy. Don&#x27;t need to use much for coverage.  This cream is so much better than some of the name brands I&#x27;ve used and costing so much more.  I definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  It has helped smooth out the under eye area.  I would totally recommend this product if you are looking for an eye cream that works.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if will make a difference but seems to be a good quality eye cream&lt;br /&gt;Very prompt delivery as well</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. The color is not a pretty white color like the picture shows. It is more a peach color. There is no unpleasant smell and it glides on the skin quite nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few days now and my skin around my eyes is so soft and a noticeable decrease in puffiness under my eyes. Love it and will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few days now (twice a day in the morning and at night) and I feel it is a good moisturizer,nice scent! I can not say I have seen much change but since I have only used it a few days I did not expect much yet. I will continue to use it. After applying it I feel a tingling sensation for a few minutes so I feel it is working.l</li>
    <li> I received your product Andre Lorentz Eye Creme on Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that your product is great. I&#x27;ve noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable. I see that my dark circles haven&#x27;t responded as of yet. I will continue to use product with hopes of seeing visible change in my dark circles. I&#x27;m excited to be trying your product as I&#x27;m getting older and wrinkles are part of the process. 😊</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in hopes of finding a new product to add to my daily skin routine specific to my eye area. I have been using it for a few days now, and while physically I see only a small difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, you can FEEL the product working and I have confidence that with longer use it will serve its purpose. It has very little scent, is light and not greasy. Application is easy and a quick addition to my normal skin care process. I am happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I am 36 years old and I have very fair, shallow skin. I have yet to start seeing fine lines, but I have always had trouble with dark under eye circles. Even though this product does not claim to help under eye darkness, mine are mostly from the fact that the skin under my eyes is very deep set and shallow. After reading the reviews, many people stated that this product plumps up the eye area and makes it more supple, so I figured I’d give it a whirl. After only two days, I am pleasantly surprised. My under eye area is defiantly more supple and less indented into my face. I am very excited to see how much more it will improve with continued use. There is no doubt in my mind that this little gem will have a place in my beauty bin for years to come. I may never get a chance to see my future fine lines, because this product is going to keep them at bay. At only $30 a pop, it&#x27;s a real bargain. My current eye cream is $36 and will be replaced by Crazy Beautiful Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a several days now and have been very pleased with it so far.  I have sensitive skin and it has caused no issues whatsoever.  Only using on one eye at the moment so I can see what improvements I am getting and the skin is smoother and softer to the touch.  Lines are also getting fainter.  Absolutely happy with what I am seeing.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s drastically changed anything in a few days. Does feel nice going on. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. And feels great. My face has been really dry due to cooler weather and ican tell around my eyes is not nearly as dry</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It goes on so smoothly and makes your face feel hydrated and smooth. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have the anti aging cream to be absolutely wonderful. One thing that I really appreciate is that cream does not leave a greasy feel to it and was to apply makeup without creasing. Very easy to use with amazing results! Something I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. In week one of use but liking the results so far.</li>
    <li> This cream is very light weight and non-greasy.  I have been using it for approximately a week and I love it.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it.  I recommend this to anyone looking for an eye cream.</li>
    <li> The product never seemed to absorb.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few days now (twice a day in the morning and at night) and I am absolutely loving it! It hydrates the skin around your eyes very deeply without being heavy or sticky. It is very smooth and delicate. One of my favorite things about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell. The skin around your eyes is very thin and delicate and you really need to take good care of it, and I think this eye cream nails it! The packaging is very simple, maybe having a nice bottle to match the amazing cream inside could be something they could improve, but at the end of the day the content is what really matters and this cream is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this eye cream as well as how it makes my under eye area feel. It seems to have great moisturizing properties. I will revisit this forum after I&#x27;ve used it for a while to review whether or not the anti-aging properties are effective</li>
    <li> Works great.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye wrinkle cream from Andre Lorent for about a week now and I can say that I am seeing less puffiness and the crows feet seem to getting better. I am very pleased because I have been looking for something for a long time to make my eyes look brighter and better.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product... Andre Lorent products are amazing Everytime</li>
    <li> Great product! Goes on silky smooth, has a light pleasant scent and best of actually reduces the under eye puffyness. A+++</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. Its not greasy at all and it hydrates my skin so well. I have been using it twice a day for a week and I have noticed my dark under eye circles have been getting lighter. I have had those for years and nothing had worked until now!</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels when I put it on and how well it absorbs into my skin.  It seems to be making a difference in my appearance already and I will continue to use this cream. It firms up the area under the eye really well.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this eye cream! It is very soothing to the skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt; I have glaucoma and use lots of drops. I have great hopes for my wrinkles. Wonderful product!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Awesome eye cream!!  Received on Friday and applied immediately.  Today is Sunday, my third day using and I definitely can tell a difference!!  I had severely wrinkled eye lids and they still have some wrinkles but are very much improved!!!  Thank you for letting me try this great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great, seeing results right away.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this eye cream for a few days, but I am a fan so far. It moisturizes the skin around my eyes, and it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky. It is very smooth.  The product arrived quickly, which is another big plus!</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly, it was a larger jar then most eye creams are. It goes on very smooth and a little goes a long way. I have puffy eyes from allergies and this works great for this. I am very pleased with how well this product works.</li>
    <li> I have always stayed away from &amp;#34;eye wrinkle creams&amp;#34; because I thought they were a waste of time.  What a change I have now.  Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Eye Wrinkle Cream is amazing!  It does lesson your crows feet and lines!  It is odorless which is great and it is so light.  I have to say I love, love, love this product!  Use it morning and night and see the wrinkles disappear and your the skin around your eyes is super soft.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, you need to give it a try now!  A+++++</li>
    <li> I could feel this working within minutes of applying it.  Within 2 days I can tell that some visible wrinkles under my eyes were reduced.  Pretty fast results!  I look forward to seeing what this can do long term</li>
    <li> Week three of using this product and I am really starting to see improvement in the area around my eyes. I really like how smoothly it goes on and is absorbed into the skin! Anxious to see what the next three weeks bring!</li>
    <li> This cream is working better than I expected.  I like that it can be  used around the whole eye and not just under.  A little goes a long way, so the jar will last a long time. I look forward to diminished fine lines with continued use.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Wonderful product! I love it! Will be buying this one again!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft and not at all oily like other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a short time, but the texture of my skin is much improved!  I will definitely be using this cream for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Lightweight and nongreasy. Even helped the puffy dark circles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this for my wife who has used high quality cosmetics for well over 15 years.  She is 57 years old.  And she is very impressed with the Crazy Beautiful Eye Wrinkle Cream!  After 3 to 4 weeks use, she is noticing the fine wrinkles getting smaller, and smaller and some fading away completely.  Nice consistency, easy to apply, and generous amount in package.  Well worth trying!!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for about 4 days now and i really do like it.</li>
    <li> This eye cream goes on smoothly.  It is not oily and does not feel heavy on your skin.  I found that it works well on puffiness under your eyes and look forward to seeing wrinkles around my eyes disappear!</li>
    <li> I had to wait before I posted so I could be a fair judge on it. Not sure if I am, because I have not really used a true wrinkle cream. I do like it, and my husband (without him knowing I was using it) asked if I was using new makeup! So this is a win. Thanks</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing!  It makes my skin feels so soft and in a very short period of time I have noticed my wrinkle lines smoothing out.  I apply at night before bed and I have noticed less puffiness and dark circles around my eyes in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye cream for about 4 days now. It goes on very smooth and Iight. I like  how it feels moisturizing without feeling heavy. Has a very pleasant scent. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing good results in the future.</li>
    <li> I received mine about 4 days ago.  I love it I can already tell the difference!  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I&#x27;ve tried so many but free using this one I have noticed an improvement all around me eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff was not very moisturizing and definitely made zero improvements. Would not repurchase</li>
    <li> Does not really moisturize.  For the past 6-7 years I have been using Revision Teamine and Skinmedica eye creams but decided on the strength of these reviews to try something cheaper. Well, you get what you pay for. I applied this product according to the directions and it really did not do anything for me.  The skin around my eyes felt tight and stretched when I smiled and the lines did NOT get any better, they looked worse as this product did not moisturize at all.  Thank goodness I had a Skinmedica tester on hand.  I am heading to the medical spa to see my esthetician to renew my high dollar eye cream.  Really wished it lived up to its reviews, so much for saving some money.    1 day later-   Received an email from the owner of the company offering a full refund without having to mail back the product. Very good customer service.  You do not see this kind of service nowadays and I was pleasantly surprised. I do look forward to trying a different product in the future on the strength of all the 5 star reviews and knowing that they stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> Uptempo does exactly what it advertised.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing!  I love that it is made of all natural products and not harsh chemicals like most eye creams.  It goes on smooth and light.  I would definitely recommend this eye wrinkle cream to everyone!  They also donate some of their proceeds to Breast cancer research!</li>
    <li> Great product and I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the cost.</li>
    <li> I have received this product one week before at discounted price . Used two times in d day n nite....nice cream hydrates ur skin well n feel some tightness below eye lines....looks better thn bfr, hope my wrinkle under my eye lines will go soon. Love this product n will buy again. Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> Less rich and creamy than expected.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Too thick for under eye area.  Leaves a heavy waxy feeling.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is okay, but does nothing for my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Loved the product unfortunately my skin is too sensitive and my eyes started swelling up in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Product is nice and thick, you don&#x27;t need as much as you would think you do... which means it will last longer! It has little to no scent, which is nice. Must have!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin super soft. I certainly noticed improved skin tone &amp; coloration.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream out there!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this product!  Great!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I can literally feel it working. I apply it at night before bed, and it creates this tingly tightening sensation. It doesn’t last long, just long enough that you know its working. Cream is odorless and goes on smooth.  I’ve used it for a little over a week, and my skin hasn’t broken out around and my eyes don’t water when I use it. Plus the skin around my eyes feels smooth. This product is a definite keeper in my daily beauty regime.  I’ve just recently ordered the face cream too. Can’t wait to see how that works.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how often people tell me I look &amp;#34;so&amp;#34; tired.  Since I have been using this cream my eyes look refreshed and bright!  Its not greasy and is not heavily scented.  I am am excited to continue using it to see it improve my crows feet!</li>
    <li> This eye cream went on smoothly and soaked in quickly which is great because I can apply my makeup without having to wait. Another plus is the awesome ingredients and that it doesn&#x27;t have parabens or any bad fillers/additives. While I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles or crows feet yet I do have slight lines beginning on the outside edges of my eyes. Although they haven&#x27;t disappeared, they are more smooth and less noticeable when I look in the mirror. Overall I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this cream and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using different anti aging moisturizers for awhile but this is the first cream I have used that is specific for the under eye area. This cream is thicker than most moisturizers I have tried. A little bit goes a very long way. I lightly pat it under my eyes after applying my moisturizer. It feels so good going on, with the cool cream. The first couple times I used it, it was tingling so I knew it was working. No scent which is a huge plus in my book. This cream is very silky an  it leaves my under eye feeling amazing. I ordered some of the moisturizer by this same company and I am so excited to try it.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles as of yet. Hopefully this will keep me from getting them. :)</li>
    <li> The product seems to helping with my wife&#x27;s eyes. She uses it every night.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Andre Lorent products but none as much as this eye cream.  It is so light and refreshing.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  Andre Lorent is AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Very good feeling. Soft and smooth. Not greasy. Wonderful for lips also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this eye cream. Not thin, but not too thick! It is really great!</li>
    <li> I have been using product for 3 days and I can see results.  Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually get too excited about these things, but...I was out of eye creme and decided to give this one a try. Being of a &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34; I realize the need to moisturize my face, neck and eye area. I just do it and don&#x27;t give it any thought. I love the way this cream makes skin around my eyes feel. I actually catch myself touching just because I love how my skin feels now. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it is really making my skin look younger and guys aren&#x27;t chasing me down the street to tell me how soft the skin around my eyes look,(though they probably want to). I feel if it makes my skin look better and feel wonderful after applying the long term results will probably be great. Now I have to see if the company makes a lotion to make the rest of my face feel this great.If you are looking for eye cream you will love this non-greasy soft finish!</li>
    <li> I recently received this eye cream, and I must say I have been critical of many of the products that I have purched in the past and have not been very satisfied with any of the results.  So my review will be an honest one, if you are looking for an over night Miracle you may have to wait two nights, I have already noticed the puffiness under my eyes has greatly diminished , I am blessed not to have many crows feet especially at my age, the fine lines do not look sO prominent today.  It goes well under my makeup and actually compliments it. I will. Continue to use this product and follow up on this review</li>
    <li> I have just received this eye cream and can&#x27;t comment on how it works yet, but I have to say that it feels great when I put it on. It goes on smoothly and leaves the eye area moisturized.  I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any reaction. The ingredient list sounds wonderful.  Will keep using it. Hopefully will see results soon.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eye cream. Very light, unscented and non-greasy. It appeared to tighten and plump wrinkles around the eyes immediately. It soaks in fast and is not sticky. The reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 is that I prefer a more moisturizing formula. This would be a great product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream!  After I receive my cream started using it that night. I use it twice a day and can really see the difference! A little bit goes a long way and feels silky not greasy. Wish I had found this product alot sooner! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love how this product feels on my skin.  Not greasy which is a super bonus especially because it is for the eyes.  My lines are already visible reduced with only a few days of use.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream! It goes on very smooth and firms the skin around the eyes. Also love that it is made of natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye cream.  The consistency is very nice and my skin felt smooth and soft after only a few uses.  I have been on a endless search for products like this.  I finally found the one! I would highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Used for 2 days so far. Slight stinging at first but I can feel my skin tighter. Will continue to use for sure!</li>
    <li> Have used this for just a few days but love it. The skin on my face tends to get irritated easily but not with this cream. I like the way it absorbs into the skin quickly and is no greasy.  I would recommend this cream to anyone.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this eye cream and I really like the quality. Great results so far. I have extremely sensitive skin and this cream has not caused any irritation.</li>
    <li> Well, I got the cream on Tuesday and I used it that night and then again Wed. morning and night and thursday morning.  I am sorry to say that I have seen (or felt) no difference.  I am hoping that it is just because it will take a little more time, but at this point I see no change.  I will continue to use the cream to see if I have a difference of opinion later on.  Thank you,  Pat Compagnari</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream I love how it softens and fills in fine lines I&#x27;m 62 yrs old and it really makes my eyes look younger!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the cream even after two days it already has plumped up, hydrated, and tightened up my eyes. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll keep going and get rid of my deeper lines around my eyes. I have very sensitive skin and had no issues with this.</li>
    <li> Used this eye cream 7 times. It is easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. It probably takes a but longer than 4 days to get rid of any wrinkles so I will update later. So far I like it and the full price isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> A wonderful cream --- just a teeny bit goes a long way and makes the skin around your eyes smooth and soft.  Love it!</li>
    <li> After only 3 days of using this product, I have noticed a difference in the fines lines smoothing out. I have also used it around the lines on my upper lip and smile lines and it does make a difference. I would highly recommed this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Always concerned about new creams as I have sensitive skin.  Works great and does not irritate!</li>
    <li> Luxurious cream, smooths right on.  Purchase was a breeze and shipping was right on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any type of face/eye cream before.  This cream is great.  After the days I see a visible difference in my dark circles under eyes and tiny wrinkles almost invisible.  I tend to have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few days now with wonderful results. It is very hydrating, I have also noticed reduced lines, and less puffiness around my eyes.    After one week I have seen a significant reduction in the puffiness under my eyes. You use very little of the product (a little goes along ways). It is very hydrating.  I Love it.</li>
    <li> I recently started using  this product. You use very little but it goes a long way and I feel like it&#x27;s tightening up under my eyes. I also really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I think I&#x27;m really going to enjoy this eye cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of days now, and so far have had no problems. The consistency of the cream is perfect and does not smell bad.  At first I thought the product was just going to be an open container in that little box. I was very happy to find that the product&#x27;s container itself was sealed. Also, i&#x27;m glad the instructions for use are on the actual container too.  I&#x27;ve never used any type of eye cream before, so I&#x27;m really excited about this one. I feel like I&#x27;m doing something right by using it.  I&#x27;d actually been asking around to get people&#x27;s opinions about what I can do for my eyes, and then this product came along. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve been using it long enough to notice a difference, but from the way it feels when I put it on I have high hopes! </li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out different eye creams, and have reordered this one because it seems to be so much better than 4-5 others I&#x27;ve tried recently.  It&#x27;s very creamy, feels great going on, and I see immediate results for fine lines and dark circles.  I was using it over an eye serum but ran out of that so I&#x27;ll see how it works alone.  I don&#x27;t think I should waste my time or money on other products, I think this is my eye cream of choice from now on.</li>
    <li> Light and greaseless, this cream is a pleasure to use - and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn. (Yes, you keep it away from your eyes, but other creams wick into my eye somehow and they burn all day. Not an issue with this.) &#x27;Would happily purchase again.</li>
    <li> I dont know if its psychological but I swear I see a difference in the smoothness of my rear end and thighs. I know that when I use it my skin is so soft. I will definitely continue using this. Im sure over time I will continue seeing improvement. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and sinks into my skin quickly.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is light and easily applied on. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see a difference, but will continue to use it to see the long term effect.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. It is smooth, not sticky, or greasy. I use it daily, and the skin around my eyes feels great. It does not irritate my eyes. There is not a scent to upset my skin. Even though my skin is very sensitive this cream has not upset it in any way. I will continue to use this great cream, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Wonderful product; could feel it working as soon as I applied the product. After three days of use, I can already see it working on my fine lines/ wrinkles under my eye! can&#x27;t wait to see what results I get after more usage.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving a 4 star rating because in my opinion,  a 5 star would be absolutely perfect perfect perfect. I do not know of any product that warrants 5star.  I&#x27;ve only been using Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL eye cream 2 days BUT so far I&#x27;m loving it! Normally my skin is dry around my eyes. This makes my eye makeup look bad. Using this, around my eyes is moisturized and makes the appearance of my skin look and feel.so much better.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to find a couple of Andre Lorent products on sale and I&#x27;ve had them about a week now so I feel like I can give a pretty good review.  I&#x27;ll also update at the six week mark.  First of all, I washed my face as normal before applying.  The area around my eyes is pretty sensitive.  So, I was pretty reluctant to try this eye cream but I&#x27;m in my early thirties and worried about lines so, figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Well, I didn&#x27;t wake up the next morning looking 20 again.  Bummer.  However, the wrinkle cream was so smooth and felt nice going on.  It didn&#x27;t burn my skin and the next morning, it still felt smooth and nice.I haven&#x27;t noticed a look in my fine lines yet but my skin is softer and smoother and I&#x27;ll definitely keep using!</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy but really haven&#x27;t been able to test it long enough to see any results as I only received it earlier this week. I am definitely excited about the ingredients which are more natural than most.</li>
    <li> Good product. Feels good on skin, absorbs real good.</li>
    <li> Good product and excellent customer service. I initially wasn&#x27;t happy but the seller stands behind its product and they immediately fixed my issue. I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days back, shipping was fast and amazing..but the eye cream is so luscious! No heavy perfumes and my eye area is seeing an improvement. Bought the other products now too..can&#x27;t wait to get them!</li>
    <li> i really liked this product helped the wrinkles around my eyes</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream! Started seeing improvement in my eye area around 2 weeks. But the first night after applying I felt my sling tightening. Definitely will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Wow … in my fifth day of using it … I love this cream I can see the difference</li>
    <li> This eye cream is really nice. Goes on very smooth and feels good.  I have always used Clinique products but feel this eye cream is just as good or better and price is much better!  I will definitely keep on using it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and easily break out and have had no issues after using for one week. My skin feels hydrated but not oily! it may take some time to see a different in my completion and fine lines but so far I like the cream!</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams prior to this brand.  Thus far, this is the best one I have tried to date. I have only been using for a short time but I  already noticed tightening around my eye area (crows feet!).  It has no smell which was a huge plus and does not go on heavy or greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t affect make up make up application and absorbs quickly. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am on one week using this product.And I so loving it..I feel the tightiness after I put it on my eye area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s, do not have wrinkles around my eyes and do not plan on getting them!  This product is very light weight, absorbs easily and has a nice mild scent.  It is not oily or greasy.  I have several products from this company and they are all great.  Can highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
    <li> It has lighting my dark spots under my eyes</li>
    <li> Love love love! Ive never used any of these eye creams before but decided to give this one a try and the results are amazing! It has considerable reduced the black circles under my eyes, And its super silky and creamy!</li>
    <li> Cream seems fine.  What I don&#x27;t like are the constant emails from this company to rate the product.  I really won&#x27;t have a more detailed opinion until I&#x27;ve used it for a month or more.  Stop with the annoying emails!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream once at night once in the morning after washing my face and showering. I have seen no results at all and I&#x27;m three quarters through the bottle or jar. maybe it&#x27;s my skin but it is not working for me at all. I&#x27;m 57 years old and wanted to tighten up some wrinkles around my eyes. I was anxious to get this training and now I feel let down especially paying $20 for the small amount they give you. It looks like a lot when you open it but when you get to the bottom, it is kind caved upward. so there is not as much in the little jar as you thought. take my testimony however you like. I&#x27;m only letting you know this is one person&#x27;s feel Of this product.</li>
    <li> Received this and have been using it and so far I love it.  The texture is very creamy and glides on easily without any greasy residue. It has a light scent that I like, I don&#x27;t like an overpowering fragrance especially with eye or face cream.  I definitely noticed my fine eye lines were plumped up and less noticeable already and I haven&#x27;t been using it that long so I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works over the long haul! I like the fact that it contains Resveratrol and other anti oxidant ingredients.  The package arrived quickly to my door and I am very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference pretty quickly though to be fair I have never used an eye cream before. A little goes a long way and I&#x27;m really seeing results. The packaging was cute too.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream .makes skin very soft and smooth. You only need a tiny amount ..no overwhelming smell or tacky feeling .</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my eyes look youthful and rejuvenated. It smooths the appearance of under eye wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Light and smooth - doesn&#x27;t tug at my skin when applied. Love it so far.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful!! Very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for very long but so far I really like it! It feels really nice when you put it on. It arrived when promised and the customer service is great too!</li>
    <li> works great so far! makes skin so soft and clear looking</li>
    <li> The cream is light and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. It applies easily around the eyes and does not irritate.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great. It goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy at all!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream. I have used it for about a week and I have noticed that my fine lines are starting to disappear. It also improve the dark circles under my eyes in the morning. I have also noticed that it greatly reduces the puffiness of my eyes. I promise you will love this eye cream. I plan on buying it again as soon as I finish with the bottle that I currently own.</li>
    <li> Feels excellent on skin and has a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful eye wrinkle cream is a great product.  I started using it about 2 weeks ago and my little fine lines and crows feet are not noticeable anymore.  It&#x27;s like a miracle eye cream!  It is so soft and smells really good. And the best things is it really does work!  I Highly Recommend this Product!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Can&#x27;t wait to see the effects long term.</li>
    <li> This eye wrinkle cream is amazing!  Goes on flawlessly and is not oily.  I noticed a change right away in the morning.  My under eye area was smoother and less puffy.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Andre Lorent face cream for a while now and I love it.  So i decided to try the eye cream.  Its wonderful too.  Im so excited about these products.  They totally change the skin&#x27;s texture.  My skin so more plump and soft now.  So much more soft.  I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps with the fine lines or dark circles yet.  I just started using the eye cream. But i love it so far</li>
    <li> I gave used this product for 3 days now. Honestly, my skin feels smoother and looks brighter. To soon to say how well it works on reducing wrinkles . The eye cream feels cool when applied , has a nice consistency to it , not greasy feeling  blends in well. Nothing negative to say about this product  but I do enjoy applying it daily.</li>
    <li> Very nice to apply, makes skin soft a.d smooth. Hope long term effects are just as good as initial application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using your Crazy Beautiful Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely texture and moisturized wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet, but live in a very dry climate so am hoping&lt;br /&gt;that the regular moisturizer will help prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this great new product!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 3 days, so I can&#x27;t say what the long-term effects are, but so far I like this eye cream. It does a good job of firming up the skin around my eyes. I&#x27;ve used it both in the morning and at night. I tend to wake up with puffy eyes, and I have noticed that this cream is better than others I&#x27;ve used at reducing that. I like that it has natural ingredients, no smell and no parabens - I have sensitive skin and this is not irritating at all.</li>
    <li> I have been looking a eye wrinkle cream for a while. This one is moist and creamy..I have been using it only for a short while but I&#x27;m excited to see what the the results will be.</li>
    <li> I love that the products in this eye cream are essential oils and not a long list of chemicals.  It is totally non-greasy.  You can wear this under makeup.  A tiny dab works for the eyes, so this container will last for quite some time.  There is no odor.  It is smooth and pleasant feeling.  I have used it for two days so far, and find it illuminating.  I am going to look for more products by this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this eye cream so far.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, which is something that is really important to me since my eyes are sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
    <li> Great product! Saw results right away! My puffy eyes were reduced and redness decreased!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great. It is really soft and feels great. I have had eye creams in the past that were really greasy, but this one is not greasy at all. It is so nice that my husband even used it!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! smells great and reduced wrinkles right away. Its a must buy!</li>
    <li> I only tried this cream twice. I have sensitive skin, it made the skin around my eyes red and feel like it was burning.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I did like the texture. It went on smoothly and wasn&#x27;t greasy. I also liked that it wasn&#x27;t scented. There was a half ounce in the jar, but it seemed like it would go far and last awhile.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully for the past 3 days. I have noticed in the morning before putting on my makeup that I don&#x27;t have much of the puffiness and dark color under my eye. Hoping that in continuing this I will see more changes.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! It is NON greasy you only have to use a small dab so it will last a long time. My skin felt wonderful as soon as I put it on and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (which other eye creams seem to do). So glad I decided to try it! Shipping is fast too which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few days now and I really like it!  It is a smooth and silky cream and moisturizes and hydrates the skin wonderfully!!  My husband noticed that my eyes look brighter and not tired!!!  And I love that it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor like most wrinkle cream.</li>
    <li> Love the way it tightens up my eye area after using about a week.  It&#x27;s important to make sure it&#x27;s absorbed before applying foundation or it will flake.  Other than that,  I really like it and would definitely buy it again. Good product.  I&#x27;ve used and tried many eye creams and this is tops.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  o can feel it working.  Only used it a few days but can already tell a difference.  I am hooked</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It feels amazing as you are putting it on and results come quick. Theres no harsh smells. It actually has a very pleasant smell. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Very thick and creamy, it smells nice but not highly scented. Noticed a difference after just a couple days</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eye cream!!</li>
    <li> Light weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with this eye cream. The lines around my eyes are definitely &amp;#34;softening&amp;#34; ! I have been using the cream since Halloween &amp; I like the fact that the cream goes a long way. I dab a small amount around the outer corners of my eyes every morning &amp; I still have a LOT left in the container ! Thanks for a great product !</li>
    <li> I have truly enjoyed my new eye cream. It is lightweight and non greasy. Good eye cream</li>
    <li> Wounderful eye cream! I use this with my nightly routine.This cream is great for tiny lines around the eyes,and also helps with puffiness.A little tiny dab is all you need,used on upper lid as well as underneath the eye</li>
    <li> I have only used this eye cream for a few days now, but am already pleasantly surprised. I have very sensitive skin and usually any cream burns around my eyes, however so far that has not happened with this. It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling after use like other creams do. Very happy with this so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product. It&#x27;s so light and silky when you put it on, you barely know it&#x27;s there. Unlike some other products I have tried. It&#x27;s a perfect size jar that makes it easy to take along when you travel. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t believe the difference around my eyes.</li>
    <li> The product feels amazing on and I can see the difference already!!!!! Love!!!!!!</li>
    <li> best ever cream for puffiness and wrinkles at a great price.</li>
    <li> Received product and have used it for three days now, morning and night. So far, so good. Light, not greasy, can feel a little tingling around eye area where applied...so I think something is working...too soon to tell about lessening the look of wrinkles, but it is definitely hydrating.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 72 hrs &amp; love it!! Packaging is very nice, color of eye cream is a little odd, kind of a beige pink. Odorless which I really liked since you are putting close to eyes. I patted cream around eyes as instructed, letting it absorb in. I can honestly say This 59 yr old lady noticed a difference in one day :) Helps with those fine lines and eye puffiness, hydrates the eye area all day and night. I would highly recommend this eye cream and am looking forward to trying their other products!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product. First, I like how it’s light and goes on smooth. It doesn’t have any strong smell which I usually avoid. I also like that the company is conscious with the ingredients. It’s free of paragons, SLS, Petro-chemical derivatives. Only after several uses of the cream, I could see it really works. I haven’t taken care of my skin very good so it was really dry, especially around my eyes where I could see some faint wrinkles. I hardly see them anymore and it makes me feel really good. I would buy it again when I am done with this bottle.</li>
    <li> I have already submitted a review on this wonderful product previously.  However, I do not see it.  This eye cream was not greasy.  It soaked right into my skin.  I have very dry skin and am 65 years old.  I love that there is no fragrance.  Most fragrances break out my skin.  The skin around my eyes felt tighter on first use.  I am in love with this eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 1 1/2 months, twice a day.  I wish I could say that I have seen a noticeable improvement, but I have not.  While my skin seems moist right after application, the feeling does not last long.  And I have seen no improvement in the lines/wrinkles under my eyes.  However, the one positive is that the product does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I was really hoping to find something that really worked without breaking the bank but this product was not it.  After purchasing, I received several emails from the company since they wanted a five star review.  However, I cannot give such a review since the product failed for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream for less then a week and have noticed a slight difference. I&#x27;m not really sure it it is much better then my current brand since I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream nightly since it arrived.  I like the texture and feel of the cream, it has great consistency and very little scent.  It was a little to harsh for my own skin so I switched to using  it every other day.</li>
    <li> This cream is lightly scented. I love the thickness of it and it spreads nicely. Only had it a few days so cannot tell about wrinkle removal just yet.</li>
    <li> I think this is going to be a great product. I have only used it for 2 days. I have found a little product goes a long ways. That is a great thing. The skin around my eyes already feels smoother/softer. I will update with more information in a few weeks of using the product.</li>
    <li> Only been a couple days but so far great product!</li>
    <li> love the moisture and smooth feeling that my skin has , can&#x27;t wait to see what a week does</li>
    <li> First cream that hasn&#x27;t caused some kind of reaction to my face. After a few days of use I can already see some results. A huge plus to me is that it is made in the USA. I will definitely buy this again. And I cannot wait see what other products they have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had for a short time, however I am impressed so far.  Reduce puffy eyes  with one application.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping the dark circles from under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful on skin. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is working-It&#x27;s not going to happen overnight-nothing does. But you can use this cream every day &amp; feel a change &amp; see a change. I have used other Andre Lorent products &amp; you can trust this brand.  You have to be patient &amp; not expect miracles.but it does improve the eye area!</li>
    <li> Hmmmm, not same color as in the picture. The one I received is yellow-ish... Makes me wonder if it spoiled or if that&#x27;s the actual color. Either way, it has no foul smell, so I am giving it a shot. So far 2 weeks &amp; I see a minor difference... Nothing to do with wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have any, but my skin tone, dark circles, puffiness has decreased... Let&#x27;s see. I&#x27;ll update review</li>
    <li> This arrived fast and I can already see results. I&#x27;m only in my early 30&#x27;s and i&#x27;m starting to see wrinkles form. What a lovely way to head them off!</li>
    <li> I love it. I just started using it so I can&#x27;t say I look 15 yrs younger but I love how soft it makes the area around my eyes feel. And my makeup seems to look smoother in that area as well. I plan to only use this at night so it may take some time to reap any true benefits but I love it and will continue to incorporate this in my regimen.</li>
    <li> feels great on skin, hydrates well, cant wait to see the results with more use.</li>
    <li> I have only been Using this cream for abt a Week.  I do love it So Far!  A very low to No Scent which I like, and a great texture!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Priced right!!  Delivery fast and easy!  Andre Lorent has done it again!  Love this company!</li>
    <li> Love this product it is exactly what I was looking for in a eye cream! Very moisturizing but yet soaks in quickly. I will purchase this product again!!</li>
    <li> Great Product Highly Recommend!!</li>
    <li> This cream feels like silk on your eyes. Very light and soothing.  I love that they use all natural products.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is AMAZING!!  It goes on as a silky cool cream that absorbs right into the skin.  My makeup looks flawless after using it!  You know it&#x27;s working when it feels tingly.  And is it scentless, which is a huge plus!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying how soft my skin feels after using this cream! It leaves my eyes and skin feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> Light and non-greasy.  Pleasant scent.  Great find!</li>
    <li> I saw the difference after the first use. I&#x27;m very pleased with this item. Now to look and see if there is something for forheads.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream, after just a few days I see the results! I also patted on those wrinkles between my eyes and I see improvement!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Eye Wrinkle Cream for a few days, but can already tell that this cream moisturizes very well and the benefits will continue to show themselves.  I use the cream in the mornings under my make up and in the evenings before bed.  It has been a simple and effective addition to my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Helps smooth wrinkles. Lovely cream. Soft and mild. No odor at all. Does not make eye skin tight. Feels good on your skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic eye cream. Works great even after only the first use. Noticeable diffrence in crows eyes. I love it.</li>
    <li> I recently received this cream, so I haven&#x27;t used it for very long. So far, I am very pleased with the way it glides on and the smell isn&#x27;t over-powering. I have already noticed a change with the light crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes. I think it&#x27;s a keeper and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase which should last quite awhile since very little is needed to work.</li>
    <li> I really like it. It works well and tingles when you put it on. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell either. You only need a little, so this jar will last awhile!</li>
    <li> I received this cream for $1, and right afterwards I was emailed requesting that I wrote a positive review within 72 goes off receiving the product. If I did not have something good to say, I was supposed to nor write a review. In other words, i was provided this product at an extreme discount solely so that I could write a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be an OK cream - it has a very light scent, it is thick, and it moisturizers. However, i have no way of knowing whether it will affect my wrinkles after only 3 days of use. Unfortunately, the email stated that I am required to write a positive review or I will no longer be offered the opportunity to get products for $1. Based on my personal experience,I am not surprised that this cream has so many 5 star reviews, considering that the cream was provided for $1 and those customers were requested to only submit excellent reviews.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I&#x27;ll have to update after I&#x27;ve used it a little bit with whether it actually works or not.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Generous sized jar for eye creme. I have used it for a week and it seems to be softening the lines around my eyes. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Product came on time,  smells amazing,  feels like silk.  Used for 3 days,  feel the difference already.  This is the Holy grail of eye cream.  I will be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> I did receive my eye cream from  from you. I have been using it since that day. I have very sensitive skin and I thought should I or shouldn&#x27;t I try this. Well I am so glad I did. I have dark circle under my eyes and they are going away, I am in my late 50&#x27;s,I  felt the tingling in my eye area when I put it on. Did it tighten the area... some, so I would say yes... what it did more then anything was made my eye area smoother, less dark and I have had an overall different look in my eye area. I would say this is a great product (Even for those of us who have sensitive eyes) I would recommend this product to my friends and family memeber</li>
    <li> I love the eye cream!  I like the size of jar that it comes in, compared to other eye creams with smaller portions.  I like the fact that there is no scent associated with the cream when it is put on.  I have noticed a tightening effect (less wrinkles) under my eye area and my skin feels more supple in that eye area.  When I pat it under my eye, I feel a slight tingling sensation that I know it is working on my skin.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Get yours today. Works wonders</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for three days and I can feel the difference already!!</li>
    <li> I got this cream last Wednesday and while I cannot speak to the long term benefits of the product, I do like what I have seen so far.  The cream feels very rich and absorbs well into the skin without leaving a greasy feel.  I can almost feel it firming the skin after applying it without it feeling like it is drying my skin out. It feels like the skin is tightening but when you touch your face it doesnt feel anything but moisturized. I do see a slight change in the skin under my eyes and have noticed a mild reduction in the puffiness in the area when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this review after using the product for a few weeks so I can determine if a significant reduction in the fine lines has been acheived.</li>
    <li> I took advantage of a great deal in purchasing this product. I have never used an eye cream exclusively. I usually have just been using face moisturizer. When this deal came along, I figured what do I have to lose. I purchased the product, and it came in a timely fashion. I have received multiple emails from the company to see if I had indeed received the product and to see if I liked said product. I do like the product...I am in a higher age bracket than most of the reviewers on this page, so this cream has a lot of work to do. I am happy with the results thus far....the dryness around my eyes is gone, and there are days where my eyes do look more radiant, and small lines have disappeared. I will continue to use this product hoping for more improvement around my eyes. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It made my eye area smooth.I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Going for my third day and love it .Not grease no smells and the formula that I have been looking for a long time&lt;br /&gt;since I had to by everything separate to achieve the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Will fallow  up with more info in few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! I&#x27;ve only tried it for a few days but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m in it for the long haul! It&#x27;s not greasy or oily.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent so it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  I look refreshed when I wake up.  I&#x27;ve paid more for other products and gotten less results!  Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> Not that crazy about eye cream. One star</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels good on my eyes</li>
    <li> Def noticed a tightening feeling and smoothing feeling.. Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream!  It sinks in well and feels very nourishing. It&#x27;s a really nice size too!  This will last me a while!</li>
    <li> Loved the feel and texture of this creme. Goes on smoothly and not greasy. Will def be telling all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple days now. A tiny amount goes a long way! I don&#x27;t ever wear makeup but have dark circles under my eyes. This cream feels good going on, it&#x27;s not oily and has made the skin under my eyes smooth! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if my dark circles will disappear!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream.. I love the fact that it&#x27;s not those tiny little tubes that run out in a month and cost $20.00.. This is a generous amount jar and feels really refreshing. Customer service is superb. The company personally follows up to make sure you like the product.. Keep it up guys!</li>
    <li> I really love it- work very well for me too- i had such problem with eye are after wrong botox injection- all skin was pulled wrong way  - it did not solve my problem but made it better looking skin</li>
    <li> This eye cream really works for me. I love being able to notice a difference when I use a product like this. The fine lines after using this eye cream for 10 days have gone away and the crows feet are staring to disappear also. This is a mild cream that does not bother my eyes like some of the creams I&#x27;ve used. I use this with the anti-age facial cream and it&#x27;s a great duo. They have excellent customer service. They donate proceeds to charities from the sale of their products. They are a win, win all around small business that I would highly recommend any of their products.</li>
    <li> I love how soft this feels as it is being applied.  And how smooth arounfd mf eyes feel. Being a mom my eyes are always puffy with black circles and this really seems to help</li>
    <li> I’m a 51 year old, who has tried so many different products. The Crazy Beautiful Eye Cream is exactly what I have been looking for. I have very sensitive skin, especially around my eyes. This product is amazing! It’s light, non greasy, and doesn’t have any perfume or unpleasant smell. It goes on very smoothly, non-stinging, absorbs quickly, doesn’t crease under my make up, and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Truly a product I will continue using. Five Stars!</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about this cream.  Its a moisturizer like any other.  I have been using for apx. one month, regularly.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype some of these other reviews give this product.  It is certainly no better than a much more affordable Olay type product.  If you have wrinkles and dark circles and you want them to be visibly reduced, you need a product with strivectin; its the only thing I&#x27;ve found that can actually help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this eye cream. I&#x27;m already feeling it working after a couple of days. I have been using another prestige brand which I actually sell but wanted to try this anyway and I&#x27;m surprised that I actually like this better shhh don&#x27;t tell :) I&#x27;ve been taking before and after pictures and can&#x27;t to compare them in a week or so!    Update. Feb 2015. The cream was felling great on my skin but the results were less than I expected and unfortunately I stopped using it</li>
    <li> Love it. I have very sensitive eyes and this cream did not cause any reactions. It has a light pleasant smell, non greasy and absorbs fast.  I love these Andre Lorent creams and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few days now. my skin feels smoother and looks brighter. Too soon to say how well it works on reducing wrinkles . It is  not greasy feeling blends in well. Nothing negative to say about this product</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this eye cream was going to work for me, as I have very sensitive skin around my eyes.  I also run, and I have had other eye creams that sting my eyes when I sweat.  I haven&#x27;t had that happen with Crazy Beautiful eye cream.  It is non-greasy and fine lines and wrinkles virtually disappear!  It stayed in place while I ran, no stinging or burning!  I also like that my eye makeup looks as fresh at the end of the day as when I applied it in the morning.  I use it as a night cream and I don&#x27;t have the dryness and dark circles under my eyes that I used to have.  I would highly recommend Crazy Beautiful Eye Cream, especially for the &amp;#34;over 50&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> Really like the eye cream...Great texture...goes on great and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive eyes.  Would recommend it !</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received the product 3 days ago, and have used it each night at bedtime. It feels wonderful, I am usually sensitive to products like this and I have had not breakout or rash from it. I am excited to see the long term effects. I will continue to use it every night, thank you.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have only been using it for a few days but I swear I can tell a difference in the softness of my skin.  I recommend this product mostly because there is no perfume smell to it, which I love.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I was hesitant at first but was surprised of the high quality. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Andre Lorent Crazy Beautiful Eye Wrinkle Cream for a short time but I have already found that the fine lines around my eyes are much less noticeable. I also love that my face feels smooth and hydrated, not greasy like some products I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a great product and I look forward to trying Andre Lorent&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> This product is not oily and can be absorb very quickly when I first time put it around my eyes.  The amazing part is ~I found out that it did reduce the fine lines after I woke up next morning in the dry heated room.  Usually, when I used other brand, it would dry out the next morning and you could definitely see few fine lines.  I was very surprised that this product can reduce the fine lines.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is wonderful! I have used it for two days and am already seeing results. No more fine lines around my eyes!</li>
    <li> I have only used this cream for a few days but have already noticed a difference in the bags under my eyes. It is light but feels firm on your skin. Very hydrating.  Also good for sensitive skin. I have very sensitive eyes and skin and I have had no problems. Very good eye cream for a very good price.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly.  Great packaging...loved when products are packaged security with no tapering possible.  Creamy and smooth.  I have very dry skin and some products make it drier.  This did not.  Anxious to see how my skin looks after several weeks.  Happy so far!</li>
    <li> Awesome eye cream! Reasonaby priced. Skin will feel super soft and supple and just awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few days now (twice a day in the morning and at night) and its one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried.  It hydrates the skin without being sticky. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, which is very nice. You only need a small amount and goes on gentley. It&#x27;s worth the amount I spent on it and I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days and all I can say is WOW!!! I absolutely Love this eye cream. Already have noticed my fine lines are not as visible.  I would definitely recommendthis to my friends and ffamily.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful.  It has reduced the puffiness below my eyes and my wrinkles look better.  It is wonderful to put on - not oily at all and it is smooth to apply.  No unpleasant scent and no skin irritation.  I also like that it is made with natural ingredients.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love how it works so far.. Can&#x27;t wait to leave a follow up review in a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several days now. Skin around my eyes feels softer, lines appear less noticeable. Smells pretty much neutral, (some I have used before smelled TERRIBLE.) Will definitely continue using this eye cream. The list of the ingredients that are in this is impressive. I also am going to order the face cream that goes with the eye cream. Changing the product line I use!</li>
    <li> This is my first eye cream so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but after a week of using it, I do like this product. There no strong smell and I feel it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; right away. I will continue using this product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. Refreshing. Would buy.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel refreshed, and it does not feel like it is burning my skin</li>
    <li> Awesome product and service. Smooth, smells  good and Luke the way it feels. Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good. I dont have a lot of wrinkles BUT the couple that I do have seemed to minimize using this product</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, gets rid of my baggy eyes.  Needed to make sure that it worked well with my&lt;br /&gt;foundation.  Made attempt this morning to look and make sure my foundation and the eye cream worked together.  They did.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!!  I notice a difference with the first application!!</li>
    <li> Feels good, very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Only been using it a few days, but I am seeing amazing results! Great Product! Great Price!</li>
    <li> This eye crème does not irritate my eyes.  I decided to try this product around only one eye to see if there really was a difference.  Stupid me - I now have one eye that has a reduction in crow&#x27;s feet &amp; sagging skin around the eyes.  I am now using the product around both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this cream because it uses antioxidant found in the skin of red grape. It fights visible signs of aging. Lord knows we are all getting older. It is nice to find a product with 600 microbial compounds produced by plants.  There are too many chemical products in the world &amp; I am looking for more natural products.  There is also a money back guarantee on this product so you have nothing to lose by trying this eye crème.</li>
    <li> I loved the Crazy Beautiful Eye Cream because I noticed that my eyes did not look as tired or puffy. The cream does not have a smell to it which is nice, and it is the perfect consistency. Whenever you put things near your eyes they can not be to thick or to thin. I used it exactly as directed and after the second day I could see the difference. My eyes looked brighter and more alive. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just received the eye cream, so I have only used it a few times but I love how soft it makes my skin feel around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and have noticable improvement to the fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;ve also used on my upper lip as I have some lines there as well.  It has a pleasent smell as well.  I&#x27;m happy to keep using this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference using this cream, the pot it comes in has a false bottom, the amount of product is not the size of pot..fyi</li>
    <li> Hello,  I&#x27;ve recently purchased this with ALOT of research and also I won&#x27;t buy anything without reading the reviews first.. I am always a little hesitant when buying things especially for my face online. Unfortunately I have had as of late the onset of adult acne. I am 41 so idk.. But I have been using this wonderful cream morning and night for one week now and it hasn&#x27;t made my breakouts worse in any way, actually I thinks it&#x27;s helped if you could believe that!..BONUS FOR ME!...LOL.My skin looks and feels amazing! . I HAve used Retinol in the past but it&#x27;s seems too harsh for my skin..this cream is fabulous. .I WILL purchase again and I do recommend! ..much love and big hugs to all, Patty.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9d4479ff614b8d67a34a2e12fbfeb59b]] I don&#x27;t think I am the target market for this product. I am a 30 something dad who is a wash and go kind of guy. I have always believed in aging gracefully and just taking what nature and my body threw at me. That being said I am starting to get a few crows feet and its not as much fun as I thought. I was excited to give this a try. Does it reduce wrinkles? The jury is still out there. Maybe, maybe not. I do believe that the extra moisture in the area will help improve the appearance and health of the skin around my eyes. Maybe that&#x27;s all they need (lets hope) and for that this is definitely effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself has a light tan color. it is completely unscented and applies smoothly and evenly. You are instructed to dab (not wipe) around the eye area. I believe this is so that you have plenty of product in place. It does absorb but takes a few minutes because of the dabbing.

    <li> This is my second container!!! I have people telling me I look younger all the time!</li>
    <li> I bought this six months ago do have had time to determine actual effectiveness.  I have to say... I just don&#x27;t get it.  It seemed basically useless and even dried &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  I expected more..or SOMETHING..given the price.  As most middle aged women, I&#x27;m always looking for the next great cream and, this isn&#x27;t it.  I am disappointed because, the one good thing is that it&#x27;s fragrance free.  I am also glad that, in spite of its seeming uselessness, it didn&#x27;t cause irritation.  Those two things saved it from a one on the review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a month.  I do see a difference around my eyes and don&#x27;t need as much concealer.  It also seems to make a sort of &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for my makeup and my makeup seems to stay put around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve never seen extensive changes to my skin from any makeup product, I&#x27;m basing this review mostly on how I liked the look and feel of the cream. First of all, when it arrived, I thought I had received a fake product because the label colours were different from the image and the cream was a light, apricot colour with the consistency of partially-melted candle wax (the photos made it look milky-white and more gel-like). I don&#x27;t know if this is what the product originally looks like, but the photos were extremely different and made me question whether there had been a mistake or not.  I have been consistently using this for a month or two, since I don&#x27;t want to waste the money I spent. However, I found it to be very waxy and it takes a long time to warm the product between your fingers before it&#x27;s comfortable to apply under your eye. After using it, I did notice that it made my skin very smooth, but it didn&#x27;t quite moisturize the way I was hoping it would. It would work really well on the back of my hand, but it was near impossible to get it to sink into the skin nicely below my eyes. All in all, I think this is a good product if you want the skin under your eyes to be smoother. I guess the product did mention that it would make your skin LOOK fresh and rejuvenated, not FEEL.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, since it didn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I was hoping it to, but it could be right for people looking to add brightness to their under-eye area.  EDIT: Really great customer service, and I appreciated the time they took to try to make up for the fact that this product didn&#x27;t fit well with me. All in all, if they ever make different products in the future that fit my skin better or have different textures, I would be inclined to shop here again.</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased a total of 6 creams, 3 each, one of each kind; eye, face, and cellulite. The creams were making my wife&#x27;s skin flaky, while causing a rash on my skin. I was a little worried at first, because we had tried other creams with undesirable effects, but this company offered a 90 day, 100% No Risk Full Refund, and would not require us to ship the product back.  I thought it was worth a shot. If it worked, great, if not, we have nothing to lose, which is what they want you to believe. They want you to think that they believe in the effectiveness of their product with such confidence that they will let you try it, and if it does not work, they will give you your money back without hassle.  This was not the case. I sent 3 emails requesting my refund. Each time they repeated the same thing; I would have to ship the unused portion back, and then they would issue a refund.   Here is what they advertised above, &amp;#34;100% No Risk Money Back Guarantee...If you are unhappy with the item, we will issue you a 100% refund of your purchase price within 90 days, and you may keep the unused contents of the skin cream.&amp;#34; Andre Lorent  I would not buy creams or any other products from Andre Lorent.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit.....several days and you will start to notice that you skin is responding to this cream.</li>
    <li> Having just received this product and using it 6 times, I am quite pleased with it. It is very light texture and goes on nicely . Very light scent and you certainly don&#x27;t use very much if you tap it on as recommended. This jar will last a few months so the price is really good. I have used Mary Kay over the eyes but I am liking this product very much. It is  a  small enough jar to fit into cosmetic bags for travel as well..a big plus!! Hoping after a bit it will give me more great results!!!!</li>
    <li> Small bottle but it goes a long way. The results are amazing as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past 2 weeks, I dont have to many under eye wrinkles, but I do or had a very rired look. Since Ive been using it I have noticed that I dont look as tired as I use to all the time, I am loving the results and looking forward to using this product more. It goes on smooth and does not leave a gross greasy feeling on my face,</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this product.</li>
    <li> great product would share with friends and buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now (maybe slightly more), and have noticed no difference at all.  I was however bumbarded emails in the first two weeks asking for positive &amp; 5 star reviews (my guess, all the five star ratings came from people who were tired of getting the emails, or people who never used any eye cream before at all).  The product isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just thin &amp; watery (not what is expected by me for a good product).</li>
    <li> Great cream I have very sensitive eyes and skin and this cream does not irritate them, so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel the skin around my eyes very hydrated, so far I like it.</li>
    <li> This Eye cream is great! It really moisturizes the skin around your eyes. I use it once in the morning and once at night! Great product!</li>
    <li> Nice consistency, not too greasy, seems to work quite well</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very soothing!! My mom and I are both loving how nicely is works! Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results and I will update my review as more results are seen!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my Mother. She seems to like it a lot, and she is very picky and dismissive when it comes to facial creams. Must work!</li>
    <li> Arrived at my door in 2 days. Love this product. Smooth not sticky feeling. I like how the product works.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth and silky and helps prevent wrinkles around your eyes. I wear this everyday because who wants crow feet?? I love Andre Lorent, the company always delivers luxurious products that are affordable.</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for an eye cream that does not burn my eyes and I found it! Its not too terrible expensive either.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very light and does not smell which is what I look for. You really have to pat it in for it to absorb rubbing doesn&#x27;t work for me. After using for 10 days, morning &amp; night, I really do see a difference in the lines by my eyes. They are softer and I feel I don&#x27;t look as tired. It is very easy to spread makeup over it. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Feel great and is non-greasy formula I can&#x27;t say weather or not it will help with wrinkles or not but it feels very nice</li>
    <li> LOVE my Crazy Beautiful eye cream! My skin feels wonderful and I can tell a difference in my &#x27;tired&amp;#34; eyes already. only been using for a week and would recommend to my friends!</li>

    <li> I love how this cream feels on my face. Smooth and silky and after 2 days I already feel a difference in how my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream and I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for about a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The skin around my eyes looks firmer and smoother in such a short time.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is awesome! I like how light it feels. It&#x27;s not greasy feeling like other&#x27;s I have tried. My fine lines are disappearing and my eyes look brighter!</li>
    <li> Amazing product,...I love it.</li>
    <li> Received this and have been using it and so far I really like it. The texture is very creamy and smooth and it applies easily without any greasy residue. It has a very light scent that for eye  cream. It hydrates the skin around my eyes very nicely you can feel the hydration almost immediatl.y I like that it contains Resveratrol and other anti oxidant ingredients. My package arrived prior to my scheduled arrival date and I am very pleased with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had 2 days so haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but the product is nice. Light weight, not heavy on skin. Neutral smell.</li>
    <li> Well I used Andre Lorent eye wrinkle cream for a little over aweek now and I have to say that I love the way it feels.  It is very moisturizing and&lt;br /&gt;does not have a bad smell.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time so can&#x27;t say too much about it since it takes some time to see &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; results but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;happy with the product so far.  I will be following up in a few more weeks to let you know my thoughts.</li>
    <li> The eye cream absorbed very well and improved the look around my eye after only one day. I was very happy with the results</li>
    <li> I received this cream and was anxious to try it, but I was also concerned about using it.  I have to say that I have VERY sensitive skin, especially around the eye area, so I cannot use anything with a lot of perfume, certain colors in eye shadows or strong chemicals because I get an allergic reaction to them, so I was concerned about using an eye cream.  When I opened the jar I noticed the scent, if any, is very slight.  It is very light and creamy and easy to apply to the eye area.  There was no burning or itching around the eye area after applying it - just a slight tightening sensation but it was not drying or irritating.  I have only used this cream for about two days, but I have to say that I do think I already see a bit of improvement in the lines around my eyes and on my eyelids.  It does really well under makeup.  I know that to see the true results I would need to use this product longer, and I am looking forward to using it.  If I continue to use this, I think the price very reasonable compared to other eye creams on the market.  I can&#x27;t wait to see further results.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it, I usually have issues with eye creams burning, this is CRAZY BEAUTIFUL eye cream, no burning, light, non-greasy and made with organic ingredients.  What a great value this is, with Prime it was delivered to my door in two days.</li>
    <li> I have only had the cream for 3 days and love the luxurious feel of the cream. It is replenishing moisture around my eyes and lines are diminishing !</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t agitate my eyes! easy to apply, left the skin smooth and soft</li>
    <li> Great new product.  Love the way it make my skin feel and that fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  I seem to be sensitive to some facial products and so far so good with this.  I have only used it a week and plan to continue with it (sometime I stop using them after 3 or 4 days due to sensitivity).</li>
    <li> This eye cream definitely removes wrinkles and tightens the skin around my eyes.  I was skeptical at first but very pleasantly surprised after using it.  It&#x27;s only been a week and I can already tell there&#x27;s an improvement.</li>
    <li> the best cream ever .</li>
</ol>
