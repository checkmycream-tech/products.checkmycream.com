### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>you will provide the best shape up lines across the forehead and neckline known to man.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>A great product out of the box.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>It got here very quickly and I am happy with it</li>
      <li>Amazing and cut almost like a razor .</li>
      <li>Straight and perfect every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t the blades fault just my own over-optimistic attitude.  </li>
      <li>Good for a clean close fade and no bumps.  </li>
      <li>It would not become like a shaver, a shaver will be smooth like butter, here, it is like the next best thing if you have any reason at all to not use shaver, and there are plenty of good reasons.  </li>
      <li>but it gets very warm very fast and tends to &#x27;skip&#x27; no matter what speed or angle I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This blade is okay</li>
      <li>the set back is perfect</li>
      <li>so I decided on this and glad I did.</li>
      <li>These work ok,</li>
      <li>This is a great blade, it really comes about as close as you could get to a razor</li>
      <li>That way you get the best cut possible.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was that much closer of a shave than the &amp;#34;00000&amp;#34; blade, but it was indeed better, and any additional closeness is good.</li>
      <li>It might not work if you&#x27;re clipping somewhere sensitive but it worked great trimming my head.</li>
      <li>Follow up with your straight razor and youve got perfect, crisp lines fast.</li>
      <li>It cuts close and accurately.</li>
      <li>Works great on Andis clippers on a human head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pictured in the primary add is the trimmer blade, but when you check out the cart shows an image of the outliner, but the part number and originating page indicate the trimmer blade</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked around to find the closest detachable blade that would fit the Oster 76 and</li>
      <li>fault, quick delivery otherwise fine.</li>
      <li>If your growth is more than two weeks then first use the .5 mm blade, bring it to a stuble, and then use this to get the close look.  </li>
      <li>The cut is close to razor clean just without the irritation and ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I normally use them with the face of the blade touching my head and I push them across my scalp.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite.</li>
      <li>Works with my Andis shaver very welll and easily swaps for another blade/blade length if needed</li>
      <li>If you are looking for crisp lines, stick to outliners that you can manipulate as the fix blade on this item cannot do a real crisp line</li>
      <li>useful for lining up beards...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth the hassle of returning it, I don&#x27;t know what the difference between the outliner and the trimmer are so</li>
      <li>However it was worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>This rating is due to the seller&#x27;s ineptness, and has nothing to do with the product which is as good as anything else Andis makes</li>
      <li>The blade worked right out of the box no need to adjust the blade and it cut skin close.</li>
      <li>i just slap this on my wahl rapidfires and BAM quick fast cut like butter</li>
      <li>I have to use a #00000 (.2mm) blade first</li>
      <li>Just remember before you use your blade for the first time,run it through some type of blade wash solvent to get factory protective film off.</li>
      <li>I found that the &#x27;skipping&#x27; is pretty much eliminated by turning the clippers 180 degrees and pulling them.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped I could easily use it to keep my entire head shaved</li>
      <li>powerful.a little bit more powerful than oster 76.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cuts very close to about somewhat of a days growth.</li>
      <li>Keeps my head shaved without the irritation of a straight razor.</li>
      <li>I like to shave my head but razors really irritate me</li>
      <li>and he wants to get rid of them even if that&#x27;s not what the customer ordered, knowing that the customer will be disinclined to return the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This blade really gets close, its just like shaving, but without the use of a razor.</li>
      <li>I bought this for use in my oster 76 and it works very well.</li>
      <li>I think the shortest Oster is a 000 or 0000 and this cuts much closer.  </li>
      <li>but it really isn&#x27;t meant for that.  </li>
      <li>Cuts very close and does not scrap or scratch the skin.</li>
      <li>Whether this is good for African American facial shaving, I do not know.</li>
      <li>A good strategy for me is to frequently brush off the clipper blade during cutting to ensure a better cut.</li>
      <li>If you have longer hair naturally use a higher # blade and then finish off with this blade.</li>
      <li>Its been fine so far after a month or so of daily use.</li>
      <li>can do my entire neck with it comfortably and it looks like a pretty recent razor job.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The slightly wider size blade just gives and easy straight line up that cannot be beat.</li>
      <li>The Ultraedge Trimmer Blade was good but did not preform as expected based on the previous reviews.</li>
      <li>If there are other brands that offer a .1mm blade that would also fit the Oster 76, this I do not know.</li>
      <li>It looked as if it was a used blade instead of a new one.</li>
      <li>The issue is that its made of thinner material and seems to be less sturdy in general, though its also a bit more inexpensive I think.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that this blade can get hot unlike the ceramic blades.</li>
      <li>Ill be using the Outliner II for this since it is smaller and more agile.</li>
      <li>Keep your blades clean and well oiled and they will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>No problems so far.</li>
      <li>but I find that they are much too cumbersome to use in place of edge clippers such as the Andis &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; outliners.</li>
      <li>For years, I used a 00000 blade with my Classic 76, thinking that it was the closest to the skin I could go, short of shaving with a razor.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this blade if your are looking for the closest shave possible.</li>
      <li>I have owned several of these over the last decade and they work very well.</li>
      <li>Not like the T-Trimmer but just as good on the cutting.</li>
      <li>Blade is sharp and ready to use.</li>
      <li>For anywhere you want to clear hair down to nothing, get high contrast lines, etc, this is the blade for it.</li>

<li> I still cut my hair once a week, but this keeps my military cut extra short.</li>
<li> I have a cheaper electric razor that I use for when I am in a hurry and can&#x27;t do a DE wet shave, and that cuts a bit closer than this blade.</li>
<li> So, instead of holding them so you are pushing them turn them over and drag them over whatever you&#x27;re clipping.  </li>
<li> you may need your t outliners around ears but very non irritating for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> two wide for tight spaces and doesn&#x27;t hit hard enough for the jawline.</li>
<li> /&gt;Although it cuts shorter than my 00000 blade from Oster, it is not worth the hassle.</li>
<li> I could consolidate my two unit setup of an Andis BGRV and Andis Outliner II down to just the BGRV by using detatchable blades.</li>
<li> I like it, because I can take the hair on my husband&#x27;s head down to almost nothing.  </li>
<li> Plus you have to pay attention to the direction you move it in while cutting hair as it will slide right over hair if you follow the grain.</li>
<li> less than .1mm length.</li>
<li> this bad boy was slapped on my extremely powerful wahl rapidfires.by the way u have to get the rapid fire extremely</li>
<li> The blade seems to be a little sticky, even after lubricating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Very close cutting i like it</li>
<li> however ceramic blades are not available in this size.</li>
<li> The cut is not as close as the Outliner II with a Promate blade and it is too wide when shaving around the jawbone and behind the ears, etc.</li>
<li> The blade was dull when i received  it.</li>
<li> And right away I must say I am very disappointed.</li>
<li> there is either real stupidity on the sellers part, or bad intentions as the seller just has too many outliners</li>
<li> I assumed the thumbnail image in the order fulfillment part of the cart was wrong.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll try it out, but disappointing in that  </li>
<li> But don&#x27;t misunderstand what I said the product isn&#x27;t bad,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> *****this blade will not hit as hard or as crisp as your outliners*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this blade is irreplaceable for two things .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number one: slap them on either an Oster Octane or BGR+ cordless detachable...preferably an octane and you will provide the best shape up lines across the forehead and neckline known to man. Straight and perfect every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slightly wider size blade just gives and easy straight line up that cannot be beat. Follow up with your straight razor and youve got perfect, crisp lines fast. Saves me a lot of time every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number two on kids. the set back is perfect you may need your t outliners around ears but very non irritating for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not useful for lining up beards...two wide for tight spaces and doesn&#x27;t hit hard enough for the jawline.</li>
    <li> I shave my head daily and this cuts closer than any blade I could find by Oster.  I think the shortest Oster is a 000 or 0000 and this cuts much closer.  The issue is that its made of thinner material and seems to be less sturdy in general, though its also a bit more inexpensive I think. Maybe this isn&#x27;t an issue; time will tell.  Its been fine so far after a month or so of daily use.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. This blade is okay, I would recommend just staying with 00000, unless you have this one sharpened</li>
    <li> The blade was dull when i received  it. It looked as if it was a used blade instead of a new one.</li>
    <li> This baby cuts it short.  I can get away with not using the Bic method.  I still cut my hair once a week, but this keeps my military cut extra short.</li>
    <li> If your growth is more than two weeks then first use the .5 mm blade, bring it to a stuble, and then use this to get the close look.  It would not become like a shaver, a shaver will be smooth like butter, here, it is like the next best thing if you have any reason at all to not use shaver, and there are plenty of good reasons.  Whether this is good for African American facial shaving, I do not know. I wish you luck there, I can only guess at it being pain in having ingrown hairs. My sympathy.  I&#x27;ve looked around to find the closest detachable blade that would fit the Oster 76 and this Andis .1mm is what I found, which Oster does not provide. If there are other brands that offer a .1mm blade that would also fit the Oster 76, this I do not know. If there are any detachable blades that are closer than .1mm, I do not know. Please let me know if you find any detachable blade that is less than .1mm length.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for crisp lines, stick to outliners that you can manipulate as the fix blade on this item cannot do a real crisp line</li>
    <li> This is a great blade, it really comes about as close as you could get to a razor shave without actually busting out the razor.&lt;br /&gt;I can do my entire neck with it comfortably and it looks like a pretty recent razor job.  That&#x27;s no simple task.  For anywhere you want to clear hair down to nothing, get high contrast lines, etc, this is the blade for it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a blade that cuts SHORT this is it! I use it weekly to achieve an almost skin bald shave with out having to use a razor blade. The only downside is that this blade can get hot unlike the ceramic blades. however ceramic blades are not available in this size. Highly recommend this blade if your are looking for the closest shave possible.</li>
    <li> Amazing and cut almost like a razor .</li>
    <li> The blade worked right out of the box no need to adjust the blade and it cut skin close. A great product out of the box.</li>
    <li> I like to shave my head but razors really irritate me so I decided on this and glad I did. It cuts very close to about somewhat of a days growth. If you have longer hair naturally use a higher # blade and then finish off with this blade. It&#x27;s the closest you&#x27;re going to get to a razor shave with a clipper. A good strategy for me is to frequently brush off the clipper blade during cutting to ensure a better cut. Keep your blades clean and well oiled and they will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> this bad boy was slapped on my extremely powerful wahl rapidfires.by the way u have to get the rapid fire extremely powerful.a little bit more powerful than oster 76.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways this detatcheable blade saved me from using the 5 star balding clippers and my trimmers.now to bald out any fades i just slap this on my wahl rapidfires and BAM quick fast cut like butter</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these over the last decade and they work very well. No problems so far. I replace my blades every year.</li>
    <li> The item I bought was a andis outliner detachable blade, the item they sent me was a outliner 2 blade. Which was not detachable. It&#x27;s almost as if they wanted to trick me, like I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. I demanded a refund and for them to pay for the shipping back. I will never buy from this seller again. But don&#x27;t misunderstand what I said the product isn&#x27;t bad, In fact I haven&#x27;t even used it, it&#x27;s just the seller.</li>
    <li> Very close cutting i like it</li>
    <li> I like it, because I can take the hair on my husband&#x27;s head down to almost nothing.  He likes it like that!  I can also trim around his beard.</li>
    <li> This rating is due to the seller&#x27;s ineptness, and has nothing to do with the product which is as good as anything else Andis makes (I Expect...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictured in the primary add is the trimmer blade, but when you check out the cart shows an image of the outliner, but the part number and originating page indicate the trimmer blade so I bought it anyways. Of course what i received was the outliner blade. I assumed the thumbnail image in the order fulfillment part of the cart was wrong. Instead, it is the seller that is lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the hassle of returning it, I don&#x27;t know what the difference between the outliner and the trimmer are so I&#x27;ll try it out, but disappointing in that  there is either real stupidity on the sellers part, or bad intentions as the seller just has too many outliners and he wants to get rid of them even if that&#x27;s not what the customer ordered, knowing that the customer will be disinclined to return the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you like shopping from crapshoot sellers, I recommend you order your blades elsewhere.</li>
    <li> For years, I used a 00000 blade with my Classic 76, thinking that it was the closest to the skin I could go, short of shaving with a razor.  This blade cuts shorter!  It basically feels like a two day stubble.  My new favorite.</li>
    <li> Keeps my head shaved without the irritation of a straight razor. Works with my Andis shaver very welll and easily swaps for another blade/blade length if needed</li>
    <li> These work ok, but I find that they are much too cumbersome to use in place of edge clippers such as the Andis &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; outliners.</li>
    <li> This blade cuts as short as any I have found but it gets very warm very fast and tends to &#x27;skip&#x27; no matter what speed or angle I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I normally use them with the face of the blade touching my head and I push them across my scalp.  I found that the &#x27;skipping&#x27; is pretty much eliminated by turning the clippers 180 degrees and pulling them.  So, instead of holding them so you are pushing them turn them over and drag them over whatever you&#x27;re clipping.  It might not work if you&#x27;re clipping somewhere sensitive but it worked great trimming my head.</li>
    <li> This blade really gets close, its just like shaving, but without the use of a razor. I highly recommend this product. Just remember before you use your blade for the first time,run it through some type of blade wash solvent to get factory protective film off. That way you get the best cut possible.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use in my oster 76 and it works very well. It definitely isn&#x27;t razor close, I&#x27;d say it cuts to what would be just under a days growth for me. I have a cheaper electric razor that I use for when I am in a hurry and can&#x27;t do a DE wet shave, and that cuts a bit closer than this blade. I still recommend this blade for trimming around your ears or where you need it close, but can&#x27;t do(or don&#x27;t want) razor close.</li>
    <li> For those who want the closest clip possible, this is supposedly the &amp;#34;000000&amp;#34; blade. I didn&#x27;t think it was that much closer of a shave than the &amp;#34;00000&amp;#34; blade, but it was indeed better, and any additional closeness is good. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> The Ultraedge Trimmer Blade was good but did not preform as expected based on the previous reviews. However it was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I could consolidate my two unit setup of an Andis BGRV and Andis Outliner II down to just the BGRV by using detatchable blades. Not the case. The cut is not as close as the Outliner II with a Promate blade and it is too wide when shaving around the jawbone and behind the ears, etc. Ill be using the Outliner II for this since it is smaller and more agile.</li>
    <li> Blade is sharp and ready to use. Cuts very close and does not scrap or scratch the skin. I will buy another.</li>
    <li> Works great on Andis clippers on a human head.</li>
    <li> Good for a clean close fade and no bumps.  Not like the T-Trimmer but just as good on the cutting.</li>
    <li> I had hoped I could easily use it to keep my entire head shaved but it really isn&#x27;t meant for that.  I have to use a #00000 (.2mm) blade first and then I can go back over with the .1mm blade.  It isn&#x27;t the blades fault just my own over-optimistic attitude.  If you use this with hair that is longer than .2mm it ends up clogging a lot. Plus you have to pay attention to the direction you move it in while cutting hair as it will slide right over hair if you follow the grain.</li>
    <li> I recieved my trimmer blade . And right away I must say I am very disappointed. The blade is not made correctly as it has a crooked lip in it</li>
    <li> The blade seems to be a little sticky, even after lubricating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it cuts shorter than my 00000 blade from Oster, it is not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Metal blade it is not ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;My fault, quick delivery otherwise fine.</li>
    <li> I use this blade with the Andis 64850 Clippers. The cut is close to razor clean just without the irritation and ingrown hairs. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It works well. It cuts close and accurately. Good product. It got here very quickly and I am happy with it</li>
