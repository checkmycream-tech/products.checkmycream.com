<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that the 15x magnification is not worth having, it takes space and is not good, overall I think is a good mirror</li>
    <li> Beware of the directions for mounting.  They were incorrect on my unit.  All still fully functional and all but had to call the company to get direction on how to mount.</li>
    <li> I had a couple small issues with installing the mirror. I didn&#x27;t have drill bits that fit the size of the anchors included, and couldn&#x27;t find any at Home Depot, so ended up buying new screws and anchors to use instead of what came with. Not a big deal, but an inconvenience even so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of lining up the holes for the mount instead of making sure the hinge itself is perfectly lined up on the wall. Rookie mistake, since I should have known the holes weren&#x27;t exactly lined up with the hinge. So now the arm of my mirror isn&#x27;t exactly parallel to the tile line below it. No one but me will ever see that, but I see it every time I use the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the mirror itself is exactly what I need to see all the gory details when applying make-up.</li>
    <li> Mirror is good for make up.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality. The 10X and 15X magnifications are just what I needed. As a suggestion to Jerdon, it would be nice to see a split mirror with those magnifications, rather than a mirror on mirror. I&#x27;d love to see a larger 15X magnification area. Quick ship. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I wanted and well worth the money. I put it up in my bathroom and it is very convienient with it&#x27;s swivel arm. Makes it very easy to pluck eyebrows and the extra 15x magnification for those hard to see spots. If looking for a wall mount mirror that would work in any room this is perfect.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this a lot.  The construction is hollow tube, so it&#x27;s lighter than I&#x27;d like. However, it is solid and works well.  I&#x27;m also not as happy with their wall mount, but it does the job.  It&#x27;s difficult to get it flush against the wall, however.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; on one side is annoying. Wife doesn&#x27;t like it because of that.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and nice looking.</li>
    <li> I bought these two mirrors to help me park in a narrow space in my garage. This was AFTER I&#x27;d hit and crumpled the side of my brand NEW car. Now, I can relax and depend on those mirrors to help me park. It&#x27;s such a huge relief!!!</li>
    <li> I am 53 years old, and just recently, I have had trouble seeing my eyelashes to put my mascara on.  This mirror is very nice-looking, was easy to mount on the wall, and makes my life so much easier.  I can once again see my eyelashes without squinting, and my mascara goes on in half the time it was taking me.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and is what I wanted; although the little mirror placed on the big mirror is a little annoying while doing makeup - it is useful while tweezing eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I used one of these mirrors at a hotel and loved it. This price was much cheeper than any place I looked. It also looks great in my dressing room. Higly recomend.</li>
    <li> I really like the mirror. I think it would be better if the 15X circle was not so big. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, great quality.</li>
    <li> It does not move very smoothly, and it makes horrible squeaking noises when it is swiveled.  It is adequate, and has a nice finish, but is not commercial grade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a contact lenses and reading glass wearer. Needed to be able to see to put on my make up. Good size mirror and great magnification.</li>
    <li> WOULD BE A BETTER PRODUCT IF THE MAGNIFICATION WAS REDUCED. BUT OVERALL OK AND HIGH MARKS. WOULD RECOMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT REGARDLESS.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for at a  very reasonable price.  It works exactly as I hoped and the mounting went smoothly.  While it&#x27;s pretty scary to see myself magnified this much, it is extremely helpful to tweeze and put on make-up.  Love it.</li>
    <li> What a nice mirror.  Worked wonderfully for me.  Size is perfect.  Arms go exactly where I want them.  Mirrors are quality and all as advertised.  Very, very pleased with this mirror ... especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to purchase on of these mirrors for my private bathroom.  With my eyesight getting worse, I was trying to put my makeup on and pluck with a mirror 2 feet away.  I use the little inset occasionally, and it doesn&#x27;t get in my way. And now I have two hands to put on my eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Purchased this during a bathroom remodel. Had my contractor install it and I love it! I only wish it lighted up....omg then it&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
    <li> The enlargement mirror is hard to get a focus point in.</li>
    <li> This is a must have in my bathroom.....after years of propping up a smaller  10x mirror , this is a real bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I love having a larger mirror and the image is &#x27;truer&#x27; than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It also folds flat very nicely against the wall when not in use.The only negative is that the 15x &#x27;spot&#x27;  mirror sometimes gets in the way, but I can easily adjust the slant of the mirror.  Overall, it&#x27;s been an excellent buy!</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for. no issues with process or product. would order again</li>
    <li> Love this mirror and it was a very good price.  I had no problem installing it on my bathroom wall.</li>
    <li> Works fine but small circle is always in the way.</li>
    <li> Did not come with hardware to mount which was supposed to be included</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Margaret Speer, Jack&#x27;s wife. I&#x27;ve been using a magnified mirror for many years (I&#x27;m 73 years old), I work in a professional setting and need to be professionally made up. This is the best mirror I&#x27;ve used. The small ultra magnified circle is especially helpful for eye makeup. I highly recommended this mirror.</li>
    <li> Next time I would order this without the 15 x  magnified little mirror on the 10x side. Other wise this is great for tweezing.</li>
    <li> Very happy with item purchased.  Delivered as advertised performance.  Will likely purchase other items in the future through Amazon</li>
    <li> great quality. I like how there are no screws to get loose on the sides of mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Properly mounted, it is just like being in a 5 star hotel.</li>
    <li> Mirror came quickly, packaged well and appears to be a quality product (I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to truly know, but I really like it so far!).</li>
    <li> the 15x seems to take up the whole mirror.  Also, 10x just seemed to be too much for me.  I exchanged it for the 5x and am very happy with that.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mirror!  I love how it pulls out from the wall and then stores flat against the wall when not in use. Exactly what I needed for putting on makeup and tweezing eyebrows :-)&lt;br /&gt;Great magnification. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Easy to mount, well made Momma very happy!</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  It is very sturdy and is a great item for old eyes.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a new bathroom - it was exactly as described and installed easily -- looks great and magnifies as expected.</li>
    <li> Great  is perfect for my bathroom. Beautiful look for the bathroom and works well to tweeze eyebrows. Also great for makeup</li>
    <li> What an excellent makeup mirror !!  So simple to install and looks like a million bucks on the wall.  My wife just loves it !!</li>
    <li> Nice looking, quality materials and does what it needs to. Came quick, packaged nicely, swivels nicely and stretches out far enough from wall to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror for me. Don&#x27;t have to bend over. It magnifies very well and can be folded back out of the way.</li>
    <li> I need the 15X and the little round circle is the only area that is 15X. I has one before made by this same company and I loved it!</li>
    <li> I got it on time and but when I opened the box the small glass piece had already fallen off. I went ahead and super glued it back. I had a hard time mounting it to the wall, I stripped a few screws but other than that I use it often. I didn&#x27;t really use the small magnified glass at all but the other magnified side I use all the time. Love it</li>
    <li> I like this mirror. I needed something that I could get close up to since my vanity mirror is so far back. I wish it mounted a little better to the wall. The wall anchors it came with were junk and we had to use other ones we have which didn&#x27;t mount flush and the mount is a little wobbly.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice swing-out makeup mirror and it looks great on the wall.  However the installation instructions weren&#x27;t accurate and I had a struggle installing it using the provided hardware which was lightweight.  I ended up using stronger screws with small washers and attaching it directly to the wall stud to really anchor it.  Plus the holes for the wall plate&#x27;s set screws were cocked, so I had to adjust the bracket behind it to make the mirror horizontal. It took some patience and some help from my wife, but all is good now.</li>
    <li> I always like the magnifying mirrors I used in finer hotels, I finally bought one, wondered why I waited so many years, it was easy to buy and low cost, I am glad I finally got one.  I installed it myself, very easy, 3 screws to the wall, I am not a handyman, even easy task seem daunting to me, but this was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 10x-15x mirror, paid extra for the best.  After using it for a couple weeks, I realized maybe a lower power mirror could work just as well or better.  Somehow I found the 10x-15x magnifying powers to be a bit overwhelming.  I rather have a lighted mirror, but the task of digging holes in the wall for the wiring is just too much for me, hiring a worker for that would cost hundreds more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good solid metal quality, a good choice.</li>
    <li> Worked great, good magnification. Strong bracket. It arrived when promised. The product is as described. i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The mirror is just what I need and the magnification is amazing, although I would like to see the arm extend a bit further than it does.</li>
    <li> It is too hard to see in the medium magnification mirror because the hyper magnification circle is in the way. I would recommend going to the store and trying them out.</li>
    <li> Solidly built, easy to mount, excellent functionality.  Having three magnification levels is really helpful depending on what you are doing.  It takes some time to get used to the focal length at high magnification but that does not reflect on the mirror but on the reality of optics.  Seeing your face at 15X is an amazing (not always great) experience.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent product and seller.</li>
    <li> Wife just loves it! She could not due with our it, matches our bathroom hardware also.</li>
    <li> This product has a good design. It is attractive and well built. The magnification is excellent. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> wish it had lights but good quality</li>
    <li> Finally, just like in a nice hotel room, I can put my make-up on without a hassle.  I don&#x27;t have to bend in to a medicine cabinet, I can just stand there and adjust the mirror to the angle I feel more comfortable putting my make-up on.  The little 15X is good for a close-up for plucking, etc.</li>
    <li> I needed a good 10X &amp; 15X mirror, I saw this one and decided to give it a try because of the price. It is great!  It&#x27;s hanging on the wall in the bathroom near the light and it makes putting my makeup on so much EASIER!  If you&#x27;re looking for a good mirror, this one is it!</li>
    <li> Received my mirror and it looks nice but the mounting hardware is TERRIBLE.  The instructions say to use the mounting bracket as a template.  But the set screws for attachment of the bracket to the mirror were already in and were VERY tight.  So tight they stripped out even though I use the correctly size phillips screwdriver (I guess they were made of cheap metal and could not take the torque needed to loosen them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions also note that you should probably mount the mirror 58-inches off the wall and then say to use a bracket as a template.  What they do not say is that the bracket needs to be about a foot below this for the mirror to sit at 58-inches.  The anchors are also non-standard and now that I have mounted the mirror too high and need to move it lower, there are now two non-removable anchors that cannot be easily speckled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service and after it rang for a while it answered and immediately said &#x27;Thank you for your call&#x27; and immediately hung up.  It may be a nice mirror but if you can&#x27;t get it mounted it is pretty much a worthless purchase...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She needs a lot of magnification in order to do her makeup. She loves it and it looks really pretty and sophisticated in her bathroom.</li>
    <li> See all your wrinkles, but also all your makeup so no mistakes. Essential, if shocking.</li>
    <li> It gives me 3 ways of checking makeup - regular, zoom at 10x and zoom at 15x..................awesome for any bathroom addition.</li>
    <li> The mirror is heavy and nice quality.  I found the small 15x mirror on the larger mirror to be distracting.  I sent it back and purchased the Jerdon 8x mag..</li>
    <li> Love love love this mirror. Nice quality.  Very easy to mount but doesn&#x27;t come with any mounting screws or toggle bolts.  We used wood screws mounted directly into a stud...works a treat.</li>
    <li> very nice - distortion free</li>
    <li> Great addition to my bathroom for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift but yowza, who needs to see their pores this large and in charge?  It definitely works as advertised and looks well made (not cheap plastic or fake paint).  The mirror is good quality and as mentioned the magnification is quite high.  It&#x27;s rather easy to attach to the wall and the swivel joints allow for snake like movement to get it in the right position.</li>
    <li> returning as this type of mirror needs to be lit.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a mirror like the mirrors in the hotels.  It&#x27;s perfect and just what I expected.</li>
    <li> The missed 1 star reflects the fact that SUCH products do need professional installation.  I am handy, but turned out was not handy enough to install it \\&quot;just right\\&quot; (as I kept aligning with a stud).  Handyman found the new-tech fancy heavy-load bearing sheet-rock anchors (they look like super fat screws) and use them to place this heavy mirror at the right place.  Its been a couple of months now and with the bright vanity lights on, I hear that this product is doing its job well!  My wife has not been able to find another product at local stores that can adjust in so many directions</li>
    <li> Ok. Could use XX MORE</li>
    <li> For the last five years, had been using small suction style magnifiers, which fell off and broke when seasonal temperatures changed. The last one that fell caused the mirror to separate from the base unit. It was still intact, but needed to be glued back on. Which glue could be used? Most glues would remove the silver backing. Online research revealed that Liquid Nails had a mirror glue, which Amazon sells for under $10. Decided not to bother. Instead, decided to finally put in the extra money and get this wall mounted mirror. LOVE IT! Looks great in the bathroom, and makes a big difference to aging eyes! Totally pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror, we saw things in our skin we had never seen before with the magnification! This will be very useful for putting on makeup and eyebrow tweezing. I have zero DIY skills and was able to install it easily. You just have to unscrew the mounting bracket from the mirror and attach it to the wall then reattach the mirror to it.  It feels pretty solid too. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> When attached to the wall the arm is not long enough to see in the mirror over a counter.  So it is useless.</li>
    <li> Fits the need just great!  Well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for hotel quality double mirror for my bathroom and when I saw Jerdon&#x27;s model, I had to order it. I love the mirror - it is very helpful in applying makeup or just simply flossing. The little 15x magnification is very helpful although 10x is sufficient enough for me. I like that it doesn&#x27;t get foggy after the shower. This mirror was easy to install - took my husband about 10 minutes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new wall mount mirror.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one of these handy things!  I&#x27;m 62 years-old and need my magnifying mirror every day!  This makes it so much more convenient!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought two, easy to install and are great.  I wish the 15x magnification was not mounted directly on the mirror unless you wanted it. (needs to be an option you can add yourself or not) It is just a bit too much, otherwise the product is worth purchasing.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, a great help putting on her make up!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It is just the right size to see your whole face magnified 10x.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the smaller 30x mirror was on the other side of the mirror.  It gets in the way more then it helps. I&#x27;ve learned to look around it, and really love how well I can see when tweezing or applying make-up.  Other then that one small problem, I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I think the magnification is a little much unless you really need it.  It requires me to be very close to the mirror in order to use it.  I had one at my last home that had a magnification of 5 and liked that better.  I thought the greater magnification would help more but it is much harder to use.  Perhaps I will get used to it and like it but right now I would order one with less magnification.</li>
    <li> Since I started to use reading glasses, I wanted something in my bathroom that had a closer view of my eyes, etc to do my make up.  This wall mounted mirror is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t take away counter space and needs no plug in.  Just be sure you have it in an area with sufficient light, since this mirror doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Can easily see to put on makeup.</li>
    <li> Moves nicely and the small magnifier is great for finding eye brow hair.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great mirror</li>
    <li> Great for close up work.</li>
    <li> I wanted the one w/the light but I really ended up not needing it because of the lights in my bathroom.  I Love That I can watch as I dry the back of my hair to make sure I don&#x27;t leave holes.😀 but the thing I&#x27;m using more than I thought is the INCREDIBLE magnifying side!  I have to admit-it was quite a shock to see what I really look like, all the wrinkles &amp; sun damage! Ouch! But I can apply my makeup to near perfection!  Can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. Good quality, just as depicted</li>
    <li> Finally I can see my eyelashes to put my mascara on!  Very nice quality, looks great in my bathroom! I would recommend to my friends and family for sure.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for a very sturdy mirror to put up on the wall by the window.  I am using it to apply my makeup in the morning.  It is wonderful...I feel like I am in a hotel AND now I can see what I am doing very clearly!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I saw this type of mirror by accident while shopping. Then I remembered that my wife had this small mirror stuck to our bathroom mirror that she used. Ever so often it would fall off. I was glad it was not glass. It caused her to lean over the sink trying to get closer to the mirror. Santa surprised her with this new one, I mounted the next day. She used it shortly before going out and came to me with a smile and said she loved it. When the wife is happy the household is happy, if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Although it is apparently a well made item, at 10x magnification, it&#x27;s useless unless one is practically within 1 inch of the mirror. It&#x27;s just way too strong. The spot makes it even worse. Sending it back and ordering 5X or 7X magnification.</li>
    <li> Mounted easy.  Only problem - remember to mount it low enough for younger and shorter members of the family.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mirror.  I looked for ever to find something that had 3 levels of magnification and would extend properly from the wall. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This mirror is nice quality. It was easy to install and does exactly what I need. I like the additional 15X smaller area. I put it up in the bathroom so I can use it to put on makeup and then push it back to store behind the door.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a little more flimsy than I thought. The magnification may actually to too much.  I have not decided if I will hang it or not.</li>
    <li> I have only one eye and it helps to have the magnify thingsI now can take off my glasses and still see something love it.  first got my first chance to use it when we were on vacation in Aruba the place we were at had them in the rooms loved it so when got home looked one up on line.</li>
    <li> It is a bit heavy, but is a really nice looking mirror. It has more magnification in the large magnified part then others, so is a higher quality for that good magnification. You need to secure it good on the wall due to its weight. It also arrived in good time.</li>
    <li> Really nice extendable mirror that helps when plucking out those unruly hairs..the magnifier really brings the objects in close. I&#x27;d buy this product again for sure.</li>
    <li> great mirror.  Stainless steel mounting screws are soft and deform easily.</li>
    <li> Perfect. This was exactly what I was looking for. I was a little concerned about the small magnification mirror but it&#x27;s not in the way.</li>
    <li> I love it, but if you have a problem seeing. It&#x27;s a little hard to see without a light.&lt;br /&gt;A normal eye seeing person would have no problem</li>
    <li> Easy to install and great to use.</li>
    <li> This was Broken when taken out of the box. The small mirror fell out. Little super glue and back in business. May want to check this out though.</li>
    <li> this would of been a great mirror but the magnifying part came not glued to mirror and was broken I was very dissapointed</li>
    <li> 10x mirrors are hard to find.  The clarity of the mirror is great.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Magnification is much too great for everyday needs.</li>
    <li> good quality excellent magnification easy to install</li>
    <li> loved it mounted it in my bath</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mirror with magnification since the ole eyes aren&#x27;t what they use to be...THIS is IT! it not only a regular mirror on one side but 2 different mag. on the other!  Mounting was super easy and its all ready to go. I LOVE this plus it matches all my nickel finish in my bathroom. A little Pricey?  yes but I am worth it and so are YOU!</li>
    <li> Not sure what other negative reviews are talking about when it comes to seeing through the 15x magnification other than maybe your eye site being worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great and only wish the arm was a bit longer. I would recommend it to anyone needing additional magnification!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror because it is not electrofied and I don&#x27;t have to use an outlet on my sink. I also am very pleased with the high magnification of the mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually leave my electrofied mirrors in the houses when we move which I won&#x27;t do now.</li>
    <li> The first mirror I received came broken (the glass), so I contacted Amazon and the return was easy.  I got my money back&lt;br /&gt;and a new mirror at no cost. The return was free too.  I also got my replacement quickly and unbroken.  My husband put it up for me in place of a similar mirror that had become wobbly.  The mirror is very well made and sturdy. The mechanisms to&lt;br /&gt;move it around are smooth and easy, if not slightly stiff at first. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that the lower, smaller mirror of higher magnification is very distracting.  It is hard to see what you are doing in an overall way with that thing in the way.  And I find the magnification of the lower mirror not much different than the larger portion, thus making it extraneous and a big nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;The only reasons I got this particular mirror are the price (reasonable compared to the others), the 10X magnification, and the&lt;br /&gt;fact that it appeared well made.</li>
    <li> Came as expected . mounting was easy, the smaller mirror on the inside is very distorted but the larger is okay. I tried to find a mirror with this strength but  could not find one without the smaller stronger mirror. The price was right but the quality of the smaller mirror is not worth the aggravation.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to order this mirror??? Love the ease of pulling it out at different angles and then putting it back against the wall out of the way. Perfect makeup mirror. Good quality optics  and nice finish.</li>
    <li> Attractive looking mirror but defective.  The extension arms did not work so it had to be returned at my expense.  Didn&#x27;t appreciate that either.  Took a long time to receive it only to have to return it.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice mirror that I hung in my bathroom, it shows me all of my wrinkles up close, and is so magnified that for a woman it shows me when I need to go have eyebrows , mustache and beard waxed if you know what iM saying.</li>
    <li> For those of us who can&#x27;t see up close, this is great!  Would highly recommend this to all seniors who have trouble seeing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with your Jerdon JP7510N Swivel Wall Mount Mirror.  The only thing I was disappointed  with and didn&#x27;t realize it&lt;br /&gt;came with the little tiny mirror in the middle of the 10x mirror.  When I&#x27;m trying to put on my makeup, I have to adjust it so I can&lt;br /&gt;put on my eye makeup without the little mirror in my way.  Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Like another poster on this product, I too got the 15X mirror loose in the box ... I believe this mirror WASN&#x27;T supposed to be loose. In my case it scratched up the 10X slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Also the mirrors aren&#x27;t glass and looking at this product made me think I can find something better.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived damaged, but I wouldn&#x27;t have liked it because the small extra-magnified circle makes it hard to use the larger mirror.  Great idea, but tough to execute as one piece I think.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for us. With the price of anything for vanity going sky high, this was a great buy, and less expensive than other mirrors.</li>
    <li> GREAT MIRROR, Easy to Mount and Use.  Some reviewers are saying they hired someone to install this mirror. I am an \\&quot;old\\&quot; lady and I installed it myself.[[ASIN:B0051IB6OA TOGGLER SnapSkru SPM Mini Self-Drilling Drywall Anchor with Screws, Glass-Filled Nylon, Made in US, For #6 to #8 Fastener Sizes (Pack of 25)]]&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations for installation.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Purchase self drilling drywall anchors http://www.amazon.com/TOGGLER-SnapSkru-Self-Drilling-Glass-Filled-Fastener/dp/B0051IALCI  this link takes you to 50 for $11.75 on Amazon, they are wonderful for hanging anything 65 lbs. or less on drywall. You can buy smaller packages for less money. They are also available at your local hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  If you have the option of installing on the opposite side of your dominate hand, I would recommend it. The arm on the mirror is long enough, but if someone with long arms is using it they might occasionally appreciate the extra elbow room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Some reviewers are saying the magnification side of the mirror is blurry. You need to be able to adjust how near or far your face is from the mirror. For that reason, I recommend that you mount it on the wall at the \\&quot;outer\\&quot; edge of your vanity, not along the back of the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Hold the mirror and look into it so you can figure out what height works best for you, then mark it on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  On the sides of the round plate are two tiny \\&quot;set screws\\&quot;, remove them so you can remove the \\&quot;mounting plate\\&quot;. Hold the mounting plate up to the marks on your wall and mark the two screw holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Hold up screw from the Anchor.  Choose a drill bit the size of the shank of the screw, but smaller than the threads of the screw. Drill a hole into your drywall. (If you hit a wall stud, you don&#x27;t need the drywall anchor, simply use a screw) After drilling the hole, use a hand held screw driver to screw the anchor into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Place the mirror mounting plate over the anchors you have installed aligning the holes and add the screws.  Then place the mirror over the mounting plate and install the set screws you removed earlier.  Easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST TIP.  Some reviewers complained that the 15X magnifying mirror was in the wrong place (at the top or at the bottom). If you need it to be lower or higher, simply flip the mirror from top to bottom, then flip it from left to right and presto....it has shifted lower or higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these tips may seem simple to you, but they would have saved a lot of reviewers money not having to pay someone to install the mirror and also helped others who were complaining about the placement of the 15X mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS MIRROR.  Plan to buy a second one for the guest bath soon. Wish I had bought this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for Jerdon, the Seller of this product and did \\&quot;not\\&quot; receive this product for testing and to review. This is a totally unbiased review.  Hope it helps you.ews.  Then place the mirror over the mounting plate and install the set screws you removed earlier.  Easy    LAST TIP.

    <li> This item is just what I was looking for!  Great for hands free magnification in the bathroom!  The magnification is so good you can even see your pores!  You wont be disappointed with this item!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this mirror and it arrived with the 15X insert mirror popped out, which allowed it to slide around the larger mirror during warehousing/shipping.  That left a few scratches on the larger mirror.  Too much hassle to return it, so I used rubber cement and glued it back in.  I own two of these mirrors and simply wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife who needed a mirror in our bathroom for when she puts her makeup on.  I installed it easily and it seems very sturdy. The only thing I wish is that it had a light, but oh well.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Easy install and I can see things I really didn&#x27;t want to see on my face! Great mirror and I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> This mirror is fantastic, although it does show everything is great detail - the good and the bad news. But it makes applying makeup very easy and it was easy to install in my bathroom. It can be pulled out or put away very easily. I love it! Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Finally, I can see my face up close.  The little special mirror in the bottom middle is a bit in the way, but shouldn&#x27;t deter anyone from getting this great visual aid.</li>
    <li> Mirror was a great addition to my bathroom and didn&#x27;t take away from the appearance.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This replaced a similar model (oval shaped) from another company that rusted after a few years. It really looks and works well.</li>
    <li> ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WELL PACKAGED. COULDN&#x27;T FIND THIS PRODUCT IN THE LOCAL STORES-GLAD AMAZON.COM HAD WHAT I NEEDED! WILL BE ABLE TO PUT MY MAKE-UP ON WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS NOW!</li>
    <li> easy install- used for seeing back of my head  , and for those close up mirror checks- without glasses</li>
    <li> Mirror works fine.  The screws to put it on the wall, however, were not adequate and my husband had to use others.  But, enjoy the convenience of having the wall-mount mirror.  Is nice to be able to get directly in front of the mirror while applying makeup and to be able to use both hands, if necessary.  Is much better than having to use a hand-held mirror.  Would recommend this item.  Not sure the small circular magnifier is necessary.  It does get in the way sometimes.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror set. It&#x27;s a little less sturdy than my laast one, but the magnification is great.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this product can come with small mirror (15x) loose in pkg.  Mine had no contact with adhesive. Seemed easier to glue than to return, but I was not happy with that kind of quality.</li>
