      <li>Being used to carry important pill and using cell phone for the alarm!!</li>
      <li>It was what I wanted, handy and nice size,  but stopped working after a week or so.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>In our case, the patient was sure that she could manage her own medications, so I (the caregiver) agreed to a trial run.  </li>
      <li>They are very cheaply made but I continue to buy them to help my husband remember his pills.</li>
      <li>READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY, IT IS ACCURATE TO THE LETTER!  </li>
      <li>, I am very much satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>and I have so many</li>
      <li>I am so glad you carry them.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>and so things are running much more smoothly.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and gives a 10 minute warning and a 5 minute warning.  </li>
      <li>I now wear the alarm timer or have it where I can hear easily and it has created a huge change in our relationship</li>
      <li>It works fine, when I need another one or anything else I will know where to look.  </li>
      <li>and I wish it was a light color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very handy to keep in pocket &amp; be reminded with a timer when it is time to take the next pill.</li>
      <li>They have changed it somewhat and it remains to be seen if it will be as functional as the original purchase.</li>
      <li>I was excited about this product until I received it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this two years  ago and have certainly gotten my money&#x27;s worth considering how many times I use it a day.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Like any pill box it gets kind of yucky after a year or so of sticking your hands in it multiple times a day</li>
      <li>The case is easy to open and close, the numbers easy to read, and the timer gives you a 10 minute and a 5 minute warning.</li>
      <li>threw it right in the trash.</li>
      <li>The pill container is very large so if you take a lot of pills, it will accommodate them.  </li>

      <li>sure enough one had an alarm that didn&#x27;t sound, only the light worked.  </li>
      <li>It does take some dexterity and old people sometimes don&#x27;t have fine motor skills.  </li>
      <li>The Fashion Pill Box with single timer alarm, is GREAT,conveinent and easy to use, fits comfortably in ones pocket,purse or any where you wish to keep it.</li>
      <li>; leads you to expect you&#x27;ll be able to set it to remind you to take a pill once a day, &amp;#34;same time, same station.&amp;#34;  But that is NOT the case!  </li>
      <li>Easy to understand instructions,  simple and not overly dressed up with unneeded functions.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than I expected for the price.  </li>
      <li>This timer seems to work well and should be very helpful in spacing my pills every 3 hours.</li>
      <li>Large enough for several pills when i need to carry more.  </li>
      <li>Light to carry and battery lasts for long time.</li>
      <li>I can hear the sound of the timer even when it is in my closed purse</li>
      <li>If I could remember to set it to remind me to take a pill 20 hours or less from now, chances are pretty much in favor of me not needing this cockamamy timer in the first place!  </li>
      <li>Still haven&#x27;t bought a new battery to find out if the device works.</li>
      <li>that because of the sliding action it is harder to put very large pills in</li>
      <li>Great for Senior Citizens who may be a little forgettful and small enough to travel with you all day.</li>
      <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product it has done me well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small so will fit in your pocket</li>
      <li>I have recommended this to other professionals like nurses, hygienists etc., and have had some positive feedback.</li>
      <li>Carry well and alarm is loud enough to get their attention.</li>
      <li>One of its drawbacks is, obviously, numerous medications, nearly all of which must be taken at different times of the day.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Early warning&amp;#34; single beeps allow for avoidance of the main constant beeper if in meetings, movies, etc.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Two years ago I didn&#x27;t take any medicine at all, now I take 22 pills over a 10 hour period everyday. I bought this two years  ago and have certainly gotten my money&#x27;s worth considering how many times I use it a day. The only drawback that I have come across is  that because of the sliding action it is harder to put very large pills in and I have so many I end up having to dump them out in my hand to pick out the one I need next. Like any pill box it gets kind of yucky after a year or so of sticking your hands in it multiple times a day and I did screw it up for a couple of days by washing it, my bad. But when it dried out it worked still. Overall I would highly recommend this product it has done me well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pill box for years!  I have tried other boxes but none has met my expectations.  The Fashion Pill Box with Single Alarm Timer let&#x27;s me know when it&#x27;s time to take my medicine - something I kept missing. before I found this wonderful box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It meets my needs perfectly and it is easy and unobtrusive to carry everywhere and actually it turns into a conversation piece in a gathering.</li>
    <li> THE DESCRIPTION WAS NOT ACCURATE.  IT SAID THE ITEM CAME WITH A LANYARD (FOR WEARING AROUND THE NECK) AND BATTERY INCLUDED, BUT WHEN IT CAME, THERE WAS NO LANYARD AND THE BATTERY WAS DEAD.  I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.</li>
    <li> Have had this product from several years back. They have changed it somewhat and it remains to be seen if it will be as functional as the original purchase.</li>
    <li> READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY, IT IS ACCURATE TO THE LETTER!  However, &amp;#34;Fashion pillbox with single alarm timer&amp;#34; leads you to expect you&#x27;ll be able to set it to remind you to take a pill once a day, &amp;#34;same time, same station.&amp;#34;  But that is NOT the case!  This &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; actually is a 20 hour count-down or count-up timer, or you can use it as a stop watch, just as the terse description says, but you CANNOT set it to remind you to take a pill every 24 hours.  I suspect the concept was developed by creatures from another planet that has 20 hour days because it&#x27;s not much use on planet earth.  If I could remember to set it to remind me to take a pill 20 hours or less from now, chances are pretty much in favor of me not needing this cockamamy timer in the first place!  I failed to take the description literally.  Don&#x27;t repeat my mistake!  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m still shopping...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was excellent, arrived quickly, but the packaging was destroyed in opening it so I&#x27;m not going to bother trying to send it back.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the small print -I wanted an alarm to go off every 2 PM so my elderly Mom would be reminded to take her 2 PM pill.  Doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> It is the one I was looking for . I am so glad you carry them. It works fine, when I need another one or anything else I will know where to look.  Jean L. Wikowsky</li>
    <li> I did not see in the advertisement that this product is meant for people that take medications several times throughout the day. I just need an alarm for once a day, which would be every 24hr. This product does not allow you to set the time for 24 hrs out so I could not use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it right in the trash.</li>
    <li> It was what I wanted, handy and nice size,  but stopped working after a week or so. From the other reviews, this seems to be a common problem.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product until I received it.  It had a horrible odor that nothing got rid of.  I couldn&#x27;t even have it in the same room.  I knew I would have to reset after each use but didn&#x27;t expect that process to be so difficult.  since I need to take the med in the middle of the night I have no desire to stay awake longer to reset.</li>
    <li> I bought this for an elderly aunt to help remind her when to take her medicine. Works well. Battery included is a plus!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 just in case one did not work and sure enough one had an alarm that didn&#x27;t sound, only the light worked.  I got these for my elderly mother who had to practice setting it, but did get it.  It does take some dexterity and old people sometimes don&#x27;t have fine motor skills.  She uses it just for the alarm because it is too hard for her to open and close the pill part.  It has been helpful and was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> The Fashion Pill Box with single timer alarm, is GREAT,conveinent and easy to use, fits comfortably in ones pocket,purse or any where you wish to keep it. If you can use one, get one. Cost approximately $13.00. Have a great day, Joe Burian.</li>
    <li> The pill container is very large so if you take a lot of pills, it will accommodate them.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can only program it for one dose at a time so each time you take your pills you have to enter the interval until the next dose.</li>
    <li> We have used these for years to keep track of when my husband&#x27;s Parkinson&#x27;s meds are due.  Works great.</li>
    <li> All Parkinson&#x27;s patients need one of these.  Carry well and alarm is loud enough to get their attention.</li>
    <li> They are very cheaply made but I continue to buy them to help my husband remember his pills. He has Parkinson&#x27;s and takes a load of medications. This order was $4.00 each, next time I checked they were $12.00 each so I am looking for another source.</li>
    <li> Too hard to work with the buttons to set the timer and even harder to open it!</li>
    <li> The pill box arrived quickly &amp; in excellent shape.  It&#x27;s very handy to keep in pocket &amp; be reminded with a timer when it is time to take the next pill. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gives a 10 minute warning and a 5 minute warning.  Great for elderly person to use.</li>
    <li> Timer arrived in good condition but was defective - I could not get it to run as advertised. I retruned it and bought the same item locally. This timer seems to work well and should be very helpful in spacing my pills every 3 hours.</li>
    <li> It was unreliable and difficult to use and would not work..  In addition,the cover holding the battery kept falling off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected for the price.  I only wish the alarm was louder since I wear hearing aids.</li>
    <li> This was poorly made. The battery did not make good contain with the mechanism and the display only showed when I pressed the device. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 pill timers on advice of my physician since I must take my medicine in a timely fashion. I carry one in my purse at all times and the other is at home. The design of the timer allows for 2 days of medication. The case is easy to open and close, the numbers easy to read, and the timer gives you a 10 minute and a 5 minute warning. I can hear the sound of the timer even when it is in my closed purse so I am alerted. I have recommended this to other professionals like nurses, hygienists etc., and have had some positive feedback. Great for Senior Citizens who may be a little forgettful and small enough to travel with you all day.</li>
    <li> My wife has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease.  One of its drawbacks is, obviously, numerous medications, nearly all of which must be taken at different times of the day.  Another drawback of the disease is that the Parkinsonian, due to a certain amount of dementia, must give up various responsibilities, which leads to friction and/or serious anger and resentment between the Parkinsonian and his/her caregiver.      In our case, the patient was sure that she could manage her own medications, so I (the caregiver) agreed to a trial run.  It soon became evident that it was impossible for her to keep a handle on the dosages and the times of day when she should take the medications.    I now wear the alarm timer or have it where I can hear easily and it has created a huge change in our relationship -- there are no more cross words or ominous silences.  We both depend on the timer and so things are running much more smoothly.</li>
    <li> Larger than I thought.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement pill box that I used to have and it was hard to find any similar ones. This one is the closest and it also has a string that allows the timer to be put around your neck. While the string is black color and I wish it was a light color, I am very much satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  It&#x27;s small so will fit in your pocket or you can put it around your neck. It is very easy to use.  I take my morniing medications and then set the timer to the number of hours before my next dose.  It will beep to let you know it&#x27;s time to take the next dose.  It will re-beep you if you have not taken it within five minutes.  I don&#x27;t understand any of the reviews that are negative.  I&#x27;m ordering another one for my cousin!</li>
    <li> My wife has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and needed a reminder to take her meds every 4 hours.  One of parkinsonian friends saw it and I had to order one for her too!  She too is extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> Came with a corroded battery.  Still haven&#x27;t bought a new battery to find out if the device works.</li>
    <li> Great concept but doesn&#x27;t work.  Timer stopped working immediately after receiving it.  Being used to carry important pill and using cell phone for the alarm!!</li>
    <li> Easy to understand instructions,  simple and not overly dressed up with unneeded functions.  Price is very reasonable</li>
    <li> Simple to use for my medication which is taken every 12 hours--just one setting and push replay for the next 12 hours.  Large enough for several pills when i need to carry more.  &amp;#34;Early warning&amp;#34; single beeps allow for avoidance of the main constant beeper if in meetings, movies, etc.  Light to carry and battery lasts for long time.</li>
