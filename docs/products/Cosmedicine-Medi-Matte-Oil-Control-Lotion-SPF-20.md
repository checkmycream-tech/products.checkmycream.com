### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am soooo HAPPY!</li>
      <li>The combination of the two has made my skin look the best it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
      <li>and it looks great!</li>
      <li>So, ya, great great product A++</li>
      <li>I was really happy to see that it doesn&#x27;t use Oxybenzone as one of the ingredients, but it does have parabens.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I wanted a primer with matte finish and a good SPF.  </li>
      <li>For $42, I don&#x27;t think this is a good deal.  </li>
      <li>I have used this for a couple of months now with great success.  </li>
      <li>I was given some free samples of this product and love it!  </li>
      <li>OK look - yes</li>
      <li>You can get a lot more content with this price from equivalent brands.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to look for something better.</li>
      <li>I do love my Amazon ...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that this works for some people..</li>
      <li>This product is ok...</li>
      <li>Wow, what an incredible product..</li>
      <li>But, it works and looks better than any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used or seen before for shine control.  </li>
      <li>My favorite use for this product is around the eye and on the eyelids.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s more than a miracle for me.</li>
      <li>I have an oily face and have been looking for a product that will keep my face oil free for more than an hour.</li>
      <li>and I dab it on those areas, then smooth it around.  </li>
      <li>reconsider trying out this &#x27;free&#x27; sample.</li>
      <li>and I could smooth away any streaks with my finger.  </li>
      <li>This product works best if used after Cosmedicine&#x27;s cleanser and use no more than a dime amount.</li>
      <li>So, I was super excited when the chick at Sephora told me about this product..</li>
      <li>No, it does not go on silky-smooth like a Neutrogena sunscreen or anything, that much is true.  </li>
      <li>Given, I do have a really shiny nose, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to work for more than half-an-hour.  </li>
      <li>As far as oil control - pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It is also a good overall mattifyier, although it does take some practice to get the right amount on.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased with the product&#x27;s performance, although I find the price a bit steep, hence 4 stars rather than 5.  </li>
      <li>In general I find Sephora&#x27;s private label products to be very good.</li>
      <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the products that work best for my facial skin.</li>
      <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth the price because the pros outweight the cons.</li>
      <li>Hardly worth the outcome.    </li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
      <li>The Medi-Matte works well to reduce pore size and make your skin look very smooth and using the above mentioned powder helps too.    </li>
      <li>It leaves my face soft and oil free for hours.  </li>
      <li>At first, when I applied this to my face--</li>
      <li>The product is pretty think</li>
      <li>I used the travel-size tube of this that came in the \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; from Sephora on my honeymoon, and I can definitely say my skin had never looked better.</li>
      <li>To use enough to actually get good sunscreen coverage - you will be paying.</li>
      <li>and it brightened and evened my skin tone without giving me that \\&quot;ghostly\\&quot; white cast I experienced with other sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Little bubbly bumps that kind of itched a bit.</li>
      <li>The catch is that it&#x27;s a really \\&quot;thick\\&quot; product that kind of has a heavy and sticky feel to it, which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
      <li>and I can break out very severly with cystic acne.</li>
      <li>However, I really like the matte finish and oil control it provided.  </li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use that much at all, for it to spread evenly on your skin.</li>
      <li>While it initially provides a nice matte finish, it does not last.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and live in a hot climate.</li>
      <li>So I plunked down the cash and went home with the hopes that I had finally found the product that would keep me shine free for most of the day.</li>
      <li>It does not hold all day long, but I usually get a solid 6 hours out of it and that is the best I have found to date.  </li>
      <li>So I went to Ulta, searching for another primer, and the consultant there showed me the secret to using Medi-Matte successfully:     </li>
      <li>Also, just another bit of advice, I use Rare Minerals by Bare escentials.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>Also, this contains only 1.35 fl.oz of content, which is going to be used up pretty fast.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t control my oily T-zone, and it&#x27;s kind of thick and pasty.  </li>
      <li>Since my face was wet, it looked streaky but it would dry nicely</li>
      <li>I found that initially, using a foundation brush to apply the MediMatte helped me get the right amount applied.</li>
      <li>At first I had the same problems everyone else described.  </li>
      <li>(personally, I was digging the concept), as it is basically supposed to suppress oil production on your face, and it is Particularly humid where I live.    </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It was near my temples and along my jaw line.  </li>
      <li>That wasn&#x27;t the biggest complaint that I had, but after reading more reviews about this product, I am assigning blame for dryness to.  </li>
      <li>It works very well on my moderately oily T-zone area.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily t-zone skin and while it doesn&#x27;t eliminate oil, it definitely reduces it.  </li>
      <li>and so far have had no additional breakouts.  </li>
      <li>Basically the key is to use the right amount and apply it properly.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, the tube will last a long time for me because I use it only on my T-zone.</li>
      <li>Try applying in small amounts all over your face and then lightly massage it all over your face.  </li>
      <li>It will not &#x27;migrate&#x27; into your eyes and it really helps my eye makeup stay in place all day long!</li>
      <li>Currently, I&#x27;m trying to remedy it with clear skin treatments I have.  </li>
      <li>I use Bare Minerals Foundation over it....</li>
      <li>Not only to I have oily and blemish prone skin, but it is also sensitive.</li>
      <li>It is kind of weird though because I have combination skin...</li>
      <li>I bought several new things when I bought this product, but this was the only product that I put in the areas that were effected, so I assume this is the culprit.  </li>
      <li>If you decide to try it, err on the side of applying too little at first, until you get used to working with the texture.</li>
      <li>In general, my face was just a shiny three hours later than if I hadn&#x27;t applied the product.</li>
      <li>Two experimental days later, I can tell you, without a doubt that my face being too dry was Not a problem.    </li>
      <li>washed my face put it on and just 2 and a half hours later my t zone was very shiny.</li>

<li> My skin still gets a little oily by the end of the day, but nowhere near as oily as it was before.</li>
<li> the stuff is a bit thick and a bit sticky, but it is not as if it is glue or anything, just use small amounts onto one area at a time and it works fine.  </li>
<li> My skin looks rough and bumpy with red patches.  </li>
<li> I live in the humid south and have an oil slick for a face.  </li>
<li> Also, I&#x27;m extremely senstive to chemical sunscreens and this one did not irritate my eyes or cause red patches or breakouts.   </li>
<li> This product controlled shine yet didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts, either.</li>
<li> I am also placing blame on it for making my face look dry.  </li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t enough for a day at the beach, but for everyday use it definitely covers me for oil and sun for at least the first half of the day.  </li>
<li> I discovered this item at Sephora and paid nearly $50 for the small tube.</li>
<li> In addition to that product, I powder with loose cornstarch-based face powder which also helps with the shine problem.  </li>
<li> I only use a little and smudge a long way and have had no issues getting liquid foundation over it.  </li>
<li> It is a little thick maybe, but it is meant to be used very sparingly...</li>
<li> Definitely a waste of money, especially if your shine problem is severe.</li>
<li> I rated it down one star because it is super expensive for such a small amount, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t last 6 hours for an excessively oily girl in the excessively humid swampland of Southeast Texas.</li>
<li> I have a very oily T-Zone with oily cheeks and chin with some dry patches around my mouth and jaw (weird, I know).  </li>
<li> * mattification, something I don&#x27;t get with any other product.</li>
<li> I have to agree with the other reviewers.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I live in the humid south and have an oil slick for a face.  I was given some free samples of this product and love it!  It does not hold all day long, but I usually get a solid 6 hours out of it and that is the best I have found to date.  I am acne prone and so far have had no additional breakouts.  I only use a little and smudge a long way and have had no issues getting liquid foundation over it.  I&#x27;m anxious to try the tinted version too!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I work in a facility that isn&#x27;t air-conditioned and my job involves a lot of physical labor, and I don&#x27;t like being oily/sweaty at work.  It definitely keeps the shine away and keeps oil under control.  The catch is that it&#x27;s a really \\&quot;thick\\&quot; product that kind of has a heavy and sticky feel to it, which I don&#x27;t like.  I&#x27;ve prefered to blot my face with oil-control papers after it dries and then apply oil control powder over it (both fron Tarte&#x27;s Little Blot Book), and THEN I get the effect that I&#x27;m looking for.  Maybe it&#x27;s because of the sunscreen in it.  I probably will select a different oil-absorbing lotion when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. In general I find Sephora&#x27;s private label products to be very good. However, I am disappointed with this one. The product is very thick and sticky. Hours after applying, I still have sticky areas on my face around the hairline. While it initially provides a nice matte finish, it does not last. In general, my face was just a shiny three hours later than if I hadn&#x27;t applied the product. It is also difficult to apply foundation over. The foundation does not blend out over the lotion unless it is a moisturizing formula. Stila tinted moisturizer was the only foundation in my arsenal of beauty products that could be blended.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product from a salesperson at Sephora.  Once I tried it, I was hooked.  It works very well on my moderately oily T-zone area.  Unlike other reviewers, I have had no problems with this product streaking or causing issues with my foundation, but that may be due to the fact that I use a powdered mineral foundation instead of a liquid one.  Overall I am very pleased with the product&#x27;s performance, although I find the price a bit steep, hence 4 stars rather than 5.  Fortunately, the tube will last a long time for me because I use it only on my T-zone.</li>
    <li> I have an oily face and have been looking for a product that will keep my face oil free for more than an hour. I was told by the sales girl that this would work for 6 hrs. So I plunked down the cash and went home with the hopes that I had finally found the product that would keep me shine free for most of the day. Well i went home washed my face put it on and just 2 and a half hours later my t zone was very shiny. while this might work for those who are NOT that shiney and oily, it did not work for me.  I still have to return it and either get my money back or i could exchange it for something else. i will not be buying this again. This might work for those who are not as oily as I.</li>
    <li> Wow, what an incredible product.. I don&#x27;t know how this product can be getting bad reviews. My advice would be to use the Cosmedicine cleanser and toner before using this. You really don&#x27;t need to use that much at all, for it to spread evenly on your skin. Also, just another bit of advice, I use Rare Minerals by Bare escentials. The combination of the two has made my skin look the best it&#x27;s ever been. So, ya, great great product A++</li>
    <li> Hope this suggestion will help people who are frustrated with their Medi-Matte.    I bought this product because I wanted a primer with matte finish and a good SPF.  At first I had the same problems everyone else described.  So I went to Ulta, searching for another primer, and the consultant there showed me the secret to using Medi-Matte successfully:     Use a medium sized flat brush (think it&#x27;s called a concealer brush?) with synthetic bristles, so it doesn&#x27;t soak up the primer.  Use the brush to PAT the lotion into the skin (she said you do that with primers so it \\&quot;fills in\\&quot; the pores).  I use a small amount of product this way, and there is no pulling on my skin as when I tried to rub it on.  I let it dry a few minutes, then follow with bareMinerals, which also has some sun protection.  It isn&#x27;t enough for a day at the beach, but for everyday use it definitely covers me for oil and sun for at least the first half of the day.  I guess I&#x27;m holding out on that last star for the mythical product that will banish oiliness all day.     Another secret for oily skin I learned at Ulta:  if you use bareMinerals, apply Mineral Veil BEFORE as well as after your foundation powder.    I do love my Amazon ... but Ulta rocks, too!</li>
    <li> I have tried product after product, for the past 10 year.... nothing has worked. I decided to try Cosmedicine Medi-Matte Oil Control Lotion. It&#x27;s amazing!!! It keeps the shine away for hours. My skin still gets a little oily by the end of the day, but nowhere near as oily as it was before. I am soooo HAPPY! It reminds me of elmers glue (the consistency of the lotion). I use Bare Minerals Foundation over it.... and it looks great! Thank You Cosmedicine!!!!</li>
    <li> I wrote a review on the Cosmedicine starter kit for oily skin and enlarged pores.  This wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  The product is sticky and its hard to blend into your skin.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from Sephora.  I wanted to test it out before I spent money on a product that I am not sure would work.  I have very oily t-zone skin and while it doesn&#x27;t eliminate oil, it definitely reduces it.  Before using the product my skin would be so oily that my makeup would wash off by the end of the day.  Since I have been using the product, my shine would be reduced.  The product is pretty think but it is a trade off to not have greasy bangs at the end of the day and not have my makeup run off because of all the oil.  I have not noticed stickiness.  I use it in conjunction with Smashbox Primer before applying mineral makeup so maybe the primer reduces the stickiness.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers.  At first, when I applied this to my face-- although it had a thick, gluey texture to it--it did the job of mattifying my face which I liked especially in warmer weathers, BUT...when I applied my Giorgio Armani liquid foundation with a foundation brush, the brush collected the sunscreen onto the brush and did not blend AT ALL! My face was sticky and gluey from the application.  I was horrified.  I had to wash my face again and reapply my makeup. Also, this contains only 1.35 fl.oz of content, which is going to be used up pretty fast.  For $42, I don&#x27;t think this is a good deal.  You can get a lot more content with this price from equivalent brands.  This sunscreen is not a good sunscreen to go under your foundation.  If you just want to use it alone, then give it a try, but I would find another sunscreen that is compatible with foundation and makeup.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of months now with great success.  I have oily areas on my face and I dab it on those areas, then smooth it around.  I do not use it where I do not have problems; it&#x27;s too expensive for that.  In addition to that product, I powder with loose cornstarch-based face powder which also helps with the shine problem.  The Medi-Matte works well to reduce pore size and make your skin look very smooth and using the above mentioned powder helps too.    If you don&#x27;t wish to spend all that money, try before you buy.  Sephora should have some samples for you to take home and try.  That is how I came to appreciate this product.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to offer a tip to those who claim medi-matte to be too thick or sticky.  Try applying in small amounts all over your face and then lightly massage it all over your face.  This seems to work quite well.  It leaves my face soft and oil free for hours.  Basically the key is to use the right amount and apply it properly.  Just my input, hopefully it can be helpful.</li>
    <li> OK look - yes the stuff is a bit thick and a bit sticky, but it is not as if it is glue or anything, just use small amounts onto one area at a time and it works fine.  No, it does not go on silky-smooth like a Neutrogena sunscreen or anything, that much is true.  As far as oil control - pretty good.  If you have serious shine issues, this should get you a few hours, as it did for me. Does it work all day? No.  But, it works and looks better than any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used or seen before for shine control.  One big problem - it is a freakin fortune.  To use enough to actually get good sunscreen coverage - you will be paying.</li>
    <li> I admit it - I am mildly obsessed with all things Sephora.  So when I got the chance to try this \\&quot;oil-blocking lotion\\&quot;, I thought, hey, why not.  The one thing the sales person told me to look out for was that it might make my face \\&quot;too dry.\\&quot;  Two experimental days later, I can tell you, without a doubt that my face being too dry was Not a problem.    The problem was, perhaps the consistency and forumlation of the product, which comes out like a thin spackling paste (personally, I was digging the concept), as it is basically supposed to suppress oil production on your face, and it is Particularly humid where I live.    This product clogged EVERY PORE IN MY FACE that it was smoothed over, leaving me with a bumpy-looking, irritated-looking face.  It itches in some parts, and frankly, I&#x27;m just wondering when it will go away.  Currently, I&#x27;m trying to remedy it with clear skin treatments I have.  I checked the ingredients on the box provided and didn&#x27;t see anything out of the ordinary, so maybe there was one not printed on the sample size, or it is the consistency that is in fact the problem.    In the meantime, the product kept the moisture from overtaking my face for between 30 minutes to an hour.  Hardly worth the outcome.    I followed it with mineral makeup - hardly pore-clogging stuff.    If you have sensitive skin. reconsider trying out this &#x27;free&#x27; sample.</li>
    <li> This product is ok... no better or worse than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It didn&#x27;t control my oily T-zone, and it&#x27;s kind of thick and pasty.  I found that if I didn&#x27;t use a foundation primer, it was difficult to blend because of the texture.  I was really happy to see that it doesn&#x27;t use Oxybenzone as one of the ingredients, but it does have parabens. I will continue to look for something better.</li>
    <li> I have a very oily T-Zone with oily cheeks and chin with some dry patches around my mouth and jaw (weird, I know).  At first I was frustrated with this product because its so thick and sticky and would leave a residue on my cell phone and my cheeks felt slightly sticky to the touch.  However, I really like the matte finish and oil control it provided.  I also have tan skin and it brightened and evened my skin tone without giving me that \\&quot;ghostly\\&quot; white cast I experienced with other sunscreens.  Also, I&#x27;m extremely senstive to chemical sunscreens and this one did not irritate my eyes or cause red patches or breakouts.   I discovered that if I applied it while my skin was moist, it glided on a lot easier.  Since my face was wet, it looked streaky but it would dry nicely and I could smooth away any streaks with my finger.  I recently ran out of this product and since I like trying different things, I started using an Aveda moisturizer with SPF.  Big mistake.  My skin looks rough and bumpy with red patches.  I plan on going to Sephora this weekend to get another tube and I hope my skin restores itself to the condition it was in before.  To me, it&#x27;s worth the price because the pros outweight the cons.</li>
    <li> Given the hype of the Sephora sales people, I was expecting angels to swoop down from heaven to blot the excessive oil from my face with angel dust.  In reality, my face was matte for about thirty minutes after application.  Given, I do have a really shiny nose, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to work for more than half-an-hour.  I didn&#x27;t notice an all-day reduction of the oil slick on my nose or forehead, and I agree that the product is a little thick and gooey.  It seems to further clog my pores, too, as I always notice an increase in blackheads after I use it.  Definitely a waste of money, especially if your shine problem is severe.</li>
    <li> Like a previous reviewer posted, this product  must be used in very small quantities. I&#x27;m still working on the tube I bought in mid-October. I found that initially, using a foundation brush to apply the MediMatte helped me get the right amount applied. This product controlled shine yet didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts, either. If you decide to try it, err on the side of applying too little at first, until you get used to working with the texture.</li>
    <li> I used the travel-size tube of this that came in the \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; from Sephora on my honeymoon, and I can definitely say my skin had never looked better. (Maybe that was because I was having to wash my face 3 times a day from all the saltwater, but still). It is a little thick maybe, but it is meant to be used very sparingly... it reminds me of the Smashbox anti-shine product, which you put on in small dots and massage until you feel it start to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; -- this works well when used the same way. I notice *instant* mattification, something I don&#x27;t get with any other product. I rated it down one star because it is super expensive for such a small amount, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t last 6 hours for an excessively oily girl in the excessively humid swampland of Southeast Texas. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my foundation blending, and I have used it with mineral powder foundation as well as with Clinique Superbalanced compact foundation.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and live in a hot climate. I buy this product every summer, and I&#x27;ve found that one 40ml purchase last me for several months.    My favorite use for this product is around the eye and on the eyelids. It will not &#x27;migrate&#x27; into your eyes and it really helps my eye makeup stay in place all day long! No raccoon eyes and no creased eye shadow.    It is also a good overall mattifyier, although it does take some practice to get the right amount on.</li>
    <li> So, I was super excited when the chick at Sephora told me about this product.. however, after using for a week, I&#x27;m taking it back.  After about 2 days of use, I started noticing this weird sort of break out.  Not blemishes per say, but like a bubble effect on my face. It was near my temples and along my jaw line.  Little bubbly bumps that kind of itched a bit. Upon closer inspection I speculated that it was clogged pores.  I bought several new things when I bought this product, but this was the only product that I put in the areas that were effected, so I assume this is the culprit.  I am also placing blame on it for making my face look dry.  That wasn&#x27;t the biggest complaint that I had, but after reading more reviews about this product, I am assigning blame for dryness to.  It is kind of weird though because I have combination skin... so for the oily areas this lotion intensified the oily-ness. For the dryer parts of my face, it made it look even dryer.  Crazy. I&#x27;m glad that this works for some people.. it&#x27;s just not working for me.</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the products that work best for my facial skin. Not only to I have oily and blemish prone skin, but it is also sensitive. It&#x27;s a hassle trying to find products that work AND don&#x27;t irritate my skin. I was referred to this brand by Sephora (the guy was raving about it). This product works best if used after Cosmedicine&#x27;s cleanser and use no more than a dime amount. The consistency may be thick but it does work. I don&#x27;t have to blot my face every hour (now it&#x27;s just once a day) and that&#x27;s more than a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> I have excessivly oily skin and I can break out very severly with cystic acne. I have been looking for a product that would diminish the shininess of my face. I discovered this item at Sephora and paid nearly $50 for the small tube. I used it a couple of times and noticed a slight difference in shine. I only used the product twice and my face started to break out badly. I don&#x27;t know if it has anything to do with the product, but it is a coincidence that after using it twice my face broke out. I took the product to my dermatologist and asked him if he had heard of the product or thought any of the ingredients would be bad and he pointed out that there is a silicone based ingredient and that may have clogged my pores. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this product again. So now I&#x27;m out my $43 and back to blotting my face with tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would agree that those using this product use small amounts. By using small amounts it isn&#x27;t really goopy.</li>
