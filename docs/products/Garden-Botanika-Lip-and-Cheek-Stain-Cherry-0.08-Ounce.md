      <li>/&gt;UPDATE on 04/20/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, it&#x27;s been about 2 1/2 years since I wrote the original review.</li>
      <li>Has a cherry red color on my fair skin.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain my lips, but everyones lips are different, it does stain my finger really good</li>
      <li>Although the color kind of fade out when I use it on my lips, again, it adds the natural color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on silky smooth, but rubs right off again if you touch it in any way.  </li>
      <li>lucky that I found this lip stain cause its once of the besstt.</li>
      <li>Most of the time people have no idea I&#x27;m wearing it, just that I look \\&quot;rosier\\&quot; than normal.    </li>
      <li>Very pretty color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a massive world full of lip ink that takes special removers to remove, lip stain pens (which look more like magic markers and really don&#x27;t attract me at all).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great way to give yourself a little glow throughout the day without having to reapply a bunch of makeup.</li>
      <li>- Turns pinkish and kind of gummy when wearing powder, so I don&#x27;t put powder on my cheeks, only my chin and nose.    </li>
      <li>you are looking for a cheek color that looks the most natural, get this item.  </li>
      <li>My mom asked me why I look so fresh</li>
      <li>Im one of those ppl who never write reviews unless its worth the 5 stars</li>
      <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>It feels nice when on the lips but doesn&#x27;t stay that long for me</li>
      <li>For those who love lip balms, and there are many, this may be a product to try if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying every few minutes.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful because it is natural and gives long lasting color...</li>

      <li>I think of all the mysteries in makeup, the plethora of lip care products is enough to boggle the minds of most women.  </li>
      <li>I really dislike scented lipsticks!</li>
      <li>this color is perfect for natural look or a little more can be used to create a more dramatic look for an evening out.</li>
      <li>After I read positive reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would look just as good on lips as well, if you prefer a very subtle, natural look on your lips.  </li>
      <li>there just be a product out there that gives you a natural, matte-ish looking hint of color that you can determine how light or vivid it</li>
      <li>but it lasted a pretty decent 8 hrs and didnt make me breakout at all.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get it to layer on darker, but it&#x27;s a good cheek color.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that was very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking, and I like that it has a dual purpose.</li>
      <li>color stays for almost the whole day.</li>
      <li>If you just go with a light swab of color, it&#x27;s YOUR lips only...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Im really picky with cheek/lip colors</li>

      <li>or if you are not one who likes to wear too much make-up.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>- Very drying to my lips (</li>
      <li>It is also very moisturizing and not drying at all.  </li>
      <li>I will leave my initial review at the bottom of this one so you can see what I originally thought of this product.</li>
      <li>but this one was so natural and pretty.</li>
      <li>I think the color will look better on me once I get a little color in my face this spring/summer</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wanted to purchase a multi-purpose cosmetics for my upcoming international trip with my daughter.  I know I will be dragging a lot of things for the trip and I wanted my cosmetic bag as tiny as possible.  After I read positive reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best cosmetics I have ever owned.  The reasons are..&lt;br /&gt;1. This product makes my cheeks tinted really naturally.  Not powdery at all.&lt;br /&gt;  I look like I just took a nice warm bath.&lt;br /&gt;2. Although the color kind of fade out when I use it on my lips, again, it adds the natural color.&lt;br /&gt;  No smell or uncomfortable texture.&lt;br /&gt;3. Great price for a multi-purpose cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s not too harmful for my body (the rating from cosmeticdatabase.com is 5 out of 10)&lt;br /&gt;5. The container is compact.  Also it will never leak since it&#x27;s solid.  Great for getting through airport security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cheek color that looks the most natural, get this item.  If you aren&#x27;t a big fan of lip sticks or gloss but want to add some color on your lips, get this.  If you need something to make yourself look alive after a long haul flight, get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on 04/20/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, it&#x27;s been about 2 1/2 years since I wrote the original review.I still own &amp; love this product.  I actually looked for this item on Amazon to purchase it again.  I use it on my cheeks +5 days a week, and it lasted this long.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding makeup that I like and I hate it when things don&#x27;t look natural, which makes finding affordable products extra hard. I received this as a gift about a month ago, I use it every day and I haven&#x27;t even made a dent! I think it would be better used on lighter skin though because of the reddish color. It really makes it look like I&#x27;ve been out in the cold exercising which I really like! There are some not so good things about it though.    Pros:    - Very natural and natural looking.  - Creates a beautiful flushed look.  - Lasts all day on cheeks.    Cons:    - Very drying to my lips (which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5).  - It doesn&#x27;t stay as well on my lips, which isn&#x27;t a big problem, but it isn&#x27;t a very great lip stain.  - Turns pinkish and kind of gummy when wearing powder, so I don&#x27;t put powder on my cheeks, only my chin and nose.    If it dries your lips out like mine, just put some lip blam/chap stick under or over and you&#x27;re good to go!     All in all, it&#x27;s a great product and I will be buying again. It was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the beautiful color, earth friendly ingredients, and convenience.  However, when I first applied it, it had a wierd smell that made it a little hard to wear (my lips being just under my nose and all...) ;)  However, I am not noticing the smell now, so I either got used to it or it went away.  I need to wear a moisturizer with this.  It stays on me when I kiss the baby, so I LOVE that!  Good product.  Hope the next one doesn&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
    <li> I just bought the \\&quot;Garden Botanika Lip &amp; Cheek Stain,\\&quot; and am really disappointed.  It goes on silky smooth, but rubs right off again if you touch it in any way.  If you don&#x27;t touch it, it evaporates or disappears in a short time.  I don&#x27;t think this product should be called a \\&quot;stain.\\&quot;  It is NOT a stain, and I&#x27;ve just wasted over $16.00 plus shipping.</li>
    <li> Im one of those ppl who never write reviews unless its worth the 5 stars and this is one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;Im lucky that I found this lip stain cause its once of the besstt. Im really picky with cheek/lip colors but this one was so natural and pretty. I was worried it wouldnt last long throughout the day or make me breakout but it lasted a pretty decent 8 hrs and didnt make me breakout at all.  My mom asked me why I look so fresh and now I have to order her one. &#x3D;) Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. This is my second one, last&#x27;s a long time. Once you put it on leave it sit undisturb for 10 min. or so and it will last all day. You can put gloss over it and it doesn&#x27;t come off and if you don&#x27;t it just feels like your lips would naturaly.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I wanted something that was very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking, and I like that it has a dual purpose. I&#x27;m not yet sure how long-lasting it is... but I&#x27;m not the type of person that expects something to last all day. Usually if a cosmetic does last all day it is because there are chemicals or harsh ingredients. I would rather have to apply something a few times than absorb who-knows-what into my epidermis.</li>
    <li> Cute, portable. Not super-tenacious, but fine for the price. Not as vivid as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I Love Garden Botanika Lip and Cheek, I bought the first package of it a couple of years ago and found a second tub of it in the retired been, I paniced thinking I would never be able to find it again.   Thank you Amazon for having the product. Just promise me that you won&#x27;t stop carrying Garden Botanika Lip &amp; Cheek.</li>
    <li> This was an expensive peace of sauve. It doesn&#x27;t stay on long. Feels good when you apply it, then it gone. I will never buy this again nor would I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think of all the mysteries in makeup, the plethora of lip care products is enough to boggle the minds of most women.  We learn about lip balms and sticks at an early age when our moms are just letting us play with makeup... then come the glossy, sparkly glosses best left forgotten along with our jr. high school pictures (ugh!), and then comes the big step.  Lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the taste, the smell, the texture, the way it dries out my lips, wears off on your glass and never lasts a meal.  Most of all, I hate the pricey price tag.  Geez louise.  It&#x27;s lipstick, not gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been a lip balm kind of girl.  Give me moisture and a little shine and I&#x27;m usually pretty happy.  But one day I thought, hey, there&#x27;s got to be a product out there that will give you long lasting color that&#x27;s not shiny, not so wet-looking, not sparkly or so laquer looking that it just can&#x27;t be natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t there just be a product out there that gives you a natural, matte-ish looking hint of color that you can determine how light or vivid it gets?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold... welcome to the world of Lip Stains.  It&#x27;s a massive world full of lip ink that takes special removers to remove, lip stain pens (which look more like magic markers and really don&#x27;t attract me at all).  So I thought my search was over until I stumbled on Garden Botanika&#x27;s lip &amp; cheek stain.  Not only does it do lips, but it does cheeks too?  SCORE!  Double-duty cosmetics.  Who can&#x27;t like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to the store to check it out, they were having a sale.  Buy one get one 1/2 price.  ooooh.  Economical!  I grabbed two -- one for me, one for a friend -- and headed out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a few months ago.  Now?  I&#x27;m in love.  Lip Stain rules the school, peeps.  It goes on flawlessly easy (though it does leave your finger a little pink/red if you don&#x27;t wash it off after applying it to your lips) and STAYS on.  No more annoying touch-ups.  No more dabbing at the table after you&#x27;ve sipped your water.  No more last minute bathroom trips just to add more lipstick because your meal is over and all your lipstick has worn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts.  And lasts.  And lasts.  And best of all?  If you just go with a light swab of color, it&#x27;s YOUR lips only... healthier.  And who doesn&#x27;t like that?  Most of the time people have no idea I&#x27;m wearing it, just that I look \\&quot;rosier\\&quot; than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic product and I&#x27;m so glad I found it and selected it above all the other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend lip &amp; cheek stain.r.

    <li> this color is perfect for natural look or a little more can be used to create a more dramatic look for an evening out. I love it because it&#x27;s light on lips and cheeks...blends easily and never dies you out.</li>
    <li> This lip and cheek stain by Garden Botanika is absolutely beautiful.  I use it as cheek color, not lip color.  It is very subtle and natural looking.  It is a beautiful color.  I like a bolder, less sheer color on my lips.  So, if you are looking for an organic product that looks very natural and subtle, this is for you!  I absolutely love it.  It is also very moisturizing and not drying at all.  I don&#x27;t notice it actually staining my cheeks, but it does have decent staying power.  I&#x27;m sure it would look just as good on lips as well, if you prefer a very subtle, natural look on your lips.  I would definately purchase this product again.  I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this lip &amp; cheek stain. When I work out my lips turn to like a grayish purple and I look like a zombie. So to avoid anybody thinking I&#x27;m the walking dead, I wear this lip stain to help give it a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;So in a way this lip stain helps save my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color stays for almost the whole day. Would buy again if this thing ever runs out.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light tint or stain.  not sticky or waxy and I can&#x27;t smell or taste a thing.  I really dislike scented lipsticks! the gb stick tint has a scent, but this little pot of stain does not.</li>
    <li> I like the color, but don&#x27;t like applying it with my finger to my lips so will probably buy a separate lip brush. It&#x27;s hard to get it to layer on darker, but it&#x27;s a good cheek color.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It gives your checks that \\&quot;kissed by the outdoors\\&quot; kind of look!  A little bit goes a very long way...so use sparingly.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful because it is natural and gives long lasting color...I love this stain for my cheeks. I used to use Benefit cheek stain in Cha cha and I love this one way more! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Very light weight. I have trouble with acne (I&#x27;m in my thirties, so it&#x27;s not going away) and this is easy to wear with no breakouts whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Very natural.  Great for weekend wear or if you are not one who likes to wear too much make-up.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This seems to make my lips feel dry and the stain doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid so much for such an odd color. It&#x27;s like you ate a popsicle or drank Kool-aid. I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Doubt I&#x27;ll ever wear this.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color but it doesn&#x27;t last on lips or cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fades almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed and hope the manufacturer fixes this problem.</li>
    <li> I think the color will look better on me once I get a little color in my face this spring/summer but I like it a lot. Its light and stays on for a long time, however, at this point due to my super pale complexion, it can look like I just ate a red popsicle after a couple hours. The color tends to be darker on me toward the inside of my lips and worn off toward the outside after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Lovely color and texture. Nice and easy to carry in bag. Has a cherry red color on my fair skin.  Just wish that as a lip color it had greater staying power.</li>
    <li> I will leave my initial review at the bottom of this one so you can see what I originally thought of this product. They have since changed the product and it is HORRIBLE. It doesn&#x27;t stain your lips at all, rather it leaves a peach colored, creamy texture on your lips. I am so irritated that I actually took time out of my schedule to post this and to return the product ASAP. Word to the makers: DON&#x27;T FIX WHAT&#x27;S NOT BROKEN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW A YEAR AGO:&lt;br /&gt;I just bought 2 more of these so I can have them around at all times. It&#x27;s a great way to give yourself a little glow throughout the day without having to reapply a bunch of makeup. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lip stain aficionado and have every color from the palest pink to the deepest red that actually stain my lips. This product felt greasy and never morphed into a proper stain. It just lay on my lips and even after blotting or wiping there was no stain to behold. Very disappointed since it has great reviews. The color never penetrated the upper layer of my lip to even resemble a stain. For me, this was just a cherry-colored lip balm that once wipes off, leaves no color. Maybe I misunderstood. I thought this would dry and become a legitimate stain but it stayed greasy and I dislike lip balms. For those who love lip balms, and there are many, this may be a product to try if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying every few minutes.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find something better to use on my body and I really liked how with this one, I could use it on my lips and even my cheeks.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain my lips, but everyones lips are different, it does stain my finger really good so I use a qtip to apply.  It feels nice when on the lips but doesn&#x27;t stay that long for me</li>
    <li> Goes nicely on skin. I use for blush and eye. Adds nice color to face. Garden Botanika makes great products for the body.</li>
