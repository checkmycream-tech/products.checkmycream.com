      <li>These are a good deal though</li>
      <li>They are also good at removing shards of floss leftover from the so-bad-I-would-laugh-except-I-have-floss-bits-in-my-teeth Oral B flossers (ASIN: B0028K3J26).</li>
      <li>so great and easy!</li>

      <li>Great product, strong, they don&#x27;t break.  </li>

      <li>The floss is strong and does not break.</li>
      <li>These work great but the ones with the tilted head are easier to fit in my children&#x27;s smaller mouths.</li>
      <li>The second strand of floss is much more effective at removing particles.</li>
      <li>Not only are they strong, they also super effective at removing unspeakable food bits from between the teeth.  </li>

      <li>Plackers have made it much easier</li>

      <li>A pack normally cost around $3.75.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive and crowded teeth</li>
      <li>so It was hard to use most traditional wax flossers.  </li>
      <li>The dual line is two VERY thin, but VERY strong lines of floss.</li>
      <li>Also, they are MUCH cheaper in a certain discount department store (less than half the price).  </li>

<li> 100% sold on plackers brand over other brand and generic floss picks.</li>
<li> These DO NOT break on me when I use them in those tight spaces in the back of my mouth.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve recently noticed that these, which I mentioned are no longer American made, now have less tough floss.  </li>
<li> They get all the spinach and turkey meat leftovers hiding down in the hidden crevasses between your pearly whites before it turns into stinky breath and tooth-rotting decay.</li>
<li> they work well on my tightly spaced teeth.</li>
<li> I carry a few with me where ever I go.</li>
<li> I have very little space between my teeth  --  </li>
<li> In the past, they almost never broke.]</li>
<li> I would say in at least one out of 10, the floss breaks before I get done.  </li>
<li> I never liked dental flossers.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s kinda expensive though.</li>
<li> Just wish they were still made in America :(  </li>
<li> They also pick out a bunch of crap from your mouth too.</li>
<li> I was horrible about flossing before I switched to Plackers and now I floss every day (like your dentist tells you to)!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the double string. gets a lot more gunk out. 100% sold on plackers brand over other brand and generic floss picks. placker out perform any of the others.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite flossers</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like using standard floss these work so well.  I&#x27;ve purchased a bunch of different brands.  These DO NOT break on me when I use them in those tight spaces in the back of my mouth.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> good deal on good old Plackers.</li>
    <li> they work well on my tightly spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product, strong, they don&#x27;t break.  They do a good job of cleaning between tight teeth.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and get a shockingly large amount of stuff out from between the teeth.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand for dental floss. The twin-line is better than the single line! Will buy agin!</li>
    <li> These work great but the ones with the tilted head are easier to fit in my children&#x27;s smaller mouths. These are a good deal though</li>
    <li> I love these. They are strong and do a great job at cleaning your teeth.  The only problem is, when you switch to these you will never use regular floss again</li>
    <li> The second strand of floss is much more effective at removing particles.</li>
    <li> I have very little space between my teeth  --  these work and don&#x27;t break!!!  Will always get these all the time now!!!</li>
    <li> My son inlaw had surgery and these are the only ones his surgeon recommended. The twin line type are hard to find I our area and was thrilled to see them in Amazon!</li>
    <li> I realize how difficult it is to get excited about personal hygiene, especially flossing, but these are the bees knees of flossers.  Not only are they strong, they also super effective at removing unspeakable food bits from between the teeth.  They are also good at removing shards of floss leftover from the so-bad-I-would-laugh-except-I-have-floss-bits-in-my-teeth Oral B flossers (ASIN: B0028K3J26).</li>
    <li> Excellent.. Makes flossing a lot easier without having to worry the string will tear</li>
    <li> The twin-line flossers are great.  I find that they break less often and get out more &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; than the single-line Plackers.  Plackers are the only brand that really work and stand up to heavy flossing.  I was horrible about flossing before I switched to Plackers and now I floss every day (like your dentist tells you to)!  Just wish they were still made in America :(  Also, they are MUCH cheaper in a certain discount department store (less than half the price).  [Update:  I&#x27;ve recently noticed that these, which I mentioned are no longer American made, now have less tough floss.  I would say in at least one out of 10, the floss breaks before I get done.  In the past, they almost never broke.]</li>
    <li> Dual thread picks up more than single thread flosses.</li>
    <li> I have always had difficulty in flossing my teeth.  Plackers have made it much easier and i think they do a better job than the normal flossing technique.</li>
    <li> Best floss out there. The double floss lasts longer and you get a better scrap cleaning from them. I carry a few with me where ever I go.</li>
    <li> I never liked dental flossers. They always shred. The Twin-Line design helps with the shredding. It still shreds for me. They also pick out a bunch of crap from your mouth too. It&#x27;s probably one of the best dental flossers on the market. It&#x27;s kinda expensive though.</li>
    <li> These are the best! They get all the spinach and turkey meat leftovers hiding down in the hidden crevasses between your pearly whites before it turns into stinky breath and tooth-rotting decay.</li>
    <li> so great and easy! I floss in front of my computer when watching netflix cuz it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
    <li> These flossers are seriously the BEST.  I have sensitive and crowded teeth so It was hard to use most traditional wax flossers.  The dual line is two VERY thin, but VERY strong lines of floss. The two strands work together to literally pluck any gunk out of between your teeth.  You will be happy with these. I can&#x27;t find them in stores around me, so I love getting them shipped very quickly  and for a great price on amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent flosser! I buy these for the family. They are perfect for kids and adults. The floss is strong and does not break. Great for getting to hard to reach areas.  A pack normally cost around $3.75.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re easier to use than standard dental floss and I get great results my dentist is happy I&#x27;m happy I will continue to buy them</li>
