      <li>I started wet shaving four months ago and this was a perfect razor and blades to get me going.</li>
      <li>For a starter its not bad, but I would spend more for a better name brand.  </li>
      <li>and it is easy to replace the blades.  </li>
      <li>easy to assemble</li>
      <li>Eventually I will probably purchase a higher end razor but for someone buying their first DE razor, the Lord Tech is a great place to start.</li>
      <li>This razor is just as worthy as the brands that are twice the price!  </li>
      <li>It is extremely light and the way it holds the blade is overly aggressive.  </li>
      <li>This razor is light and durable.  </li>
      <li>Some people make it sound like if this is some kind of art and and not everybody can do it, but this is simple, it&#x27;s easy &amp; it&#x27;s cheap, way better than disposable&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even notice the discolorations originally mentioned anymore.</li>
      <li>This was my first DE razor and it is just okay.  </li>
      <li>I love the razor the bigben and shark sample blades, the arco blades SUCK haven&#x27;t been nicked so much in my life!</li>
      <li>and once you find the right blade for you - an easy and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t have a special stand for my razor</li>
      <li>as far as finding a blade that&#x27;s comfortable it comes with 3 blade packs - but you can also buy from amazon sample packs with more options - or ask Sam for help.</li>
      <li>I think you will enjoy wet shaving once you master the technique this is a good place to start then</li>
      <li>This is a good starter set for someone new to wet shaving and fine for the experienced wet shaver.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re getting into wet shaving to save money on blades, this handle is a good way to get started.</li>
      <li>Subsequent shaves have gotten increasingly better, and I thoroughly enjoy shaving with this razor.</li>
      <li>Read up online on the proper way to use these and don&#x27;t be intimidated — you&#x27;ll love it if you do it right.</li>
      <li>The handle is lightweight, the head is heavier and the shave is slightly aggressive, but overall the razor is good and the price is even better.  </li>
      <li>Like I said it&#x27;s my first DE razor</li>
      <li>thankfully you have a wealth of outstanding help starting with the owner of the site/company - Sam!!</li>
      <li>Too expensive, I just had my first shave with this DE Lord razor and it was perfect!</li>
      <li>I wish I had bought that one in the first place.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think I will need a expensive one, this one does a perfect job!</li>
      <li>One positive thing though</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve been using disposable razors that pull at your beard, you might think you&#x27;re not doing it right the first time you use one of these blades — it just slides down the face and the whiskers are magically gone.</li>
      <li>I use Proraso Pre-Shave cream for sensitive skin w/ C.O.Bigelow shaving cream and Lucky Tiger aftershave.  </li>
      <li>It gives you a much closer shave than an electric razor.  </li>
      <li>This is a much cheaper way to go than disposable razors and blades.  </li>
      <li>I bought this razor because it was inexpensive as I didn&#x27;t want to sink a whole lot of money into a razor and end up not liking it.  </li>
      <li>and it gives me a very close shave.</li>
      <li>The light weight forces you to use extra pressure which results in the aggressive blade giving you razor burn and weepers.  </li>
      <li>Real metal throughout and a nice weight make this a good razor to learn wet shaving with and the blades that come with it provide a few different varieties of sharpness to experiment with.</li>
      <li>I like shaving with the older razor.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>All of these blades will work fine for your shaving, remember let the weight of the razor do the work, don&#x27;t force it for the new guys to wet shaving.</li>
      <li>One side of this razor cuts more aggressively than the other which tells me its not centered properly.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as my first double edge handle, and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.</li>
      <li>It holds the blade firmly in place and is easy to manuever and not too bulks.  </li>
      <li>The shave is more abrasive but that is to be expected from a single blade razor</li>
      <li>I will definitely keep it around, but am also certainly going to upgrade to a nicer model at some point.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s caused no problems for me so far</li>
      <li>And if you don&#x27;t like it at first, give it a few more tries to see how your skin and technique adjusts before making a final judgement!</li>
      <li>As for the blades that come in the package I did not care much for - but I choose this package so I could try different blades, so if you are new to wet shaving I&#x27;d recommend this razor but not the blades.</li>
      <li>I clearly see a future problem with the threads.  </li>
      <li>That trio is a must have, especially if you have sensitive skin like mine.  </li>

<li> However, this was primarily due to inexperience with DE razors and my skin&#x27;s sensitivity.</li>

<li> Maybe in a few months I will look into purchasing a Murker or Edwin Jagger.  </li>
<li> I have used this razor a few times and it works well for brush shaving.  </li>
<li> Not even a small one!</li>
<li> I used to watch my dad shave with a DE razor all of his life and was always curious about it, I&#x27;ve always use disposable razors, but they&#x27;re always expensive!</li>
<li> My first shave was absolutely AWFUL.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not even expensive</li>
<li> It&#x27;s worthless, must be thrown out.  </li>
<li> the bad its kinda like a stick shift car - there is a learning curve with nicks and cuts - just \\&quot;man up\\&quot; you will get thru it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> i don&#x27;t have a special stand for my razor so i leave this on the sink and it was in some water and it rusted. i can&#x27;t use it anymore. it also doesn&#x27;t adjust so i have to loosen the handle a little so it will be a painless shave, when you get it working it works good it gives a close shave, but i wouldn&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> The handle is lightweight, the head is heavier and the shave is slightly aggressive, but overall the razor is good and the price is even better.  The small selection of various razors it comes with are also a plus as the razor is only half the shaving experience and knowing which blade you prefer is just as important.  Beginners can try out four different blades without making a separate order.  Overall, terrific bargain.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try DE shaving for some time, but did not want to spend a lot of money on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use.  After shopping around, I settled on the Lord Tech Razor and was not disapointed.  Despite it&#x27;s low price, it is well made and feels solid in your hand.  Eventually I will probably purchase a higher end razor but for someone buying their first DE razor, the Lord Tech is a great place to start.</li>
    <li> This razor is just as worthy as the brands that are twice the price!  It&#x27;s more about the razors you use with it.  I have used this razor a few times and it works well for brush shaving.  It has caused a bit of skin irritation, but that&#x27;s likely due to my face not being used to one blade.  This is a much cheaper way to go than disposable razors and blades.  It gives you a much closer shave than an electric razor.  It has a nice weight and does not feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart.  Keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t buy this for it&#x27;s visual qualities (although I do prefer silver to gold) -  I bought it to work and it does just that. For the price, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor and it is just okay.  It is extremely light and the way it holds the blade is overly aggressive.  The light weight forces you to use extra pressure which results in the aggressive blade giving you razor burn and weepers.  Spend the few extra bucks and get the Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L (L6) instead.  It is a million times better.  I wish I had bought that one in the first place.</li>

All of these blades will work fine for your shaving, remember let the weight of the razor do the work, don&#x27;t force it for the new guys to wet shaving. I think you will enjoy wet shaving once you master the technique this is a good place to start then fine a good vintage Gillette razor to shave with.Gillette made the best razors happy shaving.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving four months ago and this was a perfect razor and blades to get me going. Real metal throughout and a nice weight make this a good razor to learn wet shaving with and the blades that come with it provide a few different varieties of sharpness to experiment with. My only concern is that the threading on the handle is very short and am worried that if i dropped it the razor might break. It&#x27;s caused no problems for me so far though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> well this is a great razor. easy to assemble and once you find the right blade for you - an easy and smooth shave. if you have never wet shaved the good reason to get into it - cost &amp; savings!! the bad its kinda like a stick shift car - there is a learning curve with nicks and cuts - just \\&quot;man up\\&quot; you will get thru it! thankfully you have a wealth of outstanding help starting with the owner of the site/company - Sam!! just email him before you buy for tips, deals - anything that will make you confident to purchase. customer service is important to him - and he is the best ( by the way Sam - Cheers!!)also go on you tube and search DE shaving - lots of great shave tutor videos are there. and finally there is the amazon money back program if you are not comfortable! what do you have to lose? as far as finding a blade that&#x27;s comfortable it comes with 3 blade packs - but you can also buy from amazon sample packs with more options - or ask Sam for help. A GREAT DEAL!!!</li>
    <li> I got this razor in the mail today and it seems like it&#x27;s in great shape. The only complaints that I have is that there&#x27;s some discoloration on the handle, and it&#x27;s not as shiny as I had expected. But otherwise it&#x27;s just fine! I&#x27;ll update this as soon as I try it.    Update 8/16/2011:  I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use this razor several times with two or three of the enclosed blades. My first shave was absolutely AWFUL. However, this was primarily due to inexperience with DE razors and my skin&#x27;s sensitivity. Subsequent shaves have gotten increasingly better, and I thoroughly enjoy shaving with this razor. I don&#x27;t even notice the discolorations originally mentioned anymore. This is a great razor, and I highly recommend that you give it a try. And if you don&#x27;t like it at first, give it a few more tries to see how your skin and technique adjusts before making a final judgement!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! I used to watch my dad shave with a DE razor all of his life and was always curious about it, I&#x27;ve always use disposable razors, but they&#x27;re always expensive! Too expensive, I just had my first shave with this DE Lord razor and it was perfect! No cuts! Not even a small one! No bleeding!!!!!! Some people make it sound like if this is some kind of art and and not everybody can do it, but this is simple, it&#x27;s easy &amp; it&#x27;s cheap, way better than disposable&#x27;s and it give&#x27;s you a perfect shave!!!! I recomended it 100%! Like I said it&#x27;s my first DE razor and it&#x27;s not even expensive, I don&#x27;t think I will need a expensive one, this one does a perfect job!</li>
    <li> A piece of junk.  About a month after buying it I dropped it from the shelf on which I store it in the shower.  As a result, the head no longer screws into the handle at all.  It&#x27;s worthless, must be thrown out.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> For a starter its not bad, but I would spend more for a better name brand.  I clearly see a future problem with the threads.  Having steel male threads going into aluminum female threads is never going to last.  One side of this razor cuts more aggressively than the other which tells me its not centered properly.  One positive thing though, it saved me about $175.  It removed a skin tag quicker and cleaner than  my dermatologist could have done.  Due to the fact that it&#x27;s made in Egypt, I&#x27;ll keep using it until it revolts against me.</li>
    <li> I like shaving with the older razor. I don&#x27;t get as many razor bumps and it gives me a very close shave. The shave is more abrasive but that is to be expected from a single blade razor</li>
    <li> This safety razor is perfect for someone who is considering switching over from disposable razors. It comes with multiple types of blades and gives you a chance to try them out to see which you like and to get used to shaving with a safety razor without dropping $50 or $100 on a high-end razor. I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost a year now and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to upgrade yet (or revert to disposable razors for that matter!).</li>
    <li> This is a great beginner razor.  This razor is light and durable.  It comes with 16 blades, 5 of 3 diferent brands and 1 lord blade.  All of the blades are good quality.  I used to get razor burn at the bottom of my neck almost every time I shaved.  I tried all kinds of diferent products...razor, creams, pre-shaves, after shaves, ect.  I use this razor and I have another with a butterfly opening and I prefer this one out of the two.  It holds the blade firmly in place and is easy to manuever and not too bulks.  It is a little agressive, but with small strokes until you get used to it you will be fine.  If you are under a budget then this is your razor.  If you have 40-50 to spend then there are some great razors out there.  Maybe in a few months I will look into purchasing a Murker or Edwin Jagger.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to start wet shaving as a hobbie.  I have gotten some of the closest shaves of my life, matter of fact-THE closest shaves of my life with this razor.  My girlfriend loves how my face feels against hers.  I use this razor with a badger brush.  I use Proraso Pre-Shave cream for sensitive skin w/ C.O.Bigelow shaving cream and Lucky Tiger aftershave.  That trio is a must have, especially if you have sensitive skin like mine.  Hope this helps any newcomers.  Find me at theshaveden.com as FacialCarnage if you have any other questions.  Cheers Gents!</li>
    <li> This is a great first double-edged safety razor. Works well, good variety of blades. I will definitely keep it around, but am also certainly going to upgrade to a nicer model at some point.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from disposable razors and canned goop to shaving soap and safety razors. This was my first safety razor, and I&#x27;m really impressed. If you&#x27;ve been using disposable razors that pull at your beard, you might think you&#x27;re not doing it right the first time you use one of these blades — it just slides down the face and the whiskers are magically gone. Read up online on the proper way to use these and don&#x27;t be intimidated — you&#x27;ll love it if you do it right.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first double edge handle, and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since. If you&#x27;re getting into wet shaving to save money on blades, this handle is a good way to get started.</li>
    <li> I love the razor the bigben and shark sample blades, the arco blades SUCK haven&#x27;t been nicked so much in my life!</li>
