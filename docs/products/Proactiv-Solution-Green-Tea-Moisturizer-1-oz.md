<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was getting laser treatments on my face.  After, my face felt sun burned with some redness.  The doctor said apply cool water to cool the skin, which worked only sometime and not as quickly as I would like.  I received this product as a sample from a friend and now it&#x27;s all I use after my treatments and sun exposure.  It&#x27;s clear, but not a gel, so it&#x27;s not non-greasy and absorbs in the skin well.  It gives my face a matte finish not shinny.  It cools my skin immediately.  I use a pea size for my entire face. I&#x27;m Afro- Amer in my 40&#x27;s.  Now, I have my husband using it after he shaves.  1oz is really small so use sparingly.  There is no SPF so I use something different when going outside.  It served it&#x27;s purpose for me. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The green tea moisturizer is wonderful. Always leaves my skin feeling refreshed, quenched and not heavy or greasy. Very light weight and smells very good too.</li>
    <li> I like this for a night cream along with the proactive night cream together. I noticed if I use it in certain areas it breaks my skin out. (forehead/chin) I have to be careful where I apply it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so light, refreshing, not greasy at all! I&#x27;d have to say It definitely smells the best out of all the proactiv products. One of my favorite facial moisturizers. It is definitely worth buying in the bigger size however, because you will run out of it very quickly.</li>
    <li> This product hydrates the skin, doesn&#x27;t have any strong irritating fragrance, and gives a cool and refreshing feeling after you apply, not to mention that it absorbs so quickly. Fast delivery as well.</li>
    <li> I have used Proactiv products for several years and love them. I recently purchased this product and I love it. The green tea moisturizer goes on so smooth and it makes my skin feel like silk. I use this product every night. I also occasionally use it before applying make-up, and when I do, my make-up seems to stay on better. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Thanks Proactiv!</li>
    <li> Its nice to finally find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out! It doesn&#x27;t add as much moisture as I had hopped, but it does make my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I must say this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not greasy, absorbs quickly, and a little goes a long way. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I first got it as a free gift when I ordred the ProActiv kit.  It is pretty expensive through ProActiv, so I was thrilled to find it at such a great price on Amazon.  I ordered a 2 oz. tube and got two 1 oz. tubes, which was fine with me.  The only problem was that both tubes were several months past the expiration date!  I have been using the product anyway without any problems, but if this seller if offering them cheap because they are expired that should be noted in the description.  I probably would not have ordered them if I knew it beforehand.  Having said that the appearance, consistency, and fragrance of the product seem uncompromised and I have used it nightly without any issues.</li>
    <li> Started using this product a couple months ago and it has really help clear up my face.   Good price for this product also. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Just to get your attention (the 1 star is misleading). This moisturizer is awesome! Its the first moisturizer ever that water base (that i know of), I hate cream/lotion-like moisturizer... my face break out with most of the products that I&#x27;ve ever tried on. With this moisturizer, you feel like your face really absorb the product, and it have this nice soft green tea sense and make your face feel really soft.    About the 1 star. The product price is inaccurate, it said 25$ (crossed out), so if you buy this for 7$ then you save like 17$. That information is wrong, this is only 1 oz. The 25$ one is 2 oz. If you buy it as a member of Proactiv, it&#x27;s only 19.75$ then. So you don&#x27;t really save THAT much buying it at this price, 1-3 dollar at most. Still, it&#x27;s a fair price, good buy &lt;3.</li>
    <li> Just as it promise, this cream is very light and soothing. You don&#x27;t need anything else but sunblock afterwards. I really liked it!</li>
    <li> Results are great, but price is high.  My daughter is 11 and uses the proactive line and uses this to finish off her routine.  Not harsh, but I dread paying for this stuff until she is old enough to buy it herself.  She had sort of early on-set acne at age 10-11, so I felt for her self esteem, it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> It has turned my very dry skin into something so great.  The one I got in the mail was a teeny bit watery, which I don&#x27;t remember from the one from the actual website, but it still works miracles!</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactiv products for years (I am 47 and have had acne since I was 15), and I really like the cleanser/scrub, the toner and the nighttime cream, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the Green Tea Moisturizer.  Like many adults, who have acne and wrinkles to contend with, I struggle with finding a balance between moisturizing the aging skin and keeping it acne free.  I was thrilled when Proactiv introduced a moisturizer for acne-prone skin.  Unfortunately, every time I use it, my nose and cheeks explode with blackheads.  For me, I find Olay Regenerist SPF50 lotion to be the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> Ever since Dove got rid of their deep moisturizer, I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement. I have very dry skin especially on my forehead and eyebrows, and this product helps! I&#x27;ve been back on the Proactiv system for a few weeks now and my face is getting better, but I don&#x27;t know how well this works for clearing up acne without the whole product line of Proactiv. It is a little spendy, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 months. I&#x27;m not a guy that is into alot of different facial products or lotions because of have sentative skin but I do like this one; it mosturizes my face but not oily or has a strong scent. Will use often</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. Smells good. Feels nice. But I feel like its breaking me out. I guess I just have more sensitive skin than I thought. Would buy again but with a different more sensitive formula.</li>
    <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
    <li> Great customer service. My stuff arrived on time. I kind of wish that it came in a bigger size bottle, a little expensive for 1 oz but it works good though.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is wonderful.  I have oily skin and this moisturizer is the only one that I have ever used that has actually decreased my oiliness.  Love it, never want to be without a tube of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had bad skin. Proactive system was no better than others for me. This moisturizer is a true gem though! It took a few days for my skin to adjust--iniyislly very dry and flaky. Soft, clear skin now when I pair with Cetaphil face wash!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant when first looking into buying this product. I had used Proactiv products in the past and they hadn&#x27;t done much for my skin. However, this moisturizer really helps my skin! Not only does it make it softer, but it seems to have helped clear my acne up in combination with some other acne products. I use it on a daily basis and have seen great results!</li>
    <li> Gel-based, non-comedogenic, and very light on the skin (doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy). Maybe a little more expensive than other moisturizers but that&#x27;s because it simply works better and contains more effective ingredients (specifically those that prevent acne).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne-based skin care because my skin is already so dry. (I started using Proactiv again and am making progress with the blemishes. Things did get worse before they got better but within weeks my skin has majorly cleared up.) So I decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. It appears to work well and is actually a smooth, non-greasy moisturizer with very little scent. The reason I have it 4 stars is because I think this and other Proactiv products tend to be pricey. I just recently tried the oil-free non-comedogenic moisturizer from Neutrogena seems to work equally well for less. So I&#x27;ll most likely use that brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been only using it for about a week and I feels my skin is so much softer and brighter than before. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased Proactiv kit for my son who said that, although the product works, his skin was getting uncomfortably dry. So we purchased the green tea moisturizer and it was the missing link in the kit. It would be nice if they would add it into the 2 month supply kits they offer for sale.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Proactiv Solution Green Tea Moisture purchase. I love this stuff - it is not greasy and instantly absorbs... leaving my face feeling wonderfully hydrated without even a hint of oily or greasy feel. If you use the Proactiv 3-step system - I highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I do not have acne skin what so ever and you may be thinking, why are you using it then? Well, I&#x27;ll tell you why. The reason is because I have sensitive skin and most moisturizers tend to clog my pores or have a perfumey smell or be to greasy. I figured that since this is a product used for acne and people who have acne have sensitive skin and since most products seem to make it worse, I figured, why not use it. I&#x27;m glad that I stated using it because it works great, My pores are not clogged, it has a nice smell that&#x27;s not perfumy or greasy and a little foes go a long way. Just put a dab on both cheeks forehead and chin and your set to go. It leaves a velvety satin feeling to your face. I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I needed a moisturizer for my acne prone skin, and this one is really good. it moisturizes the skin without giving me the greasy feeling and i feel like it has actually helped in lightening my acne marks. but this tube is relatively small from what i expected it to be , guess shouldve checked the weight before ordering. But I am glad I ordered this, its a really good non-spf moisturizer which i wear under my makeup!</li>
    <li> I love the entire proactive system and this green tea moisturizer is a great addition. It really truly can take dry flaky skin and make is soft and glowing, but it doesn&#x27;t feel at all like lotion. Its 1000 times lighter than that. Plus it smells great.</li>
    <li> I think this left my skin a little oilier than usual.  This is sitting in my cabinet unused.  Prefer the standard repair lotion.</li>
    <li> proactiv doesnt work pissah for my acne vulgaris, gel peels do. i use this in case a gel peel goes too deep and drys out my skin. great deal great product.</li>
    <li> Still having oily-ish skin despite being in my late 60s, I tried many different moisturizers.  They all felt greasy after a short while.  This is the marvelous exception!  It feels light and clean on my face, despite the warm weather.  I only wish I had discovered this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I got 2. The 1 oz. is a good size. It&#x27;s a simple, non-greasy and nice-smelling moisturizer. Keeps my face clearer</li>
    <li> Tried this years ago and really liked it.  Found on Amazon at a good deal so tried it again.  Same as before, good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> A lot goes a long way.  I never have to put more than one layer of this on throughout the day.  I have used many moisturizers but so far this is the only one that I can use under or even on top of make-up.  You will not find this any cheaper either. Proactiv sells this for 4x the cost.</li>
    <li> its as good as the ones you buy at the mall, at a better price, I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Okay so I have to retract my earlier rating because I realized that this works on my skin ONLY if I exfoliate before watching my face and when I do my skin looks super radiant. It&#x27;s still not greasy at all and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s worth the price because it works! My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when I use it, and it&#x27;s a wonderful foundation for my Bare Minerals. My make-up stays looking great all day with this. I would recommend everybody try it, but you should be prepared to fall in love and stock up!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m the kind of girl who doesn&#x27;t wear make up because, even if my skin is blotchy or uneven or whatever, i think i&#x27;m beautiful without it and it&#x27;s a huge waste of time (plus, ladies, we don&#x27;t have to cover up under eye circles and puffy eyes if we don&#x27;t wake up at 4am to put our make up on... i&#x27;m just saying...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i use the proactiv regimen for my face, the only part of it i can usually stick with is the cleanser, because it&#x27;s the only face cleanser that I like (with some exceptions, but those are once-in-a-while things that i use if i don&#x27;t have the cleanser or if I want to give my skin a break for fear of desensitizing my face to its awesomeness).  anyway, the rest of the regimen- the standard one, i mean- with the toner and repairing lotion- were absurdly irritating to my skin, and I would walk around with almost a dermatitis-looking face, so while it DID clear my skin and it DID make my pores smaller, and my skin was even and not blotchy (when it wasn&#x27;t totally red from the irritation, abut 2 or 3 hours after using it), it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then when I got the green tea moisturizer, it&#x27;s the perfect cool balance to the harshness of the toner and repairing lotion.  it makes my face feel smooth but not greasy, and even after coming home from a 12 hour work day at the pharmacy, my face is not oily or shiny but it still feels moisturized and healthy. since getting the green tea moisturizer, i&#x27;ve been able to stick with the proactiv for longer which is good, because it automatically comes in the mail every 6 weeks or so, and i can&#x27;t figure out how to stop that. (haha, i&#x27;m a ditz!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this at night with the Roc corexion under eye stuff, a new addition to my regimen, because it&#x27;s not irritating to my eyes and i feel like the combination (the green tea on my face even if it&#x27;s not purported to fight the wrinkles I dont have yet- though moisturized skin wrinkles slower than un-attended to skin) is helping me feel a wee bit better about the bags and wrinkles of my face and just hte health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m only 22 but i&#x27;m afraid that hte stress of my job (soon to graduate as a pharmacist!) is putting undue stress on my skin. and my disregard for the health of my skin (i&#x27;m quite pale, but in high school I used to play field hockey and was a champion mt biker, so I wore sunburn on my face like a prize) will soon take its toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve read that we young folks should start taking care of our skin now, even those of us not into vanity- like me- because the extra ten minutes a day of applying a thin layer of moisturizer before running out the door (or even in the few minutes before a shift starts when you get to work) is worth it in the long-run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so that was somewhat babbling, and i shall summarize:&lt;br /&gt;i couldn&#x27;t stick to proactiv until the green tea moisturizer came out because it was otherwise too irritating. now the green tea moisturizer is perfect to offset the dryness the toner and reparing lotion were causing, easy to apply, thin and not greasy, and very soothing. i recommend it to everyone, even those not using proactiv (which i only use bc i think my pore are kinda huge). it&#x27;s totally worth it.s and wrinkles of my face and just hte health of my skin.    i&#x27;m only 22 but i&#x27;m afraid that hte stress of my job (soon to graduate as a pharmacist!) is putting undue stress on my skin. and my disregard for the health of my skin (i&#x27;m quite pale, but in high school I used to play field hockey and was a champion mt biker, so I wore sunburn on my face like a prize) will soon take its toll.      i&#x27;ve read that we young folks should start taking care of our skin now, even those of us not into vanity- like me- because the extra ten minutes a day of applying a thin layer of moisturizer before running out the door (or even in the few minutes before a shift starts when you get to work) is worth it in the long-run.      so that was somewhat babbling, and i shall summarize:  i couldn&#x27;t stick to proactiv until the green tea moisturizer came out because it was otherwise too irritating. now the green tea moisturizer is perfect to offset the dryness the toner and reparing lotion were causing, easy to apply, thin and not greasy, and very soothing. i recommend it to everyone, even those not using proactiv (which i only use bc i think my pore are kinda huge). it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the product -- it is light on the skin and works! Plus, I love the price, love the transaction!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE my green tea moisturizer! It smells great and it actually lingers on your skin for a while. It leaves my skin soft. I have combination skin but mostly dry with some acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived just as promised. The size is pretty tiny but it does say 1 oz. But its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my skin regime: cleanse, toner, and then moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you proactiv! Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I have very oily and temperamental skin. This lotion not only leaves my clean skin feeling clean, it doesn&#x27;t make it oily or aggravated. I love the fresh scent and feel it gives to my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been trying it after AcneFree&#x27;s Green Tea Moisturizer was discontinued. It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out, since my skin is so sensitive and acne-prone. I got this one because it doesn&#x27;t have cetearyl or cetyl alcohol (emollient alcohols which can cause acne), which are used in almost every moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem pretty similar, but this one makes my face red for a while whenever I apply it, which seems weird to me, since a moisturizer should calm down the skin--not further irritate it. I&#x27;m going to be trying Mary Kay&#x27;s TimeWise Moisturizer for Combination/Oily Skin next, which also doesn&#x27;t have cetearyl or cetyl alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;ve since tried Mary Kay&#x27;s TimeWise Moisturizer for Combination/Oily Skin, and it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s great for my extremely sensitive skin. My skin still gets a little red when I apply it, but it goes away quickly and it&#x27;s nothing compared to the irritation this one elicited. Mary Kay&#x27;s just feels soothing and calming on my skin--and it doesn&#x27;t break me out! It&#x27;s relatively expensive, but worth it for me, since it&#x27;s been so hard to find a moisturizer that works. Also, make sure it&#x27;s the Combination/Oily skin one, since the Dry/Normal has different ingredients which include emollient alcohols.</li>
    <li> Very light and soaks right in, great for summer! Soothes my redness too. Just like it did when I used it in highschool.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin with break-outs and this moisturizer works and does not cause break-outs. It was an add-on purchase for me. At the price, buy a couple. It&#x27;s a fraction of the cost at the Proactiv cart in the mall.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is non-greasy and works pretty well. It also does not make me break out, which is good. The only downside is that the tube is a bit small for the price, and I go through it pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this to try to keep my skin from drying out during the winter months. I live in north west Indiana and it gets bitter cold. It works well.</li>
    <li> This item offers smooth facial skin care. The quality is great. It can be used as a professional skin care product at a salon or home.</li>
    <li> Great price! The green tea moisturizer works great, especially during the summer, it is light, non-greasy, and very light scent. It works great for combination skin.</li>
    <li> smells really good and but not sure of it moisturizing my face good because after i apply it my face still has dry spots</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, but have been stealing it and using it myself. Surprised how much I like it.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!  Most products for moisturizing the face gives me pimples.  This does not!  It is weightless &amp; wonderful!</li>
    <li> It is not very moisturizing but no acne, and I have very very acne prone skin. Only use this at night before  my benzoyl peroxide treatment. Pleasant smell. Not for dry skin</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it is light and soaks in quickly, but still does the job.  I&#x27;ve tried too many lotions that just sit on your skin.</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent, but didn&#x27;t really do anything wonderful for my skin. In fact, it made it a bit oilier.</li>
    <li> This item did not seem to work as well as the container that came with my original complete kit purchase.</li>
    <li> It helps tremendously, so glad I ordered it! I will always make sure that I have the green tea moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Originally I got this as a sample with my proactiv set, and I loved it! But when I looked into purchasing it through Proactiv, the price tag made me consider something else. The price is perfect on amazon! This stuff is great for priming your face before putting on foundation and the scent is cute! love it!!!</li>
    <li> I should probably start out by saying that I have SUPER sensitive skin! It is very prone to acne and yet is severely dry. So finding a good moisturizer is very important to me. I have been using this for about two months now. It hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, it is creamy but not in an oily way, it dries fast, almost too fast. Meaning that it sometimes leaves my face feeling tight. But this could be due to my overly dry skin. Overall good product and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer after applying a chemical peel and it provides wonderful moisture that is long lasting and it smells incredible.</li>
    <li> THIS MOISTURIZER IS VERY LGITHWEIGHT AND NOT GREASY AT ALL! IT HYDRATES YOUR SKIN AND PROVIDES NEEDED ANTIOXIDANTS.  SKIN LOOKS VERY HEALTHY!!</li>
    <li> love this product! leaves the askin without a greasy feeling and does not cause break outs. it is my go to moisterizer</li>
    <li> Nice and light moisturizer. Great if you have oily skin. Best I have found so far. Can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> Very gentile and does not clog pores. It does not feel heavy on the skin but rather feels refreshing. I have used it for years and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> No idea why this is so cheap here on amazon when it costs $30+ from Proactive.  You can definitely feel the difference.. a little dab and your face is silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I use it only when my face when I have a break out instead of my regular face cream, It&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t like the smell of it, it&#x27;s not bad I just prefer no smell at all.</li>
    <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill. But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
    <li> One of my two favorite moisturizers.  The big difference between this one and the other that I use is that this one is cheaper (currently $8 an ounce vs $28 an ounce) and the other one is way more moisturizing.  I love both and use both though.  As far as this one goes I find that it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin (skin is sensitive) and it doesn&#x27;t cause more breakouts (most of mine are hormone cycle related).  This is one of the only two Proactiv products I use.  I had tried their full setup when I was younger, but it just made everything worse (it did work for my sibling though).  I like this and find that it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 extra tubes of this moisturizer.  I found it great for my oily/dry skin.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Her face is really dry, especially in the winter with the dry heat.  It is not moisturizing, but in fact drying.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now, with and without the proactiv or proactiv+ systems, and it is a skin-craving product. My skin adores this! It&#x27;s very lightweight, sweet smelling (not overpowering), hydrating, calming, smoothing, and rich in antioxidants. I love the fact that it has Green Tea in it, because Green Tea is known for its many soothing and anti-aging properties. Don&#x27;t believe me? I&#x27;ve researched this ingredient so many times, plus any dermatologist or skin-care professional will most likely tell you the same thing. So basically you&#x27;re getting five- in- one results:&lt;br /&gt;Hydration, Gentle Anti-Aging, Smoothness, Calamity, and non-greasy nor oily skin. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Like a BB Cream, but without the Color!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need any of the other products that proactive offers, but I did try this and I am madly in love.  Not only does it work on my aged skin (I&#x27;m almost 65) but it smells so wonderful. It works so very well and I do and would recommend this to everyone.  We have hot air heat and so it&#x27;s not only age but environment that I deal with. I have used this product since I received it and have been so pleased with my skin.  Thank you for such a wondewrful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with proactive products but being that I have a mature skin I realize not all of them are going to great for my skin at this stage. I purchased green tea moisturizer but no longer use it on my face. It&#x27;s been moved to the hand lotion category for me.</li>
    <li> Been using this product to reduce my facial oil production as part of my facial health routine. This product has definitely contributed to healthier appearance and shine reduction.</li>
    <li> Honestly, there&#x27;s not much really to describe here.  It is a light weight moisturizer that works really well.  At no point in my time using this product has my skin felt oily after putting it on, nor have I broken out as a result of using this product.  There is no odor and you don&#x27;t even have to use very much to get the job done!</li>
    <li> This product is so wonderful for my skin! It fixed my dry skin problem in just a couple of days!</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose. It&#x27;s very light on the skin. It smells great too. I need it in the winter time because my skin is so dry.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I am 61 years young and it is great</li>
    <li> I got free sample of this moisturizer with my proactive kit and i really liked it, so i ordered a full size one. This product really smoothes ur skin and u can feel that ur skin is moisturized. It makes ur makeup look better too. :)</li>
    <li> It feels amazing on my skin, its super refreshing. I love it, i use it every day and its great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. After you put it on your skin feels like silk. Very clean feeling. I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Both of my children have used this product in the past.  We had a left over tube that they no longer needed.  My husband decided to give it a try last winter.  We live in Wisconsin and had a really rough winter!!! His face was dry with the low humidity in our home and at his office.  He didn&#x27;t want to use anything oily on his skin.  This product gave his face just enough moisture without any greasy feel and he as not experienced any breakouts.  He balked at the price for the small tube but he uses so little.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this and it has done a decent job of moisturizing through the summer. I probably wont be able to use it for the winter though.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but these moisturizer balances it out so well.  My skin is sift and supple without having to worry about &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; as the day progresses.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot because it is very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily. I will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this to add to my cleansing repertoire of Proactiv. However, it has a sorta funky scent, but nice smoothness, Not saturating/moisturizing enough for me in the winter time though. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I have oily,brake out prone skin. Every other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried (even expensive ones) clogs my pores or makes me feel like I have gunk on my skin. This stuff just melts on my skin and completely absorbs controlling oily ness without drying. Very light and refreshing . Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pro-activ for the last 11 years; and let me tell you,this is the best thing that they could have come up with!!! A little bit of moisture for the face that wasn&#x27;t too heavy, nor greasy!!! I love this!!!</li>
    <li> It work wonderfully .great for using under foundation and just in general .keep face really soft. Very happy with it</li>
    <li> I love this moisterizer! Very light, not greasy and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like most other moisterizers do. Dries quickly and my face gets less oily during the day.</li>
    <li> After using this, my face felt oil-free. I felt like it didn&#x27;t moisturize me face at all. But i guess that is the magic of it! I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> i just started using this when i got it a couple days ago and my zits are already starting to clear up and my face feel s very soft. i love it so much. its a must get! make sure to get 2 of these cause you will run out quickly!</li>
    <li> Another excellent Proactiv product.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that lives in a harsh winter climate.  It moisturizes without clogging your pores.</li>
    <li> I love proactiv products, they work better than anything I have ever tried, and I have tried many acne products. This lotion feels really nice and smell really good. It moisturizes with out being too much or greasy.</li>
    <li> Other than a little eyeliner and lipstick, this is all I use on my face.  Great moisturizer! People always ask me what I use and tell me my skin looks nice.</li>
    <li> Good product, but wish it came in bigger packages</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer as it feels light on the face and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all. It does its job well, as I&#x27;m used to my face getting dry when I travel, but since I started using this, not anymore. Perfect size for travel too.</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion ever! It feels so great going on and gives just the right amount of moisture. It is great for all ages and skin type, both myself and my teenage daughter love it! My daughters acne is finally improving since she started using this instead of the original lotion that comes in the Proactiv set.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good. My skin was getting dried out using the Proactiv three step program, so I tried using Clean and Clear&#x27;s moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t help much at all. It uses salycidic acid, which is better than nothing, but not as good as this. The only problem is that it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but unless you&#x27;re on a really tight budget it&#x27;s not that bad. A little bit goes a long way and it won&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the rest of the Proactiv line, because I really don&#x27;t have an acne problem. My sister got some of this moisturizer for Christmas, and I used a bit of it, and I really liked it. Even though it is a bit expensive, I decided to buy a small bottle of it for myself.   I use this once at night and once in the morning before/after I put/take my makeup on/off. It feels amazing on my skin. You can feel the green tea in it, and it sort of wakes up your skin. It has a very light, very pleasant smell, and it makes your face super soft. I don&#x27;t even have to use my primer before I put on my makeup now because this moisturizer basically does the work of a moisturizer and a primer. I love this stuff! My only complaint is that it is SO expensive, you could go broke buying this stuff every month. But I truly believe it is worth it. If I take care of my skin now when I&#x27;m in my 20s, it will look great in my 40s.   Try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great stuff especially in the cold.</li>
    <li> Feels too light like I didn&#x27;t even put moisturizer on but if light is what ur going for that&#x27;s great. I like to feel like I actually put lotion on. So I will find another acne moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It is good but you must buy over like 5 or 8 of those to see the results</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t burn!!! very soothing</li>
    <li> you will feel re-fresh , it has a nice smell it makes you want to nap.</li>
    <li> Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Too small of a bottle... :(</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my acne prone skin after using this product.</li>
    <li> I have seen definite improvements in my skin since I have started using this. Less pimples and clearer skin tone.</li>
    <li> Bottle was out of date</li>
    <li> This product works great for my combination-to-oily skin. It is an effective moisturizer that has a nice light texture, absorbs within seconds, and keeps my face fresh and shine-free throughout the day. I&#x27;m well past my teenage years, so I cannot really speak to this product&#x27;s acne-fighting abilities, but I did notice that it makes any redness or dryness on my skin go away faster. Oh, and Amazon&#x27;s price on 1oz add-on item is a sweet deal!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  I have tried to find natural or organic products that feel as good as this and have not been successful. I keep giving into buying this moisturizer because it is so perfect-feeling on my skin!</li>
    <li> Received this order in 2 days!!! Compared to how much it would be to buy it in the store you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv products for seven years now. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any of their other products besides the three step acne kit and the sulfur masks. This product is good for my dry, flakey skin, but I do have one complaint. Towards the end of the evening this product starts to irritate my eyes making them burn and I don&#x27;t even put the product but on and around my nose and above my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by green tea being in the name, this is not a natural product.  I ordered it for my sensitive skin and was extremely disappointed when I received it and saw that it contained parabens!  I&#x27;ll give this away to someone less sensitive and go back to either Alba Botanica oil free Hawaiian moisture or juice beauty&#x27;s oil free moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t help control oil on my nose either. The other moisturizers I mentioned did a much better job than this one and cost about the same per oz.</li>
    <li> Very smooth moisture and keep my face fresh. If you have a dry face in winter, this is a great moisture to purchase for your face. The price is low compared to other top brand moistures, but their effects are similar.</li>
    <li> The Proactiv products are overpriced and undersized. There are more natural and cheap ways to help problem skin, such as honey.</li>
    <li> i like this moisturizer because it feels more like a serum than your typical lotion. Its greaseless and light yet sinks in nice and fully moisturizes morning till night and vice versa. The only drawback is its small size~i wish it was twice the size</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Green Tea Moisturizer. It is a quality product and it is great if your skin is very dry or you just need a pick me up. It has that little bit of coolness factor that leaves you feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect!  It absorbs quickly, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and a little goes a long way.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone using Proactiv or any other facial care product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so surprised by this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s like spreading pure moisture on your face.  It&#x27;s not a cream so there&#x27;s no oily feeling at all - it&#x27;s like a clear lightweight gel that absorbs quickly and feels like you have nothing on.  It&#x27;s different from anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before (and is great!)</li>
    <li> Love this face lotion, very light but still moisturizing. I will keep ordering this product over and over and I am very picky about lotion!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is everything I wanted, hydrating , moisturizing, and does not clog pours. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It leaves my skin really soft and it has a nice scent :)  I just ordered some more!</li>
    <li> I have used Proactiv products for years but had never tried the Green Tea Moisture.  It works really good and does not leave my face feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Perfect for moisturizing my oily skin after washing my face. It does it&#x27;s job and I don&#x27;t find my face drying out quickly or looking too oily.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It is light, the smell is nice, not too strong and it doesn&#x27;t cause breaks out. I use it especially on my cheeks, since my &amp;#34; T &amp;#34; zone doesn&#x27;t need to be moisturized as much. I recommand it to people with sensitive skin who can&#x27;t tolerate parfumed cream. More, it doesn&#x27;t cost much. I hope it has helped you make a desicion.</li>
    <li> Good price, small but you also only need to put a small amount on face, smells great and face already feels softer and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it helps with my dry skin in the winter but doesnt clogs my pores andactually soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because of how light it is. The sent is also light and good. Too expensive to buy at a kiosk,thanks  for having it here!</li>
    <li> Smooth face with no oily residue, I would buy it again. Hope that they start making it a little bigger though, cause for the price its tiny</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, dry and oily at the same time and this product works very well at controlling the oily skin without sacrificing moisture.</li>
    <li> great buy. I would recommend to buy the 2.5 ounces from this company it gets you longer for what you pay and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of &amp; therefore do not use Proactive acne wash, toner or repairing lotion (that stuff exacerbated my blemishes &amp; made my skin oily &amp; shiny) BUT, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this Proactive Green Tea Moisturizer! It helps to alleviate redness &amp; blemishes, it plumps up fine lines &amp; wrinkles making them diminish, it serves as the absolute BEST under eye cream I have ever used (&amp; trust me I have very bad under eye circles from allergies &amp; heredity) &amp; it absorbs into the skin very quickly without just sitting on the surface like most moisturizers do. It is NOT greasy AT ALL &amp; it has a lovely, fresh, clean scent. It is my miracle all-in-one product! Seriously, if I were on a remote island &amp; could only have one beauty product... THIS would be it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please NEVER, EVER stop making this stuff &amp; keep it affordable!</li>
    <li> 1. Very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;2. Awakens skin, and face&lt;br /&gt;3. Isn&#x27;t shiny and doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because my facial complexion suffers the most during the many seasons of Texas. During the summer, my skin gets too oily, during the winter it&#x27;s too dry, and it&#x27;s everything else in between. LOVE LOVE LOVE it so far. Definitely wakes me up, and relieves a little of the puffiness I have after waking up. It smells great, goes on clear, and my skin just soaks it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it isn&#x27;t really shiny, so it goes great underneath my makeup (BB cream, powder foundation, bronzer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product to anyone. Great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> At times (winter) my skin gets a little too dry &amp; flakey, at temples and, forehead. Use Green Tree on the areas, soothes and moisturizes almost immediately.  Little bit goes a long way. Very light formula and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work for my skin it makes it too oily but everyone has different skin type. My skin is dry and oily combination skin. Didnt like it at all, made my skin red with a rash.</li>
    <li> This product works great, is nongreasy and smells good.  Need to purchase it in a larger size, 1 ounce does not go a long way.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> After using the proactive + my face started peeling. This moisturizer helped a lot!!! very light weight and it&#x27;s great that i can use it as needed. Will be buying this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. There&#x27;s no greasy feeling or anything like that. I really enjoy that you can put it on and that it never reminds you that it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Did not like the scent.</li>
    <li> its alright....its s upper small bottle and smells good. I just have very dry skin so I used a lot fairly quick. I like how it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores but honestly need something a lil longer last because I have to constantly re apply.</li>
    <li> i use every moisturizer for my face and this one is very light !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very recommend! and i think ima buy this again once i ran out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son who is developing some acne. I have him using t Seems to be working wellhis after his acne wash cleanse.</li>
    <li> i just use it once but it good for moisturizing all night.&lt;br /&gt;i hope it can make my skin looks better</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I hate this product, HOWEVER I won&#x27;t purchase it again.  It burns my skin, turns really red and doesn&#x27;t feel nourished at all.  Pretty certain it would be a great product for someone without sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a natural formula in an acne product.  It works in sync with the 3 step system.  Apply to keep your skin supple and healthy and less dry and flaky</li>
    <li> works and smells great very light lotion.&lt;br /&gt;very fast service. I would order it again also other products too nice</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t moisturize very well.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I do not care much for Proactiv products. There are only one or two items that I think are really worth the price and this is one of them. Moisturizes my face and quickly heals dry spots (overnight) without making me break out or leaving an oily mess. If you have trouble using any moisturizers on your face, this product is worth trying.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I suffered with very dry skin on my face this last winter.  I tried several very mild moisturizers, all fragrance free and ALL caused me to break out on my cheeks and chin even if they swore they wouldn&#x27;t all over the packaging.  I had used Proactiv products years ago so I looked for something from them to try and found this Green Tea Moisturizer. While I didn&#x27;t have to use it every day, it did the trick. I was able to end the tight and dry feeling and NOT have to worry I was about to cause a breakout. However, for reason that make no sense to me, it is MUCH cheaper to order a few of these small 1 ounce tubes of the product than one of the larger version and you get more of the product.  So, I always buy this smaller size and just keep one in my office, one in my bathroom, etc.  How a smaller sized product costs MUCH less per ounce than the larger version escapes me, but keep an eye on that when buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I use it before gym because is not greasy, also during humid summer days because my face is dry in the morning. Cool feeling on face. Bought two on Amazon. Great price.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works great and if used twice a day everyday it will make your skin feel very soft. Its great for those that use Proactiv 3 step system which can severely dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, no irritation. Not sure how much it improves skin but it is a great smelling neutral balm on oily skin</li>
    <li> The scent of the green tea extract in this moisturizer is divine.  It won&#x27;t cause breakouts and is the perfect amount of moisture (both in the oily areas of my face and the dry ones).  This might be my favorite Proactive product.  Despite having highly sensitive skin, I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or redness mentioned by other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch Amazon for the \\&quot;add on\\&quot; deals and stock up.</li>
    <li> This Proactive moisture leaves your skin feeling super soft and is gentle on your skin. I use other Proactive products, and wanted to ensure I used a safe moisture that would not increase skin break outs. This product was wonderful. I highly recommend this product. Great customer service and fast delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I originally wasn&#x27;t using this on a daily basis so I had the same one for about a year and a half (yes it still did the job) but the newer one has a different scent and feel which is nice and has made me use it everyday. This is the only product I have used that really controls my oily face and makes it feel very refreshed. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin like other moisturizers!! I use it after Proactiv 3 steps. After using it every day for a couple of weeks, I really felt mi skin more hydrated.</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin too well, it almost seems like the area I used it is more noticeable with dry spots.  Not to mention the parabens.  I am trying to eliminate the parabens from all my bath and beauty products.  Sorry Proactiv.</li>
    <li> While I love Proactive products, this particular moisturizer -sadly- didn&#x27;t meet my needs. Instead of helping my problem area on my face, it made it worse-and I even broke out from it. :( I knew it was a small bottle when I bought it, but didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go through it as quickly as I did either. It&#x27;s too bad there isn&#x27;t a product out there that WILL help that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm &amp; a leg.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about the products on my face because of how prone I am to breakouts.  My skin is very oily and usually moisturizers make my skin feel sticky and thick.  That is definitely not the case with the Green Tea Moisturizer, it is so light and makes my skin feel quenched, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Feels light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, I&#x27;d recommend it to people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to breakout</li>
    <li> Absorbs very quickly, not greasy at all, but has an overpowering smell. Will not buy it again because of the incredibly strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It is my first time using it.  I need a moisturizer to wear under my make up and this is perfect considering I am currently using the the 3 step system and I did not want anything to conteract that.  I think I would purchase the moisturizer after my skin is clear.</li>
    <li> Like most people I spent my share of money trying to find a moisturizer that does just that without adding to or causing breakouts.  I am not a user of Proactive products but thought I would give this a try given most of the reviews were positive.  I have the t-zone area oily problem, and in the winter the rest of my face tends to get dry.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Face is soft and no breakouts.  My son uses it and he feels the same.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough. Many of you might like it for that reason, but I found my skin still felt dry after using. I really like the Burts Bees natural acne solutions lotion. Seriously though, I stopped the entire harsh proactiv system and my skin looks better than ever now. (Going dairy free helps too. ) After trying everything, (Clinique, proactiv, neutrogena, clearasil, Burt&#x27;s Bees) I now use the Body Shop Tea Tree soap and toner and have never been happier.</li>
    <li> Though it feels a slightly drying.....I feel it to be necessary for the complete acne system. I&#x27;ve tried to use my old moisturizers but they end up clogging the pores that I have just cleaned out. It is nice and light, non greasy, and I don&#x27;t want to use anything else with my proactiv system.</li>
    <li> but after a wash or shower my face is super dry. This works really well in soothing my skin. It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily later on in the day either.</li>
    <li> My teen-aged daughter loves this moisturizer and uses it all the time.  She had tried various other products prior to this one and didn&#x27;t like them nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting ready to leave on a short trip last week and didn&#x27;t want to take my regular moisturizer since the bottle is large and I grabbed one of these and threw it in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise to find out how much I liked it.  I used it under my makeup in the morning and the foundation went on extremely smoothly.  At night before going to bed, I used this again on areas of my face that were dry (didn&#x27;t use it over my entire face).  It kept my skin hydrated in this dry winter weather we are having and I loved the way my skin felt.  I didn&#x27;t need to use a large quantity to get the benefits of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product I will be ordering for myself as well as for her from now on.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and the Mary Kay Velocity Moisturizer cream to see which was better and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv Solution Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No funky smell, goes on really well leave no film on skin after application. Feel light weight and make my skin feel soft and not greasy. Keeps my skin hydrated in winter and none greasy in the summer. Skins is also not shiny after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Small bottle going to have to reorder soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay Velocity Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: very thick, provides moisture, big bottle, there is a partner face wash which can be purchased as a set with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:Leave a film, the film is bothersome enough because even an hour after application it causes my foundation to turn color and looked patchy and matted. Also makes your skin very SHINY. Causes any sweat you may have on your face to smell and you can feel the moisturizer melting off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the price difference in these two is 15 bucks. In my opinion and experience Proactiv wins this round by a mile. This proves you don&#x27;t have to break your wallet to get pretty skin. I love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> This is the only proactiv product I was very impressed with. I was happy to find it on Amazon which means I don&#x27;t have to deal with Proactiv&#x27;s horrible customer service or ridiculous subscriptions. I have combination skin that gets very dry around my nose and t-zone. This helps with that and is not greasy AT ALL! It&#x27;s very soothing and very lightweight. I recommend this to everyone, regardless of skin type. It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
    <li> Just like the three step system this is another product I love from proactiv! It feels absolutely amazing when you apply it to your face, it feels soooo creamy soft but not oily feeling. This goes great with my bare minerals that I use. I have sensitive skin also so this is another reason I love it because my face doesnt get all red when I use this! :)</li>
    <li> In my humble opinion, this is the best facial moisturizer for acne-prone skin out on the market. Its pretty darn expensive for a moisturizer of its size; however, considering others are WAYYYYY more expensive and don&#x27;t do the trick, this is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---It is not oily after application.&lt;br /&gt;---It absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;---No overbearing scent (lightly scented)&lt;br /&gt;---Don&#x27;t need to apply large amount.&lt;br /&gt;---Spreads well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product on and off since Proactiv came out. While I do not find the product set to be effective for me, the green tea moisturizer is totally worth it. If you can find it separately, like you can sometimes here on amazon, pick it up.</li>
    <li> Not a great price for such a small tube, but it absorbs so quickly into my skin - it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue either.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes my face, but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, i love this face lotion i just hate that it can be so expensive!</li>
    <li> It was soothing while it was still wet, which only lasted about 10 seconds, then my face felt even drier afterward.</li>
    <li> The reviews here are misleading. I have normal skin, and it is true that it absorbs quickly, but it does not moisturize. My skin does not feel soft after.</li>
    <li> a great consistency great to use after the Nuetrogena grapefruit oil free cleansing wash&lt;br /&gt;and i would recommend buying this size first if you have never purchased it</li>
    <li> It does not block my pores. It&#x27;s great. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Proactiv for years...</li>
    <li> much smaller than picture but it is a very good product</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very soft and minty. I&#x27;m going to buy a gallon of this stuff. I really wish I would have tried it ages ago.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin that can also be prone to breakout.  This is a great solution.  Its not quite as moisturizing as some creams but it also doesn&#x27;t break my skin out.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years.  It also has a pleasant but not overwhelming scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same people who developed the proactive line have started their own new line (Rodan and Fields) which is also worth checking out.  They have all sorts of skin care stuff including a &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; proactive line.  I use this in conjunction with some of those products with no issues.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  Just bought a 10 pack.  It&#x27;s the only moisturizer she uses on her face.</li>
    <li> I really love this product- though i do not have acne.  It will make a great summer-time, light facial cream.</li>
    <li> I recieved this container and there was no seal on it. I did not bother to return it as it wouldn&#x27;t have been worth my time for such a small item that wasnt worth that much. I have ordered from Proactiv directly before and the tubes had a seal on them in addition to the cap.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling moisturizer but I had to put a lot of if on my face.  I have dry skin so was surprised this moisturizer didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
    <li> Is not too heavy or greasy, but fairly light.  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work miracles either.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this. Its so light and refreshing. My favorite. It would be a 5 naturally but my bottle didn&#x27;t seem quite full but maybe I got a defective one.</li>
    <li> light and cooling on the skin used as part of my routine</li>
    <li> Works well in moisturizing while you have it on but after you wash it off your skin is still dry. Smells great, and is very light. Not bad</li>
    <li> This goes on really smooth &amp; silky..... buttttttttt it leaves my face realllyyyyyyyyyy really oily &amp; shiny after a while.</li>
    <li> this is a very light  moisturizer. feels great on the skin, non greasy. if you like rich texture maybe this is not for you.</li>
    <li> I know this stuff works but isn&#x27;t there a less expensive product that works the same... Maybe someone out there knows.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer, the best I&#x27;ve tried for oily skin. Lightweight, absorbs quickly, moisturize the skin. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and texture. It gives my skin a smooth healthy feel and causes no breakouts whatsoever. In fact, I think it helps keep them away. This is NOT for someone with dry skin though - it does not provide a heavy moisturizer to the skin. No greasy feel at all. Try finding a truly non-comedogenic moisturizer - there are very few. This one is great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different face moisturizers and this one is the best. I have combination skin and it never leaves my skin feeling oily. It absorbs into your skin very nicely and smells pretty good, too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand the big deal about Pro-Active products.  Another one that did not work for me.  Once was a test, twice I failed, no third time for me.</li>
    <li> I am 40 yrs old and constantly. Have acne issues. Not heavy oily zit action like when I was a teen... more of the red blotches and tiny white heads here and there, I guess more like just having sensitive skin. I started using this moisturizer after I learned that drying my face out with soap was actually causing my skin to push more oil out to try and fix the problem. So I countered the dry outer layer of my face with this moisturizer. Now I have known for years I needed to use a moisturizer but hated all the oily non absorbing products. I can use this at night and not have to worry about any getting on my pillow. This stuff is keeping the red spots away and has helped even out my skins oil balance so its spot free/ zit free. Took about 4 days to see it start working and 1-2 weeks all was fully cleared. It has no real smell and I use it 1-2 times a day (I forget to use it sometimes also).&lt;br /&gt; Overall I recoment you at least give it a try if you have any issues like me. I understand everyone has different issues as far as what it takes for them to clear up/ help balance their skin. Just know that this works great on the dry and/or slightly oily skin (the kind where by the end of the day you have a slight amount built up, not a ton and a simple wipe with even a dry towel can clear up). red spotty dryer skin will be nothing more then past memories before you know it. But like I said... everyones different and this may not work for you. I think if you have overly oily skin you should get the pills from DR to clear that up (or do the proactive system) but then for sure use this to keep your skin happy and moisturized (I am sure I repeated myself throughout this review, Just wanted to ensure you knew what I was trying to get across... hope it helped you out. I base almost all my buying decisions on reviews I read so I like to return the knowledge).</li>
    <li> this is a great moisturizer for oily skin i use this product all of the time i definatley recommend this</li>
    <li> This is just an amazing face moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all, works well on dry patches I have.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. I&#x27;ve used about half of mine and find it a very refreshing moisturizer for my skin for when it&#x27;s particularly red or dry from sun, working out or other environmental causes. It&#x27;s packaging isn&#x27;t just a plastic tube, it&#x27;s a higher grade material which I like. When you put it on, a little goes a long way, but then you&#x27;ll want to put on more because your neck or hairline feels neglected from this very hydrating product. I do think the green tea helps with redness and dryness somewhat, maybe more with more regular use, but then you may want a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s extremely light and does not leave your face looking or smelling greasy. I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and will not use anything else now. My skin looks pretty good.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference &amp; I used the entire tube before I made this review.</li>
    <li> I can feel my face is no longer dry and has consistently been hydrated in only 2 days of use. Very satistfied.</li>
    <li> I was unsure at first,I have sensitive skin, but I love this, it seems to work great and not irritate my skin. I have almost finished the bottle, I need to buy more soon!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling very smooth, not at all oily. I used a sunscreen by EltaMD after applying the Green Tea Moisturizer.  Need a large tube.</li>
    <li> I used this first from a little sample tube that came with my husbands proactive set. I LOVE IT!!! I put it on after I wash my face, before bed time. I wake up with my face feeling super supple and smooth. It is a nice, cool, refreshing and light moisturizer. BUY IT!!! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son who has used the Proactive products in the past. They really do work if used properly. My son actually said that he liked this and wants to use to all the time.</li>
    <li> Since going through menopause, I am prone to both rosacea and acne. I love this moisturizer because it calms my rosacea without clogging pores and causing breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It makes my face feel so soft and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out!  I will definitely buy it again!</li>
</ol>
