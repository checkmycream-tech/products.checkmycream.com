<li> This may be because I am used to over-perfumed Western products, so take that with a grain of salt, but the bigger issue I had was that it instantly stripped my face, leaving it feeling dry and tight.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, and your skin feels so soft afterward.</li>
<li> You only need a tiny amount (I used half a pea size).</li>
<li> if you have dry or sensitive skin, and just don&#x27;t want to use heavy products on it.</li>
<li> I have dry skin and this never ever has left my skin feeling tight or irritated, even after double cleansing and using tretinoin.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and cleanses well even when I haven&#x27;t removed makeup.</li>
<li> Dry skin folks may need to avoid.</li>
<li> Product has a strange and slightly off-putting smell.</li>
<li> I accidentally got a bit in my mouth and it tastes awful.  </li>

    <li> This is one of the best facial products I&#x27;ve ever used.  My skin felt wonderful immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I see a definite improvement and will review it again when  I&#x27;ve complete  this jar _ could be a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleanser! I used to be in the makeup industry and I love the consistency, cleansing power and moisturizing effect. Very clean. You only need a tiny amount (I used half a pea size). Wet face first, foam cleanser in hands and work into skin. I noticed a visible difference after using this product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> worth the cash. great product!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for the price...</li>
    <li> Good stuff, will buy more</li>
    <li> Did not like the product smell</li>
    <li> I really like this face soap!  It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dried out after I use it like most do.  Although the one thing I can say is you should definitely avoid getting it in your mouth... I accidentally got a bit in my mouth and it tastes awful.  Its also unscented which can be nice.</li>

    <li> I love this face wash! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and cleanses well even when I haven&#x27;t removed makeup. I use a pea sized amount morning and night and haven&#x27;t gotten any irritation or breakouts.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve tried but I am satisfied with it. Bought it a set. I would buy again if discounted or in a set.</li>
    <li> nice creamy texture but this stuff really stings when it gets into your eyes! I still much prefer the Fresh soy cleanser or the Sunday Riley ceramic slip cleanser with my Clarisonic.</li>

    <li> Love this product.  It leaves my face clean and soft.  I will reorder it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 weeks but I do notice improved moisturization and it cleans nicely.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this never ever has left my skin feeling tight or irritated, even after double cleansing and using tretinoin. No sulfates, right pH (all hada labo products have a pH between 5 &amp; 6.5). Does an excellent job of removing oils. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a cleanser.</li>
    <li> Best facial wash I have used in a long time! Buying there whole line of product! The Japanese women have all the beauty secrets and now now I do too!!</li>
    <li> The consistency reminds me of Origins Checks &amp; Balances. Doesn&#x27;t smell great - little to no smell really, but it feels wonderful, and leaves my skin super soft, not dry and tight feeling, and not greasy feeling either.  Very thick and creamy and foams nicely. I have been using Philosophy Purity for ages and I like this better, and it&#x27;s cheaper.  This brand makes a wonderful moisturizer too!</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser! I was previously using Shiseido&#x27;s Perfect Whip cleanser, which I was ok with until I realized that that &#x27;tight&#x27; feeling I got afterwards did not equate to actually being clean.
