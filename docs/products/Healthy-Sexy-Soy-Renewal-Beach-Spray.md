<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. It really does make beach waves. My hair is super straight and I don&#x27;t have time to style it in the morning so this product is awesome.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I have long hair, defines my curls nicely :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more of this product line!</li>
    <li> Smells like the beach and gives hair great texture without being too sticky. Just don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that has been messy and difficult for years. Now I am 20, have a good haircut at meduium long length, and when my hair is wet i  curl it around my fingers in pieces. I spray this afterward and have pretty curls all day. And the next morning if all I have done is slept on them.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome to add some texture to your hair. It&#x27;s not sticky like hair spray it&#x27;s nice and soft in your hair and helps keep the style in place</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding this in stores, and it takes my semi-wavy hair to loose beachy curls. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and I had some left when I used the new bottle.  It didn&#x27;t smell the same and it didn&#x27;t feel the same in my hair.  I was very disappointed because I was left wondering if it was watered down or tampered with in some way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Helps frizz, and you can even scrunch with it to help get those beachhead waves! I usually use it before I blow dry my hair and I&#x27;ve even just used it by itself. I love it! BUT, the bottles leak! The seam at the bottom hasn&#x27;t held up well so I have to buy another bottle to pour the product into.</li>
    <li> This works great for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with that said, something in this gave me an increasingly severe rash where ever my hair touched my shoulders, face, ears and neck.  After eliminating many other things from my daily use I finally eliminated this and amazingly the rashes finally started to go away.  Upon reading the ingredients I noticed there was algae, an unusual item I thought.  But whether it was the algae or something else in it eliminating it from my day and washing everything my hair had come into contact with stopped the eczema type rash.</li>
    <li> my hair is a bit damaged and quite thick and very wavy. I was a bit skeptical when I received this in the mail but so far this is my favorite hair item received and is definitely worth every penny. it makes my hair have the most gorgeous curls and makes it look very healthy! i will be purchasing this again and i would recommend it for everyone it works wonders!! just remember not to over load your hair on this stuff it could make it feel a bit sticky if you put too much on....</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for a product that makes my wavy hair look manageable, and this is the best I have found. No dryer needed- just spray, scrunch, and go for perfect beach waves!</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping from seller.  This product is rated A+++  My hair is as thin and straight as hair can be.  This product is the only one in the line of beach texture waves that does not leave my hair sticky or appearing greasy and it provides exactly what it describes....wavy beach hair.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Smells fabulous too!</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve found in awhile.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Only downside was shipping, about a quarter leaked out and was all over the bottle. :(</li>
    <li> I have short hair and the product helps to manage it very well, you can have any look you want with it. It took a bit of practice to get the right amount on but once I figured that out it is great. I found a bit of blow drying after use worked best for me, rather than just air drying. You need to play with it a bit to find what works best for you. I would recommend anyone giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this product. I received a sample and I would definitely buy the full-sized bottle once the sample runs out. I spray it all over damp, towel-dried hair, scrunch with fingers and usually let it air dry, and it makes my curly hair tame for hot summer days when it&#x27;s simply too humid to attempt to straighten it. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue. I do feel that I need to apply a lot of the product though to get results. On extra humid days I might mix this with a little bit of mousse to give my curls some more lasting structure.</li>
    <li> I have a very short bob (slightly shorter than chin length) and was trying to find something to give me beachy, loose waves and have been struggling because of the length. My hairdresser recommended this and I&#x27;m so glad she did! My hair isn&#x27;t particularly wavy after using this and letting my hair air-dry but the texture and volume is amazing! Looks even better than after the beach! I can also use my 1.5&amp;#34; hair straightener (despite the short length) to give myself the loose waves I&#x27;m looking for and it&#x27;s exactly the look I wanted!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I totally love it, gives me perfect beach curls at any time. I just apply it with a bit of mousse to hold the curls and perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh! of curse you have to know how to work your hair to form the curls with your hands while the hair is still wet.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...gives just enough texture</li>
    <li> The bottle had leaked in the plastc and box so almost half of it was wasted.  I called to ask them about itand no one ever hot back to mr.  Very unhappy due to this being expensive and 1/2 empty.</li>
    <li> Love this spray. I was using the brand Not Your Mothers and I like the way Healthy Sexy Hair feels so much better. It doesn&#x27;t leave that gucky feeling in your hair like NYMs</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair look and feel great.</li>
    <li> we use this to take out tangles it works good on our &amp;#34;rats&amp;#34; nice size bottle and sprayer works great !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great hair product !</li>
    <li> Product came in when expected, only 1 of the bottles was leaking, but not to bad. The lid must have just came loose. Suggest maybe putting a strip of tape over the lid to keep in place. :)</li>
    <li> This review is for my favorite hair product of all time, Healthy Sexy Hair’s Beach Spray. I have baby-fine, thin hair. It&#x27;s not straight and not curly, but a bit wavy. I bought this at my hairdresser&#x27;s shop but have since reordered on Amazon as needed because the price is much lower. It makes me look like I actually have full, thick, tousled and textured wavy hair!!! I love the texture of my hair after spraying it on wet, scrunching, and letting my hair air dry. This “hairstyle” only takes about 30 seconds to create. If you don’t like air drying, you could spray it on, scrunch, and then blow-dry. Once dry, my hair feels full and springy, not limp and thin like it does without the product. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every other beach spray on the market over the past two years, and none are this good. It is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy or brittle, yet it provides a great feeling texture. You can tell there’s something in your hair, but it’s not heavy. It has a light perfumed fragrance that smells lovely, but not overwhelming. One bottle lasts me about a month with daily use. The bottle itself has a spray pump which never jams, and the internal straw attached to it actually goes all the way to the bottom of the bottle so you are not wasting the last few drops of the product.  It’s a huge pet peeve of mine when product packaging does not allow you to get the last little bit of product out. I will order this forever!</li>
    <li> I am SO excited to finally find a product that works on my hair and is easy to use. My hair is mid-back length, thick, and heavy (Cuban, Italian, and Native American background). I have slight natural wave combined with straight sections. I have struggled for years to find a product that would encourage the wave I had without leaving a sticky mess or weighing it down too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved close to the beach and wanted a more relaxed look. I ended up buying this on a whim because I like the fact that it has Argan Oil in it to help tame the frizz and counteract the normally drying Sea Salt. The first time I used it I got out of the shower, brushed my hair and sprayed the Beach Spray throughout. I did not touch it or do anything else. I went to bed with a wet head and woke up to the BEST WAVES! My waves were defined, not frizzy, and my hair looked shiny. I didn&#x27;t want to disturb the waves so I slightly brushed the hair at my crown so I didn&#x27;t look too bed-heady and walked out the door. The waves lasted all day, a miracle because of the weight of my hair, and the next day I dampened my hair and reapplied more for a secong wavy-full day. I tried to go for a third day but felt at that point it got too crunchy feeling for me (light a light hair spray) and I ended up washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back to buy four more bottles. Went to Ulta today and they sell it for $19.95/bottle; no thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: This product works best if you spray it on and leave it alone (preferably go to sleep). The longer you can refrain from touching or brushing your hair the better. You can extend the life of your waves by lightly dampening your hair and reapplying some more product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girl friend as she requested it. Shes been using it for a while now at the beach and says she loves and wants me to buy more already...</li>
    <li> Great product for thin or fine hair. Gives lots of volume. Is not sticky or heavy and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I keep ordering it because I like the volume I get if I spray it at my roots before I blow dry.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair - not curly, not straight - just plain wavy. It needs a little something, something to keep the wave throughout the day. This product is great for that. A few sprtiz and scrunch and it give my fine waves nice texture and very light hold.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and I use this as a light hairspray! it holds my flyaways but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy and nasty like hairspray and has a oceany smell.</li>
    <li> I have used other beach sprays and I really like the smell and the texture this product gives my hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair gunky and uncombable. It felt sticky and had a lot of residue.</li>
    <li> A lovely de-tangler for your wet hair after shower with lovely smell as a bonus from this product</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot a sea salt sprays, but this one is for sure my favorite. You don&#x27;t hear about this sea salt spray as much as other types, but it is way better. It not only adds definition to my wavy hair, it also tames frizz and makes my hair softer, which never happens with any products, much less a salt spray. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works great but kind of sticky. Works best by combing a little Argan oil through first.</li>
    <li> I received this with my monthly Ipsy subscription. I had to get more from Amazon of course :) It holds my waves in the summer. It&#x27;s great for up-do&#x27;s after spray to hold your style instead of hair drying crisping hair spray. It&#x27;s like a healthy hair spray with OUT the alcohol. It feels beachy. Great ingredients.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great, and produces a great beach look! I just ordered my 3rd and 4th bottle because I love it so much</li>
    <li> My hair is super fine and straight. I love this product because it gives my hair texture, a slightly wavy beach look, and some volume. I prefer to use a diffuser after I spray and scrunch it on my damp hair.</li>
    <li> Makes great beach wave summer hair</li>
    <li> When the weather gets humid, my hair will not stay straight.  My hair is not exactly wavy, it just has random pieces that stick up in the humidity.  This product solves the problem!  I spray it on right out of the shower and I don&#x27;t even have to blow it dry.  I scrunch my hair a few times while it&#x27;s drying and in the end my hair is full of body and waves.  Plus, it smells great.</li>
    <li> I like this product it does give a very nice beachy wave to the hair but leaves an unpleasend feel to the touch and the next day the hair must be washed it causes a sticky greassy feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this product got a sample in my Epsy bag and fell in love had to have more</li>
    <li> Very good product. Smells and feels good.</li>
    <li> I love this spray! I use it all the time in the summer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have very very straight fine hair.  And this works!  I spray it on wet, and twist my hair and let it dry.  Voila!  Soft curl that lasts!</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this was at a salon in North Carolina (I drive over the road) - and I fell in LOVE with it !!&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased, since then, three more bottles. It gives your hair some serious OOMPH, and has the SLIGHTEST hint of tanning lotion. You know when you have been to the beach (or wherever) using say Coppertone, etc...then after you take a shower you might have a residual scent of the lotion? That is the best I can describe that.&lt;br /&gt;A little about me and my hair - I have long hair (mid to lower back) and a LOT of it - I spray this on in thee most unorthodox way, staying close but not right ON the root area. Then VOILA ! &amp;#34;Girl you got hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED BUY -&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
    <li> I love the Sexy Hair product line and this is no disappointment! It smells amazing, and leaves my hair soft with no frizzies! I have naturally wavy/curly hair and this was a summer must have! Just a few sprays after washing, twist strands and go~~soft, smooth, beachy hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Gives my hair just enough body.  You just need a little.. If you use too much it can make your hair a little dry.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I have naturally curly hair and usually don&#x27;t like the curl after blow drying. With this I get beUtiful defined natural looking curl!  It&#x27;s a little stiff and sticky but doesn&#x27;t LOOK stiff or sticky!  Best beach spray I have tried and I have tried a bunch!  Got a sample from my ipsy bag and bought it here for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many sea salt sprays for my hair and got hooked on this from an ipsy box. I love the entire sexy hair line. I have long thick wavy/kinky hair and this adds just the right amount of texture and control to make my waves look intentional and not just messy. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or act like a hair spray. I start with the curly sexy hair curl cream, add this for texture and then give it a quick blast of style sexy hair spray clay to finish. My hair looks great and natural all day. Love it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size bottle of this product at an event and didn&#x27;t have big expectations.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple uses it has become one of my go-to products.&lt;br /&gt;I really love it and will be certain to buy more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect soft locks with this product, though.&lt;br /&gt;It does make your hair feel \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; but the look is great.&lt;br /&gt;My sister who has much curlier hair than I, and who loves Moroccanoil, also liked this product a lot and wants to buy some too.</li>
    <li> Smells so so good, and is one of the only products that works for my wavy-curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have very flat hair that I need to use a can of hair spray to hold any curls. I have success using it while my hair was wet then drying it and use my curling iron. It held my curls much longer and my hair had volume much longer than usual.  I also love the smell of this spray and another plus is that it has argon oil in it! However, beware that with great volume comes great price. While looking great my hair is also a tangled mess. Once style is set, I learned not to run my fingers through my hair otherwise I create knots that I have to cut off.  Otherwise the finally look result is great!</li>
    <li> Love!  Makes my hair have hold and texture but not too much.  Don&#x27;t use a lot or your hair will end up sticky.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I had horribly high expectations for this product, but the reviews seemed decent and it wasn&#x27;t too pricey so I thought I&#x27;d try a new product out. It was pretty terrible. I&#x27;ve used at least 3 different brands of &#x27;beach hair&#x27; products over the years and this by far has to be the worst. I don&#x27;t know what other people are talking about, this smells NOTHING like the beach. It smells like gross 80&#x27;s hair product or a hair salon - way too chemically. I thought I could get over the disgusting smell if it gave me that light tousled beach hair look, but it didn&#x27;t come close. I don&#x27;t have thick or fine hair, somewhere in the middle, and it&#x27;s naturally mildly wavy. All this product did was make my hair frizzy and big. And it felt like straw. I looked on the ingredients list and no wonder; I don&#x27;t think there is any sea salt or anything natural in it at ALL. I&#x27;m so disappointed that I wasted my money.  I realize different people have different hair types that may react to this differently, but I can&#x27;t imagine that this comes close to any other beach hair product. Gross. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work.  Came in a plastic baggie and seemed to have leaked.  Was crusty.  I transferred the liquid into a different container.  It is okay but would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a knock off of the original product. Does not produce the same results.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product.  I tried to use a similar product from VS and was disappointed.  The smell the beach blown look all of it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Love the smell and the texture it gives my hair when I don&#x27;t want to blow dry it.  It was recommended by my hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel very dry.</li>
    <li> Great product! I first received a sample of this product from an Ipsy box and it&#x27;s one of the few products that made me track it down to purchase the full-size. I have curly/wavy hair that gets frizzy, especially in hot, humid weather. (Yes, we get that in Maine.) This spray does a great job of defining my curls and preventing frizz and &amp;#34;big hair.&amp;#34; It keeps it soft to the touch and has some hold to it as well. I usually dry the roots a bit to fluff it up and then let it dray naturally. I will be a repeat customer of Soy Renewal Beach Spray!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it&#x27;ll do it makes your hair look great.</li>
    <li> it smells like i am at the beach. It is much better than spray. It does not make it feel crunchy.</li>
    <li> The scent of argan oil is definitely the strong note. It does work as a texturizer. Style hair first, then spray and scrunch to liking. It can&#x27;t hold flyaways the way a pomade would, but it can serve as a slightly gently hair spray.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like the beach and makes me happy. Also gives my hair a little extra texture during the day. But the smell-  I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I have never given anything such a poor rating but honestly, this product is so incredibly sticky and sprays on so fast and spans such a large area without warning,so get your face ready.  It is reeeeeally sticky and made the sides of my face breakout for weeks in the same pattern as it sprayed.  The smell was amazing though!  And the shipping speed was fantastic, so thank you for that. :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Leaves hair looking tousled, not stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> This product is the best for texturizing and even root boosting. It is supposed to give your hair a beach look, but it can be used just for volume and root boosting your everyday ponytail or other everyday hairstyle. My mom actually can&#x27;t live without this stuff. According to her it is worth every penny and she uses it everyday. I say for the cost I just use it for the occasion when I really want a volumized style. However she has a problem with thinning hair, so that&#x27;s probably why she likes it so much, because the volume means more to her. Your hair will definitely feel like you have been swimming in the beach, thought it won&#x27;t appear dirty or anything, so if you don&#x27;t like that feeling it might not work for you. But liked said, it isn&#x27;t visually apparent.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Helps my hair hold curls throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This gives excellent volume to my hair without making it look &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;. I will definitely be ordering this again when I run out!</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use the Beach Spray.  I especially wanted to cover some thinning areas and this stuff is great in doing that.  It smells like the beach and I like that also!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great product! Smells like you were at the beach and gives your hair that beachy messy look.</li>
    <li> I thought this spray would be a cheaper alternative to Bumble &amp; Bumble. But...its the consistency of spray glue. Instantly turned clean hair into a disgusting, dry, tangled bird&#x27;s nest. No waves. Made my hair awful to the touch, and I could not brush it out. For beautiful beach waves, buy the Bumble &amp; Bumble.</li>
    <li> order this product on Oct 2013, when I received the product show that it expired on Feb 2013. not sure if the brand is good or not cuz it&#x27;s expired can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes incredible curls, you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
    <li> This makes my naturally wavy hair air dry almost straight and with tons of body and volume. It also makes my hair air dry faster than if it didn&#x27;t have any product in my hair. It smells incredable and is an all around amazing product!</li>
    <li> I love this so much! I always got amazing results when I used this! I wish I got the bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> It is good unless you spray too much then it gets greasy !</li>
    <li> I had received a sample-sized product in one of my monthly subscription boxes and liked it, so I ordered this larger size.  In all honesty, I can&#x27;t say I love this product, but it does seem like it&#x27;s good for your hair and it does, sort of, look like you&#x27;ve been at the beach.  I have longer-than-shoulder-length hair, and pull the front of my hair to the back of my head with a clip.  Though I give this a 4-star rating, I really don&#x27;t see much difference in this vs. hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I WANT to like it, due to the soy content, nice packaging, and that it&#x27;s not harsh for your hair.  I&#x27;ve used other beach sprays and cannot honestly report that this one&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I order it again?  Probably not.</li>
    <li> This spray smells fantastic! I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good hold, not sticky.  Nice fragrance. BUT the bottle is teensy and I used it up way too quickly.  Notice that it&#x27;s only 5.1 ounces.  That&#x27;s just over 1/2 cup of fluid.  That ain&#x27;t much, especially for the high price.  It should come in a much larger size to last all summer.  I will try other beach sprays that cost less and come in bigger bottles, even though I really like this one.</li>
    <li> love this stuff and the smell</li>
    <li> My stylist asked to use this on me at the salon and I loved it. I was $20 there so I&#x27;m glad that I looked online before I purchased it. Smells great, and gives a beachy look! This picture is just this stuff in my hair, air dried, nothing else.</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair and this makes me look like I actually have full, thick hair... Will definitely order again!!! Love the smell too!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Adds volume and looks beachy! A little sticky if used on wet hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you like curls and the smell of a beach.  The spray is not a hair spray, it isn&#x27;t sticky.  It does coat your hair though and makes it feel like it was washed by the ocean (if you know what that feels like).  It does provide fullness and a texture to your hair so those with fine or thin hair will love this spray.</li>
