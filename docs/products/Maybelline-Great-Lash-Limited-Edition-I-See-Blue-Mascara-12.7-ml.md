      <li>Definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-:&lt;br /&gt;you may need to apply 3 or more coats.</li>
      <li>The color is amazing and its maybelline tried and true though out the years.</li>
      <li>I wanted it to be a very bright blue.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price and the quality is good as well.</li>
      <li>It does wash off easily.</li>
      <li>So happy with my blue mascara.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is too light for me.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and the delivery was super quick</li>
      <li>Was expecting more intense colors and texture.</li>
      <li>Not a bad product at all.</li>
      <li>looks pretty dark under shade, but under light, color appears super vibrant and I love it!</li>

      <li>Thanks Maybelline</li>
      <li>I love the colors for this product, but I need a more dramatic extension.</li>
      <li>Pops particularly well if you line the lower lashes with a bronze or peachy toned liner/ shadow.</li>
      <li>so I really appreciate a mascara that offers lengthening.</li>
      <li>,I do recommend if you want to try something new</li>
      <li>So much brighter than the standard Navy Blue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually noticeably colored, it&#x27;s just disappointing because blue is not the most complimentary color for my eyes.</li>
