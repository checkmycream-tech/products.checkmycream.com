      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.</li>
      <li>I love the bowl and getting THREE brushes instead of only one was a great buy for the price!!</li>
      <li>You should:)</li>
      <li>It makes the job of coloring my hair at home much more thorough.</li>
      <li>Cheaper than sallys and way better quality.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try these to help me color better.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found this.</li>
      <li>Works much better than any applicator bottle/brush that comes with drugstore hair color brands.</li>
      <li>These brushes work a LOT better than using those pointed nozzle applicators.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery, good quality</li>
      <li>Worked really well with all the colors we&#x27;ve been using them for!!! :) and FAST delivery!!</li>
      <li>The brushes are cheaply made but they work for me</li>
      <li>The dye kit doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>Gets the job done and you can&#x27;t beat the price, 1.79 on sale with free shipping?</li>
      <li>Makes coloring hair so much easier and much more accurate.</li>
      <li>I am stocked up and would highly recommend anyone looking for fast shipping and a good price to buy.</li>
      <li>My old brush bristles were coming out, this set works nicely.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>Was able to color my hair on my own without missing spots.</li>
      <li>and like I mentioned before you can reuse these if you wish to, so they are definitely worth purchasing.</li>
      <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product</li>
      <li>bowl and brushes are so easy to clean even if I hold over the sink drain and only use water to clean.</li>
      <li>shipped really fast and is worth the money</li>
      <li>Larger than they appear I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Came exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>This product is really helpful in term of mixing and applying the products nicely with a minimum mess.</li>
      <li>Very well made brushes and bowl.</li>
      <li>The bristles are stiff enough to brush through your hair while applying, which is great for even coverage.</li>
      <li>This was alot better than I expected!</li>
      <li>You can clean them and reuse them if you like, which I have done a few times, but now I just throw them away and just clean out the bowl.</li>
      <li>I can do a better job than the box dyes now, especially in the back.</li>
      <li>The long handle helps you part your hair, and the brush helps you get the dye in the right place!</li>
      <li>Since you can safely save un-mixed Naturtint hair color, (my preference) the low cost of this item is quickly replenished by avoiding the necessity of disposing left-over color due to short hair or combining colors.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any except for 1 other bowl and getting this set was a fabulous find.  </li>
      <li>Helps me reach those hard to get spots and a more even color.</li>
      <li>It also arrived early.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product, i officially can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>Professional wisdom behind this product is now available for home use!</li>
      <li>This little set is exactly what I needed.</li>

<li> and I can tell I&#x27;ll be using this product for a long time.</li>
<li> I would have expected one smaller version of the brush.</li>
<li> I was surprised with the size of the brush and the bowl, was expecting it to be small.</li>
<li> Other things like a three pack set of brushes was the same amount for less</li>
<li> These were just as expected.</li>
<li> It worked well in catering to my endless hair color changes and what not.</li>
<li> The bowl holds a lot of color, and with my hair being long I usually have to use two applications.</li>
<li> I do my hair all the time and this kit has never let me down</li>
<li> Brushes applied color evenly and I used a lot less product than just squeezing the color onto my hair.</li>
<li> The application brushes are stiff, making  it easier to get the product from the bowl into my hair.</li>
<li> Brushes are a lil stiff.</li>
<li> The bowls are small, but I combine product from 2 boxes of Naturtint to get the color I want.</li>
<li> Still in use, for price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> Great product, great price! I can do a better job than the box dyes now, especially in the back. If you dye your own hair, this is the best! The long handle helps you part your hair, and the brush helps you get the dye in the right place!</li>

    <li> Great buy! I would have expected one smaller version of the brush.</li>
    <li> This item enables &amp;#34;mixing&amp;#34; of color if desired. Since you can safely save un-mixed Naturtint hair color, (my preference) the low cost of this item is quickly replenished by avoiding the necessity of disposing left-over color due to short hair or combining colors. Better, more thorough application is the best motivation for its use. This is a money-saver in every way! Professional wisdom behind this product is now available for home use!</li>
    <li> Looks as in the picture.</li>
    <li> very nice product. makes hair dying a lot easier!</li>

    <li> This set was more stuff for a good price. Other things like a three pack set of brushes was the same amount for less so I&#x27;m glad I found this. The brushes are very good and I can tell I&#x27;ll be using this product for a long time. It also arrived early.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Brushes are a lil stiff. But it does the job    Note: I received a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product</li>
    <li> These are very good quality!! If your thinking about buying these well.. You should:)</li>
    <li> Brushes applied color evenly and I used a lot less product than just squeezing the color onto my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is really helpful in term of mixing and applying the products nicely with a minimum mess.</li>
    <li> I was surprised with the size of the brush and the bowl, was expecting it to be small. Good quality, used it twice now.</li>
    <li> since I can&#x27;t afford to pay someone to color my hair I thought I&#x27;d try these to help me color better.  Helps me reach those hard to get spots and a more even color.</li>
    <li> Good product. The dye kit doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> love it bristles on brush feel great</li>
    <li> My old brush bristles were coming out, this set works nicely.</li>

    <li> Very well made brushes and bowl. I just wish there was a rubber grip strip to keep the bowl from sliding.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT WORKS GREAT:)</li>
    <li> Still in use, for price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, very well made.</li>
    <li> Great product...as described</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product with nice price</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect, I tried using a paint brush from the hardware store, didn&#x27;t know these are available. The application brushes are stiff, making  it easier to get the product from the bowl into my hair. The bowls are small, but I combine product from 2 boxes of Naturtint to get the color I want. If I  used 1 box the size would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl and brushes are so easy to clean even if I hold over the sink drain and only use water to clean.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal  I didn&#x27;t have any except for 1 other bowl and getting this set was a fabulous find.  I am stocked up and would highly recommend anyone looking for fast shipping and a good price to buy.</li>

    <li> This little set is exactly what I needed. The price for what you receive is beyond wonderful. Would definitely buy from this seller again I recieved my item faster than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> I love this! I usually do my own hair in between going to the salon, like touching up the roots, and this is perfect for that. I purchased it a while ago, but just got around to using it last night. The bristles are stiff enough to brush through your hair while applying, which is great for even coverage. The bowl holds a lot of color, and with my hair being long I usually have to use two applications. This bowl allowed me to mix all my color in one! I would definitely recommend this product, i officially can&#x27;t live without it!</li>

    <li> This good for use of dye hair</li>
