    <li> It was shattered when it arrived.</li>
    <li> The size was good but the magnet didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> magnet doesn&#x27;t adhere.  should have read the reviews before purchasing this mirror.</li>
    <li> Awful magnet. Can&#x27;t even hold mirror up then it peeled off the mirror. Don&#x27;t buy waste of money.</li>
    <li> Hung it in the bathroom so my daughter could brush her own teeth in the morning. She&#x27;s not tall enough to see the vanity mirror so this helps.</li>
    <li> slips down the metal wall, pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> Magnet not strong enough to hold the weight of the mirror portrait orientation.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s exactly what you expect</li>
    <li> The magnet didn&#x27;t work at all. I tried it on my refrigerator to see if it worked, but it just fell off. I do not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> MAGNETIC STRIP DOES NOT WORK.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on locker.  I have to keep it in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;The one someone gave me from the dollar store was great.</li>
    <li> This magnetic mirror was what I ordered and was exactly right for what I needed and came very quickly.  Kathleen A.</li>
    <li> The magnets wouldn&#x27;t even keep it on a metal office shelf.  It slides down from the moment you try to attach it.  We used other magnets to hold it up, but it was so useless with the multiple magnets that its now in the desk drawer, where it will likely remain.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly as described.  Unfortunately, one fall off the music stand and it shattered.  Depending on how you plan to use it, you may want to look for a plastic mirror instead.</li>
    <li> This item is not worth the purcahase ! magnet is really cheap  quality it doesnt even hold the&#x27;mirror as soon as i placed it on  my locker it fell down and the mirror broke ,,what a rip off!!</li>
    <li> Magnet not large enough to stay attached to the locker door. Moved the magnet (not glued hard - thankfully) to the top of the mirror, but even then, when the kids close their door the mirror falls off. Now I have to fix the mirrors because the plastic broke and I need to put on a larger magnet.</li>
    <li> Love it so much very small and fits anywhere I didn&#x27;t really need it but I got it just because I wanted it hanging on my door because it&#x27;s made of metal</li>
    <li> magnet fell off within 5 minutes, had to glue it on. Fell off again a few month later.</li>
    <li> The mirror has a strong magnet and stays on the cabinet.</li>
    <li> Mirror magnets not strong enough to hold in place and sticky part keeps falling off. But if you need small mirror and your not worried about magnets this is perfect product.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package the first thing I did was hang it on the refrigerator, walked away and within 5 seconds the magnet on the back fell off and the mirror fell on the floor. It did not break so I tried gluing the magnet back on. (I did not have any glue on hand so I had to make a special trip to the store to get the glue). I glued it back on and it still did not work. The mirror ended up in the trash.</li>
    <li> I mean, its a mirror. However, my kid dropped it and it didn&#x27;t shatter. So that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Initially, the magnet wouldn&#x27;t hold everywhere on the locker door.  It held a little better in one spot, so I kept it on the shelf and put it in that spot when I needed to use it.  I forgot to put it back on the shelf once, and the next time I opened the locker, the glue holding the magnet had failed.  The mirror was in the bottom of my locker and the magnet still on the door.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of the magnetic mirrors for the toddler classroom and the kids love using them.  At first they were sticking on the metal radiator but now they don&#x27;t.  The children still enjoy using them.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, weight, and quality i was searching for. Magnet is strong-love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror for my desk at work. The magnet is nice and strong so the mirror does not fall down every time I open and close my desk drawers.</li>
    <li> The mirror part is good. The magnet is not very strong, though. I taped the magnet part of an old decorative refrigerator magnet to the back and that helped. But without it, it was sliding down and off the metal.</li>
    <li> The magnet kept falling off, which rendered it useless for its intended purpose.  Had to buy 3M stickies to make it work.  Meh.</li>
    <li> The magnet on this thing is worthless!!! I bought this to hang in my cube at work and it won&#x27;t even stay on the metal wall of my cabinets. There is absolutely no way this would come close to staying on a moving locker door. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this mirror it is worthless unless you want to keep it in a drawer and pull it out to use it. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t return something like this but it is so worthless I think I&#x27;m going to.</li>
    <li> Great price, shipped fast, my daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Great mirror for my employees in their cubicle.</li>
    <li> Had to tape the magnet to the back.</li>
