<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love and my kids love it. I use it in their hair every morning after their shower.  We&#x27;ve only been using this product for a day but so far we are in love. The IT 12-IN-ONE Leave-in Treatment is a pretty great one. Most leave-in treatments are made to only fix one problem, conditioning your hair. This treatment fixes 12 problems every time you use it.</li>
    <li> I loved this leave in conditioner. It smells great (which is always really important) and it left my hair feeling smooth and soft. I liked that it was also a hair treatment not just a conditioner. I have curly, colored hair and it can use all the help it can get. It was also great on my daughters curly hair. It made brushing after a bath much easier.  I like the way it left my hair after one treatment and I&#x27;m looking forward to what it can do with continued use.</li>
    <li> The older I get, with all of the coloring that I&#x27;ve done to my hair and the heat damage from curling irons and hair dryers, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair always looks unpolished and just dull and thin. Living in Central Virginia, the humidity is just murder on my hair. I usually keep it yanked up in a ponytail because of the frizz. The It 12 in One Leaving in Treatment is a miracle leave-in product. It&#x27;s not only a hair conditioner but a hair TREATMENT as well. I am completely and totally in love with my hair again thanks to this leave-in conditioner. What other conditioners have failed to deliver - this product does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just ONE USE, the frizz is GONE - and I&#x27;ve been outside with the humidity level at 86% and NOTHING. My hair is full and sleek and doesn&#x27;t look a bit damaged at all except for a wee bit on the ends still - but that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;ve only used it once. I cannot wait for the day to be over with so I can apply this leave-in treatment again and see the results in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a definite must have in my book and a total 10!!!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to duplicate the magic my stylist archives. This product not only makes my hair feel amazing but it withstands the humidity every woman in South East Texas battles ever day! I highly recommend this esp for anyone who uses a flat iron everyday!</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner works great!! I have a major frizz issue when it comes to my hair.  The only way to get it under some sort of control is to blow dry, flat iron, and curl.  Even then I have more miss days than hits.  I tried the 12 in One treatment before my usual routine of heat and I was amazed by how healthy and shiny my hair turned out.  It looked as though I had just come from a fresh cut and style at the salon.  Goodbye bad hair days!!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this hair conditioner.  My favorite thing about it is the wonderful scent....it&#x27;s not overpowering but very pleasant.  The actual conditioner has been a lifesaver for my hair.  After just the first use my poor dry, dull, frizzy hair actually had a nice sleek and silky shine.  It instantly made my hair look much healthier and has just gotten better the more I have used it.  I live in an extremely humid climate and my hair is always frizzy but this really helped tame it and make it much more manageable.  The conditioner has a really nice sprayer on it so you get good coverage with just one spray....I hate when I have to spray half of a bottle on my hair for anything to work.  I spritz 3-4 squirts on my hair and comb it in and i&#x27;m good to go.  This company has found a customer for life!  I cannot say enough great things about this and highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing, and it is not too greasy, only reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is that it came 3 days later than the latest arrival date! It came in two week! But otherwise, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> This 12 in one amazing leave in treatment really is as the name suggests it&#x27;s amazing! My daughter has long wavy frizzy hair so I knew I needed to try this on her. It has a nice smell to it which we both enjoyed. I started using it on her dry hair but felt I needed a little water so with a spray bottle I slightly we her hair which to me made it work better. The results are amazing! Her hair is straight and controlled. She even woke up this morning without her hair being all over the place. Some of her waves are back this morning but they are not frizzy one bit. She still has the silky feeling. It&#x27;s got a nice healthy shine to it. She now likes to have her hair brushed after using this leave in treatment and that makes me very happy. I would highly recommend this awesome product! I purchased this during a promotional period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This leave in hair treat mentioned works wonders! Left hair soft and manageable, even smells awesome! Helped with tangles and even frizz too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Left hair very soft and smooth with a yummy scent!</li>
    <li> This product smells so good, you almost want to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;It is power-packed with a lot of superbly nourishing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving hair deeply hydrated and conditioned.  My hair is&lt;br /&gt;really dry and frizzy.  But with the first application of this&lt;br /&gt;treatment my hair became instantly smooth and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;Works as a good protective base for blow drying and ironing&lt;br /&gt;hair.  This product is also concentrated so you only need&lt;br /&gt;1-2 pumps for good results.  Has a fragrant and creamy&lt;br /&gt;texture.  Comes in a nice big blue bottle which will last a&lt;br /&gt;long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve alway used a &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; leave in conditioner becuase it&#x27;s always worked, but when I got the chance to try this at a very deep discount, there was no reason to say no. My hair is heavily treated (dyed, styled, etc.) so I need a good conditioner for it not to be frizzy. This works great! It tames my mane but doesn&#x27;t leave it looking greasy like a lot of leave in conditioners can. I have also used it for my daughter who has very long curly hair and agian, it makes her long locks much more managable than shampoo and regular rinse out conditioner alone. If you need help keeping your hair managable and soft, this is the ticket!</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry/course hair and I blow dry and use a flat iron everyday. On top of that I also color and highlight my hair. I started using this product after I wash my hair and towel dried it. After I used the blow dryer, I noticed my hair was not frizzy and it was soft but still manageable. After using the flat iron it was still soft and looked way less damaged than before.&lt;br /&gt;I also have 3 girls with very long thick hair. This is awesome to use as a detailer for them. Makes brushing hair in the morning easy and without tears.&lt;br /&gt;It almost has the consistency of a lotion in the bottle but sprays out easy. It also smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> If your hair tangles or frizzes easily, you HAVE to try this leave in conditioner.  I have relatively straight hair but the top of my head has flyaways like crazy.  I&#x27;ve used wash out conditioner but it hasn&#x27;t seem to help.  This It 12 in One Miracle Leave In Product leaves your hair silky smooth, plus it is so easy to use.  Once you get out of the shower, just spray it all over your hair.  This would be great to use on kids hairs as well.  I remember HATING having my mom comb my hair because it hurt when she&#x27;d hit a tangle, but this hair treatment would help in that situation for sure.  It reminds me a lot of salon brands I&#x27;ve seen in stores, but at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I have really frizzy, curly hair. This 12-in-1 Amazing Leave in Conditioner is a great product for us. Today when we flat ironed our hair, we didn&#x27;t have to use any additional hair care products because the conditioner has a heat protector in it. The fragrance was crisp and clean, and the spritzer nozzle sprayed wide and evenly over our hair. Our hair was manageable and easy to comb through and when we finished styling it, it was shiny as well. If you have a limited amount of space for hair care products, I recommend giving this a try, as it will eliminate a lot of other products that you need.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that tends to get tangled a lot. I also have a 6 year old daughter that has long thick hair that, again, tends to tangle a lot! One try of this hair treatment and both of our hair is smooth, shiny, and easy to brush. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t irritate the hair, and my daughter loves it. It&#x27;s a miracle leave in product!</li>
    <li> I recently received Its a 10 miracle leave in product for review. I have dry course hair, so a leave in conditioner is essential to my daily hair treatment. I used this hair conditioner for the first time last night, and I must say that I was quite impressed! I worried that its a 10 may not work well with my ethnic hair, but it seemed to be a great fit. I will certainly be using it again in the future!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this for her hair. She&#x27;s been using it for about a week and likes how her hair feels more smoother and silky. The smell is good, too she reports. Overall, her hair feels smoother and software. I received a discount for this product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I need great products for my hair as I have very thick wavy hair, some strands normal some crazy kinky. So when I was offered this 12 in One Leave In Treatment from It for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. This reminded me of another hair product that my hair dresser uses and it is incredible. So I really wanted this product to go beyond the other one and it is. I am thrilled that I can use the same kind of products that the salon uses, but at home. I am so pleased that this 12 In One Leave In Treatment from It is better than the competitor and I definitely recommend this for your hair.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. This product amazingly well as a heat protector.</li>
    <li> Being a busy mom, I don&#x27;t always have the time that I need to spend on my hair... especially since I have dry, damaged hair. I need a good leave in conditioner. When I saw &#x27;It 12 in One&#x27;, I was hoping it would help solve me problem -- saving me time, from not having to use different products every day AND help get my hair onto the road to being healthy. I can say it is a 12 miracle leave in product for sure. I&#x27;ve just started using &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; but as a hair treatment for my dry hair I can already tell a big difference. It may be one of the best hair conditioners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has Abyssinian Oil in it... okay, I didn&#x27;t know what it was, so I looked it up and and it says, that &amp;#34;it is a non-GMO vegetable plant derived oil with a mild, pleasant odor. It is biodegradable and not-toxic and has not been tested on animals&amp;#34; -- a huge plus for me! I think the Abyssinian Oil really helps to smooth out my hair and give it a health, shiny look. I think it&#x27;s a 10 in my book!</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited about trying It 12 in One because I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of Its A 10 which happens to look exactly like It 12 in One. With 2 extra benefits in It 12 in One who wouldn&#x27;t want to try it? Well turns out I really like It 12 in One! It smells amazing for one thing. I have really curly long hair and I literally cannot brush my hair without some kind of leave in treatment and It 12 in One really helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to spray a little bit on your hair if not it&#x27;ll feel a little strange. With a little bit of spray I was able to brush my hair with no problems at all! After blow drying my hair felt really smooth and soft! I will definitely continue to use It 12 in One and would definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my clip in extensions. It really helped condition them and made them soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get tangled really easy, and from all the brushing and hair styling, they look brittle. But this stuff made them look soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for extensions and regular hair!</li>
    <li> im so in love with this product. my hair is damaged due to dying perming and pressing all the time so this definitely helps with some of the damage put onto my hair by heat at least.</li>
    <li> I got this because I tend to blow dry my hair A LOT! I needed something that would work to protect it from all of that extensive damage. This stuff is great! Within a few uses, I noticed significant improvements and my hair is very soft and shiny. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> IT 12 in ONE amazing hair treatment comes pretty darn close to being one of the best leave in treatments that I have used.  I am a hair stylist and I have used very many types of these products.  I will continue to use this product.  Makes the hair feel very soft and smooth.  It will hold it&#x27;s own when compared to &amp;#34;ITs a 10&amp;#34; brand product, but I think the IT- 12 in ONE actually makes the hair feel nicer.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, and it has nothing to do with the actual product, is the spray.  It actually isn&#x27;t a liquid product, it&#x27;s more a lotion type consistency, so I found it helpful to shake it and even tap it gently on my counter before I tried spraying it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic too!&lt;br /&gt;Nice size bottle, easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Product has oil in it and silk amino acids, which will help strengthen the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Here are the 12 treatments&lt;br /&gt;The 12 benefits of this leave in treatment are:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Repairs and protects dry and damaged hair (Great for chemically treated hair)&lt;br /&gt;2.) Protects from split ends and breakage&lt;br /&gt;3.) Gives you shiny and healthy hair&lt;br /&gt;4.) Transforms frizz to silk&lt;br /&gt;5.) Thermal protection up to 450 degrees (so it&#x27;s GREAT if you use any heat tools on your hair)&lt;br /&gt;6.) Seals and protects hair&lt;br /&gt;7.) Removes tangles&lt;br /&gt;8.) Restores natural body&lt;br /&gt;9.) Absyssinian oil for silky hair&lt;br /&gt;10.) Infuses silk amino acids&lt;br /&gt;11.) Protects your color&lt;br /&gt;12.) Transforms brittle hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my daughters hair - it does detangle well, but it left it looking slightly shiny in a I haven&#x27;t showered and my hair is greasy kind of way.</li>
    <li> i like using this instead of conditioner because every time i use one i feel like my hair gets greasy faster. Thats why when i get out of the shower i let my hair airdry and when i am ready to brush it i put my leave in treatment . It feels softer than ever and i don&#x27;t get a lot of breakage since it is a hair detangler too. I like the smell of it and the fact that it is thicker than the usual leave in conditioner ( it is easier to apply because it stays in my hands instead of leaking everywhere .</li>
    <li> Love this, helps in the humidity too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; of this product so I was really happy to try a more inexpensive alternative. I opened this and noticed it is slightly thicker than the brand I&#x27;m used to but also that the smell is AMAZING. This stuff smells heavenly. I sprayed it onto my damp, freshly washed hair and noticed that while it looked thicker in the bottle, it went on about the same. I styled my hair like normal and was super impressed. This tamed frizz, made my hair smell great and protected my hair from my flat iron. I would absolutely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I noticed an immediate difference repairs and protects.  My hairs looks far more healthy.</li>
    <li> This hair leave in conditioner lives up to its claims. Firstly, the packaging is amazing and simple. The spray makes life easier, it dispense just the right amount of product. The scent is so good, it has a hint of fruity, guava scent and i love it. It makes my hair more softer and manageable. One thing that i really love is that it doesnt feel heavy at all. My hair fibers are fine and relatively thin, so spraying thing on it sometimes makes it more flat and dull. But this product didnt took any volume on my hair. I love it! It&#x27;s a must for summer since our hairs tend to break and get damaged during the summer time due to the harsh sunlight. I was sent this product so I can test and review it.</li>
    <li> It 12 in One Amazing Leave in Treatment - I jumped at the chance to try this on a review promo because I had wanted to try a leave in but the the similar one &amp;#34;ten&amp;#34; was ridiculously expensive.  I heard people say at the salon this is just as good or better and try it out.  I am in love with this stuff now!! I have very fine thinning hair and when I use a conditioner in the shower after shampooing it is too much on a daily basis but really do need something lighter daily. This absolutely does the trick. Does not make my hair look greasy or weighed down.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is amazing!! I wasn&#x27;t so sure about buying yet another hair conditioner that promised things it didn&#x27;t deliver. This miracle leave in product has proven that there are excellent hair treatment products out there. It&#x27;s a 10!!! I have very long, thick hair and was skeptical that it would be sufficient. The spray nozzle sprays widely and covers a good amount of hair. It actually de tangled my hair. That&#x27;s hard for me to believe since I have so much hair but I was able to brush through much easier than normal. It left my hair amazingly soft. I am so very happy with this product and I will definitely be purchasing again!!! I used it and also used it on my daughter who has long wavy/curly hair. Same wonderful results. No more screaming at me for hurting her with knots, lol. Any one that wants a real quality leave in conditioner, this is the one you have to purchase. You will not be disappointed and I will highly recommend this to every one I know!!!</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist in Los Angeles, Ca and I have tired many products Its a 10 and 12 benefits being similar to this product. What I find different about this product is the thickness of the formula! The smell is wonderful and I have gotten compliments so far. I usually test out a product on myself before subjecting clients to them and this one is a winner. It is a great detangled and awesome for protecting your hair from excess heat of hair dryers, flat irons and curling irons. It is a small sized product which is easy for travel or to not clutter up your bathroom cabinet. I really like that this product is so many things in one it really helps to cut the cost and clutter of other products. I have even used this on my two year old daughter and she like that it doesnt hurt when I comb out her hair.</li>
    <li> There are so many benefits to this leave-in spray. The first I am noticing is how great it works as a detangler. I also love the scent-mild and pleasant. My hair is left with a silky finish, but doers not feel like I have product or residue. I have had no side effect so far-no itchy scalp or hair that feels dry or residue. I put it on before using my flat iron and my hair ends up soft and a with a great shine! I tried this with a promo code and all opinions are 100% my own</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is a great product. Its a 10 when it comes to a miracle leave in product as I have thick wavy hair. This hair treatment acts like an additional hair conditioner and I love the smell. Its a 10. It leaves my hair smelling great and soft.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is by far the best leave in conditioner hair treatment product that my daughter have ever used. She&#x27;s been using it for two days, and I can tell that it works really well on her tangling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite impressed by its amazing result. I love the smell of it too. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This leave in hair treatment is a great leave in conditioner for you hair. it 12 is awesome, has a very nice scent and leaves hair feeling soft and moisturized. I love the smell and felt it made my hair soft, it wasn&#x27;t as frizzy as before. This leave in treatment is a great product for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally blonde hair that lightens itself naturally in the sun. I still get my hair colored, though, to even out the color, which is a lot lighter at the top than underneath. Because my hair is fine and because of the blonding, my hair is brittle and breaks easily. I have tried many, many products to combat the breakage and make my hair shinny. Some of the other leave-ins I have bought have been extensive and heavy on my hair, so that it feels more greasy than shinny. The 12-in-one smells amazing and leaves my hair smelling as wonderful as it looks. The formula is not too heavy for my fine hair, and I concentrate on my thirsty ends rather than my scalp. I like to give the amino acid rich spray time to soak into my hair before styling which helps to protect my hair against heat and leave it soft rather tan frizzy. The formula is rich so I only need a few sprays. Also works as a detangler. Protect, treat, smooths, etc. etc. Truly a do-it-all! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> I lovee the smell on this and it left my girls curls sooo cute looks natural healthy soft and is really light wen it dry, I first towel dry her hair  and spray 3 or 4 times her hair looks so cute and healthy even a day after this is a must have defenetly my new favorite hair product !</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! I can not say enough. My hair is smooth and healthy. It also smells delicious. I will be purchasing more back ups to keep around. I received this to review and I just love it.</li>
    <li> The product itself is amazing! The only problem is, mine arrived broken, some of the writing was scratched off on the front, and the bottle was a little scratched up. Almost seemed like it been through some major banging around. I&#x27;m not sure if that is UPS&#x27;s fault or if it was packaged that way. I have to unscrew the top and pull the tube out to be able to get some out of it. I contacted the seller via e-mail bc I really hate to leave somewhat negative reviews; esp for a product that works as great as this. I unfortunately never heard back from them. Overall, the product is amazing.. it really helps my hair dry faster, detangles, and its softens it a great deal.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in competitive dance and the layers upon layers of hair glue and hair spray are taking their toll on her 8 year old maine. I have been looking for some sort of hair treatment or leave in conditioner that would help bring her long hair back to the silky, shiny state it was before our constant updos.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I sprayed this on her I was amazed by the smell. It is a luscious smell that I couldn&#x27;t get enough of. LOVE IT! I tried not to oversaturate her hair... just a couple of pumps on each side of her head and them I brushed it through. I went ahead and put it up in her ballet bun for class and when I pulled it down... it still smelled amazing and it was markedly smoother/softer. The next morning instead of her normal birds nest that I have to try to detangle, her hair was still soft, smooth and easy to brush through.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this multiple times on her and am sold on this hair conditioner. Application is easy, it smells amazing and it&#x27;s bringing back the shine and manageability to her long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample at a reduced price. All opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of every Its a 10 product I have ever tried and this one has to be my favorite.  I have naturally curly hair that has been processed more times than it should and because of my curly hair, I am a big HEAT junkie. I love my hair dryer, flat iron, curlers, curling wand- you name it- but using those has left my hair a bit straw like and I am constantly on the look out for a hair treatment that will help make up for all of my hair sins.  This It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in product delivers a few mega benefits for me. FIRST- the fragrance- OH MY GOODNESS- you will fall in LOVE. Using good smelling hair products is one of those things I allow myself to indulge in- this is by far the best I have smelled. SECOND, this product DETANGLES, so not only does my curly hair benefit by not being snagged and broken by my comb, post shower, but my youngest daughter who usually fights hair brush time actually ASKS for it. (She likes sweet smelling things, like her momma). It is such a concentrated formula, that it only takes a little to get the job done and I have actually discovered mixing a few tablespoons in a water bottle with water helps it last longer when you are using it for detangling your kid&#x27;s hair. THIRDLY, this product is a heat protector- and I can really tell it is working. It is almost like, my hair is even smoother after using heat now, rather than damaged.  Forth- it is a conditioner- a leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like there is a build up of product- it is like your hair sucks it up and says: &amp;#34;Thank you, I needed that!&amp;#34; Bottom line- It&#x27;s a 10 products have a good reputation for a reason and this has to be the most versatile hair product I have ever used. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this leave in conditioner! Having colored and permed my hair for years, this hair treatment had me reaching up to touch my hair all day long. It&#x27;s a 10 in my book although it is a 12 in 1 hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say good bye to the frizzies and tangles. Say hello to silky softness and that just out of the salon shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling treated or stiff. Just spray on a little and work it through before styling as normal. It&#x27;s also great for a late afternoon or evening freshen up for scrunching when you just need a little something before heading out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received through promotional or discount coupon..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m low maintenance. At least that&#x27;s what I plan, unfortunately for me, my hair doesn&#x27;t always cooperate with my plans, so when I ordered the it haircare 12-in-One Amazing Leave in Treatment I was HOPING it might help. I have very short hair and use a blow dryer, as a result my hair always looks fried and dull.  I love the fact that this product not only repairs damage like split ends and frizz, but it also helps to strengthen and protect my hair from the elements. One of the things I HADN&#x27;T realized until using it, was how quickly my color fades. Not only does my hair look shiny and healthy even after using a hot blow dryer (yes, I still do that), but it also holds my color longer.  This is truly a product for those who don&#x27;t want to fuss and use a number of different conditioners and protection products. It really is ALL IN ONE, and the abyssinian oil (I have no clue WHAT that is) leaves me with great healthy looking hair that&#x27;s silky and manageable.</li>
    <li> During the summer I am in need of a leave in conditioner since I often don&#x27;t style it.  Well I think this is  10.  I will be using this hair treatment product on my daughter with long hair  after they go swimming to take out the tangles.  Its a  miracle leave in product.  Frizzies are hard to keep away this time of year but Happy to have some help!</li>
    <li> I love the It 12 in One Amazing Leave in Treatment. I have colored hair and use heat products daily and it was an amazing heat protectant. I also have very thin hair that tangles easily even when freshly washed and a few spritzes of hair treatment conditioner made my comb out quick and painless. I would highly recommend this product It is a 10 in my book!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave-in treatments I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the ingredients and the consistency, it&#x27;s very light and smooth. I&#x27;m not used to using a spray so I just shake the product out the bottle into my hand since I need a lot, but it does spray out nicely. It smells very nice and lasts a great amount of time despite how much I use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, 3a/3b curls and I use this right after a wash and I reapply it almost everyday until the next wash day. My hair can tend to get weighed down, but this doesn&#x27;t do that at all. This is very light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t build up. It defines my curls very nicely leaving them soft and fluffy. I love the many benefits it provides and I can&#x27;t wait to use it as a heat protectant for when I flat iron my hair.</li>
    <li> this is totally amazing so far</li>
    <li> I usually dont spend a lot of time on my hair but it gets dried out from dying it. Just washed my hair and sprayed a generous amount of the creamy spray from root to tip and threw it up with a clip. After the first wash my hair is softer, smoother and not as bushy as it normally is when I let it air dry. It also smells great and the fragrance stays all day. Definitely conditions and repairs, with daily use it will probably change your hair for the better for good.</li>
    <li> When I was little, I had the wildest long tangly locks. I would come in from playing with everything from gum to twigs to probably small creatures nesting in there. I remember my mom so patiently combing through it with a detangling spray that saved my poor head from so much pain and left my hair soft and silky once again. This 12 in One Treatment is like the grown-up version of that spray. It smells divine and goes in without any heavy, greasy residue. It leaves my hair so soft and shiny, with less split ends and no frizz! Definitely a product a would use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am plagued with dry curly frizzy hair so when ever I see a new product I like to try it if I can, so when I was offered this 12 in one Amazing Leave in treatment during a promotion for the purpose of testing and my honest opinion I was happy to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly in its very own bubble wrap packaging, was sealed well and was undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;First I opened it to smell it like I do everything I review. The only way I can describe the smell is like walking into a high class salon.  it smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I washed and conditioned my hair as usual then dried my hair most of the way. I sprayed this on my hair and combed it in and then used my other hair products and styled it as usual, only this time it was very different. It was much easier, my hair did what it was suppose to the FIRST time and their is NO FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not me you do not touch this bottle...........&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more when this is gone and i will be telling everybody I know about it!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling super soft. I love all the benefits that come with this product. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Awesome product left my hair feeling soft and managable</li>
    <li> Very nice. I don&#x27;t often use leave in treatments, but I needed something for fly away frizz, so I tried this, and it worked great!</li>
    <li> This product is great for making hair soft and shiny.  It&#x27;s a large bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This product works OK but I think it is a fake. The MADE IN THE USA was scratched off and a sticker was conveniently placed over the directions and ingredients.</li>
    <li> IT is AMAZING! I would recommend this product because it left my hair soft and fragrant. It was not sticky or heavy. I like the spray feature as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice leave in &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; treatment for hair.  The product is slightly thick but is easy to apply and does not leave any stickiness after drying.  I used it for the first time and was impressed that it left my hair soft and shiny.  My Husband wanted to add sensual as well.  The only issue that is keeping me from leaving 5 stars is that the pump did not work.  This does not seem to be a common problem so it may just have been the one I received.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick that tends to &amp;#34;rat&amp;#34; up.  If you are a Mom, you know what &amp;#34;rat&amp;#34; means.  It tangles so easily.  I ordered  It 12 in One leave in treatment in hopes that it would help her take care of her hair.  It more than met my expectations.  This is an awesome leave in conditioner.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for better.  I know they chose the name because it solves 12 hair concerns, but its a 10 miracle leave in product.  They should have named it &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;, because its a 10.  I don&#x27;t think you could find a better hair treatment or hair conditioner for someone who has long, THICK, hair.  It&#x27;s definitely a must.  Super fast shipping and it was packed carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> I was searching for a leave in conditioner for my brittle and dry hair. I live in Florida so my hair is hard to manage due to the humidity and my frizz. I also style my hair each day with a blow dryer and a straightener. Due to those factors, I need a hair treatment that will really work. I tried this hair conditioner on a whim, and I had never heard of the brand before. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this 12 in one amazing leave in treatment. My hair is also color treated so I have to be wary of new products, but this one offered up protection! It offers heat protection up to 450 degrees (Exactly what I was looking for!), and the product promises 12 benefits:&lt;br /&gt;*repairs dry, damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;*protects from split ends and breakage&lt;br /&gt;*shiny and healthy hair&lt;br /&gt;*transforms frizz to silk&lt;br /&gt;*thermal protection&lt;br /&gt;*Seals and protects hair&lt;br /&gt;*removes tangles&lt;br /&gt;*restores natural body&lt;br /&gt;*Abyssinian oil for silky hair&lt;br /&gt;*infuses silk amino acids&lt;br /&gt;*protects your color&lt;br /&gt;*transforms brittle hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that sometimes on long weekends I forget to brush my hair and throw it up in a messy bun, so the first thing I noticed was how effortless it was to brush my hair after using this! I also did not notice my color treated hair fade or appear dull. I used my hair straightener just fine, and my hair remained silky smooth. The big test was the Florida summer, and my hair was just fine all day! I usually have afternoon frizzies and need to apply hair spray or something to fix, but I didn&#x27;t have to do that with this product. I&#x27;ll be making this a part of haircare regime.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have issues with getting a brush through my thick hair, and amazingly this has solved all of my problems. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to use a leave in conditioner hair treatment. It smells amazing too! It&#x27;s a 10. I have plans to use it with my toddler as well, especially since I struggle all the time to get the tangles out of her hair. I have a feeling it will work just as well, if not better in her hair. It&#x27;s smooth going on, easy to spray and ideal for anyone who needs something like it.</li>
    <li> Love this leave in conditioner! I used it on my kids&#x27; hair and it kept them all really soft and silky. I am glad I bought this hair treatment and would definitely recommend it! It&#x27;s a 10!</li>
    <li> As a licensed cosmetologist I love to try quality hair products. I have been able to try some fantastic products but I&#x27;m always looking for something better! I was excited to try this leave in treatment. The bottle and everything about this item reminds me of the brand It&#x27;s A 10, which is a brand and product I love and use all the time. The advantage of this product is the fact that is has two more benefits to take care of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The 12 benefits of this leave in treatment are:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Repairs and protects dry and damaged hair (Great for chemically treated hair)&lt;br /&gt;2.) Protects from split ends and breakage&lt;br /&gt;3.) Gives you shiny and healthy hair&lt;br /&gt;4.) Transforms frizz to silk&lt;br /&gt;5.) Thermal protection up to 450 degrees (so it&#x27;s GREAT if you use any heat tools on your hair)&lt;br /&gt;6.) Seals and protects hair&lt;br /&gt;7.) Removes tangles&lt;br /&gt;8.) Restores natural body&lt;br /&gt;9.) Absyssinian oil for silky hair&lt;br /&gt;10.) Infuses silk amino acids&lt;br /&gt;11.) Protects your color&lt;br /&gt;12.) Transforms brittle hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this leave in treatment in place of my It&#x27;s A 10 and so far everything it claims it does is true. I&#x27;m in humid Louisiana and frizz loves coming out during this time of the year. This stuff is definitely helping my hair remain beautiful throughout the day. It makes my hair so silky and soft I constantly run my fingers through my hair after blow drying. It&#x27;s great to use on my color treated hair. You don&#x27;t want to spray too much of it though because it will leave a weird feeling film on your hair. You just need a light amount all over your hair after you towel dry. The product smells great too! I&#x27;m very impressed with this product! *discount received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this leave in treatment. I have color treated, very damaged hair. I also live in Florida and it is very high humidity here, in addition to the fact that I use heat tools on my hair to keep it straight. I can not say enough about this product. It smells great. I have used the It&#x27;s a 10 in the past, and honestly, I much prefer this product. It is an excellent leave in conditioner and it doesnt leave my hair feeling greasy. It DOES leave it feeling silky and smooth which is a great bonus.  It also protects it from my flat iron, which is another added benefit. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just used this and let my hair air dry before straightening it. Beautiful! My hair is SILKY SOFT! Smells great, not too thick or too watery, left my hair super soft and silky without any oily feeling. Barely even needed the straightener because it was so smooth just from this product.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for two days and we absoultley love it. It works great on my staright hair and amazing in my daughters curly hair. It&#x27;s always been difficult to comb my childs hair with this, it&#x27;ss easy. No pulling, smells amazing and no greasy hair. I was asked to review and test this product.</li>
    <li> Ooo i used this last night and I love it. Not greasy at all. When you see OIl you get a little nervous but my hair is soft and sleek.. so manageable. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks to review this product to give an accurate review. I am enjoying this 12 in one leave in treatment. I have put my hair through the ringers. It is dyed several colors, curled, heat-processed, etc. I have tried lots of different leave-in conditioner products without good results. I am very happy with this conditioner. It does not seem to weigh my hair down, make my scalp itch, or make my hair look greasy. I would recommend this if you need some intense therapy for your hair without feeling that oily, weighed down feel that most products leave you with.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner hair treatment is a great product. Prior to using the leave in conditioner my moms hair was very dry and brittle. But after using the It 12 in one hair treatment she couldn’t stop raving about how soft her hair was and agreed to keep using the product. The fragrance is wonderful and stays with you a little while after applying the conditioner to your hair. We&#x27;ve only been using this product for a day but so far we are in love. If you are on the lookout for a great hair conditioner look no further than the It 12 in one leave in conditioner. I did receive this product at a discount price for my honest review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that often gets tangled so I need to use conditioner with every wash.  It&#x27;s also nice to have a leave in conditioner as well to keep my hair free from tangles and feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this is a 12 in 1 leave in conditioner. One thing I worry about is leave in treatments that weigh my hair down.  This wasn&#x27;t the case with this product.  I like how light the mist goes on and the soft feeling it give my hair.  It&#x27;s great for getting rid of frizzy hair which is a huge problem for me in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair conditioner also smells wonderful.  So many leave in treatments smell like chemicals but this one has a light and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> First off I gotta say I really like the smell of this! It works good on making my hair easier to brush through when wet! I really like how it helps those with color treated hair, I don&#x27;t want a product that isn&#x27;t safe to use. I like it and pretty good price for bottle!</li>
    <li> Made my hair smooth and moisturized. The bottle is smaller than I expected though, I have shoulder length hair and like to use plenty of conditioner in my hair so it seems I&#x27;ll be running out of it within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is a 10! I absolutely am in love with this hair conditioner. For starters, it smells amazing. The thing I was worried about most was that it would leave my hair feeling and looking greasy. It definitely didn&#x27;t do that - it left my hair feeling really soft and healthy looking. This is a great product if you find yourself using a hair straightener often.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am with this leave in conditioner! I was worried it might be heavy but I ended up having shiny hair that didn&#x27;t frizz. The scent is light and lovely -- really loving how my hair feels!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff. I am a leave in conditioner snob! I love the way my hair feels after using this product.</li>
    <li> It really made a huge difference on my beard. Much better than any oil or conditioner has done. Good stuff and the smell is nice too.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s everything you need in one bottle! I use it after I have towel dried my hair and then style. Makes it super easy since I don&#x27;t have to use multiple products at a time. Just spray and style.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair so I am always looking for something to help condition and detangle after I wash. Especially since I make my own homemade shampoo to avoid chemicals on my hair. This has a lot of natural ingredients so I feel better about using it than another leave in or regular conditioner. It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s not oily or weighs my hair down. My curls are nice and soft and volumous.</li>
    <li> The best leave in treatment I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have dry, fried hair and it makes it feel so much better!</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly pretty good stuff. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy. It makes it manageable and lay down flatter. No more frizz. It has a very pleasant smell. I would describe the smell as &amp;#34;expensive salon scent&amp;#34;. It goes on similar to hairspray. Pump style, however the product is actually a white creamy paste. Almost like a lotion.  I will be using this product for now on. I should also mention that I was given a discount in order to provide my honest and unbiased opinion, and in my opinion, this is high quality stuff.</li>
    <li> Even though some of the promoted 12-in-1 promises are really just rewordings of the same thing, I love this! My hair feels amazing after using it, and it&#x27;s so simple to use! Towel dry your hair and spray some in, distributing by using a wide tooth comb or your fingers. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants softer hair.</li>
    <li> I add this to my hair every time I get out of the shower.  I comb it in before I blow dry.  I have found that my hair is less frizzy and more manageable when I use this product.</li>
    <li> This has a great smell and left my really hair soft. It also brought back a lot of curl to my baby girls head without having to soak her hair too. A little bit goes a long way. The smell has stayed with me all day and every now and then I get a great whiff.</li>
    <li> The Leave in Treatment was delivered in sealed, protective packaging and arrived in excellent condition as described on product page.  We purchased the Treatment in a Promotion for testing and review.  As someone that is prone to dry, frizzy and easily tangled hair, I have to use leave in treatments to keep my hair manageable.  This particular brand has certainly done the job.  My hair is softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> 12 in One leave in conditioner is great! I have never tried a product like this before (I&#x27;m 52). I have salt and pepper hair. I noticed after a few applications that the brown part seemed darker. It must be that my hair was so dry it moisturized it back to its original color. Amazing! This product has a great smell and doesn&#x27;t feel oily in my hair. I was given a discount to review this product. My opinion is my own. I definitely will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair super soft &amp; shiny, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either! My hair has always been pretty dry, but after using this product&lt;br /&gt;for a couple days, I noticed my hair was a LOT softer than it had been ever before!&lt;br /&gt;The smell lingers for a few minutes with you after you&#x27;ve sprayed it on your hair, which is great, because like I said, it smells good!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long hair and we need a good leave in conditioner that will keep her hair smooth and without tangles after washing. The leave in conditioner has a wonderful smell and leaves hair with a silky feel after each use.  My daughter now asks for this product before combing or after she gets out of the swimming pool, and I can&#x27;t blame her. This has definitely made styling her hair a lot easier!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical that there could really be a product that truly can claim itself as a 12-in-1 mist that is designed to help promote beautiful hair!  This leave in treatment is beyond what I was expecting.  The formula created for this product also provides heat protection for up to 450F so it is great if you plan on blow drying or using a curling wand or straightener as well!  My hair has never felt healthier thanks to this 12-in-1 mist that truly helps repair, protect, and strengthen your natural hair!</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner / treatment is amazing. I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair and its perfect for both. It leaves my hair soft and shiny with no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this leave in conditioner. I have been trying to find one that I can use that doesn&#x27;t feel oily, smells good and does the job. This is a miracle leave in product. I have coarse, dry hair and this instantly left my hair soft and smelled amazing. It is a great leave in hair conditioner. A little goes a long way. After using the leave in hair treatment, I blow dried my hair and it was still soft and silky. I would recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s a 10!</li>
    <li> I tried this product yesterday and love the quality! My hair feels luxurious, smooth, non greasy and very healthy!</li>
    <li> it really works on my hair,it makes my hair shine more and soft..plus the smell is soooo good!</li>
    <li> This 12 in one amazing leave in treatment is wonderful for your hair!!! My daughter uses it after every time she washes her hair. She use to have a hard time finding a  leave in conditioner that would protect her hair from damaging and keeping it nice and shiny through out the day and this 12 in one does all of that.&lt;br /&gt;She bragged about it to all of her friends and they have all told me how they love how her hair looks. It also helps her with frizzing,which I may now steal it back because my hair could use some;) We dye our hair at least once a month to every two months and this will help bring back what they dye strips away. It&#x27;s perfect!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done. All words are mine not anyone else&#x27;s. Try some for yourself. It&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> I love to swim so this product is great for my dry hair.  The chlorine and sun can be damaging in the summer so I use this to soften and condition after being in the water!  Great product :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased for myself, because my hair ,needs some work. It&#x27;s damaged, so leave in treatment is perfect for my hair. Product smells great. I like shape and size of the bottle the product comes in. I really like spray spout, easy to spray on hair and sprays on quickly. I like that the spout doesn&#x27;t get stuck,with gunk.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about the product is that I thought the leave in treatment would tame my hair down. I still had plenty of fizziness after product dried.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing; my oldest daughter and I both have course, naturally curly hair and this makes it so soft and helps control the frizz. First off, this smells great! We apply a small amount (this is almost like a light lotion, so a little goes a long way!) when wet and style as usual. We also spritz one squirt into our hands (a little of this goes a long way so use sparingly) and smooth it over our day-old, dry hair when it&#x27;s extra humid and our hair starts to frizz. My oldest also uses this as a heat-protecting serum when she uses her straightening iron! Works great! My youngest daughter is 3 and has straight, waist-length hair that tangles easily. I spritz this on wet and she will let me brush her hair without fussing - works better than any de-tangler I&#x27;ve tried and saved me from cutting it. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My frizzy hair is smooth curls today, I used this and my hair has never looked better</li>
    <li> My girls are on swim team which means a lot of time in the water with chlorine which is hard on their long hair.  This product works great and helps correct all the damage of the pool.  Plus, it makes brushing out their hair easier than ever.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing...makes my daughters hair so soft, and it smells soooo good. Definately a great buy!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  I am 65, so you know I have tried tons of conditioners over the years!  Whenever a new one came out, I would try it &amp; then give it away or toss it.  Finally, I gave up &amp; went without.  Now, I have found IT!  I don&#x27;t dry my hair as I&#x27;m not in a hurry-I&#x27;m retired.  This is everything I was looking for.  Not thick &amp; hard to rinse-you just leave it in.  No icky smell &amp; no greasy feeling--like you need to wash your hair to start over!  I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  Read the reviews for extra tips &amp; info.</li>
    <li> It 12 in One Amazing Leave in Treatment is fantastic. It smells wonderful, works great as a hair conditioner, leave in conditioner and is a fantastic detangler. I&#x27;ve used Its a 10 miracle leave in product in the past and It 12 in One Amazing Leave in Treatment surpasses its a 10. This hair treatment also works great after the pool or when using hot styling tools. Even after air drying my hair looks shinier and healthier. I love it!</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is absolutely perfect for my curly head child. It makes it so easy to brush through and leaves her with moisturized curls. The frizziness is gone. It is a 10!</li>
    <li> I myself am very low maintenance when it comes to my hair. It&#x27;s straight as a bored &amp; very thin and fine so it&#x27;s hard to do anything with it anyway. Any given day I have it thrown up in a claw clip or hair tie. My 8 year old on the other hand, has straight hair that it thickening up an getting more and more tangley in the mornings. It&#x27;s such a pain trying to brush them out. I tried the IT 12 IN ONE on her hair and it made her hair nice and smooth while brushing through the tangles. When it dried, it left a film on her hair almost like I had sprayed a light mist of hairspray on it. She wasn&#x27;t crazy about that feeling and so I kept brushing through it hoping that it would go away. I think I may have put too much spray on it but not sure. I used it on myself but not a lot since I already have oily scalp and didn&#x27;t want this to make it greasy with the Abyssinian Oil that it contains. It, too, left a sort of light hairs spray feeling on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the feeling of the leave in treatment, the product smelled great and it made the hair so very &amp;#34;brushable&amp;#34;. If you already use other types of hair products then you won&#x27;t even notice the filmy feeling left on the hair. It leaves your hair nice and shiny, smooth, and smelling great. *I received this product in exchange for a 100% honest review.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is a 10 in my opinion! I love that it is a 12 in 1 hair treatment. It smells amazing as well!!</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter has swimming lessons two days a week and as you can imagine, the chlorine in the pool drys out her hair. I have been searching for a nice leave in conditioner that would help bring life back to her hair and I believe I may have found the one! This hair conditioner not only makes brushing knots out of her hair easier, but it leaves it looking soft and smooth, plus it smells really great. Getting my daughter ready in the mornings for school is always a hassle when it comes to brushing her hair, she does not like having it brushed at all! However since we started using this hair treatment, she has had no complaints about getting her hair ready in the mornings, this product is amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  My hair felt really good after the leave in treatment!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair that frizzes up and we tried all kinds of deep conditioners and leave in treatments we recently used the its a 10 leave in conditioner and it really didn&#x27;t do much i got this and sprayed it in after her shower later that day she said &amp;#34; mom my curls are beautiful&amp;#34; looks like we found our holy grail!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has been through it all recently. I dyed my hair blonde then back to my natural dark brown hair color. Since this is has really become sensitive to any heat treatments. I bought this as a supplement to flat iron my hair still, at a promotional price. I will say you get a generous amount for your money but the spritzer was on the cheaper side. The formula works well and is easy to apply though. Overall not a bad product and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> My hair has become brittle and dry from coloring it and using a flat iron. I needed something to make it healthy again. I decided to try out the 12 in one leave in treatment. It was easy to use as I just had to spray on my hair after I towel dried it from the shower. There is no need to rinse off. I can just leave it in and style my hair. My hair conditioned throughout the day and it even protected my hair when I blew it dry and used my straightening iron. My hair felt soft, silky, and smooth after using it. My hair was not as frizzy as it normally is when I don&#x27;t use it. It has a nice soft clean scent to it making my hair smell fresh throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the product featured in this post to facilitate my review. All opinions are 100% mine and not influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> Like most curly girls I know, I am always looking to try new hair products. While this isn&#x27;t designed just for us curly girls I was excited to try it.  First impression when you spray the product is that it smells great.  Not its primary function, but the scent just hits you, in a good way.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for several days and I like the softness it provides.  I also like the heat protection.  Curly hair tends to dry out more than straight so I don&#x27;t blow dry very long, just enough so it is more damp then wet, and this protects my hair.  Also, I personally don&#x27;t notice the film left on the hair that other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it to good results on my hair, I used it on my 7 yr old daughter.  She has long, beautiful straight hair that she hates for me to brush.  She will literally run away and hide.  She also liked the scent of this product and actually asked me to spray more.  She sat still long enough for me to get out the snarls which came out easier due to this product. I love that this product has helped me with taming her wild mane.</li>
    <li> Due to blow drying my hair often my hair is always in need of a leave in conditioner. I prefer this method to a hair treatment of some sort that may damage my hair more. I&#x27;m always trying new products and so far I have really enjoyed the 12 in One Leave in Treatment. I use this product after towel drying my hair. (Note: This product is made for wet hair not dry hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the very slight scent of this product. It has a floral scent which is much more preferable than anything fruity. It is not over powering at all. After using this on my hair my hair felt light and fresh. It does not weigh down your hair at all like some oils can do. I also like that it is a spray which I find is easier to work evenly through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my hair had air dried some I put it to the test of my blow dryer. It was the first time in a long time that my ends did not look frizzy. I didn&#x27;t have to get out my curling iron like I usually do to tame the ends. My do lasted overnight which is about the most I can get out of any do before it needs to be washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the protective nature of this product I&#x27;m hoping over time my hair stays in better health. With other oils that I have tried the next day my hair feels greasy, that did not happen with this product. So far it is my favorite of the products that I have tried. I&#x27;m going to try the product on my hair and let it dry naturally to see how it effects my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely helps with the tangles and I will be trying it on my daughter next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount to review this product and give my honest opinion.
