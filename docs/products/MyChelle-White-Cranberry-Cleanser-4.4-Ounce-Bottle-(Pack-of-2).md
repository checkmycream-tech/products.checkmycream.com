      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend any MyChelle product.</li>
      <li>I switched to a different brand cleanser, pairing it only with a light lotion, and my skin cleared up dramatically.</li>
      <li>their Fruit Enzyme Must and Clear Skin Serum have been a godsend!</li>

      <li>Trust me, I have tried probably about 100 cleansers so far in my lifetime.</li>
      <li>Just a company created out of concern and determination to make a quality all natural product.</li>

      <li>Never another major breakout and just the very rare individual pimple usually</li>
      <li>My skin is clear without being dry and does not give me any reaction.</li>

    <li> This product is wonderful.  My skin has completely changed since I have started using it.  Never another major breakout and just the very rare individual pimple usually only when I didn&#x27;t wash my face before going to bed.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love natural things.  I have used this product for over a year, and will be a faithful user.  I have acne prone skin, and this cleans my skin without causing me to break out from something in the product.  Most natural products I react to lavender or witch hazel in.  This is great because it smells good and cleans well.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product at first.  It smells wonderfully natural and feels great when you use it.  For me, however, this cleanser, as well as the whole Oily/Breakout skin system, make my skin breakout way more.  I used it for about 4 months, following all directions and steps, before finally giving up.  I switched to a different brand cleanser, pairing it only with a light lotion, and my skin cleared up dramatically.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in conjuction with mychelle clear skin serum and oil free grapefruit cream. Has definitely helped my acne, and leaves skin moisturized without the oily effect. Will definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that these products are available thru the subscribe and save option! Please continue offering these mychelle products through Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> This did not wash makeup off nor the oilyness of teenage skin. Basically try something else. Yes it states it is all natural, but you still need to be able to have it work.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial wash I will use. I have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin that is mostly oily (though dries out easily if using a harsh cleanser). I have been using this facial cleanser for 5 years now, and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love this company. They obviously take skin care very seriously and make fine products. I like that they are not a huge cosmetic company with all the bells and whistles. Just a company created out of concern and determination to make a quality all natural product.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I initially bought it for my boyfriend bc he was oily but not breaking out bc the humidity. I decided to try it and had to go buy him another bottle. It really does cut the oiliness! And I&#x27;m an organic/natural freak, so score!</li>
    <li> This works great for me and my teenage daughter. There are still occasional flare ups, but it has lessened the amount of breakouts that we used to have, as well as their severity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mychelle skin care products for a little over a year now.  I have to say I love everything I&#x27;ve tried of hers.

    <li> I LOVE this cleanser and have been a loyal user for years. I wanted something with more natural ingredients that does the job, and does it well. It&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser that is gentle, yet effective......but this is it. Trust me, I have tried probably about 100 cleansers so far in my lifetime. It removes makeup with ease, yet doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, even if you have sensitive skin. If it gets into your eyes, it won&#x27;t even bother them! Doesn&#x27;t dry skin out and is soothing. Again, the only cleanser I use!  A little (dime sized drop) goes a long way. Definitely a fan of MyChelle products (also the pumpkin peel is great too!)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  My skin has been clear of all blackheads and has reduced the appearance of my pores. I love that it cleans of my makeup without drying out my skin. AND it does brightening.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The white cranberry cleanser is concentrated, so a small amount is all that&#x27;s needed.  It removes even my mascara without any eye irritation.  It has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t overdry my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> It was nice getting 2 for the price of 1! This is one of my favorite face washes because it really clears up my skin! Shipping was also fast on this product! Would defiantly recommend!</li>

Unfortunately I bought two bottles and opened both before trying because I had such a success with all of their other products. I still give it 5 starts because it isn&#x27;t their fault I have weird skin, and their Fruit Enzyme Must and Clear Skin Serum have been a godsend!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my combination skin.  It has also helped my husband since he started using it.  It keeps the blemishes in check without drying our skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am in my 50&#x27;s and have sensitive skin that is prone to breakout. I have been using this for a couple of years and it is well worth the cost. My skin is clear without being dry and does not give me any reaction. I highly recommend any MyChelle product.</li>
    <li> Very nice cleanser. Like it so much because I have very sensitive skin. SO Smooth, and non irritating.&lt;br /&gt; I am a huge fan of all Mychelle products. Kind of spendy, but my face loves me now. Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product but cost is very high compared to other cleansers.</li>
    <li> was a gift she liked it</li>
    <li> I really like some of the Mychelle products (eye cream, pumpkin cream), and initially this worked great on face. My skin felt so smooth and smelled great. But over the course of a month, my skin has gone back to the usual - rough patches, flaky skin, a few pimples. I have been using this face wash, the Mychelle clear skin serum, Mychelle fruit enzyme mist, and the pumpkin renewal cream (it&#x27;s been so dry this winter I needed a heavier moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple friends recommended Cerave, so I&#x27;m going to try that next. I really wanted an organic product line to work on my face though.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser that i use with my Satin Smooth Hydrasonic Professional Cleansing Brush. The two work wonders together on my acne prone skin. Haven&#x27;t had a breakout in 3 months.</li>
