      <li>The clips are great too, very easy to put in.</li>
      <li>Its great I am in love with it...</li>
      <li>Add 2 more clips!</li>
      <li>ot knots easily but just put it in a side braid and its very cute</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>you shouldn&#x27;t  expect  it to be sure</li>
      <li>These okay, pretty plastic lookings but the color is good.</li>
      <li>so I had to cut the  extensions to fit my hair</li>
      <li>(Again I cut it to match and fit my hair)</li>
      <li>and I was surprised at how good it was for the price.</li>
      <li>The hair is beautiful and SUPER long, but it doesn&#x27;t cover the front of the head.</li>
      <li>The hair is synthetic but it looks so amazing and natural that I purchased another one to create layers.  </li>
      <li>fine hair, snags easy and unravels fast.</li>
      <li>The only thing is I don&#x27;t know how to do hair well, and can&#x27;t figure out how to make it look good in my hair.</li>
      <li>One clip is kinda messed up but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>If you want extensions buy the ones that are real hair, you can do a whole lot more with them.</li>
      <li>well  worth it</li>
      <li>And the color is gorgeous, looks like what it shows, a medium golden blonde, very natural, not platinum or brassy.</li>
      <li>Just got it in the mail and was surprised it holds secure looks</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a quick fix or temporary extensions.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping high quality product A+++++</li>
      <li>very thick, very bendable, very good for the price.</li>
      <li>real hair sp</li>
      <li>Looks real to everyone that has seen me wear it.</li>
      <li>Color is good and all, but the hair it self looks really fake, gets tangled very easily and falls all day long.</li>
      <li>the color will come out looking normal?</li>
      <li>in my photo i am wearing these extensions in golden blonde paired with several single strand clip-in extensions and they look fabulous.</li>
      <li>It needs at least one more clip on each side.</li>
      <li>I love how long this is, holy cow!</li>
      <li>they do feel fake, but they look amazing.</li>
      <li>real enough mice and soft</li>
      <li>I had to buy separate single clip ins from another place to make it look natural.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Really good quality extension!  Unfortunately it was too light for my hair color which was my mistake. But I&#x27;m sad because it is really cool looking and realist. I can use it for something else I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> The hair is synthetic but it looks so amazing and natural that I purchased another one to create layers.  I loved it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Its great I am in love with it... I never go out with out it</li>
    <li> It sheds like crazy,you can&#x27;t die it, it tangles really easily,doesn&#x27;t clip right,falls out of your hair,is impossible to brush out, and it gets greasy extremely quickly. I wish I could return it but I already opened it and tried it in my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time buying this product. If you want extensions buy the ones that are real hair, you can do a whole lot more with them.</li>
    <li> These okay, pretty plastic lookings but the color is good. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Such a hard hair color to match.&lt;br /&gt;Very fine hair, snags easy and unravels fast.</li>
    <li> Ordered  this product before  i read the reviews. Got a little worried that it would  totally  suck. But it doesn&#x27;t  for the money i paid it was  well  worth it i mean  ur not getting real hair sp you shouldn&#x27;t  expect  it to be sure ot knots easily but just put it in a side braid and its very cute cant even tell its fake hair when u do it</li>
    <li> Quick shipping high quality product A+++++</li>
    <li> I havnt bought this yet but if it&#x27;s not the same color as my hair can I die it and the color will come out looking normal? Or would it change the color since it&#x27;s fake hair</li>
    <li> I got this for a costume and I was surprised at how good it was for the price. Delivery was good as well</li>
    <li> everyone who has given this product a negative review has failed to take into account that there are $14 hair extensions. I have payed upwards of $200 for extensions and i typically only buy human hair. I needed fuller/longer hair for an event so i bought this product (after reading several bad reviews i was hesitant) and they were PERFECT. very thick, very bendable, very good for the price. they do feel fake, but they look amazing. in my photo i am wearing these extensions in golden blonde paired with several single strand clip-in extensions and they look fabulous. I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a quick fix or temporary extensions. i bought this while i was saving up for human hair extensions and i ended up wearing this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> love it!! I have lots of layers so I had to cut the  extensions to fit my hair but it looks great anyway. I washed it and used conditioner to make is softer and un tangle the hair and now it works perfectly. One clip is kinda messed up but other than that it&#x27;s great. Looks real to everyone that has seen me wear it. (Again I cut it to match and fit my hair)</li>
    <li> Arrived late isn&#x27;t thick AT ALL looks fake colors way off I ordered golden blonde expecting at least platinum got WHITE DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I it dosen&#x27;t the fake hair is fouling down</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by the way the manufacture had sewn the hair into the clip.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Really thick but plastic. Tangles as you wear. Can&#x27;t curl or cut.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail and was surprised it holds secure looks real enough mice and soft</li>
    <li> I love how long this is, holy cow! And the color is gorgeous, looks like what it shows, a medium golden blonde, very natural, not platinum or brassy. The clips are great too, very easy to put in. The only thing is I don&#x27;t know how to do hair well, and can&#x27;t figure out how to make it look good in my hair. Hopefully I&#x27;ll figure it out soon!</li>
    <li> The hair is beautiful and SUPER long, but it doesn&#x27;t cover the front of the head. It needs at least one more clip on each side. It looks silly without hair in the front sides. I had to buy separate single clip ins from another place to make it look natural. That&#x27;s my only complaint about it. The hair is thick and I haven&#x27;t styled it or anything yet, but the width was a disappointment. Add 2 more clips!</li>
    <li> The hair looks and feels really fake. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Color is good and all, but the hair it self looks really fake, gets tangled very easily and falls all day long. It is waaaay too fake to go out with it...SUCKS</li>
