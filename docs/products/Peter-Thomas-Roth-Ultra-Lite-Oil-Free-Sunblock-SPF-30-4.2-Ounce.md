      <li>Is the most amazing sun block for my oily face!!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely lovely face sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Love the way this product feels on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have found much better texture and lighter options for my face with Paula&#x27;s Choice sunscreens.</li>
      <li>This was exactly as she said - light, non greasy coverage - perfect for sensitive skin and provides really good protection.  </li>
      <li>Other sunblocks were greasy or chalky but this one is perfect.</li>
      <li>TOO GREASY AND GOES ON SMOOTHLY.</li>
      <li>and it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>but when you have tried as many products as i have, it&#x27;s worth it when you find one that works.</li>
      <li>i bought thiis thinking that it would be oil free.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend it very highly,thank you,very much keep up the good work!!!</li>
      <li>Super greasy and it sweats off easily</li>
      <li>Light fresh feeling.  </li>
      <li>Non greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I can apply my make up after about 5-8 minutes and I&#x27;m ready to go!!</li>
      <li>and I never have any reaction to it, a first for me with sunblocks!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I have a mild combination skin type, but this does not irritate or make my skin look more oily or dry.  </li>
      <li>you only use a teeny-tiney amount each time :)</li>
      <li>When I first started using this a couple years ago, I did experience some itching, but that has gone away.  </li>
      <li>My skin absolutely glows when I put it on and people are always complimenting me on my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
      <li>I wear it daily and love it.  </li>
      <li>wanted to try this because i loved the uberdry and it was not available.</li>
      <li>Finally, my esthetician recommended this exact brand and suggested I use the Ultra-Light, oil free formula.  </li>
      <li>It is very oily on application and the oil never absorbs for it to be a sunscreen for face.</li>
      <li>Thanks.  </li>
      <li>I even wear it as my base face moisturizer before putting on my make up, and my skin feels light, fresh, and most importantly PROTECTED!  </li>
      <li>Better than the &amp;#34;Uber Dry&amp;#34; but a little bit oily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, and since my skin is super dry, that&#x27;s another plus.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using PTR for a few years now and love this formula over the newest one.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Also, don&#x27;t put it to near your eyes, it stings wicked!</li>
      <li>I love this sun block, it was not that expensive and it really works than you very much, I will buy it again</li>
      <li>I use this all of the time on my entire body, super sheer, non greasy.  </li>
      <li>from our 1 year old to mom and dad.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve put it on everyday since receiving it, and it is light and nourishing to my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, no problems with it.</li>
      <li>I have a very oily T zone and normal/dry everywhere else, and my entire face would be greasy immediately.</li>
      <li>This product is not made for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this would be okay for people with oily skin, but it definitely did not work my combination oily skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this and give it a big holler for being MADE IN THE USA!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to give yourself 30 minutes prior to sun exposure to apply this product and reapply this product every few hours just like any sunscreen product or you will not get the protection you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>so I end up with sunscreen in my eyes constantly as it melts and liquefies under direct sunlight....</li>
      <li>The only thing &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; about this item was an old sticker- labeled &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Even when I apply just a tiny bit on my very dry hands, it looks very shiny.</li>
      <li>This one looks a little shiny at first, but the shine fades.</li>
      <li>It is too thick for my face and leaves it feeling sticky - and you are supposed to be generous with your sunscreen for adequate protection.</li>

<li> It has not irritated my skin, which often happens with thick sunblocks.</li>

<li> I have used this product for YEARS (seriously), and my skin shows it!</li>
<li> ill wait for the uberdry</li>
<li> It also does not set, so it is horrible under makeup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t break me out like almost every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, and since my skin is super dry, that&#x27;s another plus. But it is a bit on the greasy side, so I&#x27;m still looking for a matte-finish product.</li>
    <li> I ordered a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Peter Thomas sunblock and received an old, scuffed bottle with scotch tape securing the lid closed. The only thing &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; about this item was an old sticker- labeled &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. Sketchy.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely lovely face sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve put it on everyday since receiving it, and it is light and nourishing to my skin.  I have a mild combination skin type, but this does not irritate or make my skin look more oily or dry.  I even wear it as my base face moisturizer before putting on my make up, and my skin feels light, fresh, and most importantly PROTECTED!  You also don&#x27;t need to use too much because a little bit goes a long way.  I highly recommend this and give it a big holler for being MADE IN THE USA!</li>
    <li> Moisture without the oily film. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this sun block, it was not that expensive and it really works than you very much, I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after watching one of Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s brilliant beauty video blogs on sunscreens that she recommends.  This was exactly as she said - light, non greasy coverage - perfect for sensitive skin and provides really good protection.  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for YEARS (seriously), and my skin shows it! LOVE it. Warning: Do not buy the heavier PTR Sunblock by mistake. That one goes on like toothpaste. This one looks a little shiny at first, but the shine fades.</li>
    <li> This is the holy grail of sunblocks for me!! Other sunblocks were greasy or chalky but this one is perfect. My skin absolutely glows when I put it on and people are always complimenting me on my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it! I always have at least two extras because I never want to run out of it. I have very sensitive skin and I never have any reaction to it, a first for me with sunblocks! It&#x27;s pricey but a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a girl at Sephora, but they didn&#x27;t carry it.  Purchased from Amazon and have been using for about a month and LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is not what I would consider ultra-lite. It is too thick for my face and leaves it feeling sticky - and you are supposed to be generous with your sunscreen for adequate protection. I have relegated it to use on my neck and upper shoulders and chest area. It has not irritated my skin, which often happens with thick sunblocks. I will not be repurchasing it. I have found much better texture and lighter options for my face with Paula&#x27;s Choice sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using PTR for a few years now and love this formula over the newest one.  It&#x27;s lite, non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave the white cast....love it!&lt;br /&gt;Shipment arrived timely and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> LOVETHIS SUNSCREEN NOT TOO GREASY AND GOES ON SMOOTHLY.</li>
    <li> Better than the &amp;#34;Uber Dry&amp;#34; but a little bit oily.</li>
    <li> Is the most amazing sun block for my oily face!!&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for years!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years - will use it the rest of my life!  Thanks.  Light fresh feeling.  No scent.</li>
    <li> For years I went to anesthetician who used the Peter Thomas Roth productline and this is one of the products she had me use. It is unscented and very nice feeling on the skin. She tried to get me to buy another line when it went public and was not available exclusively to estheticians but I refused. It&#x27;s important to give yourself 30 minutes prior to sun exposure to apply this product and reapply this product every few hours just like any sunscreen product or you will not get the protection you&#x27;re looking for. Also, don&#x27;t put it to near your eyes, it stings wicked!</li>
    <li> Hate it so much. Super greasy and it sweats off easily so I end up with sunscreen in my eyes constantly as it melts and liquefies under direct sunlight....&lt;br /&gt;Also, I break out like crazy after using this and the whole point of buying expensive sunscreen was to have it work without that.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time on my entire body, super sheer, non greasy.  I have sensitive skin, no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for about 18 years.  I&#x27;ve tried others, and either didn&#x27;t like what they did for my skin, they way they felt on my skin, or the way they made my skin look (either too greasy or too white).  Finally, my esthetician recommended this exact brand and suggested I use the Ultra-Light, oil free formula.  I wear it daily and love it.  I wash my skin, skip the moisturizer and use this instead--sunscreen and moisture all in one.  I love my sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used PTR for over 20 years-this sunscreen is the only one that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes. It works great and feels wonderful</li>
    <li> finally a sunscreen the entire family can use.  from our 1 year old to mom and dad.  goes on great, the kids don&#x27;t mind it and it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and absorbs quickly. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Love the way this product feels on my skin.  When I first started using this a couple years ago, I did experience some itching, but that has gone away.  You get a lot of product for a reasonable price and it lasts at least six months (with everyday use).</li>
    <li> This product is not made for sensitive or acne prone skin. It is very oily on application and the oil never absorbs for it to be a sunscreen for face. So, if you have an oily skin or acne prone skin, I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> When I purchase this product locally, it has a tight plastic wrap which shows it&#x27;s never been opened before. This product was sent to me without a plastic wrap, nor a seal.  It gives the impression of having been used because of that.</li>
    <li> i got a good deal,your product is excellent i have been using said product for the longest time with very good results your price on this item is very resonable i would highly recommend it very highly,thank you,very much keep up the good work!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so of course i was skeptical. but this product is awesome. I have oily, acne-prone skin, so finding sunscreens that don&#x27;t make me look like an oil slick in 15 min after application, is quite difficult. This product has worked so well for me. after cleansing and applying serum or oil-free matte moisturizer, i wait five minutes then apply this sunscreen. NO OILINESS. I can apply my make up after about 5-8 minutes and I&#x27;m ready to go!! This stuff works!! It is pricey but when you have tried as many products as i have, it&#x27;s worth it when you find one that works. Plus, think about how long this tube will last you..... you only use a teeny-tiney amount each time :)</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients, but it leaves a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling on my skin and with heat AND humidity forget about putting any makeup over this.... I does protect well but I will not buy this again, I need something less greasy for my face....</li>
    <li> i bought thiis thinking that it would be oil free. felt greasy to me. i have oily tzone and sometimes cheeks. wanted to try this because i loved the uberdry and it was not available. nope. wont be buying again. ill wait for the uberdry</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;ultra-lite&amp;#34; in the product name is misleading. It does have a lotion consistency vs cream, but it is still thick and very greasy. I have a very oily T zone and normal/dry everywhere else, and my entire face would be greasy immediately. It also does not set, so it is horrible under makeup. Even when I apply just a tiny bit on my very dry hands, it looks very shiny. I&#x27;m not sure how this would be okay for people with oily skin, but it definitely did not work my combination oily skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! it is light,fragrance free and perfectly works for for my super oily acne skin.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a matte sunblock to wear under makeup because it&#x27;s marketed as &amp;#34;Ultra-Lite,&amp;#34; but it still feels a bit too heavy and greasy on the skin for my liking. I probably will not repurchase.</li>
