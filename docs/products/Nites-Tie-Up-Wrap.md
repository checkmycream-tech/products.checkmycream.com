      <li>but the price here is a lot more affordable</li>
      <li>It would be a much better buy without shipping costs, etc.</li>
      <li>so I have searched and purchased a many  products, wrap caps, nets you name it</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off with a doo-rag.</li>
      <li>TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THE MORE SILKIER SIDE.</li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>girly girls like color, please add more color choices.</li>
      <li>Good product, fast delivery</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and wrap around my head.</li>
      <li>For the most part, its cute how I can make a bow on my forehead so my husband is not complaining too much about having my hair wrapped up. :)</li>
      <li>This fits my head just fine.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the service; I would recommend to anyone trying to maitain their hair; although i would prefer not to have black colors.</li>
      <li>This product is cheap as in dollar store cheap.</li>
      <li>Both the fabric and crafstmanship are extremely cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, but doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture, and I haven&#x27;t been able to tie it to look anything like the picture.</li>
      <li>is very comfy : )</li>
      <li>The best thing about this scarf (which is really like an advanced du-rag) is that since it holds my style so well, I don&#x27;t have to use heat on my hair everyday!!</li>
      <li>be consistent or give a choice!</li>
      <li>Oh well, it was worth a shot</li>
      <li>Which is rare esp since I don&#x27;t get perms.</li>
      <li>It was worth getting to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Okay let me start by saying I am a wild sleeper.</li>
      <li>It came right on time.</li>
      <li>Once wrapped it stays on even if you toss and turn, there is a long tie to make sure it stays on secure.</li>
      <li>, they are exactly was i was looking for.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims to do with no slippage.</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY</li>
      <li>This is the first scarf that is still on my head when I wake up in the morning</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be more of a rectangular long strip......</li>
      <li>As my color taste is personal and not every woman has really long hair (and a big head, honestly :) ), this product may work for you.</li>
      <li>This product works great, isn&#x27;t hot and heavy, and keeps my hair really flat.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I roll around too much at night --</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
      <li>When wrapping around the head, the ties stay flat and comfortable against your head.</li>
      <li>This product went right back in the package that it came in</li>
      <li>the cap is simply not big enough for my hip lenghth hair to fit.</li>
      <li>Better then an elastic satin cap, this stays in place because it allows us to tie it as tight or as loose as you choose, and it is capable of holding longer hair as well as shorter hair, and puffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft so it doesn&#x27;t lead to breakage</li>
      <li>company offers no color choices.</li>
      <li>Item as described, seems to work well so far.</li>
      <li>This thing is a good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my head, and is uncomfortable any way I tie it up.  </li>
      <li>This wrap is easy to tie up, but my only complaint is that it sometimes feels oily and it seems to be absorbing the coconut oil in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what was expected</li>
      <li>now I don&#x27;t loose them thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>Neither is it necessary to wrap super tight for it to stay on.</li>
      <li>I love this item because the material it thick enough and silky enough to keep my hair moist.</li>
      <li>Two other things I like; no excess tail of fabric in the back, and the crown of this wrap doesn&#x27;t press tightly on the top of head.</li>
      <li>but it kept sliding back leaving my edges out before completely falling off, it fell off in the middle of the night.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> slips off my head during sleep...didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I love this item because the material it thick enough and silky enough to keep my hair moist. The wrap is big enough for those who have a lot of thick hair. Once wrapped it stays on even if you toss and turn, there is a long tie to make sure it stays on secure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not expensive, but doesn&#x27;t look at all like the picture, and I haven&#x27;t been able to tie it to look anything like the picture.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> My package got lost but the seller was so nice and sent me another one. I love these, they are exactly was i was looking for. It&#x27;s soft so it doesn&#x27;t lead to breakage and it keeps your hair out of your face. Great alternative to a satin pillowcase.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on head overnight unless you pin it on, and I don&#x27;t want to sleep with pins in my hair.</li>
    <li> Unlike du-rags, the ties are long and wide. When wrapping around the head, the ties stay flat and comfortable against your head. Du-rags ties tend to curl into themselves and form a tight vise-like thin band around the head. With these, after unwrapping, no indentations are left on your forehead. Two other things I like; no excess tail of fabric in the back, and the crown of this wrap doesn&#x27;t press tightly on the top of head. Neither is it necessary to wrap super tight for it to stay on. When unwrapping, if you desire to keep a little volume in the crown of your hairstyle, you have that option with this wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be used for people who sleep in foam rollers. This will accomodate small to large rollers. The jumbo rollers may not work with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company offers no color choices. I received a pink one.</li>
    <li> For some reason on some days this scarf doesn&#x27;t stay on, &amp; its cheaper at Walmart. The scarf inside looks nothing like the picture on the outside.&amp; its certainly not satin.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO. THIS ONE IS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO MY FAVORITE \\&quot;GOLD MAGIC WRAP CAP\\&quot; THIS ONE YOU HAVE TO TURN INSIDE OUT TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THE MORE SILKIER SIDE.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would recommend to anyone trying to maitain their hair; although i would prefer not to have black colors.</li>
    <li> This is the first scarf that is still on my head when I wake up in the morning and I&#x27;ve seen it in stores but the price here is a lot more affordable plus it&#x27;s a good resting place for my glasses now I don&#x27;t loose them thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday morning, and I tried it on in the afternoon and again in the evening. I tied it extra tight in the afternoon and it fell off my head.  At night I tied it slightly looser but still tight to see if it would stay but it kept sliding back leaving my edges out before completely falling off, it fell off in the middle of the night. I might buy the bonnet and try that out since this doesn&#x27;t stay on even for a nap. I really wanted this to work. :/</li>
    <li> I HATE IT BECAUSE IT SLIPS OFF TOO EASILY DURING MY SLEEPING HOURS. I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH IT GONE FROM MY HEAD EVEN IF I TIE IT ON TIGHT. NO GOOD!</li>
    <li> this is the one product that does the trick, I wear a wrap so I have searched and purchased a many  products, wrap caps, nets you name it but this is the one. scarf covers your entire head, ties down without having knots to content  with during the night, the color does not matter to me as I wear it at night</li>
    <li> You could not pick a color...the first one i ordered was pink but the second one is black...be consistent or give a choice!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! It does exactly what it claims to do with no slippage. I only wish they shipped out other colors. This is a product marketed mainly to ladies but from what I read, everybody gets a black wrap. I got black. FYI manufacturer:  girly girls like color, please add more color choices. I bet you will see sale increases if you do.</li>
    <li> Does great and holds when  you sleep.</li>
    <li> Okay let me start by saying I am a wild sleeper. I wear regular satin scarves but they always come off around the edges which I hate. With this, it stays on all night &amp; my hair style is still perfect around the edges. The best thing about this scarf (which is really like an advanced du-rag) is that since it holds my style so well, I don&#x27;t have to use heat on my hair everyday!! Which is rare esp since I don&#x27;t get perms. I haven&#x27;t pressed/flat ironed my edges in 3 days!! Which is UNBELIEVABLE for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> This fits my head just fine. It&#x27;s a good product. It came right on time. I wish I could have picked the color though. I got brown.</li>
    <li> This product went right back in the package that it came in and I haven&#x27;t&#x27; used it for my daughter since. It is ENTIRELY too tight. She could not comfortably fit it onto her size 3T head. You&#x27;re better off with a doo-rag. This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap, however it is also useless. Does not stay on at all. Also, it is shown in a green color on the package and came as a dark brown.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this product I couldn&#x27;t find a single wrap that would stay on all night without me having to wake up 2-3 times in the middle of the night and retie it.  This product works great, isn&#x27;t hot and heavy, and keeps my hair really flat.  Wouldn&#x27;t definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Do not go by the pictures- the &amp;#34;choice&amp;#34; is not limited to green and black. Not only can I not stand the color pink clashing with my entire household scheme- not to mention my nightclothes! - the cap is simply not big enough for my hip lenghth hair to fit. As my color taste is personal and not every woman has really long hair (and a big head, honestly :) ), this product may work for you. I do suggest seeing if your local dollar store carries them, though. It would be a much better buy without shipping costs, etc.</li>
    <li> According to the product, this satin cap is supposed to stay on your head as you sleep. I toss and turn a lot. In other words. this product is a hit or miss. For the most part, its cute how I can make a bow on my forehead so my husband is not complaining too much about having my hair wrapped up. :)</li>
    <li> This thing is a good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my head, and is uncomfortable any way I tie it up.  Maybe my head is just an odd shape and not conducive to head wraps. Maybe I roll around too much at night -- I know I am a very active sleeper. But it is not comfortable for me. It may work for someone else.  It was worth getting to give it a try. They are not super expensive.</li>
    <li> The seam is in the middle of the &amp;#34;hood&amp;#34; of this scarf, which can cause an impression on your forehead after sleeping with it all night.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be more of a rectangular long strip...... But instead it was a doorag. I still use it &amp; it is nice</li>
    <li> I love this cap! It&#x27;s a little thin and doesn&#x27;t really look like the photo but that was alright for me as long as it worked, and boy did it work. I have really thick hair that a little past shoulder length, and this cap covered my entire head without suffocating my hair. I braid my hair up at night and put this on and it stays on the entire night (unlike other ones I have purchased)and is very comfy : )</li>
    <li> I bought this to wrap my hair at night. Even if I use clips the wrap will fall out during the night. It may be because of my hair. I have thin, fine hair. I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> The material is not as seen, its lighter and not a satin feel. It still does the job as described though and it stays on.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Both the fabric and crafstmanship are extremely cheap. Look for another product.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold in place, bought one at the store to try but good thing it was cheaper in store than online because I regret purchasing this. your better off buying a satin pillowcase not this garbage.</li>
    <li> Great head wrap. It is easy to use and wrap around my head. I love it.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It slide off and does not work as I would like.</li>
    <li> This wrap is easy to tie up, but my only complaint is that it sometimes feels oily and it seems to be absorbing the coconut oil in my hair.  I probably use a lot of product so its not a big deal.  Also the picture makes it looks like there is a pillow-like scarf with some kind of cushion in it, but it does not have that.  It is a smooth and thin silk hooded scarf with two very long ends that you wrap around your head.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap as in dollar store cheap. The size is very small which makes it useless. Material slightly thicker than panty hose but still see through. The color that arrived is beige. This product is a disappointment would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Really great - stays on and keeps my hair in place!</li>
    <li> Item as described, seems to work well so far.</li>
    <li> Better then an elastic satin cap, this stays in place because it allows us to tie it as tight or as loose as you choose, and it is capable of holding longer hair as well as shorter hair, and puffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product and would recommend it to anyone tired of the elastic in other caps.</li>
    <li> This was the best wrap I have ever purchased.  It stays on perfect.  Other scarves had thin ties and they pulled out my hairline.  This one is perfect!</li>
    <li> I purchased this I hopes to keep my daughters curly hair intact while she slept. She has beautiful curly hair that gets frizzy when she sleeps. I was hoping this would stay on her head, but it did not. Oh well, it was worth a shot</li>
