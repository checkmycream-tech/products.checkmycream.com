      <li>And then the clouds parted and the sun came out and the angels sang and I have soft, manageable hair.  </li>
      <li>Once again, my hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been travelling to the coast on a couple of trips, where the moisture and humidity was quite different from the arid high desert where I live.  </li>
      <li>but I cannot because my fine hair does seem to get flat after repetitive use.</li>
      <li>My secret recipe consists of one pump of the Pureology Instant Repair and one squirt about the size of a quarter of the Nectar Thermique, rubbed through gently towel-dried clean hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product arrived quickly and has performed well. My husband and I both use it and it keeps my flyaways (long hair) and his short wavy hair in place whenever we use it. He uses it everyday but I cannot because my fine hair does seem to get flat after repetitive use. I take a break for a day or too and all is well again. I like that is can be used for gel even though it is a repair product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Shipped very fast. Price was very reasonable. Cheaper to buy the two small ones then it was for one big one.</li>
    <li> Well, my hair was having serious &#x27;bad hair&#x27; issues.  I&#x27;d been travelling to the coast on a couple of trips, where the moisture and humidity was quite different from the arid high desert where I live.  Result?  Frizzy, knotted hair, that made me wonder, &amp;#34;who is this woman&amp;#34; when I looked in the mirror?  I dug in my bathroom cupboard and found this product.  It saved my hair from cutting it all off as a last resort.  Once again, my hair was soft and manageable.  I instantly ordered a 2 pack to always have this product on hand.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser for my med length curly hair.  Works well as a leave in conditioner and gel at the same time.  I wash, towel dry then run the gel through and let air dry.  Reconstitutes well the next day with dampened hands or the over spray in the shower.  I have used many gel type products, this one is my current favorite.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist highly recommended this, works nicely after putting in hair - I apply to partially dry after washing - keeps my hair looking healthy without weighting down, helps keep the frizz out and doesn&#x27;t make hair look dull.</li>
    <li> still using it but not noticing repair of split ends and softness or conditioning not what was expected from product</li>
    <li> This pack of two was a savings, but it was not the same quality as the last one I bought in the salon.</li>
    <li> Better buy at amazon than any salon or beauty supply place I&#x27;ve found. Pureology leave-in conditioner does a great job without weighing down your hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The hair products came sealed in a plastic bag and one or both arrived leaking. A good portion of the product will be wasted when I unseal the plastic bag. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great with thick hair and softens quickly.  Helps my damage hair from the outdoor abuse it takes weekly.  I&#x27;ve tried others but never have had the results I get with Pureology</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Kerastase Nectar Thermique (also reviewed) and it has changed the way my world turns.  I suffered needlessly from ultra frizzy, dull, dry, do-whatever-it-wants-to hair, but then this stuff came along.  And then the clouds parted and the sun came out and the angels sang and I have soft, manageable hair.  My secret recipe consists of one pump of the Pureology Instant Repair and one squirt about the size of a quarter of the Nectar Thermique, rubbed through gently towel-dried clean hair.  After blow drying and flat ironing, my hair is beeyooteeful!! Happiness follows. A manageable price is about twenty four dollars a bottle purchased individually. I paid forty two for two bottles purchased together in April 2104.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  My hair is colored and highlighted, blown dry and flat ironed and it tends to be dry.  I use this product first thing every morning before I use anything else on my hair.  It makes my hair softer and easier to style.  The price I paid on Amazon was very reasonable.  Much less expensive then when I bought it from my stylist.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with the product. It didn&#x27;t take too long and it was packed nicely so that it wouldn&#x27;t open in route.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved the Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner, so I thought this would be a great addition.  I was wrong.  Looking at the name, maybe my expectations were incorrect.  I was expecting a product with a creme-based consistency that would moisterize my hair.  When I pumped some into my hand, it is actually more like a gel and contains a lot of alcohol.  I am Black with natural,fine hair.  This product dried out my hair and made it feel brittle.  At first, I thought that maybe the bottle and the contents had some how gotten mixed up.  But I went to a beauty supply store, and it was the same.  I am particularly disappointed because 1) Pureology products are expensive, and 2) I was dim enough to be a two pack before I tried a sample like I did with their other products.  So I&#x27;m stuck now.  I had to buy another shea-butter leave-in to go with this to keep my hair from feeling like steel wool.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  I have crazy, long, thick, curly, color-treated hair, and this has helped my hair to become softer and more manageable.  Also my color stays better.  Highly recommend! :)</li>
    <li> Knew what I wanted and found it on Amazon. I avoided the awful trip to the Mall with question whether it was available in store.&lt;br /&gt;The product has an easy dispenser. Holds my hair in place all day. No rinse . No odor. Bought 2 at one time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product!! My hair is so much healthier now! It works so much better than redkin products!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants moisture, a way to help with damaged hair, and wants to control any frizz</li>
    <li> This stuff hardens on your hair leaving it with a crispness like some cheap gel. What a waste of money. It&#x27;s nothing like the Pureology leave in conditioner. I should have realized if it&#x27;s too good to be true it&#x27;s not true. Take my word for it. Go to your salon and buy the official product there. In the long run, less expensive and your expectations will be met. Live and learn for me.</li>
