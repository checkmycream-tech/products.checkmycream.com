      <li>Nice scent.</li>
      <li>so it does a nice job of soothing irritation.  </li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth with no burn and does a good job of moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Others can describe the scent better, so I&#x27;ll leave it at this... of their many barbershop fresh/clean scents, this one doesn&#x27;t stand out to me.</li>
      <li>Would definitely order from them again, they are great!</li>
      <li>so mostly it sits on the shelf.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and nice.</li>
      <li>I also have the sandalwood, which is my favorite scent, and works just as well.</li>
      <li>I get better results using Aftra</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I will keep buying this product for sure.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s healing magic.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the scent from both.</li>
      <li>Scent is really nice and got a compliment from a cute girl (friendly hug)..</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for....nice feeling after shaving and pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>It has a classic fragrance, and it feels great on the skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is great highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Excellent results with no oily feel afterwards, and leaves my face refreshed all day long.</li>
      <li>Has a perfect smell and superior cool down.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t not really smell like Sandalwood if that what you&#x27;re looking for, but it stacks very well with TOBS sandalwood shaving cream and Sandalwood Luxury Cologne, very happy with the purchase, smells great and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>Apply to wet face and you will get the perfect consistency.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t overpower, and in fact will happily take a back seat to any strong-ish smelling aftershave you might want to place on top of it.</li>
      <li>Easy call 5 star.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong to wear to work.</li>
      <li>The Mr. Taylor&#x27;s scent is a strong, manly smell that passed the &amp;#34;wife test&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Finally, as I sometimes have a beard, this product works great for moisturizing beards as well.</li>
      <li>I’ve been using this product for about 6 or 7 years now and it is a fantastic aftershave balm.</li>
      <li>After applying, I could see that my skin looked refreshed and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin on my neck and this combined with good shaving soap</li>
      <li>While I liked Taylor of Old Bond Street products this aftershave balm just didn&#x27;t measure up.  </li>
      <li>i now actually smell this product almost every time i&#x27;m in the bathroom because smells SOOO good.  </li>
      <li>For this kind of money I&#x27;m pretty sure you could get three times the amount of an equally protective Nivea or Netrogena balm.</li>
      <li>The smell is a clean fresh scent that lasts about 3 hours.  </li>
      <li>Non-greasy, absorbs quickly, but you still feel it work</li>
      <li>Quickly absorbs.</li>
      <li>This is my very first aftershave balm.</li>
      <li>Leaves my freshly shaved face feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
      <li>With no alcohol and all the other great ingredients &#x3D; a smooth cool down that you will love!</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
      <li>It has sort of a mediciney smell at first but fades into a really clean smell.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I use post shave, it&#x27;s a great old school smell and feel!</li>
      <li>We love the Taylor of Old Bond Street brand, have the shaving cream too.  </li>
      <li>Just Love Taylor of Old Bond Street products and this product does not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised when I found this was more of a gel than a cream.  </li>
      <li>For reference if you&#x27;re familiar, I much prefer the St James scent.</li>
      <li>I think this is one you have to smell and like right away.</li>
      <li>Feels fantastic after an easy shave, and even better when you might have hit it too hard.</li>
      <li>As with all higher-end products, it may be pricey, but it certainly is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Let me say this first-</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but nothing puts out the fire after a close shave like this wonderful aloe formula.</li>
      <li>I use many different products because I like to try them all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this TOBS aftershave right after using TOBS shave cream, used small amount, provides good protection - soothing.  </li>
      <li>The scent has gotten overwhelmingly positive reviews from women I know.</li>
      <li>and I love the way my face feels and smells all day long.</li>
      <li>Thats normal and will go away once the skin has absorbed the aftershave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t grow on you.</li>
      <li>Very soothing without the burn</li>
      <li>Really soothes my face after a shave.</li>
      <li>I like a lot of TOBS scents in their shaving creams and aftershaves (not so much with their preshaves).</li>
      <li>Absolutely a quality probuct</li>
      <li>If you leave your face to wet, it takes a lot more rubbing to get it into the skin, which can lead to irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Moisturizes the face really well and leaves it feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>I happen to appreciate the scent, and my girlfriend absolutely loves</li>
      <li>Gentle on just-shaved skin, and the scent lingers almost all day.</li>
      <li>This balm, like most of the products from Taylor of Old Bond Street is terrific.</li>
      <li>The smell is subtle and the moisturizing action is great.</li>
      <li>Feels great on the skin after a shave and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving soaps but this doesn&#x27;t live up to the other products.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great....love it........</li>
    <li> Smells great, a little goes a long way and definitely seems to help fight the few small spots that I tend to get razor burn in.</li>
    <li> This is a great aftershave. It has sort of a mediciney smell at first but fades into a really clean smell.Moisturizes the face really well and leaves it feeling refreshed. I am looking forward to trying some of the other scents in the future. I especially like the fact that there is no alcohol. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great after shave! It&#x27;s a little thick out of the tube so a little will go a long ways. I rinse my face with cold water and leave wet, then dry my hands and apply small amount of balm. Apply to wet face and you will get the perfect consistency. The fragrance is light and nice. With no alcohol and all the other great ingredients &#x3D; a smooth cool down that you will love!</li>
    <li> I like a lot of TOBS scents in their shaving creams and aftershaves (not so much with their preshaves). I don&#x27;t mind this but will not be ordering it again. Others can describe the scent better, so I&#x27;ll leave it at this... of their many barbershop fresh/clean scents, this one doesn&#x27;t stand out to me. For reference if you&#x27;re familiar, I much prefer the St James scent.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 3 or 4 stars if it was a cream based after shave, but it&#x27;s liquidy and very dry on face. It does sooth the face but you still have to put facial lotion on because of dryness so it defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use post shave, it&#x27;s a great old school smell and feel! Hard to find at times but worth searching for.</li>
    <li> Soothes and smells terrific.  I little drop goes a long way so don&#x27;t waste it!</li>
    <li> Very soothing without the burn</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t not really smell like Sandalwood if that what you&#x27;re looking for, but it stacks very well with TOBS sandalwood shaving cream and Sandalwood Luxury Cologne, very happy with the purchase, smells great and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> i bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s drugstore brand aftershave that i hated the smell of and i am so glad i did!  i now actually smell this product almost every time i&#x27;m in the bathroom because smells SOOO good.  my husband has somewhat sensitive skin and has no complaints about this product.  HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and smells manly.</li>
    <li> It works as a balm but after it is applied it has no fragrance at all</li>
    <li> This one is not like their preshave gel and it&#x27;s a great product. Has a perfect smell and superior cool down. Easy call 5 star. I will keep buying this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I use TOBS Sensitive Shaving cream alongside of this. I absolutely love the scent from both. Also, a lot of people were saying the scent makes you smell like an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;. I happen to appreciate the scent, and my girlfriend absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the tube was pretty small, but after using the product, I have come to realize that a little bit goes a long way. Be sure to use cold water to close your pores, and then dry your face well prior to putting this on. If you leave your face to wet, it takes a lot more rubbing to get it into the skin, which can lead to irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could immediately see the difference that this aftershave made. After applying, I could see that my skin looked refreshed and smooth. My girlfriend immediately noticed the difference as well. I have sensitive skin, so my concern was that this would burn, but it was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aftershave, once applied, lasted about half the day. While the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, I happened to put a lot on my upper lip the first time. Bad idea. I learned to apply less on my upper lip, and I no longer had any issues. Once I rubbed it in, the skin felt every so slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;. Thats normal and will go away once the skin has absorbed the aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used so far. Excellent results with no oily feel afterwards, and leaves my face refreshed all day long.</li>
    <li> Nice sandalwood/musk smell that is not overwhelming but not too weak to be ignored.  Feels great on the skin after a shave and a little goes a long way.  No burn feel and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and moisturized instead of dried out like alcohol based after shaves have for me.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin on my neck and this combined with good shaving soap helps a lot. The smell is great highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We love the Taylor of Old Bond Street brand, have the shaving cream too.  This after shave has a nice scent and feels great too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after shave balm for my boyfriend and he said it is a great product to use after shaving.  Cools you down and really moisturizes the skin.  The smell is a clean fresh scent that lasts about 3 hours.  Very satisfied with the product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell like the soap, which is unfortunate because that&#x27;s mainly why I ordered it.  It has witch Hazel and Bolinol so it does a nice job of soothing irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t moistuize and I was expecting a white &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;, not a sticky clear &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Gentle on just-shaved skin, and the scent lingers almost all day.</li>
    <li> Nice scent.Not overpowering..Good stuff</li>
    <li> As with all TOBS products, this one lives up to the reputation. The Mr. Taylor&#x27;s scent is a strong, manly smell that passed the &amp;#34;wife test&amp;#34;. It cools that little burning sensation with no problems. It&#x27;s not as thick as some, and not a liquid as others, it&#x27;s about halfway between the two. I use many different products because I like to try them all. As with all higher-end products, it may be pricey, but it certainly is well worth the money. I also have the sandalwood, which is my favorite scent, and works just as well.</li>
    <li> very good product from an established industry leader</li>
    <li> Soothing, but not quite the smell I was looking for.</li>
    <li> great product, glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Really nice cream.  It has a classic fragrance, and it feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> While I liked Taylor of Old Bond Street products this aftershave balm just didn&#x27;t measure up.  Whil I believe it is a quality product and goes a long way for the price, I have sinsitive skin and I found my face was irritated after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this TOBS aftershave right after using TOBS shave cream, used small amount, provides good protection - soothing.  Also comparing against recently purchased Proraso Blue Aftershave lotion.</li>
    <li> Scent is really nice and got a compliment from a cute girl (friendly hug).. Not sure on the effects on my skin yet.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but nothing puts out the fire after a close shave like this wonderful aloe formula. It&#x27;s clean and cool, not oily or creamy, and the subtle scent makes me feel like a proper gentleman... even when I&#x27;m just slacking off!</li>
    <li> Really soothes my face after a shave. The smell is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> Let me say this first- I LOVE this product. The feel, the scent, it&#x27;s all very lovely. It has a nice cologne-y smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t overpower, and in fact will happily take a back seat to any strong-ish smelling aftershave you might want to place on top of it. I currently use it underneath Clubman and I love the way my face feels and smells all day long. It has a very gooey consistency at first, but once it dries it really does soothe the bumps and nicks you get from a hastily executed DE wet shave. (I, unfortunately, find myself rushing my wet shaves in the morning... I know, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m working on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I can&#x27;t stand is the PRICE of this stuff. And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not more than 3 stars to me. For this kind of money I&#x27;m pretty sure you could get three times the amount of an equally protective Nivea or Netrogena balm. I&#x27;m sad to say that I while I do love spending my hard earned money on manly shave stuff, the price point here is just too high for me to continue buying it. I may ask for a tube every few months and use it on special occasions, but I can&#x27;t see my using it every day and having any money left.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered the wrong scent of this from FGP and wanted the Jermyn Street which I think smells a lot better. They offered to just ship it back and exchange it for the Jermyn Street with no problems at all. Wonderful service by them and great speedy delivery. Would definitely order from them again, they are great!</li>
    <li> Great scent, amazing product. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using it for years and it&#x27;s as good as ever.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Leaves a slight tingly feeling after use but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way a tube will last a while.</li>
    <li> Quickly absorbs. Witch Hazel is amazing. Feels fantastic after an easy shave, and even better when you might have hit it too hard. Bought a bottle just to keep in my office, as well as home. Face feels like a million bucks. Understated, but nice &amp;#34;Guy&amp;#34; scent. Use after every shave - smooth or (especially) rough! Non-greasy, absorbs quickly, but you still feel it work it&#x27;s healing magic. Best Witch Hazel and nutrient rich aftershave out there.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I found this was more of a gel than a cream.  It goes on smooth with no burn and does a good job of moisturizing.  It has a subtle scent that my wife loves but it&#x27;s not too strong to wear to work.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a quality probuct</li>
    <li> I find this scent a little off - almost like a shave shop scent, but maybe a little soapy? I think this is one you have to smell and like right away. It certainly doesn&#x27;t grow on you. I can&#x27;t decide if I like it or not when I&#x27;m wearing it so mostly it sits on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this product for about 6 or 7 years now and it is a fantastic aftershave balm. I mainly use it because I have both very sensitive skin and very dry skin. This does a great job of calming any irritation from shaving and moisturizes my skin as well. I have also had no issues with it causing my skin to break out, which I mention because it has certainly been a problem for me with other aftershaves and to be honest there are very few that I’ve ever used that don’t cause me issues after a few days of usage. There is no noticeable scent to this product, which is another plus in my book. Finally, as I sometimes have a beard, this product works great for moisturizing beards as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a devoted TOBS fan, from their pre-shave oils to their shaving creams and aftershaves.  This one&#x27;s another winner.  Smells great, works great.  Leaves my freshly shaved face feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This is my very first aftershave balm. It has a manly scent, without being overbearing. Scent dissipates after an hour or two. Sooths skin without any burn and relieves razor burn like a champ. The oils and ingredients are great for your skin too.</li>
    <li> This balm, like most of the products from Taylor of Old Bond Street is terrific. The smell is subtle and the moisturizing action is great. The scent has gotten overwhelmingly positive reviews from women I know. Shaving about 4 times a week the 2.5 oz tube lasted about 6 months so that basically made up my mind to get another tube of it!</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great.</li>
    <li> I love the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving soaps but this doesn&#x27;t live up to the other products.  There are far better products out there for less.  I get better results using Aftra After Shave balm and it&#x27;s much less money.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for....nice feeling after shaving and pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Just Love Taylor of Old Bond Street products and this product does not disappoint.  Best shaving products on the market</li>
