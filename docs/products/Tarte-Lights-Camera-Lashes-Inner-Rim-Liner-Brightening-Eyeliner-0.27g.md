      <li>Great product to have and fun to use!</li>

      <li>IT HAS MANY USES FOR ME...</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I was really pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Too many liners flake throughout the day.</li>
      <li>i accidentally ordered two but am glad it happened.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I HAVE TRIED MOST EYE BRIGHTENERS ON THE MARKET</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>AND HAVE NOTICED THAT THE BRIGHTENER ACTS TO PROTECT THE BLACK EYE LINER, AND THEREFORE, EVEN IN VERY WINDY DAYS, DOESN&#x27;T RUN!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>HAVE FUN WITH THIS ITEM AS YOU WILL DISCOVER HOW MANY THINGS CAN BE DONE WITH JUST THIS ONE ITEM.</li>
      <li>I have medium light skin and</li>
      <li>so you have to make sure to get a right amount on.</li>
      <li>My tip would be that if tarte made a yellow, beige, and orangy tone like it already has it would be great :) never the less still love this product and will buy again.</li>
      <li>My eyes are very sensitive and most makeup irritates them.  </li>
      <li>Cover&#x27;s red rims and makes you look more perky!</li>
      <li>I applied this and it doesn&#x27;t give a consistent clean line.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and is very creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>Worth to try.</li>
      <li>THAT THIS WAS WORTH</li>
      <li>It perks you right up without looking cakey or Halloween-y.</li>
      <li>The reason I gave this 4 stars is because if it is applied lightly it doesn&#x27;t really show much and looks like it wore off</li>
      <li>Helps make a good primer for the black too.</li>
      <li>Great when you&#x27;ve been up too late or tossed and turned.  </li>
      <li>It can be used anywhere as a great highlighter, and doesn&#x27;t have that icky irridescent shine...just a natural light that makes a youthful glow</li>
      <li>You can also use it to highlight your eyes by applying it just right on your inner corners and below the eyebrow area for a nice, natural highlighting effect.</li>
      <li>My eyes are super sensitive</li>
      <li>Would certainly buy again.</li>
      <li>but if too much is applied it kind of looks messy</li>
      <li>, REALLY DID NOT MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERANCE ON MY EYES.</li>
      <li>This product is gentle on my eyes and really &amp;#34;wakes&amp;#34; me up in the morning.  </li>
      <li>but I really ended up liking it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;five stars because the product really works.</li>
      <li>but at that point I don&#x27;t really need it anymore anyway.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for brightening eyes anyway.</li>
      <li>I really do like this</li>
      <li>Go slow, apply with a light touch right on your inner lid, and kind of smudge as you go to blend it with your natural skin oils, careful not to cover up your lower lashes (though it&#x27;s easy to fix if you do).</li>
      <li>Pretty color but not for sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Thought it was my contacts, but when I stopped wearing my contacts and make up, my eyes got better, however, I put the brightener back in my eye again (w/o contacts) and the infection came back!!!</li>
      <li>THIS IS A TIP FOR OUR OLDER LADIES,</li>
      <li>It seriously looks good and very natural.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job very well, and is soft to apply.</li>
      <li>so my eyes get ringed with red easily, and just putting concealer under my eyes tends to exaggerate the redness of my inner lids.</li>
      <li>I wake up very early for work</li>
      <li>No chalky look, very natural looking although it shouldn&#x27;t be peachy colored.</li>
      <li>Really highlights the inner corners but looks natural!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge waste in my book.</li>
      <li>I wanted it (like not on my lower lashes or applied directly to my eyeballs)</li>
      <li>this nude inner rim brightner really makes my eyes pop.</li>
      <li>Really makes eyes look open and refreshed...</li>
      <li>My eyes are extremely sensitive and I also wear contact lenses.  </li>
      <li>I use it for it&#x27;s main purpose as an inner rim highlighter.  </li>
      <li>When applying inner liner it is important to not apply too much or too strongly since this is a delicate area and already delicate if you lack sleep or have redness in the eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain, I appreciate this product on how smooth it is, however even the lightest stroke applies a little too much color</li>

<li> I have been looking for a product like this for so long.</li>
<li> main reasons I removed one star is because it goes on a little to heavy.  </li>
<li> No lining my inner rim on the bottom of my eyes with dark liner to hide the redness.</li>
<li> However unfortunately with age my eyes require a little extra work to make them look more alive and less tired.  </li>
<li> Lessened my tired eyes (I sit in front of the computer all day long) and does have a natural effect of brightening your eyes.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> I have tried other inner lid liners before and they were difficult to apply and did not look natural.  </li>
<li> FIRST OF ALL, THE COLOR NUDE IS AN OFF-WHITE, SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING THAN THE UGLY \\&quot;WHITE\\&quot; ONES WHICH TEND TO AGE ONE AND LOOK SO ARTIFICIAL.  </li>
<li> so be prepared to blend it down.</li>
<li> WHO HAVE TROUBLE USING ANYTHING BELOW THE EYEBROW, DUE TO THE SOFTNESS AND AGING OF THE SKIN.  </li>
<li> Never the less...</li>
<li> I use black eyeliner on the top-inner lid and the eye brightener on the bottom.</li>
<li> I USE IT ON MY LOWER LIDS BEFORE APPLYING MY BLACK EYE LINER...</li>
<li> SO THAT THE BLACK LINER IS SLIGHTLY MUTED AND NOT TOO STARK.</li>
<li> A LITTLE LIFT AND ALSO USE FOR MY LOWER LIPS</li>
<li> It is non-irritating even in that delicate area.</li>
<li> It ends up being very thin in places and looks like it&#x27;s watered down and ends up looking ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
<li> I was skeptical about this item</li>
<li> AS A LITTLE LINER!!!!!!!!  </li>

    <li> I HAVE TRIED MOST EYE BRIGHTENERS ON THE MARKET AND NONE COMPARES TO THE TARTE EMPHAS INNER RIM BRIGHTENER.  FIRST OF ALL, THE COLOR NUDE IS AN OFF-WHITE, SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING THAN THE UGLY \\&quot;WHITE\\&quot; ONES WHICH TEND TO AGE ONE AND LOOK SO ARTIFICIAL.  IT HAS MANY USES FOR ME...I USE IT ON MY LOWER LIDS BEFORE APPLYING MY BLACK EYE LINER...SO THAT THE BLACK LINER IS SLIGHTLY MUTED AND NOT TOO STARK. AND HAVE NOTICED THAT THE BRIGHTENER ACTS TO PROTECT THE BLACK EYE LINER, AND THEREFORE, EVEN IN VERY WINDY DAYS, DOESN&#x27;T RUN!!!!!!!!!!  I USE IT AS A BRIGHTENER JUST BELOW MY EYEBROWS...IT GOES ON SMOOTHER THAN ANY PRODUCT DESIGNED TO BRIGHTEN.  THIS IS A TIP FOR OUR OLDER LADIES, WHO HAVE TROUBLE USING ANYTHING BELOW THE EYEBROW, DUE TO THE SOFTNESS AND AGING OF THE SKIN.  I ALSO USE THIS BRIGHTENER JUST ABOVE MY LIPS TO GIVE THE LIPS A LITTLE LIFT AND ALSO USE FOR MY LOWER LIPS AS A LITTLE LINER!!!!!!!!  HAVE FUN WITH THIS ITEM AS YOU WILL DISCOVER HOW MANY THINGS CAN BE DONE WITH JUST THIS ONE ITEM.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent smooth and creamy pencil.  I use it for it&#x27;s main purpose as an inner rim highlighter.  It goes on very nicely and most importantly smoothly.  My eyes are extremely sensitive and I also wear contact lenses.  In reality I should not be applying any make up on my inner rim. And I haven&#x27;t done so for the longest time.  However unfortunately with age my eyes require a little extra work to make them look more alive and less tired.  I&#x27;ve decided to give this highlighter a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did. It works beautifully and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reasons I removed one star is because it goes on a little to heavy.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, I appreciate this product on how smooth it is, however even the lightest stroke applies a little too much color and I have to use q-tip to remove extra product.  It&#x27;s a huge waste in my book. However, even with this flaw, I have to say this pencil is a staple in my cosmetic bag.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes your eyes pop. Doesn&#x27;t smudge or bother your eyes. Love it. Haven&#x27;t seen another one like it.</li>
    <li> I DIDNT FEEEL THAT THIS WAS WORTH THE PRICE, REALLY DID NOT MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERANCE ON MY EYES.</li>
    <li> Really makes eyes look open and refreshed... like you are well rested, even if you are not. Would certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> It is a very interesting make up accessory. The nude color looks good on everyone, without the \\&quot;frosty\\&quot; look. Worth to try.</li>
    <li> My eyes are very sensitive and most makeup irritates them.  This eyeliner is great.  No problems. It also makes the whites of your eyes appear whiter</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this item but I really ended up liking it. I brought this at Sephora and the make up artist who had suggested it says it&#x27;s for all skin tones. I have medium light skin and this nude inner rim brightner really makes my eyes pop. The reason I gave this 4 stars is because if it is applied lightly it doesn&#x27;t really show much and looks like it wore off but if too much is applied it kind of looks messy so you have to make sure to get a right amount on.</li>
    <li> Went into Sephora looking for an eye brightener that didn&#x27;t look too white on my latina skin or too cakey. Too many liners flake throughout the day. The product is off-white and creamy. I had to leave it on and walk around with it around the store to get used to the off-white (nude) idea. It seriously looks good and very natural. Lessened my tired eyes (I sit in front of the computer all day long) and does have a natural effect of brightening your eyes. Do not buy if you&#x27;re looking for glittery or party-like eye brightener. This is a more softer effect with good results. I use black eyeliner on the top-inner lid and the eye brightener on the bottom. Helps make a good primer for the black too. You can also use it to highlight your eyes by applying it just right on your inner corners and below the eyebrow area for a nice, natural highlighting effect. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an inner eye highlighter before so it took some time to figure out the best way for me, but once I got it wear I wanted it (like not on my lower lashes or applied directly to my eyeballs) I was really pleased with the results. I wake up very early for work so my eyes get ringed with red easily, and just putting concealer under my eyes tends to exaggerate the redness of my inner lids. With this, I don&#x27;t have that problem. It perks you right up without looking cakey or Halloween-y. Go slow, apply with a light touch right on your inner lid, and kind of smudge as you go to blend it with your natural skin oils, careful not to cover up your lower lashes (though it&#x27;s easy to fix if you do). A little goes a long way so I will repeat: use a very light touch and just keep dabbing &amp; smudging till you get what you&#x27;re going for. For me it kind of fades away by the evening but at that point I don&#x27;t really need it anymore anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this for my waterline. It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day. it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and is very creamy and smooth. Makes eyes look more awake and bright.</li>
    <li> I only like the color but it became powder once applied. If you use it on under eyelid, better find an eyeliner that has shimmer effect. No hassle no returns, coz I tried it in sephora store!</li>
    <li> I really do like this and it really does work and doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes so that is great! Try it!</li>
    <li> I have tried other inner lid liners before and they were difficult to apply and did not look natural.  This product is gentle on my eyes and really &amp;#34;wakes&amp;#34; me up in the morning.  Love it!</li>
    <li> No chalky look, very natural looking although it shouldn&#x27;t be peachy colored. It should be yellowish color since yellow covers redness, which is what this product is supposed to do. Never the less... it does it&#x27;s job very well, and is soft to apply. When applying inner liner it is important to not apply too much or too strongly since this is a delicate area and already delicate if you lack sleep or have redness in the eyes. My tip would be that if tarte made a yellow, beige, and orangy tone like it already has it would be great :) never the less still love this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I applied this and it doesn&#x27;t give a consistent clean line. It ends up being very thin in places and looks like it&#x27;s watered down and ends up looking ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered the Smashbox one and hope to have more luck.</li>
    <li> Great product to have and fun to use! Really highlights the inner corners but looks natural!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for so long. This is the ticket. No lining my inner rim on the bottom of my eyes with dark liner to hide the redness.</li>
    <li> i accidentally ordered two but am glad it happened. this has a creamy, easy-glide consistency.. but it can get caught in the lashline so be prepared to blend it down. then it is natural-looking and long-wearing. good for concealing, highlighting, and works as an eyeliner primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;five stars because the product really works.</li>
    <li> I like this product on the inner corners of my eyes for a pop there.  It can be used anywhere as a great highlighter, and doesn&#x27;t have that icky irridescent shine...just a natural light that makes a youthful glow</li>
    <li> This eye brightener gave me an eye infection.  Thought it was my contacts, but when I stopped wearing my contacts and make up, my eyes got better, however, I put the brightener back in my eye again (w/o contacts) and the infection came back!!! I threw it in the garbage!!!  Didn&#x27;t do much for brightening eyes anyway.</li>
    <li> This product does reduce redness in the waterline but I don&#x27;t entice that it &amp;#34;brightens&amp;#34; my eyes. It is non-irritating even in that delicate area.</li>
    <li> This eye pencil went on crumbly and messy-&lt;br /&gt;Would not order again..  It did nothing but make my eyes red</li>
    <li> Burned eyes and make them sting. Pretty color but not for sensitive eyes. My eyes are super sensitive so be carful</li>
    <li> I will purchase again and again.  Great when you&#x27;ve been up too late or tossed and turned.  Cover&#x27;s red rims and makes you look more perky!</li>
