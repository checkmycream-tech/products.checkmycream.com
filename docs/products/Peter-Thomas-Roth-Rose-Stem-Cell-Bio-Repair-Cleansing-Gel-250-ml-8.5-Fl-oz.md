    <li> I love this face wash! I have very oily skin and this product has helped to reduce my overall oily feel. A little goes A LONG way, which is great because it is not the cheapest face wash out there. Being someone who has spent years and countless dollars trying to find an everyday face wash that does not promote breakouts or excess oil production, keeps my skin clear, and smells amazing- this is my last stop!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love all of PTR products. I&#x27;m 51. I have real sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using for one year. I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser-I dilute mine a bit to make it easier to remove. Can be a bit drying</li>
    <li> This really works!  I am 68 and tried a lot of different cleaners.  This one beats them all.</li>
    <li> nice product, a nice change for me to a gel from lotions.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is perfect. It smells so fresh and clean and makes my skin so calm and redness calm down in my cheeks. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love , My totally new favorite face wash! Love Peter Thomas Roth...when can we purchase a higer glycolic acid peel??? I had a bottle of 40% GLYCOLIC ACID PEEL, just finished the bottle! A friend in the business purchased it for me, because they do not sell that strength to public, but all over AMAZON and Ebay you can purchase that strength from other Brands??</li>
    <li> I adore this cleanser.  The price here is great.  The scent is heavenly.  It does have glycolic acid in it which can be drying but is good for clearing out junk.  I consider it as an anti aging ingredient as well as an acne treatment  ingredient.  If it dries you out too much be sure you are not using hot water but just warm.  Be gentle and pat dry follow up with a moisturizer that does not have any acids in it or it will add to the dryness.  Skip a day if its to drying at first.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way have only used for a week it smells nice and makes my skin feel clean and soft .</li>
    <li> With acne but it drys your skin out. My skin is very oily and It doesn&#x27;t get dried out (I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either), but after 2days of using it my skin was dried out and peeling very badly.</li>
    <li> Very good. Love PTR products</li>
    <li> WOW do I love this face wash! It is a thick concentrated consistency (think like honey) so a little goes a long way. It has a light rose scent that I don&#x27;t find too overpowering. This stuff completely removes all of the makeup at the end of the day and since using it I notice it helps any breakouts clear up much faster than before. It also has progressively made my skin smoother. I would also say it definitely has a brightening effect, which is more temporary (an hour or two after using it) than building up over time, but I don&#x27;t really care about that anyway. I only use this at night but I have used it twice as day as well and notice either way it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything, leaving it feeling clean and fresh. I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth the price and has made me interested in the other rose stem cell PTR products.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast. product is top of the line. the fragrance is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great face wash!  No residue!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My face feels so clean when I use it.  I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to pay as much as I do when I walk into Ulta to purchase it.  It is a great product and I will continue to use it.</li>

    <li> The perfect &amp;#34;wake me up&amp;#34; type of face wash, but can be used at any time. It takes care of excess oil,  yet doesn&#x27;t strip natural moisture. I use it every morning, followed by the Rose Stem Cell Mask.</li>
    <li> So thick and creamy, a little goes a long way to cleansing one&#x27;s face.  Skin is left clean and so soft - no dryness after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> I very love this product</li>
