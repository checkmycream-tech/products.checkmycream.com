      <li>I have the most greasy and oily skin in the summer</li>
      <li>I always looked greasy, even no matter how many times I blotted my face or tried to cover it up with powder.</li>
      <li>Love this product,  </li>
      <li>For those days he&#x27;s out enjoying the sunshine, sunscreen and his &amp;#34;oily sheen&amp;#34; continue.</li>
      <li>Thanks again for a great product and thanks for the great service  from both Amazon and Seller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 plus years &amp; have not found a better product.</li>
      <li>, it didn&#x27;t make me more oily or interfere with the wear time of my makeup.</li>
      <li>I have never used a mattifier before, but I love this one.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant scent and does not feel greasy, absorbs well and fast.</li>
      <li>It is super easy to use and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>so I needed something that was very mild and would not cause a break out.</li>
      <li>If you do, you&#x27;ll notice caking that wipes off easily with a tissue.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I have to reapply, but that is fine because there is immediate coverage getting rid of the shine.</li>
      <li>and I made HUGE mistake believing them and ordered this product.</li>
      <li>I can tell a huge difference in my t-zone when I forget to apply it if I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning.</li>
      <li>I use this then use corn starch to keep my face shine free for the day.  </li>
      <li>It feels light and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores,</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>i wear make up, i try lightly applying this product to my t zone area (which is my prob area) and</li>
      <li>Works great but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
      <li>The price was fantastic and delivery expedient.</li>
      <li>I am an African-American female and I have very oily skin, however I do not suffer from acne which is a very great thing.</li>
      <li>It can go great over makeup though as long as you pat it on and not rub it on if you&#x27;re gonna wear it over your makeup to touch up.</li>
      <li>Gives the face a really nice soft finish.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t work 100% for the whole day, but it is so much better than without it.</li>
      <li>I have extremely oily skin and this product works great at stopping that.</li>
      <li>Order two though because you will use it fairly quickly</li>
      <li>it does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and use oil free (as they claim) makeup product.</li>
      <li>There was a better product available until just recently</li>
      <li>I have a *very* oily face, and most mattifiers don&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Frankly, this didn&#x27;t do anything for me in terms of oil control, though I give it one extra star because it worked nice as a primer for my make-up.</li>
      <li>so the price is worth it.  </li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>It maintains the fresh look of my make up for a mush longer period and is very easy to apply in the middle of my day.</li>
      <li>My friend first let me try hers, and I ordered it right away.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and not messy.  </li>
      <li>I brought this on a whim not really thinking I would like it, but it is one of the nicest type of makeup that I now own and will continue to keep buying.  </li>
      <li>You can even use your moisturizer first, and then put this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>keeps through hot weather and everything.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more when I run out</li>
      <li>It worked all day, and the Wedding was held on a hot day in July.</li>
      <li>The Mary Kay Mattifier works pretty well for me.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that with this product, my face lasts only 2-3 hours before becoming oily.</li>
      <li>It controls my oil pretty much all day.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for anyone who has very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I have really oily skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m male and I use this product on my shaved head which without a mattifier reflects light like a mirror.  </li>
      <li>and it does the job very well.</li>
      <li>I have really oily skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried every product, and this is the only one that really controls the shine.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin. I use a oil absorbing sheet every 2-3 hours or so. Unfortunately, this product did not work out too well for me. It may have absorbed some of the oil from my t-zone, but not enough to make a difference. I&#x27;ve yet to find a product to help stop the shine so this product may work for others. :(</li>
    <li> Works great to minimize oil. Makeup lasts longer. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used this product for years...love it!</li>
    <li> This is a means of eliminating oil for a few hours, I wouldn&#x27;t say that it provides all day oil control but it does the job of lasting at least 4 hours.</li>
    <li> My wife had me order this makeup from Amazon;because she has seen the quality and saving i have received from Amazon</li>
    <li> I have tried several products (even Vichy) for my skin. I am mixed (black and white) and have very acne prone skin. Its either too dry or too oily. This is the only product that works well for me and does not break my skin out. Pleasant scent and does not feel greasy, absorbs well and fast.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin, and the product works.  My friend first let me try hers, and I ordered it right away.  It really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product, Laura Mercier mattifier, and BECCA mattifier. I would recommend this product to those with mildly oily skin who need just a little bit of mattifier. I have very oily skin and use oil free (as they claim) makeup product. I noticed that with this product, my face lasts only 2-3 hours before becoming oily. Reapplying doesn&#x27;t make any difference at all. It also leaves with patches on the areas you apply it to so if you wanted to go out without makeup but needed the matte finish, that would not be possibly as it would look like you applied white powder to your face. It&#x27;s also a smaller size (17.7ml) compared to other mattifiers I&#x27;ve used and also cheaper too.</li>
    <li> You only need a little on the spots you shine. Dont over do it. Looks white/chalk like on skin but, dont worry once under makeup it works great. I have no shine after working in a warm studio, under bright lights, working a full 8 hour day. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult acnce, and must wear foundation to conceal my scars. Most make up (even the so-called \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; type) slowly slides off my face in an 8-hour day. By mixing a small amount of the oil mattifier with any foundation, my make up stays put and it even helps to control break-outs. I love it!</li>
    <li> It did a great job for my husband he used it for his shaved head for the shine.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and while I haven&#x27;t found a product that keeps me oil free for an entire work day, this does keep the shine away for a few hours.</li>
    <li> The perfect pore reducer. Keeps the t zone mat and not shiny.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 plus years &amp; have not found a better product.</li>
    <li> I have never used a mattifier before, but I love this one.  It is super easy to use and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Fantastic. keeps through hot weather and everything.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all, if anything it made my tzone worse. I will say I do like the size of the tube but that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;d love to return it but I cant.</li>
    <li> An A+ product!!  Love it😀</li>
    <li> Got one for my son and I who suffer from oily skin. I only reapply once in the day. Its very light and blends in well with makeup or by itself.</li>
    <li> I love this mattifier because it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores and it does mattify.  I can tell a huge difference in my t-zone when I forget to apply it if I&#x27;m in a hurry in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I think it works great. I use this then use corn starch to keep my face shine free for the day.  I love this stuff and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> It works keeping me matte, not for as long as I would like, but it works.</li>
    <li> No difference at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it is supposed to--even in the heat and humidity of KY. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well. No breakouts. Sometimes I have to reapply, but that is fine because there is immediate coverage getting rid of the shine.</li>
    <li> It was old and broke my face out.</li>
    <li> If you ever wondered how to get rid of that oily sheen that comes with oily skin - this is it! It&#x27;s a great product!  You can even use your moisturizer first, and then put this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - if you need to use sunscreen too - then you are wasting your time putting this product on first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son developed acne when using the Mattifier AND sunscreen, so he only uses the Mattifer when he meets important clients.  For those days he&#x27;s out enjoying the sunshine, sunscreen and his &amp;#34;oily sheen&amp;#34; continue. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I cannot go with out it thise protect control my oil T-zone exellent protect i advaice pepole who have oily area to use it</li>
    <li> Best product available.  Does exactly what it says it will do.  Long lasting and can be used alone or under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every imaginable thing for controlling the oil slick in my T-zone.  This doesn&#x27;t make things worse, it feels nice on (i.e. not greasy), but does not provide a noticeable difference in controlling oil.  I find that for me OC 8 works better.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all.... unfortunately... will keep looking</li>
    <li> I was really shocked how well this stuff works. I hated looking at pictures of myself bc my face shines so badly with all the oil. I always looked greasy, even no matter how many times I blotted my face or tried to cover it up with powder. I will definitely buy more when I run out</li>
    <li> I can instantly see as soon as I put this on that it&#x27;s working. My skin looks matte and not shiny. Seems to work for quite a while too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for but have yet to find a mattifier that does.</li>
    <li> I guess i must produce more oil than the average person.  I have used this with make up, and without and it does nothing for me.  I have tried every product, this one by far the least expensive and none have worked for me.  i wear make up, i try lightly applying this product to my t zone area (which is my prob area) and within an hour, i am oily again...even on the weekend, while wearing no make up, i&#x27;ve tried this to no avail.  It seems to work for some, but if you produce a lot of oil, and wear make up, don&#x27;t bother with this stuff...</li>
    <li> I have very oily face and my make up doesn&#x27;t stay fresh for long time, my forehead is getting shiny very fast so I wanted to get some gel/liquid or anything which i can put under my make or put use everyday and my face will stay non-oily-shiny  longer then 1-2 hours. I was going to order some other anti-shine gel on amazon but i saw one person&#x27;s review recommending this product and I made HUGE mistake believing them and ordered this product. it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I am super disappointed and upset :( i really need something  making my skin look less oily and/or anti shine.&lt;br /&gt;I keep searching for some miracle product. If anyone recommend me any oily skin product please.</li>
    <li> Good at its job. I have a *very* oily face, and most mattifiers don&#x27;t really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little tube works wonders-- I do still blot my face with a tissue for excess oil 1-2 times a day when wearing it, but if I DON&#x27;T use it, I blot 3-4 times and my makeup looks terrible by the end of the day.. The Mary Kay is a good primer and is great at preserving the integrity of my makeup, so after blotting it looks like I just put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it still works very well, and best of all you don&#x27;t need to use very much for good results. My tube has lasted me for 6+ months. I&#x27;ve definitely gotten my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> It really helps reduce the shine that accumulates on my face as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> My Daughter&#x27;s Wedding was approaching, so I tried a few products in an effort to enhance my apearance for the big day. As a woman who has oily skin accompanied with frequent &amp;#34;private Summers&amp;#34; aka &amp;#34;hot flashes&amp;#34;, I found this product extremely helpful in keeping my makeup in place. It worked all day, and the Wedding was held on a hot day in July. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product either. If you do, you&#x27;ll notice caking that wipes off easily with a tissue. So glad that I purchased two tubes. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this item!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay oil mattifier works great and in Florida we can use a lot of help with the shine.</li>
    <li> Meh. I&#x27;ve tried lots of oil control products, because my skin is like a geyser and my pores are the size of craters. Frankly, this didn&#x27;t do anything for me in terms of oil control, though I give it one extra star because it worked nice as a primer for my make-up.</li>
    <li> this product really helps keep the oiliness at bay. it doesn&#x27;t work 100% for the whole day, but it is so much better than without it. i usually just put it on in the morning, then use a little blotting paper in the afternoon when i start to get a little shiny again. i&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and only just reordered another one. you really only need a very small amount o the bad area(s).</li>
    <li> The Mary Kay Mattifier works pretty well for me.  There was a better product available until just recently but it was about ten times more expensive: Black Opal Invisible Oil Blocking Mattifier.  I say &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; only because of the feel on my head.  Mary Kay&#x27;s mattifier leaves a dry finish that I am aware of although it&#x27;s not a problem ( you cannot see it) and I forget about it once I&#x27;m on my way out the door. Mary Kay is affordable.  I&#x27;m male and I use this product on my shaved head which without a mattifier reflects light like a mirror.  My friends used to have to squint to look at me in direct sunlight.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil mattifier because I was tired of my shiny skin. I am an African-American female and I have very oily skin, however I do not suffer from acne which is a very great thing. I have sensitive skin so I needed something that was very mild and would not cause a break out. So far I use the mattifier about twice a day and it does the job very well. I usually only have to reapply a small amount by the end of my work day. After about two months of using this product I do not have any breakouts &amp; my T-Zone appears to be in Control. I do recommend this product to other women that share the same issue.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;works great :) would recommend it to anyone with an oily face, they will love it.</li>
    <li> I have used so many products and this is clearly the best.  Order two though because you will use it fairly quickly</li>
    <li> Does the job but stays mattee for a few hours but u can always reapply ...love it</li>
    <li> Finally something that works for me. It removes the shine from my T areas for several hours without messy up my make-up.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and this product works great at stopping that. I still have to use oil absorbing sheets but not nearly as much as I had to before.</li>
    <li> I am extremely oily and was looking for a mattifying product that would help extend that &amp;#34;just applied&amp;#34; makeup look. I wanted to try MAC&#x27;s mattifier but couldn&#x27;t justify the price, which led me to this product. I use this under my regular primer (I&#x27;m using Tarte&#x27;s BB primer at the moment), and I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference when I use it. It certainly helps the oil production a bit, but not as much as I had hoped, and certainly not enough to make it worth buying again. I did not buy this expecting a miracle as some do when buying mattifying products, but the fact is that I need touch ups just as frequently with this product as I do without it. I give this product three stars because although it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to, it didn&#x27;t make me more oily or interfere with the wear time of my makeup. I ultimately don&#x27;t recommend it for super oily people out there, though. I think Milk of Magnesia is more effective and far less expensive than this.</li>
    <li> takes away the shininess after moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My skin has gone through some weird changes in the last couple of years, one being excessive oil, which I had never experienced. I decided to try MK&#x27;s oil mattifier since I use their foundation and I am highly impressed. It controls my oil pretty much all day. At the end of the day I have some shine in my T-zone area, that&#x27;s to be expected, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it was before when I would look like I stuck my head in a bucket of fried chicken.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  it does exactly what it says it will do!😊</li>
    <li> I have a very oily t-zone and now that we live in Texas, I have been suffering from the humidity.  My skin looked super shiny instantly after I applied makeup.  It was a never-ending cycle of wash my face, put on make up, blot my face throughout the day, remove my makeup, wash my face.  It was annoying.  I tried this product and I haven&#x27;t had to blot my face at all during the day.  It is so nice to still have my makeup on at the end of the day instead of on blotting sheets.  I hate the feeling of my face melting off before the day is done.  I recommend this product for anyone who has very oily skin.  A little goes a long way so the price is worth it.  I put one dot on each cheek, one dot on my nose, one on my chin, and one on my forehead.  It rubs in very easily.</li>
    <li> I used this before, but my Mary Kay Rep stopped selling it. I was so so Happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just love this mattifier. it never disappoints.</li>
    <li> I totally have noticed a difference in the oil on my face when I use this product.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
    <li> I never ever ever thought my oily face could look normal. I was wrong. Mk oil mat has changed my self esteem. I always felt like hiding my face but I could not because it was oily beyond control. Nothing gad worked for me that was why i was skeptical about any other products that promise that. I tried Mk&#x27; anyway. That was a choice i will never regret and I am stuck for life.</li>
    <li> I put this on before getting oily to prevent getting oily but I didnt know I was supposed to put it in when I am already greasy, dont like that I have to go into the restroom in the middle of the day and apply it. Does dry quickly tho and does mattify your face.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every product on the market for oily skin.  All the cleansers and moisturizers and foundations that are supposed to control oil.  Some of them work better than others.  But no product has ever come close to this stuff.  It actually does what it says it will do, and then some!  I hope they never stop making it, because I don&#x27;t know what I will do without it.  I wear it every single day.  The bottle says you only need a tiny bit, and they are right.  This one tiny tube lasted me over six months!  Don&#x27;t talk yourself out of it because of the price (which isn&#x27;t really unreasonable anyway).  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Amazing. The only thing I have a problem with is it&#x27;s not enough! Buying another now. I have really oily skin. I wash my face around 6:30 am and buy 10 I am a grease ball. It&#x27;s horrible. This really controls it. I use this with or without make up. Also I use mac products which seems to illuminate my oil even more but this gives it such a long lasting Matt finish. A plus all the way.</li>
    <li> I have oily face and used it twice but still have oily face. Maybe with time it will get better.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  It can appear chalky on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really oily skin - this keeps it looking matte for about 4 to 5 hours and then I need to use an oil blotter, after which I am good for the rest of the afternoon.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve come to finding.  If you use it with MK formula 3 oil control lotion, it provides even more coverage.</li>
    <li> With my tendency for T-zone oiliness, this is one of my &#x27;never without, must have&#x27;&#x27; bauty items.  The price was fantastic and delivery expedient. A wonderful combination!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found they keeps my face from looking like it is soaking wet. It really does work (for me). The small size had me hesitant about buying it but it lasts a long time. By &#x27;long time&#x27; I guess I mean both that it keeps my face dry all day and since you only need to use a small amount the tube will last a long time. I will continue buying this one.</li>
    <li> it conceals the oil for almost all of the day and gives you a matte finish wen u apply it. It was a good purchase. I would recoomend to buyers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  Thick going on and was Shiney again within minutes.  Went to Mac and bought some compact finishing powder and it works awesome.</li>
    <li> this works amazing for super oily skin, and it helps my makeup stay on all day! I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I got this to help with my shine and oil throughout the day. I put on a small amount under my foundation or powder in the morning and I have no shine all day. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and this controls the shine for about 8 hours. I put it on after i cleanse and moisturize.</li>
    <li> Oil be gone! If you put this oil mattifier on after your moisturizer you won&#x27;t feel or see an oil shine on your face all day. It feels light and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores,</li>
    <li> It works and works well. It maintains the fresh look of my make up for a mush longer period and is very easy to apply in the middle of my day. For someone with oily skin, this is a blessing.</li>
    <li> I am the QUEEN of oily skin! I&#x27;ve tried so many things and I&#x27;ve everything I&#x27;ve tried thus far, this is outstanding! The only reason why I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars is because while is keeps my face shine-free longer than everything else I&#x27;ve tried, I still need a touch up at like 3pm. I&#x27;ve only tried it during working hours, I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll hold up after a night of dancing ... but we&#x27;ll see! It&#x27;s definitely a good buy if you suffer from ridiculously oily skin.</li>
    <li> I usually put this on first thing in the morning to take care of those shiny areas but you do need to use an oil blotting tissue for later in the day.</li>
    <li> I brought this on a whim not really thinking I would like it, but it is one of the nicest type of makeup that I now own and will continue to keep buying.  Goes on smooth and not messy.  Gives the face a really nice soft finish.  Covers up any imperfections too.  Thanks again for a great product and thanks for the great service  from both Amazon and Seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly God sent! I have the most greasy and oily skin in the summer and I hate it. Every picture of me looks like I have a shiny forehead. This product truly works in keeping the oil at bay for a few hours. If your planning and long night out put it in your purse because It does wear off after about 4 hours or so. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this oil mattifier!</li>
    <li> Works on even the hottest days in the summer! Throw it in your purse and re-apply when necessary and you won&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even an oily skin person and yet my face stays oily looking while using this.  Does nothing for my Tzone.</li>
    <li> This product is great for those with oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face or take away all your oil, but it does lessen the amount of times you&#x27;ll have to dab your face with an oil sheet.</li>
    <li> Works great but doesn&#x27;t last all day. It can go great over makeup though as long as you pat it on and not rub it on if you&#x27;re gonna wear it over your makeup to touch up. It&#x27;s very light weight and little goes a long way. You do not have to slather your face with this. I will purchasing more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years and haven&#x27;t found anything that works better! Soaks up all the oil on my face immediately and keeps my face matte pretty much all day long. Super light and fresh on my face, and a little goes a long way so it lasts forever. Adore it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. It&#x27;s great alone or under makeup to keep oily skin in check.</li>
