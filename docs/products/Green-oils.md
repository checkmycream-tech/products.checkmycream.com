<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you are new to essential oils Frankincense is grounding oil. It smells woodsy and warm.  It is one of the oldest known oils and has been used for thousands of years and was even presented to Jesus at his birth by the wise men.  It can be diffused or inhaled to induce calm, mental peace, relaxation, and satisfaction, and helps relieve anxiety, anger, and stress.  It also has a multitude of other uses including everything from cleaning to colds and flu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says this is 100% pure therapeutic grade Botswellia serrata essential oil. It also warns not to take it internally.  It is very strong smelling and not weak like some of the cheaper oils you can find elsewhere. It comes in a glass bottle with a dropper cap. I have it in the diffuser now and it is giving the whole house a clam vibe.  I have also read that pets (dogs &amp; cats) enjoy and can benefit from smelling the frankincense oil (make sure you do your research before ever using essential oil around pets).  I received this oil in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Smelling this brought back immediate memories of Christmas. My father ordered frankincense and myrrh that came in a cedar box from Jerusalem, and we would let a tiny piece of each smoulder in a holder next the Nativity on Christmas Eve and Christmas. Spicy, earthy, and the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER: I received this free product to perform product testing with the intent of providing an honest and educated review. I received no other compensation, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I recieved a bottle free for my review. I love  scent. I am new to essential oils and looked up many uses. It was great on some mosquito bites I had. Took the itch away.</li>
    <li> I want sure what to think of frankincense oil before I received it but I&#x27;m very impressed with how calming it is, even by simply opening the bottle and taking a sniff. It really helps when I wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. I like to put a few drops in my candle warmer before bedtime to help me relax.</li>
    <li> Received this product for free. Works great. Love the smell. Very nice essential oil!</li>
    <li> Great versatile oil!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion to test and review. The opinions stated in my review are 100% my own and are not in any way influenced. I have been using this Frankincense for about 3 weeks, even though a small bottle it sure does go along way. I have been using this in a diffuser and it helps eliminate odors and pollution from the room. As of right now, I have it diffusing in the kitchen and bathroom.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer I got this free to try and leave my honest opinion-- I put some drops in my candle that I am making to try more options and it smells wonderful I highly recommend trying these oils for yourself</li>
    <li> This is an amazing essential oil. I love the smell. It is very aromatic it&#x27;s got a  woody, earthy, kind of spicy scent that has a slight fruit smell added in. I personally love to use this oil in a diffuser. It&#x27;s a great essential oil to diffuser when you want to meditate and relax. There is just something about it that cleanses your soul and makes you feel at peace. But Frankincense also has other uses. You can mix it with a carrier oil like coconut oil and apply it to cuts, burns, scratches, and minor skin irritations  to help in the healing process. If you want to your shampoo and conditioner to help repair damage to your hair and scalp. This oil is really amazing and multi functional. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. Regardless all options are 100% my own based on experiences with said product</li>
    <li> An absolutely unique scent.

    <li> Frankincense oil has a woody, earthy, spicy, and slightly fruity aroma, which is calming and relaxing. This Frankincense by Natural Alternatives is a very high quality essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense oil is one of the top essential oils you can use for your health. It&#x27;s has very comforting properties, and is useful for visualizing, improving spiritual connection, and helping overcome stress and anxiety and depressed feelings.&lt;br /&gt;I love using this essetial oil for aromatherapy, i diffuse it.  Its calming. It works effectively as a  sedative that induces a feeling of mental peace, relaxation, and satisfaction, and helps relieve anxiety, anger, and stress. Definitely something we could all use! This oil is very strongly scented. It&#x27;s amazing and a must have for me! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> I like essential oils and I am always looking for  some ways to use them in my daily life.&lt;br /&gt;I used  frankincense oil in my diffuser and I really like how my room smelled.&lt;br /&gt;It was very soothing , and it calmed me as well.&lt;br /&gt;I put  some on my hands and oh my, the feeling was so great. It has that woody fragrance that lifts your mood and calm my nerves.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle carries 100 ml of pure essential oil, it is of  therapeutic grade.&lt;br /&gt;I like the the dropper as it makes pouring easy.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this great aromatic oil by Natural Alternatives at a discounted price in return for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this great oil and It will be wonderful for everyone who has a hectic life and wishes to calm themselves.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now and I have to say it has been working amazing. I diffuse it almost every night with lavender to help me off to sleep. My husband who doesn&#x27;t really believe in all of the essential oil works, was off to sleep within 15 minutes of breathing in the blend the other night. Frankincense can be a little overwhelming so you do have to be careful just how many drops you put in the diffuser, but once you have the right combination for yourself , it works like a charm. Totally relaxing.  Will definitely be ordering more once I am out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*disclaimer:received item to try for free*</li>
    <li> Love, love, love frankincense.Great product.</li>
    <li> Ah, Frankincense.  This is an oil that can do so many wonderful things.  The smell and strength of this oil is perfect.  I love its easy, earthy smell.  Just inhaling it is a wonderful experience.  This is an oil that should be in any oil lovers collection.  I love how it absorbed so quickly into my skin.  That means it is good quality.  This is an oil you should never be without.  This also smells great in a diffuser!!  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.  *DISCLAIMER: I received this free product to perform product testing with the intent of providing an honest and educated review. I received no other compensation, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle of Essential Oil for free in order to give a review.  The review is unbiased and completely my own words!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense is something I have heard of but hadn&#x27;t really dabbled in it.  However when I got this oil to try, I put it in my diffuser right away.  The smell took me back to high Holy days in church, but it kept my spirits uplifted.  I find it to be a very earthy scent.  The quality seems to be very good, but I am no chemist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to always mix with a carrier oil when you want to use an essential oil on your skin!  I like to use a drop or two of this with some sweet almond oil as a remedy for nerves.  Nervous breakdowns are never good, and this oil really does seem to help calm your nervous energy.  Rub some on the bottom of your feet (with carrier oil!) and you might find yourself a little calmer.</li>
    <li> I received a discount for this product in exchange for my honest review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a little bottle of frankincense and almost ran out.&lt;br /&gt;Is this a coincidence?&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I&#x27;ve researched many ways to use frankincense oil and these are a few ways that I use my frankincense oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- in laundry which makes your clothes smell really good&lt;br /&gt;- Surprisingly a lot of people may not know this one; use for hair. After I finish washing my hair I would use a little bucket and fill it with 4 cups of warm water and add 2-3 drops of frankincense. Then I rinsed my hair in it for about 3 minutes. It leaves my hair smelling like frankincense! (you can do this with many oil)&lt;br /&gt;- Another great use for frankincense is as a bug repellent! Summer is coming and I dread what it brings. Mosquitoes, yup. Fricking blood suckers.&lt;br /&gt;What I would do is mix a few drop of the oil in carrier oil to dilute it OR you can just put 1 drop or 2 in the palms of your hands and rub all over your legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just a few of great uses I have for frankincense. 10ml is little but it does last quite a long time!</li>
    <li> Frankincense is such a precious and useful oil! This one smelled very similar to my expensive oils. I find the oil smells woody, earthy and spicy. This age old oil smell is very unique and uplifting. I have used the oil to aid in fading scars and stretch marks. It is also an oil I use to prevent acne scars. You can diffuse the oil as well and it&#x27;s suppose to be good for depression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this oil free to facilitate my review, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have a tiny bottle of this I got from a friend who sells one of the brands that you sell to your friends... I don&#x27;t know why this is such an expensive oil from them but this brand and bottle smell closest to that oil as I have found.  I have been using that tiny bottle that my friend gave me on a mole looking patch and it is clearing it up.. I don&#x27;t know why or how but since I am almost out of it I decided that when I was lucky to have won these in part of giveaway and wanted to leave my review based on my own opinions, to jump on it to use it to continue what the other was doing.  I did a smell comparison and they smell very much the same.. Great oil much better price...</li>
    <li> This oil is the Boswellia serrata kind of frankincense. I love the calming woodsy aroma of frankincense oil. When comparing this oil to others this oil smells identical to other brands that i have on hand. Frankincense oil is great to put in the diffuser when i am feeling stressed or anxious. I also had a few drops to my home made face scrub and moisturizer. While i&#x27;m not a chemist i believe this oil is high quality and i would recommend it and order it again when needed. I received this oil for review purposes all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
