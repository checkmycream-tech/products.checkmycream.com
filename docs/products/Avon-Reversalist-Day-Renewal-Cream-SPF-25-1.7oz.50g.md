      <li>The SPF 25 is quite right for me.</li>
      <li>I like that the Anew Reversalist Day Renewal Cream has the SPF protection and still feels light on my skin, but I would not recommend it for your main anti-aging product.</li>

      <li>I use this mostly in the winter when my skin looks terribly dry but after using my face looks and feels better, younger and is so soft.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I only use occasionally so I can&#x27;t say if it actually helps my skin or not. I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s also fragrance-free and important to anyone with allergies.  It&#x27;s got a high SPF and anti-aging properties all in one jar.  This is hard to find.  It&#x27;s very light and makes my skin feel so soft.  My skin has improved in only 2 weeks time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it as a moisturizer in the morning before I apply make up.  It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy, it goes on smoothly, and moisturizes nicely.  I think Anew is usually used as an anti-wrinkle cream.  I can&#x27;t say I look younger or that any fine lines have disappeared because I haven&#x27;t noticed those changes, but I can say that my acne has improved since I started using it.  I definitely recommend Anew.</li>
    <li> Product was received in a timely manner and was as described. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer with SPF 25 protection and it&#x27;s not too greasy like many face creams that have sunblock.  As far as its anti-aging benefits, I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results.  I prefer Avon Anew Clinical Advanced Wrinkle Corrector as it made a noticeable difference to my skin.  I like that the Anew Reversalist Day Renewal Cream has the SPF protection and still feels light on my skin, but I would not recommend it for your main anti-aging product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Avon again after several years  that did not work out well this cream had a odor   That was not pleasing when applied to the face.  and the odor did not dissipate I returned this   product and will not buy Avon again .  Thank you               Ellen Tompkins</li>
    <li> Been using it since last summer and I absolutely love it! There&#x27;s a reason it has great reviews everywhere you look! Try it!!</li>
    <li> had a little problem with the delivery but the seller was more than willing to correct the problem with a complete refund and free order.Will definitely do business in the future.</li>
    <li> Avon is great. I love this lotion. My issue is with the fact that I was sent an opened product sold by #1 Beauty Care. GROSS! It annoys me when people write reviews that are meant for sellers, but I do so because nobody ever looks at seller&#x27;s ratings.</li>
    <li> Creamy and not greasy, Anew feels great and keeps wrinkles away. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using Avon Anew Reversalist Day Cream SPF 25 for several years now. It is non-greasy, goes on great underneath makeup, and makes your skin so soft. Also, it really helped to even out my skin tone, and has helped prevent additional forehead wrinkles. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love the ANEW night creams, but all the day creams I tried were disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all hydrated well, that was not a problem. None of them caused acne, that&#x27;s great. They all have nice SPF in them. But, without exception, every Anew day cream I tried sat on my face and seemed to build up and feel greasy over the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I like my day cream to sink in and not be a problem throughout the day; I don&#x27;t want to look like I bobbed for apples in a vat of Crisco by noon.  Without exception I had problems with shine and oiliness to my face, with the Anew day creams. All of them, every age range. Yes, I tried them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the night cream products, but it&#x27;s hard to beat the Olay Pro-X day cream for overall performance. I&#x27;m currently using up a sample of Estee Lauder day cream, and it acts just like the Anew day cream products. I like something to be unobtrusive under my primer and makeup, and so far only the Olay Pro-X day cream has lasted through the day without causing greasiness. The next best thing would be any of the Avon Anew serums, but the serum does not have SPF and that can be important for some folks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that works outside most of the time. I gave this a try for the sun block and to help protect my face, neck, ears, etc. Any man  that has to be outside alot should try this for protection of the skin. Really great protect. I have been using this for one year now and I think it is a must have for men.</li>
    <li> As an Avon sales rep this product is a big seller for me! The results are amazing with my customers and whenever possible I have at least a once a month host party for Anew customers! The good thing about the Anew Regimen line is that it falls in 4 groups, this one falling in the &#x27;Reversalist\\&quot; category. I also help my customers choose the right regimen, so they&#x27;ll have the complete line to cleanse, moisturize and treat. I use all four products on this line: Anew Cleanser, Anew Day Cream w/SPF Sunscreen, the Night Cream, and finally the Anew Eye Treatment. Trust me when I say using all four will totally complete your routine to a younger-looking skin!</li>
    <li> I would rate this product as just okay...I put it one everyday, regardless if I was going to be out of the house or not. It did feel great going on, made my skin feel soft but I have to say that was about it. I did not notice any improvement overall in the look or feel of my skin. It did make a great moisturizer under makeup but for the same effect, I could have bought a much cheaper cream honestly. I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Product in box is good! Grate for face !&lt;br /&gt;Smells good! Happy I got it super fast !&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for lady&#x27;s !</li>
    <li> I love this seller, product is great price, arrives on time, and the cream makes my face stay young looking! It is my favorite of Avon face creams.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the light fragrance, and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> My facial skin has never looked better. I use both the day and night cream on my face, neck and shoulders. Those little swollen oil glands that I have are not as noticeable. The lines on my neck and chest have faded a bit. No miracle here but a great improvement.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I&#x27;m always a bit apprehensive about claims a lot of companies make about their moisturizers, but I saw the difference from day one!  I have really oily skin, large pores, and sometimes my facial skin feels bumpy. These products, I ordered the whole line, has worked perfectly!  My skin feels smoother, softer, and he lines and slight discoloration I was beginning to get under my eyes.. I can barely see them!</li>
    <li> Love this day cream.  I have been using it for about a year.  Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough good things about this product.  I wear it EVERYDAY with or without make up.  My skin feels quenched and moisturized without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving the feel of this but not sure it has made me look like even a 40 something.</li>
    <li> Great item as describe</li>
    <li> I love having an Avon day cream with SPF.  It&#x27;s the perfect day cream for when I need to spend a lot of time outdoors.  Unlike sunscreen this does not clog pores and works great as all the Avon products have for me.  I love it and would buy it again for summer.  My absolute favorite AVON product of course it their clinical line.</li>
    <li> The box was not sealed in plastic which is the way Avon protects their products these days.  So, I&#x27;m thinking it was either an older inventory or someone removed the plastic and this was resold.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast service and love the Anew brand.  Thanks for giving me this opportunity to try it.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and in original packaging. Love the feeling of it on my skin and it has 25 SPF; tingles a bit when first put on. . Great for every day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily.  I Love that it has SPF in it so I don&#x27;t have to take that extra step each day with my skin care.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from a local Avon representative. I used it and fell in love with it. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use allot of products that are on e market. It doesn&#x27;t matter if ey are low in price or expensive. This cream is light weight. Not heavy like allot of moisturizers out there. I had no break outs and the cream is not greasy at all. If you have acne prone sensitive skin this is the product for you. I also use the night cream that is paired with this. It also works great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Very little fragrance, super thick and creamy and it makes my skin look fabulous immediately.  I use this mostly in the winter when my skin looks terribly dry but after using my face looks and feels better, younger and is so soft.  This is my second jar of this and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice, light day cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I took the Avon quiz to decide what might be best for my skin issues and this came up.  I probably would have chosen it over another Avon product I was using on my face even if the quiz didn&#x27;t point to it because it smells so much better.  Seems to be working and my face feels and looks smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used anew since its launch over 20 years ago.  I just graduated to the Reversalist for additional moisture and it is just the amount I need for my 50+ year old skin.  I love the entire line of Anew.  Its such a great product and value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now. I&#x27;ve never broke out from it and no irritation either. I like it that the SPF is 25; great for summertime. It&#x27;s a great product and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure what to rate it, as this is the most bizarre lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. A few moments after I put it on, my entire face begun to tingle. I tried wiping it off... But it, instead, exfoliated my skin&#x27;s top layer. I was really confused... But my face ended up very soft afterwards. Not sure what exactly happened, but I&#x27;m almost afraid to use it again.</li>
    <li> This Avon moisturizer for day and the Avon Anew for night has changed my skin!  Saw it recommended in an article in Redbook or something.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been breaking out for most of my life until I started using these creams.  Anti aging and somehow I have the clearest skin of my life.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Have not used long enough to tell a difference.  Also was shipped in a timely fashion and was as described.</li>
    <li> I really like the anew line and feel it works. this product budget friendly. It doesn&#x27;t go on very heavy</li>
    <li> Everything was fine except product expired 6 months ago.</li>
    <li> I usually have very dry and flaky skin in the winter but this year I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I am using this everyday and it really works to keep my skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this day cream is probably the spf. I have found that it really does help when it comes to prevention of damage from uv radiation. Other than that I&#x27;m not crazy about the somewhat chalky feel which is reminiscent of many regular sunscreen lotions. The protection is for me the strongest point about this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad they finally made this cream with an SPF of 25.  Product received shortly after ordering.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using for years.</li>
    <li> Love the Renewal line....works great on my face</li>
    <li> I had not found a skin system that did what it promised until Avon Anew. I am not a make up fan and not a regular Avon shopper. I will be very dissappointed if Avon goes away like perdicted. This is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I used the Reversalist line for several good years and enjoyed the results it wrought on my complexion. The sunblock works well and the fragrance is light enuough to not interfere with your personal fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is a fantasic product.  I love Avon and this really works great on my skin.  I&#x27;m 47 with medium complexion, combination skin.</li>
    <li> Love it and the nighttime cream also.  In the NE we get very cold weather and very hot weather and this solves the problem with dry, flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried many day creams that not only are they costly, but they are too thick to apply and have fragrance that I do not like for a face cream. The SPF 25 is quite right for me.</li>
    <li> this product was purchased from an individual on amazon site .product feels nice . it has smell &amp; i am allergic to perfumes . i could not use it . i wish product discription would have revealed that , before i purchased . most of the companies selling this type of product , make it a special point to reveal smell . for me it was waste of money .</li>
    <li> Perfect under day foundation ,whatever the choice.Always looks very natural, not clogged pours or that caked look. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is great for age 40 + skin and does great with my combination skin type! I give it 2 thumbs up!</li>
