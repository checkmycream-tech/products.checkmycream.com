<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would not buy again . It takes forever to heat up.</li>
    <li> The concept of this little gadget is great. After reading all the amazing reviews, I had to have it. But then I tried it and it was meh. Didn&#x27;t do much for my fine, frizzy, curly, hair.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> does not grab hair at all.  unless you have short hair.</li>
    <li> Heats in about 30 seconds; has multiple heat settings, and large barrel. Just what I was looking for. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This works great on shoulder length hair. I wish it came with better instructions on how to decide what temperature setting I should choose.  Right now I am using it at the middle number.  It heats up so quickly.  It can get very hot in less that three minutes.  I have to be careful of my fingers and ears.  I keep it in a a quilted oven glove when off and not in use I have hung the glove from a hook near my mirror.  It smooths my wavy hair and curls it easily.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST for curling curly or permed hair.  It&#x27;s so easy and quick and the curls last 2 days.  I bought an extra one for fear that I would not find it again if mine ever wears out.  It warms up quickly and the cord never tangles.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 10 year old who is obsessed with her hair,  Heats up quick cool to the touch (unless you reach in between the combs)  Great price</li>
    <li> Never tried a curling iron with the brush for curling hair. I love another choice. This iron curls hair without having to clip it to hold it in place. Because of that feature, this iron is quick and easy, without a chance to burn your fingers! Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it!!  I used to buy these in early 2000&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m guessing Conair stopped selling them in major stores. Thanks to Amazon I was able to find this product again and ordered one. It&#x27;s a great curling brush for long hair and thick hair. This product is best bought in 2&#x27;s or more depending the number of females in the home who will be using this. I will buy another as a backup very soon.</li>
    <li> works good but hair does get a little tangled in it</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. It gives me just the right amount of curl. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that something is wrong with the switch. I have to press the switch several times to get it to turn on. I&#x27;ve had it about a year and don&#x27;t know how much longer it will last. When it goes, though, I will get another one just like it!</li>
    <li> Gets hot quickly and if you forget it on, it has an automatic shut off.  Very pleased with the product and plan to order another one very soon so I have a spare.</li>
    <li> Buy this brush and you will not be disappointed. Trust me. I have tried 7 different brands and this is the one. It&#x27;s hot and it holds your hair. I have fine curly hair, but a lot of it. After I blow out my hair I curl it with this brush and the curl stays even in Virginia humidity. Actually, I tie my hair up at night in a loose band and in the morning the curls fall exactily how they were the day before. It&#x27;s magic. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
    <li> I was watching a TV shopping channel and a very expensive curling brush was being featured. They were able to tame the model&#x27;s hair in no time at all and I had to have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do some research online and came to Amazon to read reviews of that curling brush as well as others. I read all of the positive reviews on this one and the price was way better that the $100 one I saw on TV so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a curling brush before so it took a few days of practice before I really got the hang of it. I have very curly hair and I do like to wear it smooth sometimes but I don&#x27;t like to use a straightener. My hair is too thin to use a straightener so this is a good way to smoothe out my hair without it looking wispy and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling brush lets me have the look of having used hot rollers without investing as much time as rollers require.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It makes my hair really soft and seems to make it go flat</li>
    <li> I had the smaller version first, which prompted my purchasing this larger one, because it made my hair look incredible. This larger one is really good, with one slight difference. There is a slight gap between the handle and the shaft that allows a couple of hairs to get trapped and in turn pulled out of your head.I have very thin, fine hair that is very hard to keep wrapped around these type of hot curling brushes, but I&#x27;ve not had this trouble with this particular model. I&#x27;m much more careful with this one to keep my hair away from the handle end. It didn&#x27;t seem to happen with the smaller one, but you can actually see that gap in either. Still, very good.</li>
    <li> rolling each portion of hair was a time sucker!!  This enables me to curl the ends and lift at the roots and I&amp;#34;M DONE!!&lt;br /&gt;I love how it saves me so much time...&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fast and curls great.. I love this iron!!</li>
    <li> I used to have naturally currly hair...with menopause, it became naturally frizzy hair. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found to reduce the frizz without damazing my hair.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast, grabs the hair piece and leaves a nice curl. Easy to handle and cord doesn&#x27;t get all twisted with the swirling end.</li>
    <li> Great hair tool, does a good job.  Heats quickly and the heat settings are adjustable.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have two others and use one to travel with and one for daily use. The newest one is a spare.  They do wear out, but I&#x27;ve had the first two for three plus years.  The one for daily use is showing some wear but still works great.  Heats up quickly and makes styling my curly hair easy and quick.  The diameter brush gives a smooth look with volume.  I will probably keep buying them until they are not made anymore. :)</li>
    <li> I did not find this to be an effective product. It did not hold my hair well, nor did it create a firm curl. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Well I do like this product for my long hair but it only worked for two weeks then it quick</li>
    <li> Hot Brush works great.  I still wish it was a little bigger, I think maybe 2\\&quot; would be good.</li>
    <li> This Hot Brush helps to provide volume and height.  So far the product has worked as I thought it should.</li>
    <li> I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.    i have been a professional stylists for many, many years.  \\&quot;time is money\\&quot; and i dont want to spend my time nor my money on a product that is less than adequit for the job.  this iron was NOT hot enough to do the job...fine hair, course hair, it didnt matter. i have a great curling brush that is perfect for the job, however, the bristles have \\&quot;cooked\\&quot; over the years and i havent been able to find the same product again. just going to have to keep looking but i can assure you that i wont order from the west coast again.  it cost me $9.70 to return it and the iron was only $22.57.</li>
    <li> I assume the wife purchased this for her hair. I like to use it to chase the cats. They hate this thing for some reason. So I chase them with it all the time.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! I just wish it had a drier incorporated, but for the price it works awesome!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. Cheaply made. My hair got tangled in it easily. I bought it and it arrived three days later. I used it once, didn&#x27;t work. I put in under my bathroom sink, and never took it out again. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Good price, works well.  I have only used this for about a month, but it does the job.  Going to take this on vacation with me - works better than hot rollers when traveling.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I hoped.</li>
    <li> works great for my short curly hair,almost instant,very hot heat,large barrel diameter softens curl/straightens as well as a blowout.Dual voltage,worked great in Europe with no reduction in heat output. Appears sturdy/well made. However,was not useful for my mother&#x27;s straight thick hair,she needs bristles on an iron to grab onto/hold her hair and this iron just has rows of teeth.</li>
    <li> Not really what I wanted, makes my hair too soft and flyaway.</li>
    <li> This is not a hot air brush, like I thought it was. It&#x27;s a curling iron with plastic bristles. It&#x27;s a nice, bristly curling iron, but I deducted a star for this showing up in a search for &amp;#34;hot air brush.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as a Christmas present, because her old one was probably 13 years old, and was gross and was missing some of the teeth, and had burnt hair wrapped all around it. I bought this because she NEEDED it, and she LOVES it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, not to small. Love it</li>
    <li> My hand got burn very easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for only two weeks and it&#x27;s already broken. I thought it would break after six months- not two weeks!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of hot brush for at least 20yrs, maybe longer and I always come back to this particular brush. It is the best size for my longer, layered hair. It gives direction while smoothing and I never, ever get any split ends! My one and only complaint is that the cord is too light weight. I would like a more professional weight cord.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have had one of these last for appx 4 yrs with daily use. How many appliances can do that? I have gone to the conair website and purchased 3-4 at a time to keep in the closet.&lt;br /&gt;It is very hot, very fast, doesnt tangle, and doesnt burn my fingers. I have tried too many to even count and this is the best!</li>
    <li> Works well, I just bought the wrong size for short hair.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for me at my request for a Christmas present 2011. Now June 2012, it no longer turns on. When I contact Conair for the 2 year warranty, well, yes, they&#x27;ll fix it, but I have to pay shipping and handling. The shipping and handling is more then the brush was. The product worked great, while it worked, but no way should it have died within 6 months. &#x3D;sighs&#x3D; back to searching.</li>
    <li> Died. Got it the second week of September 2014, no longer works as of last week. Was a great little product when it worked but now it no longer heats up properly. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Amazon says it is not returnable. I plan to contact Conair directly but don&#x27;t have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;Worse, I bought one as a gift for my granddaughter. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this for a while.  It works perfect.  The 1+1/4\\&quot; size is so hard to find.  Great product.</li>
    <li> my wife thinks it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do big curls in my hair but I&#x27;ve found it works AMAZING to straighten my hair!! It makes it look so healthy! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to work out for me.  I was hoping that it would help to smooth out my hair and curl the ends, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work on my hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped it would.  I have very thick, course hair and this was no match for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for over a month now and it&#x27;s just perfect for my hair.  I have fine, straight hair and this brush gives it nice body and fullness.  I think the temperature settings are just perfect for me.</li>
    <li> this product works great.  It heats up quickly, and grips the hair well with the bristles.  Also it does not shut off while using it like some of the other styling brushes.  the only negative is that it could have a longer cord.</li>
    <li> A regular barrel, a straightener and now this.... I have the perfect choices for styling.</li>
    <li> The Conair hot brush delivers what it promises. It heats up quickly, and the choice of heat settings ensures the brush won&#x27;t be too hot for your hair type. It smooths like a straightener, taming my waves and eliminating frizz. But unlike a straightening tool, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat. Styling with a dryer and brush are way beyond my skill set. I just blow dry and use the hot brush to get the same results I&#x27;d get in a salon but in far less time. I hope Conair continues to make this terrific styling tool.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for years. Nothing else compares. Heats up quick. The 1 1/4 barrel is a perfect size for soft curls or just adding nice volume to your hair style. The design eliminates burning your scalp because of the brush tips. Great for thick or thin hair. Wonderful for international travel with the dual voltage control. I just purchased an additional one, just encase Conair stops making this model. I can only seem to find it online, though. Truely, my most valued hair care product.</li>
    <li> A couple reasons.  The dial in the heat is confusing and I must not have understood the barrel size as it is way too big for me to use on my hair.  Read the descriptions very carefully - which I apparently did not.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. I bought it recently and used it maybe twice before it broke. I&#x27;ll be returning this.</li>
    <li> WOW! My flat iron broke and I thought I&#x27;d try something new. This got great reviews and was pretty inexpensive, so I thought, &amp;#34;why not!?&amp;#34; Well, let me tell you, I LOVE IT!! The first time I tried it was on 3-day old dirty hair. Normally, the hair goes up on day 3, but not that day!! The brush added volume and my hair did not look or feel greasy at all that day! I&#x27;ve since used it on clean hair and it works great. Gives volume as needed. It hasn&#x27;t tangled my hair (or my hair hasn&#x27;t tangled up in the brush). Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to say I really like this brush! I honestly tried the InStyler before and wasn&#x27;t as easy to use as this brush. I have a long, straight and thick hair. What I like about it is that it heats up fast, it has different heat settings ( I usually use it on 20), and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. If I just washed my hair I blow dry it a little bit and then use the brush to curl my ends. Because my hair is straight I have to use a little hair spray to make it last longer. I read before someone had trouble with tangling?! This is my first hot hair brush and I have no experience with it and no problem! If it does happen to tangle a little I haven&#x27;t have any problems unrolling it! So with this brush you can make some waves, loose curls and straighten your hair (not like a flat iron though)! Another great thing the cord is long enough and doesn&#x27;t tangle either and it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair.    One thing I don&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair nice and smooth, so it makes your hair look a little freeze. What I usually do is I just put on any hair product first like leave-in conditioner and in my case a little hair spray on the bottom of my hair. So if you want something to give volume to your hair this is your brush!</li>
    <li> This curing iron isjust what I wanted.  But this styoe is getting harder to find.  Delivered promtly and lives up tp the discription.</li>
    <li> larger spool than I expected.</li>
    <li> love it.  Hard to find this size in the stores.  Great for adding slight wave to hair or taking the frizz out. Not as harsh as a straight iron.</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the other reviewer who said the cord isn&#x27;t long enough.  Also, I seem to accidentally hit the on/off switch while curling my hair  - before I know it there isn&#x27;t heat and I have to constantly turn it back on.</li>
    <li> This almost looks like the one that I have now but lacks the quick release button. The quick release is so great. Why don&#x27;t they put it on anymore???</li>
    <li> So easy to use for a bit of curl. I&#x27;m not one to primp, especially when it comes to my hair. This product has changed that! My hair has a little natural curl, just enough to be unruly. In less than 5 minutes I can give it just enough curl to look polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of setting so the heat can be just right. The hard plastic bristles keep hair from getting tangled (you still have to be careful to not curl too much at a time or wrap too many times). Use it for over, under or sideways banana curls. Doesn&#x27;t fry hair like a curling iron does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best, simplest, and most inexpensive hair gadget that I&#x27;ve ever bought. All the others sit in the drawer or have been given away.Surprisingly, I do actually use this one almost every day!</li>
    <li> just want I wanted, thank you</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase. Well made and works great. Highly recommend this brand to others. Thank you.</li>
    <li> DIDNT HEAT AFTER LESS THAN 2 MONTHS, I FEEL IT SHOULD BE REPLACED.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that lasted 4 years so I decided to get another one.  I like that it has multiple dial heat settings and turbo heat power boost.  It heats up very fast.  I never had a problem my former curling wand and look forward to another four or hopefully more years with this one.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people that can not use a curling iron in the traditional sense. I always burn myself. This brush curler is a wonderful alternative. Does the job for me and I never burn myself...hooray!</li>
    <li> Been a stylist for over 20 years, love this type of iron. The brush is great for some quick styling , run through your hair if you need to calm down frizzy hair after a light blow dry, or for styles that have fine or medium natural waves or basic layers. If you want a tighter curl, go for the regular iron instead that has the same black styled base as this one. Conair makes this same model (black base with temperature control) in the brush, 3/4, 1 inch, 1 1/4, 1 1/2 sizes, I own 1 of each including the brush because it is a good iron. I have been using this type of iron for quite a few years with no complaints. The iron gets plenty hot on the highest heat for ethnic hair, and  you can lower it to suite your hair type. The swivel is great for the cord, heats up fast, and the regular iron holds your hair tight enough on the barrel with no slippage even on fine hair. Great price too, nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Took this to Europe. Worked great both there and in US. My fine, shoulder length hair does not get tangled up in it. The heat settings give you great control and protection from burning the hair. And barrel the perfect size for me. Had a 1.5 inch-just didn&#x27;t get enough curl.</li>
    <li> It heat very fast, but it&#x27;s difficult to curl my hair, even I use the high temp.Maybe due to the brush thing, because I am using another curling iron without brush, it works good on medium heat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price, but I don&#x27;t see it working well when attempting to make curls.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy and it sticks to the brush and therefore doesn&#x27;t work for me. I guess I should return it, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the item just wrong for my hair.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft curls. It&#x27;s so easy to put curls in my ponytail now. It takes a little practice because when I first started using it, it would just tangle. Good styling tool.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my new brush.  It really does a good job in smoothing out hair and flyaways.  I didnt give it five stars simply because that&#x27;s all it really seems to do.  Some of the comments said that it was good for creating waves and even curls, but I am just not getting those results...maybe I am not using it correctly, but how are you exactly curling with it?</li>
    <li> I read the 41 reviews for this item before purchasing.  The vast majority felt it was an excellent product.  It did such a remarkable job on my thick heavy unmanageable hair, that I have to judge the product as outstanding.</li>
    <li> LOVE this curling iron!  Had one with a smaller barrel but it was too small. This is fabulous. Have shoulder length hair and I just brush through to smooth my hair and then give it a little flip under. No muss no fuss.</li>
    <li> Cord should be longer.  Otherwise, very effective at smoothing even fine hair.</li>
    <li> This curling stick is awesome! The only thing I wish it had was a longer cord.</li>
    <li> love it. big curls. heats up fast. I gave super thin fine hair and it still adds body.</li>
    <li> Never try since purchasing. Too big to apply for medium hair. Not sure if this thing could help shaping at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product would have been very good, however it is just too big for my hair length...I can&#x27;t get a tight enough curl..I have since gotten a smaller one that suits my needs much better...too bad you didn&#x27;t have the smaller one.</li>
    <li> The quick heat button is perfect when you are traveling or on the go.  If you have fine or course hair, this curling iron is perfect because you can adjust the heat to reduce the damage to your hair.  Making your hair look more polished</li>
    <li> It does not heat consistently and the turbo always work. I have to shake it to get it to connect.</li>
    <li> This was not a hit in my house it keep getting my hair caught and pulling at it I finally gave up and banned it to the bottom of the sink cabinet. It never seems to really curl or straightened and seemed to be a waster of my money at the expense of my hair.</li>
    <li> I love curling brushes, especially this \\&quot;larger\\&quot; barrels. I am not a fan of flat irons. I have wavy hair that tends to frizz. I like to use a brush to smooth out my hair, then, I can give it some lift and turn the ends under. This one is a perfect size for me. I love that it heats up quickly and the tip remains cool to warm (not hot). Also, I find I cannot live without the auto shut-off. Now, if it would last for at least a year! If it did, 5-stars. I am about to order my fourth one in about 2 years because they stop working. The button goes bad (it&#x27;s lower than the turbo button after a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am debating on trying the Helen of Troy. It doesn&#x27;t have the instant heat up, no auto shut-off, the tip gets hot, and there are complaints hair gets caught between the iron and the tip. However, many have said their iron has lasted FOR YEARS...</li>
    <li> love it quick grooming</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this.  Have been using this for years and years and love it.  Perfect for my super straight hair....  In a power outage I don&#x27;t know what I would do!</li>
    <li> I have used one of these every day for the last 10 or so years. My first one broke after about 5 years of daily use, and the others needed replacing more quickly, but not unreasonably fast. Especially since I use it daily, it&#x27;s well worth the money. They are durable (just make sure you physically switch the voltage when traveling internationally) and produce beautiful, silky hair. At least on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally straight, very fine, and very long hair, but I use this to smooth my hair in the morning and get everything to lay in place--otherwise, it&#x27;s a limp and crooked mess. It&#x27;s also perfect for getting bangs to lay just right and curl under just slightly. It has multiple heat settings, so I don&#x27;t fry my healthy long hair (I don&#x27;t leave it for very long on the same section--rather, I just brush it slowly through.) I can use it to smooth out ponytail kinks or to give my ends a slight curl. I swear that using this makes my hair look glossier. I receive compliments on my hair all the time, and this little baby is my secret.</li>
    <li> My hair has gotten a lot thinner, unfortunately, due to thyroid and hormone issues.  I was looking at a Calista brush on QVC but it was so expensive.  I saw this and figured I would try.  I am very happy with the way it works.  You can actually get tight curls or just some root lift.  I use it mostly for the root lift aspect.  Just be cautious as it can tangle up in your hair at times.</li>
    <li> Not near as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> Works on my long mostly straight hair to provide a bit of shine and to get the ends to curl under.  (I do not know how it will work on thick or curly hair.) It heats up in less than a minute and gives my ends a curl in under 16 seconds on a medium heat setting. The turbo setting works in a few seconds and gives a good heat boost. It will give you a tighter curl. I am done with my hair in under 3 minutes most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to  wind  your hair too many times over the brush or you could get a tangle that is difficult to undo. One or two turns is very safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last  curler one kept going for several years and only failed after one too many falls to the bathroom floor. These things are quite durable under normal circumstances. Could not live without one.</li>
    <li> I love this product very good price and it gives great big curls and body!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome . Got first one years ago and keep coming back for more over and over again . I also give as gifts and everyone loves them. Super product and super price.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001BO0KMC Instant Heat Hot Brush, 1 1/4-Inch]]  Have purchased Conair hair products for the last 20 years. Decided to try this item with many heat settings.  Thought I was buying the same size barrel as I had been using for years but did not realize my mistake until product arrived.  Immediately tried the hot brush and was quite surprised how quickly it was ready for use and I very much liked the larger barrel, much better than the smaller ones.  Auto shut-off is great.</li>
    <li> Love this hot brush, way better than the curling iron, give you volume and style without burning your hair.  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron for it&#x27;s thicker barrell and brush. Can no longer find this type of Conair product in retail stores. My only complaint is that they burn out after so many years. I bought two this time so I have a back up.</li>
    <li> I loved this iron for the first two or three months it actually worked but after that I could leave it plugged in for even an hour and still be able to wrap my hand easily around the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to buy a replacement but am very wary of this reoccurring - especially after the customer service at Conair was virtually useless, going so far as to tell me that they sold no such product!</li>
    <li> It way beyond my expectation !!!! Amazing !!!!!!</li>
    <li> This item is so-so. It doesn&#x27;t grip my hair very well to curl it. My hair is fine so that could be part of it, another part could also be that my hair is chin length so not enough quite yet to get a god grip on. I will keep this and as my hair grows out continue to try and use it.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Would like to have another with a 1 1/2 barre but can&#x27;t find it. great handling, perfect heat settings</li>
    <li> It works fine, but the handle is hard to hold, should be smaller and more manageable, like a regular hair brush.</li>
    <li> My Big Curl Brush broke after 7 years (I bought it a Target).  Love this brush because it give me great spiral curls with little effort (10 minutes to do in the morning!). The order arrived earlier then expected was in perfect condition!  Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Heats very fast.  The on/off light blinks until full hot--all of 60 seconds or so.  Very hot, too.  I use it half of full heat.  I can&#x27;t find this size in any store.</li>
    <li> Quality &amp; service--excellent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often that I find something that can manage my hair. I have very fine hair - but a lot of it. It used to be stick straight, but with age and the grays/whites (And blondes -- it&#x27;s color treated,) the texture has changed a little bit. It used to be 1A, but now I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s either a 1C or even a 2A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a shoulder length bob.  I find it very difficult to do my hair the way that my stylist does. So I leave her place after a cut with it looking great, but can never duplicate it. So I end up sticking it in a ponytail or bun which looks just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for the first time tonight - used a little leave in conditioner, blew it dry, which is usually as far as I can go. I think it took maybe 10 quick curls with this to make it look exactly like I had just left my stylist. I am totally impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I bought it. Excellent price. Glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on a rotating brush or one of those Conair hair eaters.</li>
    <li> I just bought this to replace one I&#x27;ve had for 12yrs.  Very good product</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd hotstick. I also keep one at my gym. I am able to handle this curling iron better than traditional curling irons. I have found the teeth on the hotstick allow for easier curling, with greater control.</li>
    <li> works wells with my thick hair.  I can use it to smooth my hair or curl it.  Watching youtube videos helps to learn how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> Expect to wait several minutes for this (supposedly instant heat) unit to reach the highest temperature, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot as  traditional curling irons. The rotating cord does make use more comfortable to handle than other stationary cords. Convenient size and shape for packing. The price is right for what you get.</li>
    <li> Like this and brand is consistently reliable in my experience.</li>
    <li> Thought I would love this item as it has dual voltage and heats quickly. Unfortunately, too heavy for traveling so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, not as hot as curling iron.  Curl is looser and slightly less flexible than curling iron, but very close and more convenient to hold fine hair.</li>
    <li> Tell price is great at $11. BUT it will burn the heck out of your hands/fingers without a heat glove. Also, where the heat dial is located, it will pull your hair out of you aren&#x27;t Paying CLOSE attention to it.</li>
    <li> Love it and so easy to use. Great grip, get hot really quick and ready to use fast. I love not having to wait on it to get hot I would recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> This styling wand, curler is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. Heats up lickity split, and creates awesome curls. I&#x27;ve had this styling tool for many years, and hope to have for many more. Don&#x27;t waste your money on those stupid expensive ones. This one is most excellent!!!!</li>
    <li> I had a hot brush for years and I finally pulled it off the counter and it hit the floor one last time and broke.  It took me a while to find a replacement but when I got this I loved it. It heats up to very hot but it is the right size and the adjustable heat is great.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, i use this to straighten my hair into wavy lovely hair. Its really good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this one :( was hoping I would since it got so many great reviews, but it left my hair frizzy and with tons of flyaways :(</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these (one for home and one for the office.  I am always prepared.  Planning to purchase the smaller ones and also these again.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in any store.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I ordered mine on March 1, 2012, and it died last week. So I got 16 months out of it. For 16 months, it worked great: heated up quickly, worked consistently, made my hair look full and polished. A hot brush is the best tool for adding body and wave if you don&#x27;t want actual defined curls. Then last week it would start to heat up, then stop, and finally it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all. If you are happy with 16 months of use from a product, I highly recommend it. If you think a product should last longer, then maybe keep looking.</li>
    <li> I used it about 5 times before it stopped getting hot enough to curl my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy something a bit pricier and save the hassle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling brush recently and my hair has never looked better.  It is smoother and more manageable. It heats up so fast unlike my old Conair brush. My sister has very curly, freezy hair but when she tried this brush she wanted to buy one right away.</li>
    <li> This is just what it&#x27;s advertised to be. It heats so quickly and has a wide range of heat settings. I&#x27;ve had a couple of curling brushes before, and this one is, by far, the best.</li>
    <li> Just what I was needing to create the perfect bob without spending a lot of time!!  This was the only place I could find it.</li>
    <li> tHIS WAS A HORRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME.  tHIS STYLING TOOL NEVER GOT EVEN MILDLY&lt;br /&gt;HOT AND IT WOLD GET STUCK IN MY HAIR SO I COULD NOT PULL IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH MY&lt;br /&gt;HAIR.</li>
    <li> Perfect curls every time in no time! No more need to worry about burning fingers, face, or neck because the bristles that comb the hair straight before curling also protect the skin form coming in contact with the iron. Want to give 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Brush has plastic bristles so does not get tangled at all.  Easier to use than a curling iron and less harmful to hair.  Have used this for years with different hair lengths.  Long lasting but I can replace quickly when needed.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for me .  Heats up quickly and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted. My favorite!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going to the salon to get my hair blown out every time I am going out to a party, wedding, etc. This purchase totally eliminates the need to do this. I would spend $25 (with tip) each time and I get the same results with this brush for a fraction of that cost! YAY! no more bad hair days for me! I have curly, fine, a little past the shoulder hair, and this really gives me a great result!</li>
    <li> Love this!  Makes my hair smooth and shiny, easy to use!</li>
    <li> I love this product for doing my hair.  I can no longer get it at my local drugstore of Target.  They only have the flatirons now since that seems to be new trend and I dont know how to use them.  This one heats quickly.&lt;br /&gt;To those who asked about my one star rating that was my mistake.  I meant to give it 5.  Sorry if I confused you.</li>
    <li> It is SO thick that my shoukderblade length hair doesn&#x27;t even get a wave in it.  Also, when you roll your hair in it, it tangles your hair and gets stucka and burns your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe adds a little body, but no waxes or curls.  very sad.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and it sometimes gets a little frizzy.  This product was exactly what I needed to add a little something to my hair without taking a lot of time.</li>
    <li> The item heats up quickly, is easy to use and does all that is expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Conair Hot Brush for about two weeks and really pleased with it.  Smooths my very curly hair into manageable soft shiny waves.  Really like how large it is, as it works much better than a small barrel brush.  Very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the second of this same curling iron that I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.  The first one, over a year old, still works fine, but I wanted to buy another one just in case Conair stops making them!  I find the brush style curling iron much easier to use than the clampy kind!  Also there aren&#x27;t too many brush style that heat up like the clamp ones - most are forced hot air.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this isn&#x27;t a fancy iron, but in my experience works just as well as the more expensive ones.  I love the array of heat settings, and it heats up very quickly.  I have shoulder length wavy hair that often frizzes.  With the 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel, I can smooth and somewhat straighten, or curl it even more.  The tip stays cool, which is good, &#x27;cos I sometimes still manage to burn myself on the iron itself if I&#x27;m not careful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this product to come back on the market, and now its even better with the instant heat. I have chin length fine hair and the curler is perfect to give my hair big curls.</li>
    <li> We all know tha Conair makes alot of great products and this is one.  I like that  it has several heat selection depending on your type of hair (suggestions mad in the pamhlet enclosed.  Need it heated quickly turn it on ad it the turbo button too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling brush on the recommendation of a friend and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I have very thick hair which takes forever to blow dry/style.  Since purchasing the Conair Hot Brush, I  usually just let my hair dry on it&#x27;s own unless (unless I need it dry in a hurry) and use the brush to style it afterwards.  It heats up very quickly, styles my thick hair with ease, and has an automatic shutoff so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if you unplugged it.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> Large barrel curling iron works beautifully for soft curl and body for hair. Small teeth are easier to use than curling irons with 2 part clamps. Great product!</li>
    <li> Hope this diameter curling iron is always available ... Thanks!</li>
    <li> Helpful to give hair shape when in a hurry</li>
    <li> It was bigger than I expected, but it works okay.</li>
    <li> I ordered  this thinking it was a dryer curler, and its a curling iron with bristles. After trying it, I love it.  Works very well</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife.  She loves these.  If fact we bought two in case the first one ever fails.  Heats up fast and does a good job.</li>
    <li> Larger than expected. Works great</li>
    <li> this brush is way bigger than 1inch. and I relaxed my hair but it still takes a while to glide through my hair. but I do admit that I love the different temp setting on it and it does hold a curl so its so so to sum this product up</li>
    <li> It works fine. I have unruly dominican hair and gives me good results.</li>
    <li> For people with somewhat wavy hair this is great for straightening with just a hit of wave. Safety feature a must. I have been know to leave it on and it turns off automatically. This also gives a nice loose curl.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is so much better than the rotating hot air brush which makes my hair messy and no curls at all. I have thick straight hair, they are already voluminous and sleek so I don&#x27;t care about building volume or defrizzing at all... I just want to curl them. The turbo setting makes curling really fast, and the curls are really natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;The spikes and cool tip work better than my previous curling irons too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this curling iron (brush) 4 or 5 times over the years.  It lasts quite a long time (3-5 years).  I prefer it to any others because it automatically shuts off, it has a variety of temperatures to chose from, and the round brush is large enough to give good volume.  I&#x27;ve never burned myself with it either, which is a problem with smaller brushes and regular curling irons that periodically burned my ears until I switched to this one.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001BO0KMC Instant Heat Hot Brush, 1 1/4-Inch]]  This heat brush does the job! With my hair longer and with long layers this works well on both lengths.  Alice</li>
    <li> Really like this better than regular curling iron. Quick and perfect results.</li>
    <li> I should have really paid attention to what I was reading as I thought originally that it was a hot air brush but it&#x27;s just a hot brush. I ordered two (one for my mom, one for me) and they work great! You just have to know how to use it (which wasn&#x27;t easy for me at first but then again, I&#x27;m not that good with all this hair stuff)</li>
    <li> Great.  I love it.  It is easy to use.  Has a long cord, very manageable.  Only thing I would have changed:  I would have the brush come with the travel bag.  But I found a shoe bag that does the trick.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This iron&#x27;s adjustable heat setting works great.  On my thin, fine hair I can still get fullness with it, and it doesn&#x27;t create static.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update November 2012**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my styling brush for a good while and it still works flawlessly.  I travel a good bit and, unfortunately, I was careless in packing it so some of the teeth broke off and it sounds loose inside.  It still works but I decided to dedicate that one to traveling and buy a new one for home.  This curler really heats up quickly and performs well.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of the same curling machine by Conair.  One was the wrong size, but I gave it away.  Now, there is one in each of my three baths - what more can I say?</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1-1/4\\&quot; Conair Hot Brush online as you cannot find a brush with a larger barrel size in stores.  My hair is fine, somewhat straight and cut in a long bob - and this product works great!  With the larger barrel, you can turn hair under or flip it out.  It creates the look of blowing your hair out straight in half the time.  Easy to use with a good safety tip to avoid burning fingers and heats up very fast.  All around great product and would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I like that the barrel has solid, inflexible plastic comb teeth so it can get a hold of and hold on to your hair. This thing does get outrageously hot and will fry your hair if not careful! Curl your hair around the barrel, at a lower setting, and increase the heat if you need to. The barrel is too big for my purposes, so it is not the best fit for me right now. I did not plan to return it so I threw away the packaging and cannot exchange it. I&#x27;ll hang on to it for when my hair grows longer and use it to curl the ends. This is a good tool for longer hair, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for younger girls. It will burn you.</li>
    <li> hard to use and do anything, my hair just slips right though the product, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> My hair tangles if you look at it sideways, so I have some trouble getting the iron smoothly through my hair. Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;curl.&amp;#34; I was looking for something that would maybe help smooth out the weird waves that I get in my hair, and this seems to help a little bit. So overall, not a bad purchase, just not quite what I was expecting, I suppose.</li>
    <li> I would like a smaller wand.  I like Conair Products they have high heat, auto shut offs.  They last.  Still looking for a smaller&lt;br /&gt;brush instant brush.</li>
    <li> I am not a happy camper where this product is concerned.  I purchased it in January, 2015, and it quit working one month later, in February, 2015.  Therefore I can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second Hot Brush from this manufacturer.  My first one fell off the counter and cracked.  I was able to find another one.  I Love this hot brush.  It has an adjustable heat setting and gives a nice curl or wave.  I use it almost every day and find it does not dry my hair out like a curling iron has.</li>
    <li> Love it i bought the name brand before and this is as good. very nice</li>
    <li> My Curling iron is great and I use it mostly when I am out of town.  The heat setting is perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used hot brushes to do my hair for years. I do mean years as I am 77  years old.  This is the best one I have had.  There are 25 heats settings on the brush.  I keep mine set half way.  The unit hears up very quickly and I  dont have to plug it in before I do any of my makeup to get it hot.  The price is good and performance good so thats good enough for me.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST curling brush, if you need this diameter.  It lasts several years and this is my third one!</li>
    <li> I tried a more expensive version of this sold by QVC and hated it. Then someone recommended this and though I was hesitant I tried it. LOVE IT!  It does everything the $100 one did not. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> probably should have gotten a smaller one</li>
    <li> I like this brush as an alternative to curling irons and wands used on my slightly longer than shoulder-length hair.  I had one in highschool but I didn&#x27;t like it.  I though 30 years later, the quality would have improved.  I was right.  You have to take the hair in smaller sections and the curl is not defined like with an iron. It&#x27;s soft, flowy curls.  However, within hours, my hair was flat.  So, unless your hair is shorter and curlier, I would not recommend if you want real curls that last.  It is NOT good for fine or thin hair.</li>
    <li> I cannot use a curling iron to save my life - this heating brush does a wonderful job and heats quickly - bought an extra and will buy another for our Florida home</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as a blow dryer and brush.  Just doesn&#x27;t heat up the same way.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great product!</li>
    <li> I was trying to decide between the infomercial Perfecter vs this brush -- obviously due to price, this instant heat brush won me over.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush!!  It&#x27;s cheap, and most importantly, it straightens and/or curls my hair efficiently.  I have naturally curly hair, and even tho the brush does not rotate, it doesnt tangle, its easy to use, and doesnt burn my hand or hair.  It has numerous heat settings.  I leave mine somewhere around half way point, and even tho it doesnt seem to get too hot, it works wonderfully.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but i expected more. It isn´t a hair dryer as well but it´s nice to design hair.</li>
    <li> Eh.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive tool, but even so, not one I can recommend trying.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, and can&#x27;t be easily made taut enough to do much on my fine, thick, medium-length hair.  Working with dry hair, it  not as effective as a rounded-edge flat iron, or a curling iron that you move through your hair instead of keeping in one spot.  Working with wet hair, it&#x27;s greatly inferior a blow dryer with a small round brush (esp. a metal-and-bristle brush).  Aside from heat level, a main problem is that it is hard to make the hair taut enough to do anything.  The tautness that the outer clamp piece would provide with a curling iron or flat iron, here must be provided manually, The lack of outer clamp piece  means you have to use your hand to guide it and keep it in contact with hair, which means being really, really alert to the potential for burns.  On the positive side, it is harder than with some other tools to tangle hair with it; the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are thick and widely spaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have coarse hair or curly hair, the results might be different than with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still a hair tool to be designed that is similar to this but hotter and with some sort of outer metal hinged piece, similar to a curling iron or flat iron - but this we are not there yet in hair tools innovation.</li>
    <li> This brush works as advertised, but I find it less satisfactory than either a curling iron or a hot air brush.  There is no curl release as on a hot air brush, and each curl much be completely un-wound separately. For me, it&#x27;s harder to keep the hair in place with this than with a regular curling iron. Just personal preferences, but this would be my third choice of the types of hair curlers available.</li>
    <li> The conair 1.25 Hot Brush curls and straightens my hair and the bristles keep the hot iron away from my skin, thus virtually eliminating burns.  I was always burning my forehead with a conventional iron so this is really a big improvement.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job. It helps straighted my roots and give body while giving such a nice curl to the bottom of my hair. my hair is just past my shoulders with a layered cut. Couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $80 for the try curl perfector. Very happy with this,but I wish it had more bristles to grip the hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I have used a lot of heated brush and this is the best one yet-heats up fast and gives my hair just the right amount of bounce, shine and curl.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Works great on my very thick wavy hair for curling but does not straighten. That&#x27;s ok though I have gotten sooooo many compliments on my hair since I started using this. It is a fast and easy way to make any look, looked put together.</li>
    <li> For my super thick, extra curly hair, this will get through it and will work. I don&#x27;t like that I have to use such a high heat setting to make it work though, as over time, that will be damaging to my fragile hair especially on the top layer, and at the front of my head, where I use it the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly on the turbo setting, the brush/barrel size is more than adequate for me and it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean off if you get hair, or hair lotion/potions on it when working with your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for your longer hair getting stuck at either end, if you overload the barrel winding too much hair across its length. The problem is where the recessed portion is, at the end of the heating barrel at either end, where the metal meets the plastic. Someone here at Amazon already gave a quick fix for that which I have not tried. I am just being more careful, now.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is hard to find a hot brush that does not blow air. I do wish it would come in the 1 1/2 in. size. The only problem is that it does not heat high enough. It has 25 heat settings and I have fairly fine hair that is not thick. I have to set it to number 25 to get it hot enough to use and it could stand to be a little hotter. I do not think it would work well if you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I used this twice and then it stopped working</li>
    <li> The two best features of the Conair Hot Sticks Instant Heat Big Curl is that it heats up fast and gives a nice lift to your hair.  The Turbo feature allows for a little more heat to tighten the curl.  The 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for creating a long or short page boy look.  I recently bought the same curling brush with the 1&amp;#34; barrel.  The smaller barrel is great for making medium curls.  I am very pleased with both the large and small barrel Conair Hot Sticks Curling brushes.  Also, both Curling brushes are not that expensive.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this! Bought it for the US, can also use it in Europe, no problem</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  My hair is somewhat wavy, but I wear it pretty straight.  This smooths my hair so much easier than a flat-iron, and because it&#x27;s round I can get added volume and slightly curved-under ends, which is so much more attractive than the blunt ends that the flat-iron left.  It is also so very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 bc I found it cheaper at walmart and I was bummed that I over paid for it, but it works great to make my hair more manageable and&lt;br /&gt;takes away my cowlick, yippee!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not helping me any in curling my hair. But it&#x27;s very useful in touching up my hair. Straightening it and fluffing it a bit.It&#x27;s a comb with heat. Easy to get your hair behave with it. So it&#x27;s a 3 star from me.</li>
    <li> It is good, but I can&#x27;t really curl my hair with it.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted at all.  I wanted a styling brush and this is a curling iron. Probably fine if you want a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I was tempted to get a more expensive hair styler (one of those &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; for $100), but decided to get this one after reading the raving reviews. I have hair a few inches past my shoulder that is fine, thick and slightly wavy. In just a few minutes, it makes my hair smooth and enhances the waves. I use it during the work week to look more professional and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This instant heat hot brush is great because it is easy and fast. I don&#x27;t spent a lot of time on my hair and don&#x27;t like to fuss with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had issues with tangling, but I don&#x27;t wrap my hair around the rod the way I would with a curling iron. I don&#x27;t think this brush was designed to give ringlets or curls the way a curling iron does. The purpose of this hot brush is to give body, enhance waves and curl the ends, which is does perfectly and with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry and then use it (this is not meant to be used on wet hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to curl my layers under, or flip them out, and/or frame my face. I section off the hair at the top of my crown and work on the bottom layers first. I drape a strip of hair on top of the brush and pull it up toward the ceiling so the ends of my hair naturally fall over it, which helps gravity keep it in place to give it a nice curl. To add body and volume near my scalp, I lay a chunk of hair over the brush and angle it upwards against my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the bristles also act a protective barrier from the heated rod, I have never burned my fingers nor my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my hair gets flattened from sleeping on it or wearing a hat, this hot brush quickly freshens up my look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up in 60 seconds. Does not leave my hair too hot. I have not noticed damage despite regular use. I rarely blow dry my hair as it can damage my hair, and I no longer ever use a flat iron, which can damage my hair in one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you make your decision and that you enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This makes it possible for me to straighten out my very curly hair easily and quickly.  It is just what I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like having a normal curling iron, however because this curler has teeth, you can just manipulate your hair around this. After buying this, I realized I liked my curling iron better, but this is a good product if you wake up with a bad hair and you just curl with this.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up really fast and quite easy to use. It came with 25 levels of different heat but I highly doubted if anyone will use under level 20. The price is reasonable and does what it says. My mom has short hair and it worked quite well.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, gives volume</li>
    <li> Perfect for me - never could get the clamp type curling irons positioned right.  This works great, and usually gives you just the amount of curl or wave just where you place it.</li>
    <li> I have used this hot brush (not a hot air brush) for years.  It is the best tool for my hair.  It smooths and gently styles my moody hair.  I cannot live without it!  It is impossible to find in stores, and I am very grateful that Amazon carries it.  You can&#x27;t even get it from Conair!  I do not understand why.  Love it. Please continue to sell it!</li>
    <li> Use this everyday, it was a little larger than expected but does a nice job in a small amount of time.  Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this curling/hot brush iron! I have two, one for camp also. It does not tangle my &#x27; shoulder length fine&#x27; hair and makes hair smooth. Easy to curl also.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these for several years.  Over time the teeth become brittle and break off even though the iron still works.  I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in the stores.  I love this product.  My hair is fine with just enough curl to be frizzy and this helps get rid of some of the frizz without straightening all the curl.  My only complaint is that the cord is shorter than my old one and all the other similar products that I own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for almost 4 years now and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just now writing a review about it. I didn&#x27;t use it much because I&#x27;m into curling irons and straighteners. I&#x27;ve always thought they work better. So today I was going through my stuff and I found this baby. I tried it, set it into the highest heat and put it into turbo... wow I am impressed! The curls are absolutely beautiful. While I love me some curling iron, I&#x27;ve always had trouble with the volume. With the Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush, you get super gorgeous big curls plus volume! How awesome is that. I am so ecstatic and I wanna beat myself for not using this one for years. The curls from this brush are the type of curls I&#x27;ve desperately wanted to achieve using a curling iron to no avail. The only downside to this brush is that it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator when it&#x27;s ready. I don&#x27;t care much about that though because it works so well on my hair. This may be an old styling tool but hey it works great! I&#x27;m gonna upload a picture of my curls so you&#x27;ll see how wonderful this hot brush is.</li>
    <li> I really like this hot brush but the cord is very short - recommend using it with a heavy duty extension unless your outlet is close to a mirror.</li>
    <li> I was not sure I would like due to the large, 1 1/4in. size and my baby fine hair but it does a great job.  I always hold the brush in the final position about 10 to 12 seconds and then slowly release.  I had the 3/4 in. brush for years until it finally died.  I think I like the new one the best.</li>
    <li> The product works exactly as presented. It heats up quickly, smooths and curls or waves hair. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for years now. I have mid to long hair with layers. It works fantastic when \\&quot;flipping\\&quot; up ends! I always have to order it from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in any stores, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> A present, hasn&#x27;t been used.  But I certainly think this item will be as efficient as other Conair products.</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; when I travel.  Heats up real fast and does the job of smoothing and curling my hair.</li>
    <li> works great. I was really impressed, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this and after researching a few other brands, I decided to go with this one based on reviews, etc. I have never been good with curling irons. Even after watching YouTube videos. I certainly don&#x27;t have skills when it comes to styling hair, which is why it was so frustrating when I discovered I don&#x27;t get along with curling irons and wands. I do have a flat iron for straightening my hair and have been told and shown that you can curl with a flat iron but again, I stink at that. This heated styling brush is like a wonderful little miracle! As someone said before, it is basically idiot proof...very true. You can straighten your hair or curl it with this. I am so happy that I can add style to my hair now because before it was always completely straight, flat and boring. I also figured for this price that it was definitely worth a shot. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. When I add curl to my hair, I start by brushing, twisting (whichever direction I choose for the day) and I pulling down lightly. You can&#x27;t twist it around too tight though. Just kind of let it flow with the twisting and pulling down at the same time --- it really works for me. I have straightened my hair with this too. I believe I like it better than my flat iron. At least for now. It has been the only tool in use for me since I bought it. As far as the heat setting, I started out with it being turned up to 19 and now I am practically at the highest setting. I have medium to thick hair. The curls last forever. I use a real light hairspray afterwards just for a bit of hold. I definitely recommend this! It is a life saver and I am so thrilled about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I received this at the tail end of May and of course from my review above, I&#x27;m thrilled with it. Well, yesterday (8/23/15) I tried using it, and it was completely dead. Yes, I checked my outlet and flipped the switch there, etc. I even had my husband look at it to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy. The darn thing just was DEAD. So I called Amazon this morning and they are replacing it for me - thank goodness. Disappointing because it&#x27;s only been 2 months. Let&#x27;s hope the next one lasts longer.this morning and they are replacing it for me - thank goodness. Disappointing because it&#x27;s only been 2 months. Let&#x27;s hope the next one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I am astonished at the results I received from using this item that seems to have been made from the hands of angels!  My hair is very thick and naturally curly, yet every time I let my hair dry naturally the curls look horribly messy and resemble bundled coils.  Now, that I have this product I can create any style I want.  One day I can have straight hair that looks smooth and neat, then I can have beautiful curls that are soft but yet boisterous, or I can have just subtle waves running throughout the strands.  All I have to say is that I love this product.  Whenever, I first bought the item I began  playing with the different styles I could create.  I personally prefer this over any other hair straightener, curler, or brush.  If your having a bad hair day plug this in and you will get fabulous results.  So, if your thinking about buying it, do it, cause it is truthfully the right choice!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and ths provides great curls. I don&#x27;t need to worry about tangling! Nothing worse than getting your hair stuck on the curling brush. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it. I burnt my self the first time I used. I&#x27;ll get used to after using it. Thank you</li>
    <li> My hair got so tangled in this contraption (twice) that I thought I was going to have to cut a chunk of my hair out. Fine for smoothing long hair and makes some waves when using it as a curling tool, but even careful use resulted in a tangled mess.</li>
    <li> I love this curling  hot brush,i can curl my hair fairly quick with it and it heats up quick also&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Received this product almost immediately, was exactly as promised and works&lt;br /&gt;  great.  Would order Conair hair products again.  Iron heats up almost instantly.</li>
    <li> I give this product a 5-star rating.  It heats up very quickly and easily adjusts to higher or lower heat settings as per my hair&#x27;s needs.  My hair tends to be thin and wispy, so the bristle features make it easy to wrap and hold each section when styling. The bristles also help to keep the barrel away from my scalp and skin so I do not get burns. As I could not locate a 1-1/4 inch curling-iron with the brush in any local stores, I am thankful to have acquired it online.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ! Even with my medium length, thick hair!</li>
    <li> So very pleased I traded this one in for a Helen of Troy. Half of the teeth broke off the Helen of Troy. But this Conair does what it says it will do, my hair has never looked to good!!!</li>
    <li> It works okay.  It takes longer than I like, I was expecting it to be quick like the flat iron but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  The couple of things I had issues with is it doesn&#x27;t heat to the highest temperature in 30 seconds, maybe the lower temps do.  It also gets tangled into my hair at times.  My hair inevitably finds any crevice on it and gets stuck causing the hair to break off.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Heats up fast and creates beautiful soft curls and waves.  This was just what I was looking for to use on those mornings I did not need to wash my hair or if I washed it the night before and want to create a style without wetting my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have fine, wavy brunette hair that often frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I wanted something that will reduce fly-away hair&lt;br /&gt;- I wanted a way to style my hair super fast between washes and still look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Variable heat - great.&lt;br /&gt;- Tip stays cool so you can actually handle both ends.&lt;br /&gt;- Nibs on the brush stay cool while the barrel heats up so I don&#x27;t burn my skull Ever anymore.&lt;br /&gt;- Super fast warm-up time.&lt;br /&gt;- I can use it to straighten my hair by just drawing the brush through my hair straight&lt;br /&gt;- I can use it to curl my hair by turning it while the hair is wrapped around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does risk tangling if you wrap long hair around it more than twice, so I try not to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this puppy.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Holds my fine hair in the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; much better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Curls or straightens my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cord is way too short.&lt;br /&gt;Hair gets caught in gap between barrel and handle constantly.  Be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My long, fine hair kept getting caught in not only the gap between the barrel and the handle, but it also easily got tangled up in the brush - scorching a section of my hair!  I threw this cheap, dangerous thing away and bought a curling brush with a bristle release button and no gap.</li>
    <li> Price is good but it is hard to use myself and would not be able to use often. I have not so much beauty skill, can not make volume and curl at my back hair as I desire. Or need to learn skill..</li>
    <li> just straightens my hair</li>
    <li> Wanted a curling iron for a new perm (until it &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34;) but, after reading reviews, decided on this hot brush.  Very nice for a semi-loose curl.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and performs exactly as stated - heats quickly - good job.  Received quickly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a hair tool that is easy to use and works beautifully. I have shoulder length very fine thin straight hair. With his hot brush I can get nice waves that make my hair look full. I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune (compare to one sold on QVC). It heats up fast and I only hold each section for 10 seconds. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good product. Heats up quick but be careful when roll around your hair because it can burn you easily too</li>
    <li> Love the thick barrel - I can use it to smooth my hair out rather than curling it. The multiple heat settings are great, too! And I didn&#x27;t think the fact that it heats up so quickly was a big deal when bought it, but now that I&#x27;m using it daily, I love this feature.</li>
    <li> I thought I was replacing my blow dryer/curler.. and didn&#x27;t notice until the product arrived that it is only a hot iron, no blow dryer function.. silly me. Works well, many settings, not exactly what I wanted but am keeping it.</li>
    <li> This is very hard to use and does not grip my hair.  It is basically useless and I stopped trying to use it and went back to a traditional curling iron.</li>
    <li> I could not find this curling iron in any store. It is my favorite. Heats up quick. Priced right. My old one quit working but it was at 6+ yrs old.</li>
    <li> It is great. Only takes a few minutes to repair bedhead......</li>
    <li> It damage hair, make it dry, but all iron do that, easy to use, and the price is low</li>
    <li> Gives u big curls, spiral curls. However, they don&#x27;t last like a straightener does, hair still frizzes after a while.</li>
    <li> I like this hot brush and the price is more than fair.  My only complaint is that the cord is too short.</li>
    <li> Since I have baby fine hair that is kind of hard to curl, I purchased the 3/4 inch model of this Instant Heat Brush. What amazes me about this brush is that it heats up so quickly but does not overheat.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have not forgotten to turn it off, yet I am so glad to know that it has an auto turnoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing I want to add: This does not tangle up in my hair and gives my hair softness and curl. And this brush is easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> I finally found the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; tool for my hair.  This wand is easy to use and very effective.  For just a bit of effort, you get a professional looking result. It provides a soft, natural looking curl.  Nice product and super price!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve bought 3-4 over the years.  It heats up quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t give my hair curls, but it smooths the ends and makes it overall look bouncy and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a typical curling Iron, with a multitude of heat settings. Not sure why anyone needs 25 settings (as opposed to low, medium, high), but you&#x27;ll probably do what I did, which is find a good temp for you, and leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE:  This says it&#x27;s a 1 1/4-inch brush, but it really means the barrel (the hot part) is 1 1/4-inches, and then there&#x27;s the brush part, too, so it&#x27;s more like 2+ inches in total. THAT is a substantial difference, if you have short hair. Long hair will be fine with it, but if your hair is shorter than 4 inches, this is pretty much going to straighten your hair, if you can even get it to engage at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about 4 inches long in front, and longer in back, so I can wrap my hair around it easily in back, but the front hair barely stays with it, as I turn the brush. I have to hold it against the brush, as the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; on the brush are not really brush-like at all. They&#x27;re more like hard plastic pins, which keep the hot part away from your scalp, more than picking up and holding your hair. (Good for not tangling in the hair, but not so good for holding onto the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This basically creates LARGE waves, more than curls, even on the longer hair. If that&#x27;s what you want, fine, but know this is more of a straightener, than a curler. (I have really curly hair, so straightening is what I wanted it for, but I was intending for a smaller barrel, so my short hair would fit in it, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, It works as intended, and heats up quickly. The cord is on one of those swivel cords, so you can turn it all day, and never tangle it, which I like. The cord length is good for bathroom sink outlets, with not too much excess to store when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big negative is the size error. When purchasing sight unseen, it is imperitive that size info be CLEAR and accurate.  I knocked off a couple stars for that, and the ridiculous packaging, which forces you to destroy the package, so you can never return it.  I&#x27;ll eat this one, but I sure won&#x27;t give it a good rating for a product which is nearly double the stated size.return it.  I&#x27;ll eat this one, but I sure won&#x27;t give it a good rating for a product which is nearly double the stated size.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase I keep wearing them out!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great, only able to use it once as I got a frozen shoulder several months ago and now can&#x27;t brush my hair or wash my face, let alone use a curling iron :-(  but the hot brush was great the one time I used it, before my shoulder went like this.</li>
    <li> I brought this to use in Europe and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m going to get rid of all my other curling irons now. It was a million times better than I expected. Never thought I could have curls in my hair so easily. Can&#x27;t believe I didnt know about this before now</li>
    <li> I can use this to straighten or curl my hair.  I use it on the hottest setting, as I have very thick hair and it does the job very well.</li>
    <li> This product does not really do the work. And it always pulls your hair off.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended product. And the return policy is not good either. It said you only can return the product with unopened package. But how could I know if this product work properly if I did not open it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really satisfied. If you want to buy this produce, please be careful.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling brush for medium length hair.  It produces a nice soft curl or you can use it to smooth curly hair for a bob.  Make sure the hair for each curl is kept away from the area where the brushes attach to the handle -- it can get caught and be pulled.</li>
    <li> I had one of these prior for several years that I loved, as it is quick and easy to use, and the curl lasts.  It can also be used to straighten and smooth by simply running the combed barrel down the length of the hair.  From so much use, my husband had to repair the cord at one point on my old one.  Was so glad this product was still available when my old one finally died.  This one has a turbo setting that my old model did not, but I find the highest dial is sufficient anyhow.  It heats up VERY quickly, which is great.  I love that it turns off on its own, in case I forget.  The top can be removed so you can slide out the combs and clean well when necessary.</li>
    <li> Utterly awful. Gets tangled in hair and makes hair very frizzy. I have naturally curly hair and this is awful for it.</li>
    <li> Maybe I received a dud product but I felt like this hot brush was a waste of money.  I looked at a bunch and went with this one because of the positive reviews and also, I liked that it was a curler+brush rather than a dryer+brush.  It did not get hot and certainly did not curl my hair--not even give me a wave.  I got sloppy bends in the hair then brushed the bends out and threw it away.</li>
    <li> Works great but easy to burn your hand if you are not careful</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t do the trick for me - I tired both sizes.</li>
    <li> I loved the 3/4 inch style and having 25 heat settings was a big big plus.  I love this curling iron.  Never without one so have them for every suitcase and bathroom.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this brush item so I&#x27;m keeping it but it isn&#x27;t as hot as I need without the turbo every time.  it takes a few full minutes to heat up and has to rewarm between curls. A little dissappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product. Like the longer teeth on this one.</li>
    <li> I needed something to quickly tame my thick, wild hair.  This hot brush heats very quickly and the brush style prevents the awful curling iron &amp;#34;kink&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair and blow dry it straight when weather permits.  However, I can&#x27;t stop there because I&#x27;m still left with frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve been flat ironing and then curling w/a 1 1/4\\&quot; iron after I blow dry.      Vs. a flat iron, I find this works really well at smoothing the hair without making my hair stick straight.  It&#x27;s easier and faster to use because of the bristles.  I was struggling with getting my bangs right.  I was getting them too straight with a flat iron even if I twisted it for curl, and getting them too curly with the curling iron.  The curling brush is also awesome for touching up my hair in the mornings because I have dry hair that hates being washed every day.      I also bought the 3/4\\&quot; version at my local walmart (hope I can mention them?) on a whim for less than $11.  In fact, that&#x27;s why came to amazon to buy the larger version.  They both work great at reducing frizz and flyways.  I find the 3/4\\&quot; gets closer to the scalp because of the shorter bristles, and the 1 1/4\\&quot; works better elsewhere because it creates looser curl - perfect for a little bit of flip at the ends.  If you have short hair, I think the 3/4\\&quot; version would be perfect for volume and curl.     I still use my curling iron for creating big curls, as actually wrapping my hair all the way around the brush except for the very ends would most likely end up with me having a curling brush permanently attached to my head.  I like my flat iron for the first 4-5\\&quot; of hair when I want to get the sleekest style because it gets hotter than the curling brush.  Of course, using a really hot flat iron and curling iron on your hair is definitely more damaging.    It takes roughly 3 minutes and 20 seconds for these to heat up.  I leave turbo turned on.    Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I&#x27;d like.  it goes up to a number 25 which is suppose to be HOT, but it&#x27;s meh. When I use this, I am constantly turning the dang thing off!  My hand keeps hitting the one button (dual on/off button).Constantly having to push to turn it back on.  I was SO excited when I saw this and now it&#x27;s just another hair tool sitting in my bathroom drawer. No big curl here...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. This curling brush is great it works so well I ordered a second one for travelling.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Has a high heat unit in it and like the teeth so hair does not slid out while curling.</li>
    <li> Really liked it because the iron doesn&#x27;t have a clip that leave a line/mark in hair.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could use a longer cord though.....has short cord which makes it more difficult to use behind your head.</li>
    <li> But rips out a lot of hair. But I like it because it&#x27;s something different &amp; it gives your hair much more volume. Still perfecting my skills in using this device. I learned how to do perfect curls with a straightener / flat iron. But I think this tool has even more potential to make different styles of curls, such as spirals etc, because the bristles hold hair strands in place, and you can maneuver the way you fold the curl. Pretty interesting. Only wish the heated part was ceramic &amp; that there was no crack in between the metal &amp; plastic handle, which is the part that rips out the most hair.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day.  Except for an occasional hair getting stuck, this is amazing and does a great job of curling my out of control hair.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  You will not need hot rollers after using this.  It sets curls so fast.  It also creates amazing volume and natural looking styles - my hair is fine, but there is a lot of it, and it is somewhat wavy.  Thus, I can&#x27;t use curlers since they thin the fullness out my natural texture.  This brush is a godsend - i tried three different products after settling on this one!!</li>
    <li> Found this iron heats up quickly and is easy to use with my soft, thick hair.  Easy to brush through hair but take care not to wrap too tightly.  Use it daily and have no problems  Would purchase again and also as a gift.</li>
    <li> It was too hot. I returned it and received a refund.</li>
    <li> It works! What can I say. It&#x27;s made to heat up and curl you hair, if you do it right. HOW to do it wrong?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure some people have a talent in that. Just check old infomercials! ;)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair as other similar curling blowers (I usually have curling blowers of the same size, but they don&#x27;t seem to sell them in the US) And it heats up really fast. Which is great for rush mornings.. noons.. etc.&lt;br /&gt;So many words for a curling iron!</li>
    <li> I think it works well for the price..  It wonders on weave and hair pieces. It worked on my course non processed hair but not as well as I would have liked.  Plus It still works after about a month so it worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Everyone is complaining how hott it gets? Bull****. Haha sorry but if anything is wrong with this product it would be because it doesn&#x27;t get hott enough! I absolutely freaking love it. I think though it works better with shorter hair. I have longggggg hair and it gets tangled in the mini brush. Haha but I still love it for my bangs!</li>
    <li> This instant heat hot brush heats up almost instantly! In less than 30 seconds I would say. Keeps my hair curly. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This heat brush does wonders with my wife&#x27;s hair. She thinks its the best thing since sliced bread! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The curling iron works great. Heat&#x27;s very quickly. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out, it&#x27;s just what I needed to get the extra body on top of my head to look great. It shipped and recieved it very quickly. Can&#x27;t beat the price I saw it in a store in town and it 30.00</li>
    <li> It gets hot quickly which is just what I wanted.  Thanks.....price was just right.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying or using a heat brush of any kind. I&#x27;m still getting used to it. It heats up really fast and works well, but it takes a little finesse and practice to get the results I want.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly color treated hair down past my shoulders.  This works great to smooth my hair so is looks soft, shiny and full of body without the frizz.  Best results are when I let my hair air dry and then fine tune with soft curls :)  This way my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> This brush work well with my past shoulder length hair. Bit barrel roll curls last all day. My hair is fine and I get great results. Love the auto shut off feature and it heats up quickly</li>
    <li> I am a Not-So-New-Mom of a 20 month old. I have little time to spend on my hair. My hair is not wild, but it&#x27;s not straight or falls into luscious waves either. I love that I can wash my hair at night, let it air dry, and run the hot brush through my hair. It looks like I blow-dry it straight and flipped the ends with as curler. I love that it heats up quick. (I sometimes do my hair at work. &amp;#60; That&#x27;s how fast it heats up.)</li>
    <li> This product was well worth the money.  I gives great body to those casual hairstyles.  I wear my hair in a short bob style and find that this heat brush works wonderfully for my particular application..  It&#x27;s really all I wanted to pay to get the look I wanted.</li>
    <li> Kind of flimsy.  Did not get as hot as I had hoped.  Bought a Remington one similar to this in London which was fantastic but this did not measure up.  I have very manageable, easy to style hair but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> this is the best. I just let my hair air dry and then run this through to straighten and add volume and curl. Not tight curls, just nice neat sleek curls</li>
    <li> It works great on my just below shoulder length hair. Leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I find it very quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I think I had a very different sort of expectation from this brush which is why I&#x27;m disappointed in this product (and myself). I have curly hair but sometimes I wish to loosen my curl pattern and straighten it somewhat. This brush is called Hot Stick (not a hot brush) so it&#x27;s like a curling iron with brush bristles on them. My main concern is the make of this item as it looks and feels extremely flimsy and cheap. As far as working is concerned, I just used it on my fringe area to straighten that as I&#x27;m rocking my curly hair right now. I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve used it multiple times to note the effect on the operational buttons</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length thick hair.  I have always preferred either hot rollers or a hot brush.  This hot brush is glorious!  It gets very hot and grasps my hair well; the curl is lovely and soft.  This brush is so much easier to use than a curling iron!  I think I am going to get the smaller roller as well.  Great product so far! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t what I expected nor wanted. Even then, It&#x27;s not \\&quot;wow\\&quot;.  Will keep on looking for something better to replace my faithful old brush :(</li>
    <li> Came quickly in the mail.  Love it!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!! maybe i just had a bad experience i don&#x27;t know? But i got this as a gift and i instantly tried it out on my hair. WHat wind up happening was the brush part got stuck in my hair and it would not unwind or come out. I had to cut my hair and it even burnt my scalp&amp;#62; I immediately called conair and complained. I wind up having to get a hair cut to blend in the part that this tool messed up.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and i use it often.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I like the options of different heat settings and the fact that it has an automatic shut-off for the times I forget to unplug it. It is also very fast to heat up.  I just wish I could get the 1 inch version!</li>
    <li> Looking for a curling brush and this one is great!  heats up quicker than I remember from years ago.  Love the auto shut off and the way you can dial the heat you want!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! Prior to purchasing this I was going to start using hot rollers again. This appliance is so easy to use and makes my hair shiny and bouncy. I was hesitant to buy a Conair appliance but it is great and very sturdy.</li>
    <li> I only bought this hot sticks because of all the positive reviews I had read about it. I actually wanted to have a hair dryer brush but bought this one instead. In my case, it didn&#x27;t work out as nicely as I thought it would, for I have very fine and straight hair and it slides out of the bristles rather than being wrapped around them. Maybe I would still have to find out if the hair should be wetter or dryer to make good use of it.</li>
    <li> Too dangerous to handle. Too much hot even when operated at a low level.</li>
    <li> I am giving this as a birthday gift and I am hoping it will be as good as it looks.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT...Just what I needed.....I can&#x27;t use curling irons as I can&#x27;t get the knack of them and I always kink my hair using curling irons.....but this brush gives me just the curl I need with very little hassle...don&#x27;t have to go to the salons or spend hours in curlers.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, maybe it works well on other people&#x27;s hair, but it was terrible on mine. :(</li>
    <li> great products you can find on this web site ever. thank you</li>
    <li> This works perfect for fine hair.  I really like the comb/brush aspect of it, helps to get hold of very fine hair.  I have the smaller version of this and knew that I liked it....I just needed the bigger barrel.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that I wear quite short. I have always used a traditional hair dryer and I will have to continue to do so. I thought the brush would allow me to dry my hair one handed. I cannot use the hot brush.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY CONAIR HOT STICK.  I HAD ONE PREVIOUSLY THAT WAS A I HAD VERY OLDER MODEL THAT I SWEAR I HAD FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS.  I HAVE LOOKED FOR ANOTHER FOR EVER AND I FINALLY FOUND ONE LIKE MY OLD ONE.  CONAIR ROCKS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Does the job.  I cant find it in stores.  Thank goodness Amazon has it.  Lasted several years and I finally needed to get a new one.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that this would help me manage my very curly hair but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on it.  Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of experimenting and learning how to use it - I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that were part of the problem but the accompanying information and instruction slip was more focused on not starting fires or getting burned where I would also have wanted more information on using the darn thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are handy with a curling iron, it may work for you - but then if you are handy with a curling iron, you may not need it.</li>
    <li> Really not happy with this..I would like to return it if that is possible.</li>
    <li> the instand heat hot brush was a great value and arrived on time as stated when ordering; would recommend to buy</li>
    <li> Love this larger barrel hot brush. I&#x27;ve been growing out my curly hair and this helps to smooth out my hair. A great deal!</li>
    <li> This thing gets hot, so you have to be careful not to touch the metal. It works really well. I use it to curl my bangs a little bit, and on the ends of my long hair. It doesn&#x27;t curl as deeply as a curling iron, but adds a nice little curl on the ends of my hair in very little time, with little effort.</li>
    <li> BEST curling wand i have ever had! LOVE it and i would definitely buy another one!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT AND JUST USED IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This ended up working out alright but I thought it was one of the hot sticks that spun. I read over the specifications when I bought it but it wasn&#x27;t readily apparent that it was stationary. If I had to do it over, I would ask the seller more questions. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it did end up serving its purpose. I bought it just for my bangs - to side sweep them. It works pretty well even without the spinning (though it might work faster with).</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my tween so she could get the hang of feeding small amounts of hair into a curler. This is great for short to medium hair lengths. I have long hair and it takes a long long time to do my hair with it but it does a fine job of polishing my pony.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like, but it does okay. I don&#x27;t curl my hair often, so when it do, it does the job.  It just might take a little longer than I would like.</li>
    <li> I like Conair products.  this is a good curler but will work better when my hair is a bit longer... i should have probably purchased a smaller diameter&lt;br /&gt;at this point... there is absolutely nothing wrong with this curler and i do like it...</li>
    <li> Bought through husband&#x27;s account. Love this for my shoulder length hair. It is great if your hair has hairspray or product from the day before and needs a touch up. It comes out much better than a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Great product. Timely service.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this to replace an identical unit that had quit working. She really likes it, so much that she bought a second unit for her sister!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product but not for short bobs!  It heats very fast and well..easy to use but definitely not for short styles.</li>
    <li> I have short thick hair and this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This brush does not have bristles, but instead rather widely-spaced hard plastic &amp;#34;knobs&amp;#34; on the barrel. Because they are so widely spaced,(and not bristles) they are not able to grasp the hair tightly enough around the barrel which makes it difficult for styling.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because my other one (another brand) seems to be less hot these days. This is a pleasant surprise. Left my thinning fine hair bright, shiny and surprisingly bouncy. The only problem is the tip gets hot &amp; my fingers kept touching the hot metal -owwwwww! But I love the way it left my hair, so I&#x27;m keeping it. It&#x27;s nice to have bouncy shiny hair again. Looking forward to see how it handles hair affected by humidity.</li>
    <li> I have had this curling iron before, and when it finally wore out I had a hard time finding a replacement.  Nothing else I tried came close.  When I finally found this on Amazon I bought two so that when the first one finally wears out I won&#x27;t be left in the lurch!</li>
    <li> Got here in record time...the best brush I&#x27;ve ever found for my needs.  The quality is good.  Heats up fast..</li>
    <li> this was a replacement.  Love this brush.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it heats up so quickly and works so well as my other conair curling iron but I have short hair and this was too large for me. I&#x27;m keeping it because I am growing my hair out and I&#x27;m sure with another inch of hair it should work fine. It does grab some of my hair now and curls that nicely. I do love it. I had one years ago, over 20 years ago and always loved that one too. It&#x27;s a nice one to have in with your irons.</li>
    <li> I was looking at a hot brush that was advertised for $99 and investigated on Amazon and found this as the comparable product.  It is perfect!! I feel like I saved a fortune, my daughter loves it too.  Gotta get another one</li>
    <li> This hot brush should come with a warning label! I cannot figure out why everyone loves this hot brush so much.  I&#x27;ll be honest, I ordered it over others due to the great reviews and upon using it for the first time, I was disappointed.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all about technique of which I have none because I could only use this with good results on my ends.  Once I tried to go further up the shaft of my hair, it would immediately tangle and I&#x27;d have to be UBER CAREFUL to \\&quot;unroll\\&quot; my hair to avoid major tangles.  I used it sparingly on my ends and just left it in the drawer for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my teenage daughter found it on a day I wasn&#x27;t around and used it without my knowledge.  Without going into the gory details, her beautiful 25\\&quot; long hair had to be cut out of the brush after hours of trying every other remedy possible. BE AWARE!</li>
    <li> And have never seen it in any store. So glad Amazon carries it. It is an excellent hair tool. Thank you for carrying it</li>
    <li> Works well, no burning  fingers or neck like a curling iron. Gives body without crimping hair. Very good value. Would recommend for just body or curling hair.</li>
    <li> It took me a couple try&#x27;s to figure it out (I&#x27;m AWFUL with hair) but it works great for adding volume and little twists to the ends of my hair! Heats up super fast and makes getting ready quick and easy</li>
    <li> This is totally confusing! I watched multiple videos and all i ended up doing was getting my hair stuck. Ouch! I have VERY thick hair and it didnt do anything to it. This was a waste of my money. Too confusing.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for. It was cheap but not a very good product.</li>
    <li> I guess it was my fault, so I gave it four stars. I didnt read correctly and thought this was the blow dryer version. I am not sure if it worked or not cause i never used it, I just returned it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking forever to find something to smooth my frizzy hair and give it some body. Usually, all the stuff that smooths it (flat iron, anti-frizz serums, oils, etc...), leaves it flat. This, however, did the trick amazingly! It is smooth, but has lots of body. I can straighten it by just brushing it with this, or leave it wavy or completely curly. This can pull off so many hairstyles. Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT ..I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR AND I LOVE THE WAY THIS HOT BRUSH GIVES WAVES AND SO EASY TO USEHAIR</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 5 months and, though I do not straighten my naturally curly (thick, coarse) hair often, this made easy work of it! I am African-American with natural (relaxer-free) long hair; mid-back length. It took over an hour in small sections, but WOW! My hair was sleek with curls and waves where I wanted them! I didn&#x27;t even use the highest heat setting! I also used this on my son&#x27;s 7&amp;#34; afro, which is VERY CURL RESISTANT when using flat irons, and it straightened HIS hair (I do this so I can trim his hair since he doesn&#x27;t trust barbers after a bad experience cutting his &amp;#34;bodacious fro&amp;#34; lol). I have lots of heated irons, but this did straighten AND curl my hair very well. Therefore, I have NO hesitation recommending this product!</li>
    <li> I know it is supposed to curl hair or smooth hair, but for me? Nada.  I saw a very expensive product on TV and this looked like a good cheap option, well, it was cheap, but on my medium thick long hair, I had no open than to grab the curling iron after trying to make this do something for a half hour.  fail.</li>
    <li> .... but I love it.  Right size barrel and the plastic prongs do not get caught up in my fine hair.  I cannot use the brushes with the brush like prongs.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, it works really well when you have the time to use it. It doesn&#x27;t really grasp the hair toward the ends so you have to repeat steps again and again which probably damages my hair more than I&#x27;d like. Overall I am happy I bought this brush but i wish it held on to the hair more toward the end which is where I want the curl the most.</li>
    <li> Love this hot brush curling iron.  The brush is made of plastic so it grabs your hair -not like the boar or natural bristle brushes.  Also, it heats up very quickly - you don&#x27;t have to wait longer than 2 minutes tops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this curling iron five stars.  It has numerous heat settings, heats up quickly and works well.  The only problem is that it does NOT work on my short hair.  I should have listened to another review who said the same thing.  It&#x27;s a great curling iron and deserves the five stars, the barrel is just too big for short hair.  I&#x27;m keeping it for when my hair grows back.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t grip my hair towards the end so without holding and wrapping my hair each time it&#x27;s a bit pointless. It&#x27;s good to smooth out quick after a blowdry but hard to get it to do much else.</li>
    <li> I love it.I like the fact that its good for all lengths of hair. I go from short to longer hair every summer and winter and it works for both. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have to get use to using it first</li>
    <li> Awesome product I love it with my little hair 5 STARS</li>
    <li> Not as hot as a flat iron, but it does help with curling your hair under, especially in the mornings when you&#x27;ve slept on your hair wrong.</li>
    <li> It heats quickly, I like the adjustable temperature settings. The handle is comfortable to hold. I think it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Because of a weakness that developed in one of my hands it was getting very hard for me to hold a hair dryer in one hand while I styled with a brush in the other hand. I never used one of these but it seemed that it might help me with my problem.  It did and does and I am veryD happy with it.  I can dry and style my hair mostly with one hand.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I had my eye on a similar curling brush on qvc that was much more expensive and I couldn&#x27;t see the difference.  Bought this one and it give my hair a nice flip on the ends and a lift ontop.  Very happy with this cheaper version.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling brush for the price.  If it had an auto shut-off feature, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, naturally curly hair, which is also processed with color and highlights. I just recently got my hair cut above my shoulders into a bob and wanted something that would straighten my hair easily. I have been washing my hair in the evenings (something I can NEVER do when styling my hair curly), letting it air dry and then using my original In Styler in the morning to straighten. I was originally just going to use this hot brush to add back in some big curls, but decided to try it out of the gate, without using the In Styler. I was more than pleased with the results! Not only was I able to straighten my hair very quickly, I was also able to add the curl at the ends, AND I didn&#x27;t end up with the short broken hairs sticking up on top of my head! I used a small shot of hairspray just in front, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t even have needed that, since my style has held up all day. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this tool. It works great and the price can&#x27;t be beat. If anything happens to it, it can easily be replaced. I would also recommend It&#x27;s a 10 Potion 10 Miracle Styling Potion. I can go 3-4 days without washing my hair with that stuff. The styling lotion combined with the hot brush.....AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> This is my second iron. First one lasted forever and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other. I love this iron!</li>
    <li> This  brush is ready to use soooo fast!  I had one years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find another.</li>
    <li> Love it - great price too!!!</li>
    <li> Bigger size than we thought, but works very well.  It does say big curl.......  Would opt for smaller one next time when I learn to read descriptions!</li>
    <li> My wife needed a new curling iron, could not find what she wanted at local department stores!  Discovered it was great quality for a third of the cost.</li>
    <li> gives great curl &amp; body to your hair,quick heating &amp; easy to use.highly recommended,very affordable and would work on almost anyone&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> Yes, I really like this hot brush...but would really like a 1&amp;#34; brush.&lt;br /&gt;Does Conair have a 1&amp;#34; hot brush?</li>
    <li> Its not not the best curling iron i ever used. But it&#x27;s okay considering the price. I also wish that it was a little smaller as well. after using the heat brush it gives my hair volume. I have thin hair and sometimes it can look too thin if i put too much heat on it.</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN PERFECTER</li>
    <li> I am delighted with this hot brush.  It saves me so much time!  I have unruly, wavy, curly hair.  Following the instructions, I used this hot brush on clean hair which had some product in it and was about 70 percent dry.  I met old friends today who told me my hair looked great, and although I enjoyed the compliment, I didn&#x27;t really need it because I could see what a great job this brush did. This works better than anything else I have ever tried.  I&#x27;m thrilled!  There is no worry about burning myself because the bristles don&#x27;t get hot.  There are 25 different heat settings; I used level 18 on my fairly coarse, curly hair.  i got soft, shiny, waves which is what I wanted.  I&#x27;m clumsy with hair tools, but i found this very comfortable and easy to use.  I don&#x27;t want stick straight hair, and curling irons have burned me so this is perfect.  It didn&#x27;t tangle in my hair.  I am extremely happy with this tool and recommend it to everyone who has been frustrated with other tools in the past.  With this curling brush I don&#x27;t have to put tension on my hair or damaging heat to achieve a lovely style.  All pros and no cons.  Highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great product esp for fine, straight hair. Simply use some hairspray on clean hair for &#x27;grab&#x27;. I have loved three, maybe four, of these Conair curlers over a period of about 30 years, using it day in and day out. DURABLE!</li>
    <li> Have had this a while and it works perfectly, nery easy to handle and leaves a smppth finish on the hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this little hot brush. So easy to use, makes my hair so pretty. Perfect size, made well, doesn&#x27;t burn your hair. Having the combs on it helps to capture the hair to make a beautiful curl or feather look.</li>
    <li> Instead of curling or waving the hair, it straightened it. I don&#x27;t like it. A smaller size would probably do a better job.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my friend in the UK, as it has a dual voltage which is inherent to the brush and not a switch over - the switches hardly ever work&lt;br /&gt;She liked it so much that I bought another one for myself.  It is just the right barrel size, has temperature control and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I could have done with a travel size as well - sadly, not available.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the same brand that finally died after years of use.  Good product. I have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product.  It is easy to use, gives nice shaping to straight hair, good for overall styling.  Since it does not bend or fold, it is a heavier and more bulky appliance for packing in an overnight bag or small suitcase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay and the size of the barrel does make looser, softer waves.  I just don&#x27;t see much difference between using this and a regular curling iron as far as results go.</li>
    <li> Brilliant! So easy and works fantastic for my very curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry !&lt;br /&gt;Get it now!</li>
    <li> Would recommend this for hair 6-8 in. long for body and some curl.  Like the fast heat up and controls.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up super fast. I had one of these about 10 years ago and was very happy to see they still make them, just be careful using it you can burn your fingers easily.</li>
    <li> The product is okay. It works for what I need it for. I don&#x27;t use it everyday as it is to big right now for the length of my hair, but will be used more as my hair gets longer.</li>
    <li> Nice curling iron. Gets super hot so be careful. Like that you can adjust the heat settings. Easy to use and nice curls.</li>
    <li> I like the larger brush width, on/off switch, and variable heat settings. Nice grip too. Also at a great price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how I made it without this product!  I have long, thick, African American textured hair, and this 1 1/4 inch barrel is the perfect size for me.  The spikes actually control the risks of touching the hot barrel with your fingers/hands, plus, it assists in evenly smoothing the hair around the barrel when using it.  All buttons and dials are ergonomically placed without getting in your way.  Heats up hot, like any high quality curling iron does.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is the second Conair Hot Stick I have purchased and both stopped working after a month. My second purchase was May 11, 2016 and I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t get a refund? It hasn&#x27;t been 60 days. I will not order from Amazon again if this is how I will be treated. I have been screwed twice now....</li>
    <li> No need to go to the hair salon anymore! I get my curls the way I want them!  The brush heats up really quickly and is very easy to use. I recommended it to my sister and she is very happy with it as well!</li>
    <li> I acutally saw all of the other reviews that said this was good for straightening hair. My daugher has long, thick hair. This got very tangled in it. It did not straighten hair at all. Both she and I have very thick, long, course hair. It may work very well on fine, thin hair. Not a fit for her. Just sitting in the closet taking up space now.</li>
    <li> I found this brush awkward to hold and I didn&#x27;t think it got hot enough to really style very well. I would take hours to style my hair (very thick and curly) with this tool. I think a high-powered hairdryer and a regular brush are much more effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and product. I like to auto off feature too. Would recommend it to anyone who needs a curling iron. The auto sensing dual voltage is good for travelers too.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this same product many times over in the past 10 years. This is the best hair product for smooothing and adding sleeknesss, shine and body to my very straight hair....easy to use. This product is a mainstay in my bathroom! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always used a hot air brush which takes a while with my hair.  I would actually blow dry my hair almost dry with a blow dryer then use the hot air brush to finish the style.  This took a  long time.  With the Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush, I blow dry my hair completely and finish with the Hot Brush.  This not only is faster but my hair is smoother and silker than ever before.  I should also mention that I have colored and hi-lighted hair so you can imagine how easily my hair can be damaged, but it now looks healthier than ever before.  I suppose not so much hot hair drying it out.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Plus I&#x27;ve burned myself several times.  I didn&#x27;t read thoroughly enough and thought I was buying a blow-dry type tool.  I should have returned it, but I needed something and don&#x27;t see anything I like this barrel size.  I&#x27;d like to see a brush bristle tool (boars hair) with the plastic &amp;#34;teeth&#x27; interspersed to add strength and hair-holding power in a blow-dryer wand type tool this size.  Would anyone else?</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and Conair always does the job!  Now I can have two curling brushes...one for travel and one  or home!!</li>
    <li> I chose this curling iron because is it the only one I could find of this size and style.  It works great but my complaint is that I purchased in August of 2013.  It is May of 2014 and it just quit working.  Not good when you are rushing around trying to get to work on time and have crazy out of control hair!  Since I can&#x27;t find another model like this one, I have ordered another one :-(  However for the price I guess it&#x27;s not too bad. I was thinking of ordering a spare just to avoid another morning panic!  I wish there was another brand that would be comperable to this that was better quality and worked as well.  This one definitely has a short life span.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this brush that&#x27;s  why I order this second one for travel cause it has multiple voltage</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. Wouldn&#x27;t straighten or curl my hair. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Liked this at first, but after using it 2-3 times a week, it quit working after 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed...</li>
    <li> I bought this instead of the Perfector.  Much cheaper and does practically the same thing.  I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Great for big wavy curls</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, curls stay.  Product was described accurately.  Several heat settings to choose from.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this works great on it.  Smooths it out without burning the ends.</li>
    <li> This curling iron lived up to and beyond my expectations.  Gets very hot, even on medium setting.  Perfect size for just about all lengths of hair.  I wish I had ordered 2.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding a styling hot brush with a brush diameter over 1 inch.  I finally found this one on Amazon and I have really enjoyed using it for about 2 years!! Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as expected</li>
    <li> This hot brush works great to straighten or curl hair.  Heats up fast, light weight, great results.  One of the best products I have purchased for my hair.</li>
    <li> i like to look natural .......my hair is slightly curvey and wavey i get tight curels when i woke up in the morning i tried hair straightners  but i didn&#x27;t like the way my hair looked , i am a busy mom i wanted something easy n fast these works amazing its heats up fast and super easy to use .</li>
    <li> I bought this hot brush after trying a shorter A-line bob hairstyle.  I&#x27;ve used a larger Hot Tools hot air brush for years and love it.  This Conair Hot Brush  was the only 1 1/4&amp;#34; I found, that sounded like a decent quality product.  I like that it heats up quickly and has auto shut-off, but the temperature control is in an awkward location on the handle.  I keep accidentally rolling the dial to a different temp when I pick it up.  I&#x27;ll keep it, but am not sure that it will ever be a favorite styling tool.</li>
    <li> This takes a bit of getting used to as it&#x27;s different from a hot air brush but worth it.  Using small sections of hair is critical to avoid tangling.  Produces wonderful soft looks.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use.  It heats up quickly and makes my hair bouncy and stylish.  I bought a second one for travel.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to get volume, smooth kinks out of my hair and curl the ends. It&#x27;s super fast and easy to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This does everything I want. Large barrel can be used to straighten, flip or curl my shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast and hot.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT buy the Helen of Troy it is rubbish</li>
    <li> This is just as represented.  It is an excellent buy for the price. It curls well at&lt;br /&gt;the scalp to give lift--I just wish it got hotter(personal preference nothing wrong with brush)</li>
    <li> where has this been my whole life?!??!?!?! I have thick, crazy, frizzy hair and this hot brush does wonders on my hair!! I saw a as seen on tv ad for a different brand of these, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on another styler that doesn&#x27;t work on my hair..... so I got this Conair one based on reviews, I&#x27;m so happy I did!!!! amazing!!!</li>
    <li> do my hair every day and tis thing has been nothing but amazing. my hair looks great everytime i use it and always get compliments on my hair. thank you</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing since sliced bread...well no not really. I read so many rave reviews on this. When I first received it I was disappointed. I tried to curl my hair with it to no avail. I couldn&#x27;t understand why so many hyped reviews. I was going to return this but then I read it takes practice. I practiced and I learned I had been using it all wrong. Now I have gotten the hang of it and am only keeping my old clamp curling iron as back up in case something happens to this one. Really awesome..the reason for only 4 stars is because your hair can get tangled pretty easy and when it does, it&#x27;s not too pleasant. Also the cord is very short, can&#x27;t move to my normal \\&quot;getting ready\\&quot; spot, need to stay close to the outlet.</li>
    <li> I started to order the more expensive version from another website and glad I didn&#x27;t. I had a similar iron a long time ago and haven&#x27;t seen them since. Bottom line is I&#x27;m glad I bought this one and it works great!</li>
    <li> Not very easy to work with. I am sorry but I would not recommend it at this time. Never again</li>
    <li> This is the hot brush I was looking for ,I have been looking at the stores and unable to find it. It&#x27;s great for long layers.</li>
    <li> I have fairly long hair and most of the time it has a mind of its own. I needed something to help me style it in a short amount of time, and this product has proved to be very reliable. In about half an hour I can get my stubborn hair to look as if I had just visited a hair stylist. Very happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both hot air brushes and curling irons, and this beats them both.  I have very fine straight hair and this brush is perfect for me.  I had a problem with hot air brushes because the force of the air (even on low) would tend to blow my hair away from the brush.  And a curling iron would always leave a crimp, no matter how quickly a slid it down my hair.      This hot brush gives my hair curls/waves just where I want them and is fast and easy to use.  I just brush it through a section of hair until I reach the ends and then twist my wrist to curl my hair around the brush.  It only takes a few seconds to give me the nice wave I want.  Because there is nothing except the brush to hold the hair in place (which is good for me because it eliminates the crimp), I have to be careful not to burn my fingers as I tuck under the ends of my hair.  I&#x27;m actually thinking about getting a heat resistant glove to protect myself.    Another thing I like (which is kind of silly and more useful than I would have expected) is that the plug is a regular plug, not one of those surge protector boxy things.  This allows me to plug it into the top plug to heat up while my blow dryer is plugged into the bottom plug.  With my old curling iron, I would have to use two separate outlets.    In short, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.  This hot brush is reasonably priced and works great.</li>
    <li> I have had this hot brush for several months, used it 2 or 3 times @ week and have been very pleased with it. The instant hot feature is especially nice to have when I&#x27;m behind schedule. The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating is that it doesn&#x27;t have a stand -- although, this has not been a problem to date as the tines hold it up.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, doesn&#x27;t provide defined curls, but it gives hair a beautiful wave or flipped ends.</li>
    <li> Escellent size for the top and sides of my hair.  Heats up quickly.  Love Conair!!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, easy to use- a favorite hair tool!</li>
    <li> Did not work for my coarse, thick, curly hair at all. Don&#x27;t get this if you have that hair type.</li>
    <li> Amazing! At first I was very aprehensive about my purchase due to a traumatic experience with a round brush that had a lasting impression on me.  This actually works to create volume that lasts. I have fine shoulder length hair that is usually flat by the time I get to work. Not anymore! Love this product.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the electric curling brush.  Shipment was also quick.  Happy with everything.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl - doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Pretty much have no use for this.</li>
    <li> Great! works so well and makes my hair soft and less rigid than straightening iron</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! I have fine, thin hair and this is finally conquering all my probles with keeping a hairstyle looking perfect. It easily grabs my hair no matter how small the area I need to curl is. The curls add huge amounts of body and thickness to my hair and lasts all day and evening. I have curled right up to my scalp, around my neck, and face, and never once has it burned me. The bristles poke out enough to protect your skin yet can easily grab and hold on to your hair. Also important to note is there is no clamp to dent and mark your hair. Very important for those of us who have fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I mostly love is this is essentially a curling iron with bristles. So there is no noise, fan, or air movement to interfere while you work your magic. It is the most unique and ingenious hair product I have ever owned and I can&#x27;t be without it ever again!</li>
    <li> A purchase for me.  This style isn&#x27;t easy to find anymore with all the variety flat irons etc. that are out there and this is something I was looking for, a great product at a great price!  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> works well and is gentler on my hair than the traditional curling iron,  heats up quickly and no burns in my scalp,  seems that the curl does fall out faster, so it does not last all day, still pretty good</li>
    <li> My hair is quite short and brush gives it some volume so I do not look bald headed and it is so easy to use and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> This is a good size for longer, chin length hair.  It adds nice waves without stiff curls. I dry sections and then use this to add waves to each dried section.</li>
    <li> After seeing an infomercial for The Perfecter and was going to buy it for close to $100.  Then luckily my daughter called &amp; told me to read the reviews and I started looking at other hot brushes.  I blow dry my hair to just damp then finish with the Conair.  The bristles don&#x27;t burn my fingers and I can put it close to my scalp to get lift with no burn worries.  Love the product and price + there is a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> Love it, it gives me the shine I need without burning off hair. I use It with Tressemme Heat protectant spray!</li>
    <li> I could not use this product as it is made for the American market and not compatible to use in Aus power points.</li>
    <li> The shipment on this item was very fast.  I love the size of the barrel, the ease of operation.  It is great for longer hair.</li>
    <li> This has been the best curling brush that I have ever purchased.  I recently purchased the Helen of Troy 2&amp;#34; curling brush that only lasted 6 months and didn&#x27;t heat up as hot.  This brush is by far, the best.  It heats up very quickly, cord doesn&#x27;t kink up and leaves your hair with soft wavy curls.  Well worth the money and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this brush.</li>
    <li> So easy to use! Just pull slowly through your hair for smoothing and a bit of a flip at the bottom.</li>
    <li> loved it... i thought i had all hair curl options... but this is new to me... best ever... hotter then the spinning irons i used in the past... and the comb is much better then the brush on the spinning options,... hotter then the hot air blowers that i have had in the past... i can have very frizzy hair... i was able to just comb it through and it flattened faster and better then the flat iron that i also have... i like the adjustment of the heat... the quick heat... and the turbo heat... i just ordered the smaller size to complete the set... love this...</li>
    <li> Great product but a little too large for my needs. My fault that I didn&#x27;t realize the size. have replaced it with a smaller one, but will use this on certain occassions.</li>
    <li> Returned it because it wasn&#x27;t the right diameter.</li>
    <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack. Please dont trust Conair.</li>
    <li> Product is as shown, and works well. I&#x27;d have liked a better description on the difference between hot brushes and curling irons, but otherwise fine.</li>
    <li> I thought I was happy with another hot brush. THEN I purchased this one because it was dual voltage and I was traveling in Europe. This is really the best one ever! It heats up fast. It takes a bit longer than 60 seconds for the higher heat settings, but is way faster than any others I have . It gets hotter than other brush irons - but doesn&#x27;t burn my hair - just curls better.  I thought this would be a dual voltage substitute for my regular iron just while traveling - but I love this and am ordering another  one now because anything I like this much is bound to be discontinued soon!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> I have a thick straight hair. I was hoping this would work and give me some volume. Failed horribly. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair.</li>
    <li> great for 10 year old</li>
    <li> The brush is still a bit too large for my short hair. I was wishing it would have been a little smaller. But it works really great.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a curling brush for years!  It works just a perfect as I remember!</li>
    <li> For some reason this size curling iron with comb like teeth is hard to find in stores -- heats up fast, nice long cord, multi settings, happy to find it at Amazon.   Great, fast service and just what I wanted.  Thank you,</li>
    <li> Did not work for my thick hair.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect curling iron (brush).  The teeth grip my fine hair, and curl it perfectly. I had the one which is smaller in diameter, but since my hair is getting longer, the larger one is great and it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair. I searched the stores for one this size, and couldn&#x27;t find one. I was so happy to buy this one through Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d get when I ordered this curling brush online. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a quality product. I purchased the 1.25 inch brush (the larger of the two) becaue I was more interested in using it to straighten my rather wavy hair. But I also wanted the option to use it for curls. It heats up quickly too.</li>
    <li> Love this brush as it&#x27;s very quick for fixing my hair in the a.m. before work!</li>
    <li> Great product.  In addition to turning ends of hair under, also straightens unwanted waves by pulling it straight throungh the hair.  Gently turns hair under versus \\&quot;bending\\&quot; the hair.</li>
    <li> The barrel is too large and cumbersome for those with fine long hair :( Had to return it for this reason. The unit itself looks and feels cheap as well. However, I bought the 3/4 inch one as I thought the size worked better for my long and fine hair.</li>
    <li> I like this hot brush alot but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot as I would like it to. It gets out very minor kinks in my hair after a night of sleeping, but doesn&#x27;t do wonders like I thought it would. It&#x27;s very useful, but I&#x27;m slightly disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday to get ready for work.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find instrument that performs well.  Good heat on high.  Manages hair well.  Easy to work with.  New products are out there that &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; your hair, many based on hot air, but the curling &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; brush is still a great alternative and a proven technology.  On occasion, you&#x27;ll have to clean it with a solvent based product, but that goes with all hair accessories.  When it comes to cleaning, it&#x27;s easy to maintain - one Phillips screw head and the bristles are off... The 1-1/4&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for large and smooth waves, but small enough to work into shorter hair, too.  I hope the product engineers build on this design, add higher heat settings, and better housing; but, for the current price and design, I still love this tool.</li>
    <li> I receive this brush but this is not working. I plug in but smell is like something burning and brush is not hot at all.  I don&#x27;t know what should I do now. I don&#x27;t want to contact seller or amazon because they take very long process for return or refund. Recently I have very bad experience from other seller and amazon don&#x27;t solve my problem. So, this brush is going to garbage.</li>
    <li> All the expensive normal curlers I buy my wife and this is the only one she uses because of the comb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been into hair styling products, but I really needed help with my longish, layered, curly-like, hair. I wake up in the morning looking like Rod Stewart and it would take soooooooo long to try to look decent. Or I&#x27;d just have to put it up. Now it takes me under 10min. and the curls are so pretty. Very full and looks like I&#x27;ve worked on my hair all morning.It&#x27;s fun to use too. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. It was like magic... although I don&#x27;t use that many tools so I&#x27;m no expert, but I love this one. It heats up quickly, the cord is long, there are a lot of settings, and it just works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think would work a little better on thicker hair given that it is a bigger barrel and the fact that it needs to have something to grip onto. Shorter, thinner hair may be more of a challenge. What&#x27;s also a huge perk is that the large cap at the top is easy to hold onto meaning you&#x27;re not burning your hands all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a product of this type you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I like it a lot, if you couldn&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> THE BEST THAN OTHER BRAND.VERY GOOD QUALITY HEAT FAST DO NOT BURN AT ALL.THANKS FOR THE QUALITY AND PRICE CONAIR.</li>
    <li> This gave me the best results!  Heated up very quickly. I even bought one for my stepdaughter.  My one and only complaint, which is why I gave it a 3 out of 5, There was a short or something.  Many times I could not get it to come on. I would have to keep pushing the button to finally get it to respond.  On a few occasions, I had to give up because it would not come on. I may have just gotten a lemon.</li>
    <li> My old one broke, I. got a new one very quickly. This is the greatest for quick touchups, I have long curly hair..</li>
    <li> I like this type of curling iron alot. This one is just a little to large for me. My hair is fine and it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very long. I would highly recommend this to ladies with thick long hair. It would work beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is my third hot brush.  This one will stay in my travel bag.  Heats fast and turns off automatically (a great safety feature).  I paint clear nail polish over the numbers because they wear away over time.  Don&#x27;t roll long hair too close to the skull or you may have difficulty unrolling.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a large diameter brush curling iron - and that is definitely what it is. it actually ended up too wide/big for what I wanted. It will make very large waves/curls.</li>
    <li> This heats up very fast. I could use another one with a different diameter since this one isn&#x27;t interchangeable but I am very happy with it. It gets very hot.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it even put a curl in my curly hair!</li>
    <li> Works fine, but no stand to rest hot unit on for safety. This is a real disadvantage when traveling because you have to fine a plate or other non- flammable surface to rest it on until it cools.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Quick nice culrs</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. I&#x27;m letting my hair grow and needed a bigger brush type iron and this one is perfect. Awesome price too.</li>
    <li> Curls my hair fast and good dialing for heat.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and ordered. Heats up fast when I need it and shuts off automaticly.  Will keep it.</li>
    <li> I like the curling brush because it keeps the hot iron off your scalp.  It does a good job of curling your hair without burning.</li>
    <li> This brush is great!  It&#x27;s exactly as described.  Heats up fast, has multiple heat settings, and a great swivel cord with e regular polarized plug (not one of those big, awkward plugs).</li>
    <li> This curling brush is much better then my old one.  It heats up very fast and curled my hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!  Would buy and probably will buy another one to have when this one dies.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I have been searching in stores for.  Dont know why you can only order these online.  Love the auto shutoff function, and its so easy to use to add body to my fine hair.  I dont want alot of curl, so its perfect for me!  Received iron in a very short time!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this hot brush for over ten years. I had been using the 1&amp;#34; and after it stopped working I decided to buy the 1 1/4&amp;#34; and enjoy it tremendously.</li>
    <li> I have used this particular curling brush for over 10 years. If they discontinue it I&#x27;ll be fit to be tied. It heats quickly and has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; feature if you need more heat than it provides. For someone like me who doesn&#x27;t want to fry her hair, this curling brush provides just enough heat. AND, the most important thing is it gives natural curls - nothing a regular curling iron could ever do, plus it&#x27;s much safer to use than a curling iron. I never let my hairdresser come near me with a curling iron. One burn on the neck is enough to last a lifetime. Buy this product. You&#x27;ll love it. Just keep in mind that it&#x27;s a hot brush, not a hot AIR brush. Big difference.</li>
    <li> It is my fault as I didn&#x27;t realize 1 1/4 inch was too large, so I gave it to my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;I also was disappointed that it did not blow hot air like my old one did....</li>
    <li> Curling is good, leaves no lines on my long straight hair. I pull it though to get rid of the frizz and  turn the ends under the last three inches or so. I can create waves or a tighter curl if I want to. Only drawback is the cord is too short.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever had! It heats fast plus has a boost button for additional temporary higher heat. The longer tip eliminates burnt fingers too.</li>
    <li> This purchase has saved my hair. I was using a curling brush with hot air  to get a little curl and it was really drying out my hair. Since I have made the switch, my hair has a lot more body and no more frizzy dry ends. I will either let my hair air dry or use a blow dryer and then use the Heat Big Curl. What a difference.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed.  I have thick hair but it just would not hold my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t hold my hand against it to keep it in place without getting burned.</li>
    <li> works as advertised. Not so great with my very thick hair.</li>
    <li> Works OK. I have very fine hair, this would work best on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchases.</li>
    <li> I have fine chin length layered bob and this works awesome. Adds body and style without making tight curls like the smaller barrel does. I love it and am ordering another to keep in stock.</li>
    <li> Using this helps to smooth my hair so that It&#x27;s not so frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair and I thought this would be good to use after airdrying. Its better after its dried with a blowdryer and does give a nice curl and bounce but I find it rips out more of my hair than a regular curling iron or straightener.</li>
    <li> This thing heats up beautifully, has adjustable heat, is built in such a way as to make it difficult to get burned, something that is greatly appreciated..  It behaves exactly as described and is perfect for its use.  Very nice.  I&#x27;d recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for years for a big barrel brush curling iron that was NOT a hot air styler. I have very fine hair, so no matter whether my hair is wet, dry, or just damp, all they ever do is blow my hair around. I finally thought to look in Amazon for one, and sure enough I found one!!! And so far it works perfect. It heats up almost instantly, and I like that it has so many heat settings. I read other reviews saying that they&#x27;ve had problems with hair catching at the beginning part of the barrel, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me. And even if it becomes an issue, I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m just happy I finally found this curling iron!</li>
    <li> This curling brush heats up fast and is big enough to curl my long hair.  I keep it on the medium setting because high can be too hot.  I like the fact that the on/off button is away from the handle; that way you don&#x27;t accidentally cut it off.  I highly recommend this if you like a brush as opposed to an iron, which I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> This has enough heat capability to give my medium-long hair any strength of curl that I want! It&#x27;s fast and easy. Looks like I (or a stylist) spent a lot of time on my hair but it only takes me a few minutes - wow!</li>
    <li> This is the best hot brush ever! Ease to use and pratical.Nice curls. I love it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model hot brush for at least 20 years and have never found another tool that is as good.  I have shoulder length wavy hair with great volume and texture, but will frizz if not done properly.  First I blow dry my hair with a brush and then use the Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush to quickly smooth and turn the ends under, still leaving my hair bouncy, not flat.  It is so much quicker than using a blow dryer and brush to do this.  It is also great for touch ups.  So inexpensive compared to what it does for my hair.  For years I looked for a replacement for my old Conair in retail stores and finally found it online.  I&#x27;m so attached to it that I bought two, afraid it will disappear again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this over a week now and I really like it.  I have long straight hair and I want to add a little curl/wave to the ends for some interest.  I can use a curling iron, but it takes longer and if I&#x27;m not careful I&#x27;ll send up with an ugly clamp mark.  Also I think the curling iron is more damaging.  With this I can just let it heat while I rough dry, smooth the top with a round brush and quickly run this through the ends to create a soft Kate-Middleton-style wave under.  The brush bristles keep it soft.  There is a lot of potential to get it caught in your hair, so don&#x27;t wind it all the way to the roots.  The best way is to twist your ends into it with some tension and then continually move hair around it by twisting it toward or away from your face.  You&#x27;ll need a few practice rounds, but now I need another one of these for my travel bag!</li>
    <li> This was my second choice to use to style my hair.  It does a good job on my shoulder length hair.  I believe that it would also work well on shorter hair.  It is easy to use and does not burn my fingers</li>
    <li> Hard bristles do not catch hair, so why do companies not understand this? Also, this is just a heated brush. It is NOT an air brush.</li>
    <li> I needed an iron I could make big sweeping motions backward to create the laying I wanted.  This iron is of good quality and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am revising my first review. I did not think it was dual voltage as there was no flip switch. Another reviewer told me it is dual voltage so I took it on a trip to Asia and it worked perfectly with a plug adapter!  I love the large barrel and it works great. I would buy another. Sorry if I previously mislead anyone looking for a dual voltage product</li>
    <li> I have very smooth and fine hair, usually shiny hair as well. This product is easy to use, however it makes my hair looks dry and frizzy after use.</li>
    <li> Good price, nice unit. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I have the .75\\&quot; version, which I bought as an alternative to my expensive salon-brand hair straightener. I like to style my hair so that I still have body and volume but eliminate the waves that show up if I don&#x27;t straighten my hair. This tool is perfect for that, as you can use it to brush the waves out and create pretty curl at the ends.  My model has 25 heat settings plus the turbo option. I have very thick hair, so I have to use it on the highest setting with the turbo to achieve my desired result, but it does work well!</li>
    <li> some posts were negative. I think it does a great job. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> So glad I made this purchase! I use it every day as it gives needed body to my fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Even I can get a nice curl with it!  Heats super fast and I don&#x27;t burn myself like with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron.  Heats up quickly.  Couldn&#x27;t find anything like this locally.  Will probably buy the 1 inch one also since my recent haircut</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Never heated up hot enough to do anything to my hair.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Conair makes great hair tool products and this is one of them.  This one has dual voltage so that is an added plus.  I prefer this to curling irons which I have never been able to master.. ;-)</li>
    <li> The only problem with the Hot Brush was the tip is so short that I often burn myself while holding onto it.  I have an old Conair Hot Brush that had a longer tip and had more brushes with little balls on the ends of the bristles.  They held the hair much better and I never burned my fingers.</li>
    <li> Plugged it in the first time and item did not heat up at all.  Too late to return.  Would give zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Enjoy working with this model and a 3/4 version.</li>
    <li> Worked great in Europe. Heats up fast. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> For years I have used the Helen of Troy 2 inch brush, because I didn&#x27;t want to go down in size.  After I broke the 4th one, I decided to give this smaller Conair version a try based on the reviews.  I love it.  It heats up very quickly.  Easy to use.  My hair is a about an inch longer that the bottom of my ears and this tool does a great job of catching even the shortest hairs.  It removes all of the frizzies from my hair, and leaves it shine and bouncy.  Wish I had tried it years ago.</li>
    <li> I ordered this heat brush thinking it was the right size.  It&#x27;s too big around for my wife&#x27;s hair, but it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> Okay, but I recommend getting a better hot brush. This does the job for the back part of my hair where it is short. I kept burning my neck and this helped.</li>
    <li> Works great. Curls hair nicely &amp; fast, without having to deal with the blowing hot air.</li>
    <li> Based on other ratings I thought this would be great for my hair but unfortunately it did absolutely nothing and I have decided to stick to the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT for people with fine hair.  The first time I used it, my hair got so tangled I thought I was going to have to cut it out.  Luckily my husband had the brilliant idea of using a dental tool to untangle in.  I promptly gave this to a friend who has very thick hair.  I haven&#x27;t gotten any angry phone calls for her yet, so I am assuming she had better luck with it than I did.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hot brush. I&#x27;d never used one before this but I do like the soft curls it gives and so quickly! It heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> waste of money didnt curl my hair but straighten it and burned my fingers. im gettting old fashion curling iron...</li>
    <li> this hot hair brush detangles my hair and gives beautiful curls.curls may vary ,just depends on how you work it.heating is perfect and love the grip too.</li>
    <li> This curler works very well.  Heats up fast as promised and works quickly to curl my hair.  My curls last most of the day, but my hair is fine and thin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, very easy to do my hairstyle in minutes!  Cannot find this size barrel brush in stores.</li>
    <li> Love it great hot stick that won&#x27;t burn your scalp unless you hold it to your head.</li>
    <li> Works great! My hair is medium length and this gives me great looking curls even on the lower settings. It does a good job of grabbing my hair and making smooth curls.</li>
    <li> get once a week wash and blowout&lt;br /&gt;midweek use dry shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and use round brush every other day&lt;br /&gt;compliments daily!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Heats up fast. worth the money.</li>
    <li> OMG, this tangles my hair so badly and I can not get my hair to curl. I have long hair and this does absolutely nothing for it.  Too bad I cut it out of the plastic and threw that away or else I would sent this right back.  There is no learning curve to a hot brush.  This just is horrible.  Tangles and pulls hair out. Not worth the money at all. Even if it was free, this wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  I just ordered it a little too large, but that&#x27;s ok,  I can make it do.</li>
    <li> i love that I don&#x27;t have to mess around with a scary hot clamp and the bristles do all the work! They hold the hair without that annoying clamp crimp. And the versatility of this thing is amazing - smoothing, curling, waving, root lifting, spiral-ing. I am in utter disbelief at how easy this to implement what I want in different areas of my hair. At the crown I want to lift my roots, the sides and back- I want spiral-y waves, the ends - a not too curly flip,  and my bangs - a big curl that frames my face! I am ecstatic I bumped into this at the drugstore and didn&#x27;t buy another curling iron!!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn thin fine hair like an iron does.</li>
    <li> I was unable to use it on my short hair.  I should of paid closer attention to the size of the curl</li>
    <li> Like the larger size with vinyl teeth that do not burn the head.</li>
    <li> This is old school [circa 1980&#x27;s] hair styling.  Dry hair with a regular hair dryer upside down ... section hair and curl each section with this styling tool then spray it with &amp;#34;natural hold&amp;#34; hairspray ... do this all over the head... shake at the roots....spray with hairspray again if you fancy...then you wind up with Texas style volume.  I love this thing.</li>
    <li> Have used this brand of hot brush for years, I can&#x27;t imagine setting my hair with a regular curling iron - I always burn myself when I try.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This thing heats up real quick,and replaces my curler and my flat iron. When I turn it on I brush straight down and my hair is straight and soft. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have thick dry short hair and I expected this product could smooth my hair a bit,like what they do with brush and hair dryer at hair saloon,&lt;br /&gt;but It doesn&#x27;t work for my hair at all...and it made my hair even kinda frizzy...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this beauty appliance. I bought this to replace one I had had for many years. It is easy for me to use and style my hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> This hot curling brush is fantastic!  It heats up quickly. I can curl my hair in less than 10 minutes and I have thick, straight, medium length hair to the middle of my neck. My hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck even when curling larger sections of hair. I would recommend this curling brush to all who have used others in the past.</li>
    <li> Finally found the perfect size I have been looking for with all the right bells and whistles.  A great unit.</li>
    <li> I GIVE THIS A 5 STAR RATING...WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> wish they came in bigger size like 1 1/2 inch helen of troy is the only one that sells them that big thou i love this brand heats up faster</li>
    <li> Probably a 1-1/2&amp;#34; barrel would work, too.  This 1-1/4&amp;#34; works fine for my chin-length hair cut in various lengths.  Great for touch ups in between washes and less chance of burning yourself because of the hard bristles that keep the iron off your skin.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to learn how to use this thing to get the results I wanted.  But once I did, it&#x27;s amazing.  I have long hair and have always had a hard time getting nice bouncy big wavy curls ( I hope that make sense).  I&#x27;ve seen tutorials where the girls would use a big curling iron and then brush out the curls and it would look amazing.  But when I do it, it looks awful.  But now with this hot curling brush I can finally achieve the look I&#x27;ve been trying so hard to create.  Bonus, it only takes me about 15 mins to do so.  The best thing about this brush is that the bristles stays cool so you can actually hold the barrel while you curl your hair.  So I have way better control with this brush then I do with a regular curling iron.  Lastly, be careful using this if you have long hair because it can get stuck in your hair very easily.  Just like what happens when you over wrap your hair in a round brush and can&#x27;t undo it... except this round brush is heated and it&#x27;s going to burn...yikes!</li>
    <li> I have long, thin hair and I have yet to find a hot brush that doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair and dry out my hair.  This heat brush is actually pretty good.  The price is excellent (one of the  cheapest currently on amazon) and I find that with a little practice with my twirling skills, I can fix my hair quickly and without tangles.  My hair is smooth, pretty and ready for the day in less than 10 minutes and I&#x27;m not worried about something happening to this the way I am with my super expensive flat iron.  It&#x27;s just a good product and I trust it to take care of my hair.</li>
    <li> The ordered hotbrush arrived sooner than I expected. I love to use it. In general, I am very pleased with your website and your performance. Cordially,  Helga</li>
    <li> this is not what I expected; thought it would blow air out through the wand but it just gets hot; works well but it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one leaves hair smooth and shinny easy to use</li>
    <li> I have tried, and bought, more hot brushes than I care to admit and none of them has worked for my hair until I found this one! I read all the glowing reviews before I made my purchase and they were not wrong. I have fine, blond hair, lots of it, and it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well at all. Normally, a mere hour or two after curling my hair, it would be spaghetti straight. This hot brush grabs the hair well, normally my hair will slip off the barrel, and you can chose the level of heat to suit your type of hair. With this hot brush It also miraculously holds the curl! The fact that it is a dual voltage clinched the deal as I travel extensively for a living. This hot brush deserves all of the 5 stars and more!</li>
    <li> works on medium and long hairs. excellent&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to touch the hot metal parts, and do more practise....</li>
    <li> Love this curling brush!  Heat adjustments, and barrel size are perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this hot brush.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months.  It heats up quickly and does a great job curling my hair which is on the fine side.  The curl holds with a fine mist of hair spray.  Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> love it i have short curly hair makes my hair look great</li>
    <li> Love it....It calms my frizzy, natural curly hair down.  The barrel heats up quickly and my hair is styled in no time.</li>
    <li> Works well on my thick, wavy med/long hair—nice soft waves and smoothing</li>
    <li> Missed being able to return this item by 4 weeks.  Literally had it for a bit over 2 months and it stopped heating.  Have to say it worked well for the time I had it but to only last 9 weeks?  The last Conair product I had lasted years.  Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure how I feel about this hot stick (1.25 inches). My hair still looks dry and I don&#x27;t get much more volume than using a hair straightener (I have long hair). I could see it working out better for people with shorter hair</li>
    <li> It did not do what it was supposed to do for my hair! I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought.  I really like the way it curls, but the last one I bought quit working in less than 2 years.  So this time I bought 2 hot sticks!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this also.</li>
    <li> I bought this only because the curling blow dryer I used to get was going to take too long to ship.  Guess what?  I like this better!  It heats up so fast and has a wide range of heat settings.  I can set it low enough to protect my hair and still get plenty of curl.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it as well as the previous one I had which had bristles on it.  But this one curls my hair okay.</li>
    <li> Hair gets stuck-me no likey.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. She had used the one I previously owned and asked me to get her one if I ever saw it again. She really liked the way her hair was bouncy and retained the curl throughout our evening out. She has medium weight, chestnut brown hair with some wave. To avoid heat damaging your hair, I would suggest applying a moisturizing cream after shampooing and making sure your hair is dry before styling.</li>
    <li> It works good. A little  big in circumference but it  will do&lt;br /&gt; Have a problem  with another item l  ordered but never recieved.</li>
    <li> It heats so quickly and the heat is adjustable and I love it.</li>
    <li> Lasted only five weeks and it died, will not heat up. One week after return policy so I&#x27;m stuck!  UGH  the problem with buying on line.</li>
    <li> I love this curling brush, can be used to curl or slightly straighten wavy hair. This size is not available in stores only the smaller one I was able to find. Dual voltage another plus.</li>
    <li> I really liked it but I got the wrong size barrel....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Difficult to use.</li>
    <li> As a mother of a one year old, I am usually stuck with a ponytail due to lack of styling time.  With this brush, I can let my fine frizzy hair dry naturally.  Then, all it takes is 5 minutes to smooth out and curl my layers.  It&#x27;s even great for curling an unruly ponytail.  Bravo!</li>
    <li> Disappointed when this stopped working only about 3 months after buying it.  Otherwise, would have been happy with it.  NOTE:  the product clearly was marked 220/110 volt dual current, and when on a trip to Europe I used it on the lowest heat settings (even though there were no restrictions, I knew European current would make it hotter, so that was why I moved the dial to lowest setting when using abroad).  It died on me and I couldn&#x27;t find another there so had to spend about three weeks without being able to curl / style my hair.  Next time will try a different brand in hopes of finding something more reliable.</li>
    <li> Works well on my hair, just wish cord was longer, dropped it and broke a piece off. But it still works and i use it every chance i get. Don&#x27;t touch the tip you can burn your fingers quick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, just what I wanted  I&#x27;ve always liked Conair products!  It heats up quickly and shuts off automatically if you forget to shut it.  I like the different temperatures that you can set from warm to very hot.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awesome!  I&#x27;m sending for another on that is 1&amp;#34; in case I want my hair curlier sometime.  I had one like this a long time ago and it lasted what seems like forever.  However, when it did go out, I could not find one anywhere!  My hair is thick, but very fine and doesn&#x27;t curl right with conventional irons.  This one grabs the hair really good and give me so much more volume.  It is just what I needed!  GET IT if you have fine hair!</li>
    <li> I had mine for over 6 years now and I use it almost every day. I have coarse dry frizzy hair and this brush makes my hair look luscious, healthy, vibrant, stylish. I get compliments galore on my hair. It takes me 10-15 min to go from frizz to fab ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH EVERY PENNY! I paid about $50 for mine and if I had to, I would pay it all over again...</li>
    <li> I love the different heat levels and the heat burst. It allows me to have tight or loose curls or just make nice waves in my hair.</li>
    <li> As my hair grows longer, this larger width hot brush curls faster than my 3/4&amp;#34; one.  It heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> Love it. It is exactly what I was looking for. Would definitely recommend to others. As always the quality was excellent and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for...</li>
    <li> I had a curling iron with teeth (only way I know to describe it) about 30 years ago.  It disappeared somewhere along the way, and I have wished I could find another one for a few years now.  But I never found one in any store.  Then I came across this one on Amazon.  I love it.  It accomplishes the same thing as the old one, which is to smooth out my hair after I have blow-dried it without adding unwanted curl.  Of course, you can use it to curl your hair if that&#x27;s your pleasure.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! This hot brush has been an amazing time-saver for me. I have medium length, fine, wavy/curly hair that curls and straightens fairly easily but is prone to frizz. I got tired of the flat ironed look and smashing my hair between hot plates seemed to be damaging it. This hot brush helps me tame second-day hair into smooth waves or a blowout style and be out the door in no time flat. It gives lots of bounce and body. I style my hair with it similar to the way you would use a round brush and blow dryer for a blow out. Good for turning ends under and smoothing the top layer.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter has expressed no complaints. She uses it every day since Christmas. I know because I put it away every day for her. :)</li>
    <li> Best curling brush.  No problems.  Wish it were just a bit bigger, but still, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This hot brush worked great for about 6 months, then it worked intermittently, now it doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these but by far this is my favorite and a great price.</li>
    <li> Works great heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> This product got great reviews is why I bought it but, it won&#x27;t curl my hair! Rollers and a wand work just fine but this just doesn&#x27;t do anything and makes my hair look thin and flat.</li>
    <li> Had it 4 mos.  No longer heats up.  The buttons light up but unit doesn&#x27;t heat.  JUNK!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find curling brushes that are not hot air curling brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This one has multiple heat settings, so it&#x27;s easy to get the heat as cool or as hot as you need it.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect in everyway!</li>
    <li> I love these older style of electric hot brushes. They work very well for my thin, fine hair. This one heats up quickly and has multiple heat choices. I like that. So far it seems to be working very well.</li>
    <li> I definitely prefer the Conair hot &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; versus a traditional curling &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34;.  You can not only curl your hair with it; you also get the same effect of a curling iron.  It&#x27;s just a lot easier and faster to use.  I haven&#x27;t used my curling iron since purchasing the curling brush.  The variable heat and burst of heat features are like icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try over my straightening iron, as I hit 50 and my hair began to thin out.  Not quite what I had expected as the last one I owned years ago had bristles that were closer together so it grabbed the hair much better than this one.  And the cord on this is so flimsy and short!  I&#x27;m keeping it only because I haven&#x27;t been able to find one that was comparable to the old one.  Keep in mind that if you are using this where there is not a plug in close by, it will not work for you.</li>
    <li> It made my hair  too dry</li>
    <li> Good product,  heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn the scalp and not harsh on the hair.</li>
    <li> It makes me really sad im just now discovering this tool after trying pretty much every expensive curling and flat iron&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING and so easy.....natural looking results and im the laziest about doing my hair and this is just brushing it with a tiny bit of effort&lt;br /&gt;So happy I found and yet so sad I didn&#x27;t sooner. And for this price? I&#x27;m obsessed</li>
    <li> Best and easiest curling iron I have ever used, so quick and easy, hair is done in no time....best product I have bought in a long time. A very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, well past mid-back but not quite to my waist. So, the majority of you with shorter hair will likely have different results that I did. But, this brush immediately tangled for me. And my hair got so entwined and stuck in this brush it took about three minutes for me to untangle it and free myself from the brush. The bristles weren&#x27;t the main driver, it was the small seam between the plastic handle and plastic tip, and the metal body. Very surprising that these aren&#x27;t sealed better to prevent this. Once my hair got tangled in those gaps, it inevitably got tangled in the bristles too. Maybe I just got a bad one, but really can&#x27;t recommend this for those with long hair :(</li>
    <li> Snags hair. Hair looks dull. Never again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy Conair is selling this wonder again. This is my second  hot stick in this size, wich is very difficult to find in the market these days. The only detail I was not so happy was the quality of the plastic. It looks a bit lower than the other one I was using. Let&#x27;s see if it last as long as the other one,</li>
    <li> This hot brush fits my purpose to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;...it heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair, and love all the settings. Best brush EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonia</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for 10 years or more and am always sad when it &amp;#34;burns out&amp;#34;.  Since you can&#x27;t find them in retail stores (at least in my area), it is fabulous to find them on Amazon.  I ordered two and would have ordered more if I had the money because if they ever stop making these I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do - probably cry and cut off all of my hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this item for easy loose curl with body. The only problem is you have to be very careful that all your hair stays around the bristles on the  barrel otherwise it&#x27;ll get caught and tangled on the side of the barrel.</li>
    <li> This was my first hot brush purchase and I&#x27;m so very pleased with it!!  It&#x27;s exactly what i needed to give my fine hair volume and style..  So easy to use and it heats up very quickly!!  Loving it.</li>
    <li> I love the instant heat, great product. Got it fast, I think the price was fantastic. I ordered in two different sizes</li>
    <li> This item is so superior from my 7 year old curling brush and a great value for $17.99, and superior quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush heats up in seconds; plenty of different setting to choose from based on the type of hair you have and the biggest bonus an automatic shut off -- saves me from obsessing over potential of house fire while at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  I love it, I have been using it for years.  Will always have one on hand.</li>
    <li> As much as I enjoy this brush, the quality isn&#x27;t very good and the results aren&#x27;t very good. After some practice the brush gets easier to use however it did take me a few times to figure out how to work it.</li>
    <li> i already had one, but bought one for a girlfriend as well. These are fabulous if you have&lt;br /&gt;curl in your hair and wish to tame them a bit. Another helpful hint: use PRODUCT to fight&lt;br /&gt;frizzies/humidity...js</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  I purchased the 1&amp;1/4\\&quot; brush iron.  Instant heat is exactly what I got!  My last brush took about 1/2 hour to get fully hot but this little gem is awesome!  Been using for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t had one issue to complain about.  I love that I can adjust the temperature ever so slightly with the dial.  I was afraid the dial would be easily bumped out of its setting but it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.  Love that I can turn it on and 30 seconds later be using it.  Love that I don&#x27;t have to worry if I forgot to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy, I will be buying another one.  This one will eventually need to be replaced and I will be mad if I can&#x27;t find another.  That always seems to happen with my favorite things!  Not this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/25/14&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no change in how I feel about the curling brush. It&#x27;s still just as good as the day I bought it.  I&#x27;ve still had no issues and not one complaint!  I haven&#x27;t found a brush iron this good in many years. I am so glad I found it.  Thanks Amazon and Conair!</li>
    <li> Have had this item in the past. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great hair tool for the price!</li>
    <li> The iron is great except I should have ordered a smaller rod.  I don&#x27;t have long enough hair.  I have a smaller one and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! I can&#x27;t seem to get the technique for the flat iron to give my hair body and shine, but this works well, and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> my hair is very thick and it does curl well, however the rounded teeth doesnt grip and hold the hair as well as the helen of troy curl brushes.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and heats up to a good temp. I just don&#x27;t like that the bristles are so far apart that it&#x27;s hard for it to grab hair. I have coarse hair and my hair still slips right through. Maybe I am just new to using it and need more practice. Not really sure.</li>
    <li> I love this styling brush.  I have curly hair and I shampoo my hair every night.  I do absolutely nothing to it as far as styling goes, but in the mornings, I get up with frizzy, curly hair. I smooth and style  my hair with this brush in less than three minutes and my hair always looks amazing.  I just ordered another one to have on hand in the event the one I am currently using stops working.</li>
    <li> This product is not for people with thick course hair. I have shoulder length relaxed hair that is very thick and coarse. After I put the brush in a small piece of my hair. The brush was stuck, in order for me to get it out I had to unroll the brush and pull to get it out. If you have my hair texture you are better off using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find this.  Love using this</li>
    <li> Works terrific! Good size for large, bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling brush after seeing something similar on a TV infomercial (hey, don&#x27;t judge!). The very first time I used it, I wanted to jump up and down in the bathroom, tossing around my beautiful bouncy hair, and wave this &amp;#34;magic wand&amp;#34; in the air. It&#x27;s THAT awesome. I can quickly blow dry my hair for volume, &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; the curls in place while smoothing any frizzies, and done! It saves me at least 20-30min from my previous routine: drying, round-brushing, and still needing to fix a few unruly sections with a regular curling iron. I was totally amazed! Easy beautiful hair!  So why only 4 stars? It&#x27;s far too easy to go overboard with this brush. If you roll your hair up too tightly, the brush CAN and WILL get stuck in your hair. There are no words to describe the panic I experienced while trying to untangle the hot brush from my hair, only making it worse by yanking on it. Meanwhile, the smell of burning hair is about to set off the fire alarm, so in sheer desperation I ripped out a whole section of hair from my head, and had to cut out a few fried areas. I still love this styling tool, but definitely use with caution!</li>
    <li> This is my third one. Could not find this in stores, so this is my second purchase from Amazon. Love it. First two died, but after several years of use.</li>
    <li> Used this for years and love it.  The off and on switch goes out after a couple of years but since it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive it&#x27;s worth it.  Best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> it does the basics that I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger than I would like, since my hair is shorter, but it does the job!  Has several temperatures which is nice.</li>
    <li> Heats up within seconds, and works incredibly well on my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> What a great and simple hairstyling tool that gives volume, great waves and it so easy to use! I&#x27;m telling everyone about this amazing find!</li>
    <li> Beautiful just in time for my trip.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I wanted, too hot to hold onto to twirl your hair in to get the curl and bounce I was looking for. Arrived quick though!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, not worth buying.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought. Works pretty good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but it does burn my hair.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love.  I use to have one of these for years and loved it.  Saved my hair from bad heat damage.  Love that I have another one and I use it every day.  Thank you for the fast shipping and great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I had always used a curling iron prior to this purchase. I have long, straight hair and a curling iron often left a ridge where I had started. This brush does not leave a mark where I start. It gives a natural look to the ends of my hair versus an over-styled look like the curling iron sometimes did. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Instant heat hot brush, is worth every penny, that was spent on it. I have purchased this product before,it does everything, that it states. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Since I have super-fine, naturally blonde hair, I&#x27;m afraid of using most curling irons.  The new curling irons have ridiculously high heats that would totally fry my hair.  I saw this styler brush while surfing for an alternative to hot irons and thought it might do the job for me.  I was right!  I love this curling brush!  I took it on my cruise in April and it was all I needed to add the right amount of volume and soft body to my hair.  It heated up quickly and was ready for quick touch-ups as needed.  I was snorkeling, swimming, sunning, etc., and so styling my hair quickly before dinner each night was a breeze.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with short to mid-length fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love  that this is 1-1/4inch Barrel. Hard to find this size works great for longer hair.</li>
    <li> Whether you want curls or just straight hair this product works great! Heats up fast and the curls stay all day.mwell worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works just like as previous reviews. Heats up fast and leaves curls that last all day. I can finally put away my hairsetter. It also smooths out little bumps that you may get while sleeping to give you another day without shampooing.</li>
    <li> a small piece of hair at one time works the best!</li>
    <li> I have RA and recently had shoulder surgery, so I needed something I could use to style by hair with one hand, or let my young daughter help me with. It works well and is a great value for the price. The end stays cool so I don&#x27;t worry about my daughter burning herself, like I would with a curling iron. I only wish the bristles held the hair a little better. But hey, you can&#x27;t have it all. It still is something I&#x27;d recommend and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I love this hot brush, it is instant heat and dependable. This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve purchased and would purchase another.</li>
    <li> Love this very easy to use. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this product worked, however, i&#x27;ll let you know more after my trip overseas where this is all I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
    <li> The best Hot Brush ever! My first one lasted 5 years and my second one works just as well!</li>
    <li> Works very well and well made</li>
    <li> Was dissatisfied, did not last, stop working after a month/</li>
    <li> Worth the price and works great.  Awesome for days when I just let my hair air dry and then want some curl without the frizz.</li>
    <li> Curling brushes, especially this size are hard to come by.  I love the size.  It gives my hair body.  Flat irons tear my hair up!  They flatten it and dry it out horrible.  I have very fine hair.  I have purchased 2 now in the past 2 months, to stock up.</li>
    <li> This is a very good curling rod also drying your&lt;br /&gt; hair and styling at the same time.&lt;br /&gt; easy on your hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder lenghth slightly wavey hair. I love this curling brush because I can use it to smooth out my waves, create fullness and make large curls.  It is great for finishing my ends with a flip up or a curl under. I use it on days I don&#x27;t blow dry or to freshen up my hair at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I tend to burn myself on regular curling irons and the bristles keep the hot metal away from my skin.  I tried a few flat irons to try to get the same effect, but I felt I needed a third hand for my brush. I also thought that the hot irons we too hot and damaged my hair too much which left my hair brittle at the end and hard to style.&lt;br /&gt;I have a curling brush that uses hot air, but I find it works best on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried hot rollers to get the same effect, but the curling brush allows me to control the look of curl more than the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;These are so hard to find  so I brought two.  I travel for work and I am afraid I will loose it or break it and now that I have this curling brush, I don&#x27;t want to be without out it.</li>
    <li> This brush heats up quickly but doesn&#x27;t overheat. When you have very curly hair like I do, you just roll this through your hair to give it a &amp;#34;tamer&amp;#34; look. Quick, easy, great price, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have long hair, so this just got tangled and didn&#x27;t do much. So I gave it to my friend with shoulder length hair because I could see the potential. She has never been able to do her hair until now. She&#x27;s been talking about how she finally has good hair for a month now! It&#x27;s just a curing iron (with awesome heat settings) with combs coming out of it - simple but genius!</li>
    <li> Works perfect for slight wave or curl, not a tight curl.</li>
    <li> I usually just blow dry my hair, but sometimes I want a little extra something. I regular curling iron makes it WAAAAAY to curly. The brushes on this one gift me lift, not curls, where I need it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this brush anywhere. All the local stores only carried them with small brush sizes. This is just what I wantd at a great price.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for my hair, which is thick, medium length, wavy, and easy to curl. I personally don&#x27;t think it gets hot enough. I think the dial-a-heat feature is futile.  I returned it 2 days after I received it.</li>
    <li> This barrel is a lot bigger than I thought so would not recommend it for short hair therefore have not used it much.</li>
    <li> I have shorter, straight, fine hair and I can&#x27;t even get my hair to roll around the brush.  Even when I hold the hair in place (carefully since the iron is hot), I still can&#x27;t get it to curl.</li>
    <li> Curls last all day and I have thin hair. Best brush curler I have ever owned.  Gets really hot so be careful to not burn fingertips.</li>
    <li> Hot brush came yesterday in the mail. I was sooooo excited to use it, but... definitely NOT for people with fine hair. It didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all and my hair got tangled in the brush. It did work as a hair straightening though. Not really happy about the product :(</li>
    <li> I really like the heat settings from 1-20. I have very fine hair that burns easily with other curling irons. I set the temperature that I need, and my hair ends up looking great without any damage. I also appreciate that I can use it in both the USA and the EU with nothing more than an adapter.</li>
    <li> Works great. I have the smaller size. Love it.</li>
    <li> Finally was able to replace my old one that broke. This one is just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> easy to use, works well with fine hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these and they work great until they Don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Must be a glitch in the switch.  You get about 6 moths to a yr. out of this model.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really crul my hair.. I turned the heat on to 18..</li>
    <li> Did not do what I was expecting which was bouncing curls.  I did not grasp my hair and it was not hot enough to curl hair.  I told Amazon that I had opened it and they allowed me to return with not problem.  I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this product but... it gets a short in the cord where the cord meets the iron. This is not my first one but the only one I can find in that size.</li>
    <li> Works great and heats really up fast.  Reasonable price, not cheap, durable, I highly recommend.  Has short cord but bearable.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews, and have tried many curling irons over the years.  I already had  this iron in the 3/4&amp;#34; version, and my hair is very long, and winding it around that size iron got it caught, and I had to have my husband spent 15 minutes gentling pulling it off the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was delighted when I found the same iron in the larger barrel size. It heats up quickly and is easy to use since the black plastic prongs do not heat up, and the end stays cool too, allowing me to wrap my hair around it without burning myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls come out nice and loose, not the Shirley Temple look. It was exactly what I was looking for. Overall I have found Conair to be a good brand in hair care products, from flat irons to hair dryers.</li>
    <li> Just like the other one I have, GREAT !!!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Great service from seller.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I like this Hot brush; my only problem with it is that it is too large for my hair.  I would love it if I could find it in a one inch. It is very comfortable to use and there are no threats of burning yourself.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. It still works just like new.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27; t know why they call this a hot brush. I thought a hot brush blew air?&lt;br /&gt;Well, don&#x27;t expect this thing to. It&#x27;s just a curling iron basically.</li>
    <li> great curling iron.......gives just the right amount of curl</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast, especially with the turbo setting.  Works well, but you can barely see the light indicator.  I have to look very closely or turn off the light to make sure I turned it on!</li>
    <li> This works okay as far as a curling brush, but due to the number of rows of bristles in relation to the diameter of the barrel, there&#x27;s a lot of hot metal exposed resulting in burned fingers. In order to use this without injury, I ended up buying the &amp;#34;HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove&amp;#34; (also from Amazon). If not for that product, I would have had to return THIS product.</li>
    <li> I like it, it makes curling a bit easier but don&#x27;t over use as with any type of heat or you&#x27;ll get split ends ;)</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this instant heat hot brush.  There is no heat.  It does nothing for my fine straight hair.  Wish I had returned it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in stores for years.  They are easier on your hair than a curling iron and are much more forgiving in styling.  It is my favorite hair styling product.</li>
    <li> Blew out my electrical plug. I tried it on three different bathroom plugs and all stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;A GFCI is much more subtle. When you look at a normal 120-volt outlet in the United States, there are two vertical slots and then a round hole centered below them. The left slot is slightly larger than the right. The left slot is called &amp;#34;neutral,&amp;#34; the right slot is called &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; and the hole below them is called &amp;#34;ground.&amp;#34; If an appliance is working properly, all electricity that the appliance uses will flow from hot to neutral. A GFCI monitors the amount of current flowing from hot to neutral. If there is any imbalance, it trips the circuit. It is able to sense a mismatch as small as 4 or 5 milliamps, and it can react as quickly as one-thirtieth of a second.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This tells me the product came out of the box flawed. Maybe they have them made in China now, who knows? Anyway. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Helen of Troy curling brush and the teeth strips have broken out. Are replacements available .</li>
    <li> I could think of a way to improve the design but I do like it and glad I purchased it.  Conair, if you&#x27;re reading this... more bristles, slightly shorter and a little closer together :)</li>
    <li> This brush heats up super fast!  I am very pleased with the quality of it.  Does a very nice job!</li>
    <li> I loved the first one I had of this product...it lasted 7+ years.  When it stopped working I ordered two of them since they are hard to find.  I thought I would be good for another 14 years.  Disappointingly, they didn&#x27;t last a year.  The first one started to give me problems with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.  After about 6 six months I had to push it multiple times before it would start.  I put up with it for a couple more months and then it totally stopped working.  OK, so I had the second one which was my back-up.  I started using it and again, after about 6 months it too started giving me the same problem with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.  Quality rating of this product gets an &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; from me.  No more Conair products for me!</li>
    <li> Just the right size and gives me hair the curl I wanted.  Takes just a few minutes to get my hair done and I&#x27;m out the door!</li>
    <li> Its hard to find a curling iron like this anymore. This iron gets hot and does the job. I have hair that&#x27;s a little past my shoulder and I find it good to curl the ends or bangs. Cant roll my hair in it because it gets stuck but it&#x27;s great for that flip look. I like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a similar product for many years.  It got very hard to find and I could only find it online.  I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s catching on!  The bristles make it easy to grasp hair and add some curl or just smooth my hair.</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted and  just what I expected. It even came in a quick period of time.</li>
    <li> I have medium length baby fine, very straight, hair and find it difficult to get any volume....especially on top.  This item heats up quickly, the heat control is a good feature and the brush does not get stuck and twisted in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Fast heating, easy to use, perfect curl size. This is my third one (in 10 years) and the only kind I will use.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a substitute for a flatiron or a curling iron. I don&#x27;t get smooth frizz-less hair or pretty curls. For sixteen bucks it&#x27;s a quick way to get  rid of the weird bends and uneven crimps from going to sleep on wet hair or leaving it in a knot all day. Heat it up; pull it through. In a few quick steps my hair is at least presentable. I&#x27;m not good with hair tools - blow dryers, etc. I&#x27;m sure others with more dexterity, patience and determination can get fabulous results. I&#x27;m happy to be able to look acceptable with very little time and effort.</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t curl my hair really. It almost makes it frizzy or something.  Yes my hair gets tangled in it too.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know why, but not my favorite for sure. Maybe I should try the kind with the softer bristles. But this one, just isn&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;I love Conair usually, so maybe just a fluke ??</li>
    <li> Still experimenting with it.Not the best for fine hair but the wide range of heat settings help if i need to wind the hair around the barrel more evenly.Plastic/and or ceramic barrel would make it an even better product ,and a little bit longer teeth,which are getting harder to find in these type of products. I &#x27;m satisfied with the finished results from the hot brush,tho.You couldn&#x27;t get these dos with a drying comb/brush!</li>
    <li> this is such an incredible little styling tool and it does a wonderful job.  I&#x27;m not good with a curling iron but this does comparable results without the crimping and is much easier to use.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this iron in this size. It works just like it is suppose to. The one I had years ago did not have the turbo heat on it which is a nice addition to this one now. Iron was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this iron and prefer it to my Chi flat iron. I like to wear my hair both curly and straight and this gives my hair a nice bounce either way.</li>
    <li> I love all the heat settings.  With my stick straight and baby fine hair, I can usually curl with less heat. And it takes less time to give a little body to my hair than it did with regular curling iron. Wish I would have bought this years ago.</li>
    <li> Maybe this device is for someone with very thin or shorter hair.  I was looking for a tool that would give me that \\&quot;beachy wave\\&quot; look.  My curling iron is \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but I saw another version of this tool that created the look I really want for my thick long hair.  I thought for the price-let&#x27;s try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a toss-out. I&#x27;ll ship it to my mom, she has thin hair that is short-this may be a fine tool for her. It does have a good amount of variation with the heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I seriously don&#x27;t get all the rave reviews.  It&#x27;s a curling iron (without the clamp down piece) with comb teeth around it. Trust me-that&#x27;s all it is.  I&#x27;m starting to wonder about the validity of these Amazon reviews lately.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t burn myself anymore, like I used to do with my previous hair iron, and it does a good job with my frizzy hair. My hair gets tangled once in a while so I need to pay attention and care how I use it. But it is definitely worth the money. The ON light and the heat booster light are hard to discern when on and off, but other than that I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find an inexpensive one in the store, always used this type of curling iron growing up and love them. Curling iron works great, use it often.</li>
    <li> I had this curling iron for years.  The ring that adjusts the heat intensity broke so I bought another one.  The new one works great once I can get it turned on.  I have to push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button really hard and multiple times just to get it to turn on.  Sometimes I take my plastic comb and use that to push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button more firmly.  Other than this annoyance, I really like it and it&#x27;s a good price.  I need one for a second home so I am going to buy another and hope I don&#x27;t have the same problem!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I was looking for a hot brush that wouldn&#x27;t burn me or my hair.  I have medium wavy hair. Just set it on the recommended heat and follow instructions. With a little practice I was able to straighten my hair. Shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> Love this instant iron.  It&#x27;s easy on the hair with the variable temperature setting.  Heats up very quickly and is easy to use.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This unit heats up really quickly which is a huge plus. I have a shoulder length layered cut. This unit directs my hair vs curling it because of its size. I would buy it again; and may even get the smaller barrel for curling hair.</li>
    <li> It is just what I expected....</li>
    <li> I have very thick and frizzy hair. When the stylists blow dry my hair for 30 minutes it looks great bringing out the curls and looking smooth. I was never able to achieve the same effect with my regular round brush and dryer at home, instead my ends would be frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why I never tried this before, well I have tried a curling iron and I couldn&#x27;t get used to it. I took a chance on this because the price was very affordable and because I used a friends that was similar except it was a blow dryer rather than a hot iron. The iron is awesome! The bristles easily let me grip the hair and twirl the ends and get really nice curls. I also use it all over because it does detangle and it also makes things smoother and takes a little of the dullness away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I don&#x27;t use it for is bangs because I like those straight, the iron justs curl them. Also it doesn&#x27;t work on wet hair. Has to be dry either after your blow-dry or just the next day if you don&#x27;t want to wash and just touch it up it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no, I still can&#x27;t achieve the same look I get from a stylist, but it&#x27;s definitely way nicer than not using it and doesn&#x27;t cost so much, and quick to do.</li>
    <li> Meine Frau ist sehr zufrieden, dieses Teil ist in Germany leider nicht aufzutreiben. Vielen Dank.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous brush/curling iron.  I have very thick, wavy hair that does not like to do what I tell it.  This tool takes care of my problems.  Even an especially evil curl that breaks out in back.  So easy to use and hard to screw up.  Great in humid weather when my hair goes berserk.</li>
    <li> I have long fine curly hair. This curling iron pulls my hair out.  I think it would work ok with fine hair, if my hair were short.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last spring and used it for a few months before moving to a country with 220/240 power. It worked fine for me in the U.S. but didn&#x27;t last a week in my new location even though it was sold as a dual voltage appliance. I am about to purchase a replacement that I will use only with a transformer.</li>
    <li> I love this heat brush doesn&#x27;t use much heat to get my hair straight or to style it. Heats quite quickly.Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got it in no time, very good style tool</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!! heats up fast...curls fast!! I&#x27;ve purchase more expensive curlers and this one tops it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2012 and realized upon receipt that it was too big, but I kept it because hairstyles change.  My hair is longer now and I decided to try it.  It won&#x27;t work.  I can&#x27;t even get the thing to come on at all.  I have had it too long to return so I guess I&#x27;ll throw it away.</li>
    <li> Great while it lasted.  Too bad that was only for 18 months.  What more do you expect for $15 bucks though, I suppose.  I do hate that kind of obsolescence, because it is now a hunk of plastic I&#x27;m dumping into a landfill.  It is absurd that products are so cheaply made these days it forces us to generate a lot of excess waste.  All the same, I&#x27;ve become dependent on it to style my hair, so I&#x27;m ordering another one.  Maybe the new one will squeak by and last two years before it dies?</li>
    <li> Not for thick, fine hair. Just didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair or my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this Hot Brush for a while and was delighted to find it here at such a great price!  I purchased the 1 1/4 inch barrel and it is perfect for my medium length hair.  And as another post stated... it has a small plug which is great because I can plug my hair dryer in at the same time.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have had this same curling iron in a smaller diameter for over 5 years and wanted to try the larger barrel. Still think it is a great curling iron. Heats quickly and allows me to style my hair easily.</li>
    <li> I Love it! I brush my hair out with this in the morning and go from bed head to beautiful.</li>
    <li> The Instant Heat Hot Brush does what it name implies, it gets hot quickly. Easy to use and creates fabulous body and curl.</li>
    <li> Works well with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use - better than any hot brush i&#x27;ve had in past. Would have been willing to pay more - so great price too!</li>
    <li> Have used a Hot Stick by Conair for many years and have only had to replaced once.</li>
    <li> Had one previously and this one is hotter and seems to work better.&lt;br /&gt;Color me curly!</li>
    <li> fast delivery and just as described.  Great Product that is much cheaper than a flat iron!</li>
    <li> The problem is more me than the hot brush. I didn&#x27;t really know what I was looking for. My beautician suggested that I get a hot brush to dry my hair and curl it at the same time. This brush gets hot, but it doesn&#x27;t blow hot air. I ended up giving it to my daughter. (I later found the kind of brush I was looking for.)</li>
    <li> Perfect!!  My old curling iron would burn my neck.  This curling iron is wonderful!!  Highly recommend it!  Would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I use one of these at home every day, bought a second one for my travel kit. Price is very reasonable for this item. Heat is fully adjustable, heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could just run through my hair in the morning while dry.  I did not want to pay for the calista or T3 at over 100.00 dollars so this works fine for me.  I just spray heat spray and its fine</li>
    <li> Works great - but does really dry out your hair and probably damage it. Use when you really need it, or make sure to do a light water spray first. (Note: I have colored hair and am 56 - so it may damage hair like mine more than most)</li>
    <li> Conair is a good brand and I&#x27;ve used them for years.  This curling iron does exactly what I need it to do because I am totally retarded with a round brush + blow dryer.  It&#x27;s got a switch where you can make the heat variable but not sure what that&#x27;s about as I would always use the highest setting.  Only drawback is they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as I think they should.  I&#x27;ve probably been using this product for 20 years and I&#x27;m on my 3rd one now.  Maybe that&#x27;s normal with curling irons but seems to me like the minimal use they get means they should last longer.  C&#x27;est la vie!</li>
    <li> Have had several of these curling irons in the past, but have not been able to locate them for quite sometime.  Purchased five when I saw then online.  The brush does not tangle in long hair, but slides through it much like a hot iron would.  The brush does not leave kinks in your hair like a hot iron can, nor do you burn your fingers, face or neck as the nylon brush bristles prevent it from burning you.  Great product for curling or using in place of a hot iron.</li>
    <li> This is much better than the ones that blow air.  It is quicker and easier than curling irons and does a good job of smoothing my fine long hair while adding a little curl to the ends.  It hears up very quickly, too.  And the plug is small which is nice, too.</li>
    <li> I used my aunt&#x27;s perfecter hot brush and liked it, but did not want to pay $100. This works nearly the same, with the exception of the bristles; with the perfector the bristles are made of a material that &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34; the hair a bit more, which is better for my fine, straight, slippery hair. With the Conair hot brush the bristles are harder plastic and my hair slips through them more easily. Still, I am happy to make that small sacrifice for the difference in price, especially since I left this in a hotel room while traveling two weeks ago and immediately reordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my shoulder-length, fine, straight, lightly-layered hair look really full with gentle curves, and it looks less &amp;#34;styled&amp;#34; than with jumbo hot rollers. It&#x27;s also faster and easier. I use it on days I don&#x27;t shampoo and my hair looks great. The temperature is adjustable from warm to super hot. I take sections of hair and lightly mist with water (the water resets the hydrogen bonds and makes your style last longer - always mist lightly when hot rolling or curling for best results), then use the hot brush, wrapping hair around it from the roots out to the ends (it&#x27;s opposite of a regular curling iron). Try googling youtube videos if you have long hair and are new to hot brushes so you don&#x27;t get it tangled next to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Another reviewer mentioned that there is a joint between the handle and the hot part where hair gets caught, so she added a silicone (heat-resistant) hair band to fill that space. I followed her suggestion and my hair doesn&#x27;t snag in that joint.</li>
    <li> After three years of searching in store after store after store, I was ready to give up on finding a styling device like this one.  My old one broke; since then I have been unable to replace it until now.  It&#x27;s a great product and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I really like this hot brush. It smooths and shines like a flat iron while allowing me to create volume and a little bounce on the ends. I am not really a fan of how I look with the stick straight hair you get from a flat iron. I just let my wavy/frizzy hair air dry without any products in it, then when its dry I run this over the sections and It looks like I just stepped out of the salon. It&#x27;s also great for touching up second day hair with bed head. My only complaint is I wish that it came in a 2 inch diameter so that I could get really big loopy waves. It looks like Europe is more into this whole hot brush or brush iron thing as the amazon.uk site has a much larger selection - but it seems they don&#x27;t ship to the U.S. sadly.</li>
    <li> I own a steel curling iron, a cermaic curling iron, a flat-iron, hot rollers, and a bunch of other hair tools. When I bought this curling brush, I did not have particularly high hopes. But it has become the most important hair tool of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine, super curly hair that I blow-dry straight. Then I flat iron it, but this tends to make my hair too straight - it ends up appearing much thinner than it actually is. And I don&#x27;t like stick-straight hair because it reminds me of a Pokemon cartoon. I like straight hair with a flip or a soft curl on the end (like Kate Middleton).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I use this handy-dandy hot brush and I can achieve big soft curls at the ends of my hair, which gives my fine hair weight; without weight fine hair just floats around and doesn&#x27;t hang properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my bangs to give my hair some lift in the front. And if I&#x27;m in the mood, I can make ringlets with this by continuing to turn the handle, starting at the roots and pulling it downward slowly while still turning it, over and over again. There is alot you can do with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair can go from looking like crap to looking beautiful and glamorous because of this thing. It makes my hair look thick and bouncy, I love it, and I highly recommend it. One word of advice: do use a heat protector as it can dry the ends of your hair.</li>
    <li> Works for me,love it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use daily. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This iron is great. I use it every day. Has automatic off, which helps me not too worry whether I left it on or not. NO complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect hot styling brush! Gets hotter than any other I&#x27;ve tried. Bought 3 so I would never be with out, although they have never failed me...They last forever.</li>
    <li> It really does heat up faster than any other hot brush I&#x27;ve owned.  The cord is long and the bristles are sturdy, so they won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> My instant Hot Brush gets a workout every morning - Love the size for those big bouncy curls - Every girl needs one!</li>
    <li> I have frizzy shoulder length fine hair that I prefer to just smooth and lightly curl the ends under.  I just tousle my hair while blowing dry, then quickly run this brush through a few times to get rid of frizz and add a hint of curl.  So fast and easy.  Thanks Conair!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this hot curling brush, but it&#x27;s just pretty good.  True, I&#x27;m not burning myself, but I&#x27;m also not saving any time or getting smoother curls or waves.  And I don&#x27;t think it helps the condition of my hair.  I went back to my curling iron.</li>
    <li> You would think all curling brushes are the same, but I particularly like this one. I particularly love that you can change the heat settings. I have fine hair, so it does not take a lot of heat to style it, so I use it on a low to medium setting. I also like that it heats up REALLY fast. Also, the handle is not too fat for my little hands, and it is not heavy to use. The barrel is a good size for adding body/loose waves and smoothing hair. It makes hair styling v. quick and easy for me in the morning. Love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing purchase and would buy it again. You touch the bristles without getting burned and it is versatile.  Really affordable and functional.</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly. I use it every morning. Auto shut off is great. Wish it would get just a bit hotter.</li>
    <li> it worth the price.. a bit difficult to curl, maybe cuz I&#x27;m not used to it.&lt;br /&gt;and it makes hairs dry.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was suppose to give me fullness and was easy to handle.  Well it&#x27;s not that easy to work with, I burn my fingers when holding the end of it.  I will continue to work with it.</li>
    <li> I think this didn&#x27;t work for me because it was listed under the wrong category. It is not a blower.</li>
    <li> This has worked great for my &#x27;on the frizzy side&#x27; hair.  Smooths and straightens, heats up fast and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it kicking off too soon as long as you&#x27;re using it.  Wouldn&#x27;t have one without auto kick-off feature since I wouldn&#x27;t want to take a chance on leaving it on all day.</li>
    <li> This curling iron brush heats up quick, grabs the hair just right, and provides excellent bouncy curls. I like the safety shut off, the swivel cord, and the power heat section. The really cool thing is I do not think it burns my hair, no smoke or smell, unlike regular curling irons. I was able to curl my hair all over fast, and the curls seem to be holding up well. I especially like the larger barrel size for bigger curls.</li>
    <li> It was really cheap and it works absolutely great. Multiple heat levels , turbo heat .&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that the cord is a little bit too short, you have to plug in the brush on an outlet that is not too close to the groung</li>
    <li> Had one of these for years and mine died.  Bought this one and it&#x27;s exactly like my old one a does a great job.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This larger size is the best for larger bouncy curls, has plenty of heat surface between the teeth and never tangles. The Conair iron/brush feature is great for us carpal tunnel challenged gals. When my closely guarded old one finally gave up the ghost, i had given up on finding a new one. as stores only seem carry the smaller, too tight curl, sizes. Its instant on (like a minute or two to heat up) and auto turn off are great if you are doing your hair before your morning coffee has really kicked in.</li>
    <li> This product is simple,dependable and works great.  I purchased it for my Mother.  She liked it so well we purchased a second one for her to travel with. It is light weight and easy for seniors to operate.</li>
    <li> I found a much more expensive hot brush in a beauty store that I was interested in but I could not bring myself to purchase it because I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the concept once I put it to use. Glad I tried the cheaper one first. While I like the results that I get, it&#x27;s not enough of a wow factor to have spent more money on it. For me, it&#x27;s had a bit of a learning curve to using it, as most new hair gadgets do, but I have enjoyed being able to add a subtle curl to the ends of my layers to finish off my blowout.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;Instant Heat Hot Brush\\&quot; is an excellent tool for your hairstyling arsenal.  And believe what it says:  It is definately INSTANT HEAT!  It has an excellent range of heat temperatures that will suit any type of hair.  The barrel is 1 1/4\\&quot; and in my opinion, works on any length of hair.  It&#x27;s easy for me to style my \\&quot;growing out from a Victoria Beckam bob\\&quot; that has an&lt;br /&gt;array of lengths in the back and longer lengths on the sides.  The brush can be used as a&lt;br /&gt;straightening iron as well as a curling iron.  It works very well on my fine hair giving it&lt;br /&gt;much needed volume.  Yes, I said VOLUME!!!  Plus, the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; actually holds my hair during the process making it easy to use - plus it has an automatic shut off.  And did I mention - it works GREAT for bed head hair!  This hot brush is made by Conair so you know it&#x27;s a quality&lt;br /&gt;product.  I highly recommend this Instant Heat Hot Brush.</li>
    <li> If you have silky, well behaved hair this is the wand for you. If your hair is like mine, unruly curls and frizzy you might run into problems with the bristles constantly snarling and tangling  strands of hair that have to have emergency scissor service if you don&#x27;t want to walk around with this iron as a new hair accessory.  I condition and prep my hair for heating tools but will need to go with a bristle-less wand for my hair type.</li>
    <li> It is with good quality and gets heat quickly. But the cons is that it&#x27;s hard to handle it. Probably I need more practice. All in all, I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this and she is very happy with it. If your wife is happy with a purchase, what more needs to be said?</li>
    <li> old curling brush finally died.  Now i am glad it did!  This is Huge Improvement!  No longer one temp for all hair types which was always too hot.  This has dial to set temp for your hair type!  The brush part keeps the ends of hair flat to the iron so the ends also look terrific.  Heats quickly.  the brush is a terrific length.  This is very easy to handle.  I am now 60+ and hands starting to get arthritis ..  i recommend this to anyone with hands that are not as young as once were !!!  this is so much easier than curling iron  or curling wand.  would make a terrific gift for ALL ages.  Very Glad I purchased this.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Stressing out after a very bad, short hair style I bought this curling brush. I have used a smaller barrel curling brush for several years and always liked how my hair turned out. I love this big barrel one because it almost makes my hair look just blowed dried instead of styled with rollers or a traditional curling iron. It&#x27;s great because my hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled and the multiple heat settings are great so you don&#x27;t burn your hair. Thinking of ordering a spare because I can not find these curling brush in stores.</li>
    <li> Just how many temperature settings does one curling iron need?  This one heats up quickly and is easy to handle.  Also the cord swivels easily which is a problem in some other models.  I should have gotten the 1-inch diameter but am pleased with this model overall.</li>
    <li> nice addition to bow drying natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I read the reviews wrong or just did not know how to use it but this was a terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would comb my hair while heating it to result in nice fluffy waves or something of the sort, but it was impossible to do that. I tried this with my hair wet and dry and each time it would kind of just get stuck in the bristles. I couldn&#x27;t really twist it or comb it and I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I have ordered four of these hot sticks.  One as a gift and three for myself.  I leave one in my suitcase all the time.  I use one daily and the other one is stashed away just in case one stops working.  I have never learned to use a curling iron, I always burn myself.  No burns with the hot stick.</li>
    <li> Works great - gets very hot, but the little teeth keep the barrel away from scalp and ears. Temperature is adjustable.  The tip stays relatively cool so you can hold both ends while you curl your hair. The larger barrel makes large smooth curls.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Heats up quickly</li>
    <li> Curls my long hair in minutes fast.  Heats up fast too.</li>
    <li> This works so well, as well as the much more expensive ones! It tames fly aways, curls the hair, makes waves, whatever you want it to do. It has replaced my curling iron!</li>
    <li> This is a very good curling brush, but, I personally, wish that the bristles were not quite as long. The tend to become entangled when you try to remove it and straighten out the curls too much. Other than that, it&#x27;s fine. My hair is in a chin-length bob.</li>
    <li> Love is a strong word, but I do more than like it. I returned a much more expensive item to the beauty store because it had nylon bristles that I was afraid would pull my hair. This tool works perfectly for the reason I bought it - to smooth my bed head on mornings when I don&#x27;t wash my hair. I haven&#x27;t really tried to curl my hair with it - for that, I use an iron. But, it gets the weird bumps out and smooths the hair without making it stick straight the way a flat iron can.  Recommend. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have been having this curling iron for about 3 1/2 years and never had problems with it.  Still works well as it did when I first bought it.  I would recommend this to friends and I did!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, perfect for what needed. I wear wigs and am practicing restyling. I have a wig that was too curly, I used this curling brush to run it through and straighten it slightly. Worked great! You can always count on Conair products. Thank you Conair and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works great and useful for travelling</li>
    <li> I have very thin very straight hair. I can never get it to have some body no matter how I blow dry it or curl it or flat iron it. This did the trick. It heats up FAST and I can do my hair in mere minutes. The body stays all day long. I have a bob type hair cut and this just helps curl the ends under.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been flat ironing my hair for years and have been sick of the style lately. Straighteners are damaging, time consuming, and boring. I LOVE the look this tool creates and haven&#x27;t gotten this many hair compliments in years. Plus, it never takes more than 15 minutes to do my entire head in the morning, section by section (my hair is long). I purposefully waited a few months to review this product to make sure it didn&#x27;t poop out after a while, and it&#x27;s still going strong. Haven&#x27;t used a flat iron since! Body, curl, playful style... i mean, this thing is seriously my new best friend.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and gives waves to my thin flat hair. Good price and good product. You can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> The Instant Heat Hot Brush is exactly as it says, it heats instantly is easy to handle and simple to use.</li>
    <li> This sucks. Did not make waves or curls</li>
    <li> I had always used a curling iron. Then I went away for a week and forgot to bring mine so I had to use my sister&#x27;s hot brush. Couldn&#x27;t believe how much better I liked it than the iron. Easier to use and gives volumn to my hair. Love thisOrdered one for myself on Amazon as soon as I got home and the iron just sits in a closet now!</li>
    <li> This was bought as a companion to the 3/4&amp;#34; unit. They are both super and I very highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap.  The dial to change the temperature is barely clinging to the product itself.  Cannot believe this has such high reviews. VERY poor quality.</li>
    <li> This brush is good. I did not get tight curls, I have shoulder length hair so it gave me a nice curl to my hair and it has body after curling</li>
    <li> Never missed my old one and wondered why it took me so long to order!  I use the hot setting, as I have thick hair and it works well.</li>
    <li> I chopped all my hair off a few weeks ago, and this curling brush is perfect for styling. It heats up quickly and it easy to use. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that sometimes I get a few hairs trapped in the gap where the brush meets the body of the iron, where the buttons are. It kinda hurts when you&#x27;re just going along, turning the brush, and lose a few hairs. Other than that, I love it.</li>
    <li> great product, great service. thanks</li>
    <li> Does the same job as the $100 version.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  It heats up in seconds yet its gentle to hair, it gives it shine and smooths the follicles, gives texture, bounce, and shape to lifeless hair.  This thing is the bomb.com!  I must have crawled under a rock because I have never seen this tool before and I sure wish I had!  It would saved me from one too many bad haircuts!  I love it and it came earlier than expected too! I was like a kid in Christmas opening up a special gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m letting my hair grow long now. I&#x27;m tired of paying so much for haircuts. I need to give it some lift and wave, but my hair is fine and won&#x27;t stay on a regular iron, so this brush is perfect. It heats up fast and does a wonderful job. It is easy to grip and turn as you curl. Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I  always read reviews before I purchase something like a hair product; as if I needed one more!!!  But the reviews were so favorable on this brush I HAD to try it and am so glad that I did.  It has been THE brush I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I have longer, below shoulders, FINE, hair and I truly live my brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of iron for years and have always been very happy with them.  I was disappointed in a few of them for the cords were too short, this one is not.  It is however, a bit heavy but I&#x27;m used to it.  Heats well, does what I need.</li>
    <li> I would have given it a 5 but the heat isn&#x27;t hot enough. However, with that being said, the curls stay on for 2 days. I love it!</li>
    <li> The barrel size was larger than what I expected plus the cost was MUCH more than at a regular store.  Because of the these reason, I returned this curling iron.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this brush gets as hot as it should with all the different settings it had. I cranked it up and it does not get hot enough to style my naturally wavy hair. I will be donating to someone with hair that requires less heat to style.</li>
    <li> This curler is too large for the average hair.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Heats up in 30 seconds and has automatic shut off.  I really like&lt;br /&gt;the bigger barrel.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Works well and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> works great, heats up quickly</li>
    <li> Hard to find except on line - so I bought 3!  I have straight, fine hair - med length, and this works great!</li>
    <li> Used this for less than one year before it died on me!  When it worked it was very effective!  However it should have lasted much longer than it did!</li>
    <li> This is the best hot curling brush I have ever used!! Love the settings for temp control and love the turbo button. I also like that it shuts itself of after one hour!! Conair please don&#x27;t stop making this product.</li>
    <li> i bought this based on many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;then i lost my manual. also before i lost it and after i lost it,&lt;br /&gt;i never could really enjoy it. Cause it is just awkward. sometimes my hair stuck in the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;and it just is not so effective as a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;but i checked on reviews again. now i am really curious about how all the good reviews&#x27; people use it.&lt;br /&gt;i wish someone could post a video too! thanks in advance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i have to admit this is good to straighten your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron</li>
    <li> AWESOME! Love this iron with turbo boost. I would reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Heats up instantly and curls beautifully. Use a little hairspray as you curl and you don&#x27;t have to hold it on so long. I curl my whole head in less than 10 minutes. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I ordered the bigger one but had to return it. Because it was too big for my short hair. But Amazon kindly and quickly replaced my order (I mean, changed to the smaller one), and I could get the product in a short time.. So far, so good. Hair damage is not that serious, very easy to use... I love it so much.</li>
    <li> Hate it. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my short bobbed hair.</li>
    <li> Great for my wavy hair when I go to bed with wet hair. This quickly calms it down. Just be careful curling behind your head, I have got it caught once.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brush and it well get a lot of use in the days to come thank you</li>
    <li> Love the brush. I have very coarse hair and still makes my ends look salon perfect. I still use my flat iron for my roots, but I use this brush for the rest of my medium length hair. I only wish it would get a little hotter.</li>
    <li> I am giving this away - my fine, thin hair was too difficult to style....kept sliding through without bending curl</li>
    <li> Just what I had been looking for.  So hard to find, so I bought 2.  Just the right product to curl my hair under a bit or add those big &amp;#34;ringlet&amp;#34; kind of curls.  It is a big barrel, so it won&#x27;t work for very short hair, but it is perfect for medium to long hair.  So glad I found this on Amazon as my old one had lost a lot of the teeth over the years of use.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight asian hair and i bought this to curl my hair and to put some volume in it. I was really excited when this came in the mail because I love the look of voluminous loose curls but this was INCREDIBLY hard to use, my hair would get stuck in this thing like crazy when I tried to roll it up a section of hair and I constantly had to pull the plug just so I wouldn&#x27;t burn myself ripping my hair out of the bristles. I tried using it just for volume near the roots but that didn&#x27;t really produce much results. The only way I got this to work was by cutting off all the bristles until they were just short stubs and now I get the curls I want. Honestly, it&#x27;d be easier to just get a ten dollar curling iron at target or something.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my Conair hot air curler thinking this one was also a hot air curler but it&#x27;s just a basic curler with hard plastic bristles.  Guess I didn&#x27;t read the description!  But it actually works pretty good curling my ends but hasn&#x27;t really curled to the root yet despite holding it in my hair for long on the highest setting.  That being said, I have long thick hair so it&#x27;s tough for any curling iron to curl the entire strand.</li>
    <li> Hot brush is the perfect tool for my naturally wavy hair.  Heats up quickly.  The larger barrel produces the larger wave or curl pattern that I want.</li>
    <li> This seemed to be a quality product but I had ordered the wrong size for my shorter hair.  Did not use when I saw the size and returned for refund.&lt;br /&gt;quick refund of my return.  Would recommend if this if the size you would use</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair and this product was just what I was looking for. Hassle free curling in no time at all.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and is not hard on my hair. I use this the most out of evry other curling iron I use. It is also the cheapest price.</li>
    <li> I have fine, long, over-processed hair, and I&#x27;ve struggled to keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess once I walk out into the humidity. The heat setting is easy to control and the temperature is perfect for my hair on the lowest setting, making my hair smooth, silky and shiny, with soft waves.  As an added bonus my hair is no longer effected by the humidity, it remains frizz free throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Wider than I expected, better for longer hair.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I hoped</li>
    <li> This is great if you don&#x27;t want too much curl.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Easy to use. Smooths and shines hair.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say one negative thing about this......awesome!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on shoulder length hair as it states it works for long hair.  I can see where someone with 3 to 4 inches of hair would be able to do it.  However, I was continually having to shut if off and pulling hair out by the roots to get my hair out of it.  It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t know how to use it.  I still haven&#x27;t figured out why it kept doing it.  Finally, stuck it in a drawer after about 4 uses!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent curling hot brush.  I just wish it was a bit smaller, wish they made a 1&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Hair gets trapped at the top end where the tip meets the metal roller. Everytime. I used it once and now regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is great!!  Easy to use, very gentle on my fine, fragile hair, and does a terrific job.</li>
    <li> Heats up VERY FAST and can get VERY HOT if you choose the hottest setting.  Seems like a really good deal.  I chose the larger diameter option to curl my short hair under and add some volume.  Holds all day easily.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t fancy, no spinning, or blowing hot air but this works great for re-touching ends and styling my usually frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love my Hot Sticks.  I used to have one similiar years ago.  The only thing missing is a release button to unroll the curl,and if the end unscrewed so that you could take off the teeth to clean it.  Besides that it really works well and puts just the right amount of curl in my hair and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> After trying rollers and a regular curling iron, this is exactly what I need to keep my turned under blunt cut looking fresh.</li>
    <li> It does get hot. However,my hair gets caught in between the part where the handle and the iron connects.</li>
    <li> I had been using an expensive flat iron and was just not getting the look I needed.  I read the review for this unit and thought for the price, I should try it.  It&#x27;s great!  It&#x27;s fast and the set lasts all day.  I have lots of fine treated blonde hair.  Sometimes I use it wet.  I am so impressed with this thing!</li>
    <li> This curling brush gives you beautiful soft curls that last all day. Gives you plenty of room on top to assist with curling. Your hair can get stuck in the base but just make sure that you start your curl up high. I the only bummer is that you need to make sure that you physically turn it on every time you use it, cause it has a automatic shut off if you leave it on which is great.</li>
    <li> I Love the Heat Hot Brush.  I recommend this Heat Hot Brush to anyone that curls their hair. It is so easy to use and you get not one but to brushes with it.</li>
    <li> I have bought many curling products and they are in a drawer, so I was skeptical ordering this......My hair is long and this does the trick. It gives me curl where I want it.....I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.....Rememeber it is not air blown. it is actually a curling iron with teeth which makes is doubly easy to use......If you need a straightener or curling iron buy this ...you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I could not find a hot brush in any drugstore so ordered it on line.  My old one had died.  This exceeded my expectations.  It heats up very fast and I love the smaller handle to grip.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I found this hot brush.  I like it so much that bought both sizes.  It makes styling and freeze taming so much easier.</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast and I love that you can adjust how hot it gets. It does a great job making my wavy hair look more organized, when I don&#x27;t want to totally straighten it. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This brush heats up quickly.  The only regret I have is that my hair is only collar length.  I need another one with a smaller barrel.</li>
    <li> Not much different than the Conair curling iron that I already have.  Sent back.</li>
    <li> I find this a bit hard to use in my thick, long hair. It tends to get tangled up easily.</li>
    <li> This was just what I wanted. I received it fast and  it works wonderfully. It&#x27;s everything the description said it would be. Love it!</li>
    <li> My hair kind of falls off here n there no matter what I do and does even more when i use it. But this ironing brush makes it look great when I actually use it. Although it does make my thin flat hair difficult to run my fingers through it does make I think really full looking.</li>
    <li> The brush was a little smaller than I wanted, but the product works just fine.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago and could never find another one.  The size is perfect for giving my hair a little lift.  I have purchased 3 of these from Amazon, since I&#x27;m afraid I will never find them again and I don&#x27;t want to be without one.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick.  Nice grip.  Perfect cord length.  Makes great curls!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this. I&#x27;m a hair stylist. My only complaint is I wish it released your hair more easily. Still like it and will keep it. Give a softer look with no fish hooks like irons.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine thick shoulder length hair</li>
    <li> This iron is AWESOME and it my main go to iron.  I love it for bouncy hair and I&#x27;m stacked up the back..  hair is fine but I have a lot that does NOT hold curl very easily.  This iron seems to give me what I need!  Ohh.. back is harder to use because my hair is very short back there but can manipulate it to work..  takes some work but still very good job by this iron!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair, but it does the same thing my moms Calista Perfector does at a tenth of the price.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to me as a beginner to curling tools, this is very easy to use and never worry about burning my hand</li>
    <li> I was devastated when my old curling iron blew up in my hand.  However, this hot stick is so wonderful, I am almost glad the old curling iron is gone.  It really smooths nicely and will make a nice curl if you hold it in place a few moments.  It is great.  I would be careful if I had really short hair I would buy the smaller round one.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Not a well made product the material that makes the barrel is just awful, this cannot curl my hair at all I just had to throw this out. Wish I could give no star.</li>
    <li> The new hot brushes out now are hot air. This one is like a curling iron with brush teeth. It&#x27;s great for getting the frizzie to calm down.</li>
    <li> exactly like the pone I have had for 10 years.  Love it!  Happy i could find an almost exact replacement</li>
    <li> This little Hot Brush CURLS the hair.  I have long hair and it works so well.....better than a barrel iron.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> The brush is larger than I expected but it heats up quickly, without getting too hot, and curls my hair.  I like that it gives body to the curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who was nervous about burning herself on curling irons or straighteners. This checks the box for being much safer to handle. Two problems though: 1. She and I both have curly hair and unless we thoroughly brush it out or blow dry it using a brush, this product tends to snag or, worse yet, get stuck in the hair. Secondly, this does not have the same straightening power of a conventional straightener or curling iron, so while it is safer, it also takes twice the time as you need to run it down each section of hair repeatedly. I would recommend this on hair that isn&#x27;t curly and thick like ours.</li>
    <li> Very good product, easy to use</li>
    <li> It is a nice big roller, gets very hot n quick. Has many heat settings. I have mine on the higher ones n I have very thick hair</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and I was told many times it was better than the way more expensive one I replaced it for!</li>
    <li> April 13, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know WHY this model is so hard to find in the stores but it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  The teeth on the brush keeps your hair in place and the size of the barrel is wonderful for volume, with a softer hairstyle. All you see now with teeth or bristles is one with a blow dryer in it and that doesn&#x27;t get the barrel hot enough for a good curl.  Matter of fact, I&#x27;m getting another one for a spare - just in case they discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;Rockford, MI</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and curls very well.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Received on time and product is great.</li>
    <li> Not that easy to use. Very light, feels cheap. ( it is cheap)</li>
    <li> I have to use the hot brush every day, sometimes twice a day. My hair has no curl without it. Works very well</li>
    <li> Unit heated up quickly. Got the volume of a blow dry (without the hassle of a blow dryer in one hand and round brush in another) and flat iron finsh (for smoothing) in one pass.  The 1 1/4 inch barrel is too big for a &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;; might be effective for a &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; if your hair is long enough.&lt;br /&gt;I Really like it after one use, could grow to love it.</li>
    <li> Well made, heats up fast, but the barrel is too small for me to make the sleek page boy look I like</li>
    <li> It trip my house electricity. Don&#x27;t bother buying</li>
    <li> I have hair to my butt and it is very thick so this does not work for me. It rips out a lot of hair but is does style it cute just not curls more like a slight style. I think it would be a good tool for the thin short hair people</li>
    <li> This is the best curler for the money out there.</li>
    <li> This curling iron works really well without crimping your hair.  Be careful not to wind long hair around the shaft more than twice as your hair will get tangled in the brush and it will be really hard to get your hair unstuck.  The curls it produces are beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and thin hair that I must add lots of volume to or I look like a drowned rat.  I bought this because it was the cheaper version of one of those super volume ones I saw on an informercial.  It does get hot super fast and has several settings.  It curls my hair, sort of.  I actually get way more volume on my Revlon dryer brush.  It would probably be ok if you had a lot of product in your hair, or you had really thick hair.  It didn&#x27;t cost me much, so I didn&#x27;t return it and will use it if I have to touch something up.  Overall a good product, just didn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this model.  It is sturdy &amp; works well.  I have tried other styling brushes, but always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> It is simple to use. Love the fast heat-up and i control the temperature. Have used similar products through the years but this was is so much faster and safer. Body and bounce in seconds. Wondering why i can not find this size in stores. They only carry the 3/4 in. model which is for short hair. ?</li>
    <li> This curling iron is reliable and versatile. I hope they never stop making them. I take it with me everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is actually the first review I have ever written before and let me tell you... this isn&#x27;t what you think it is or what you might actually believe it to be, it&#x27;s so much more! After watching a few videos on how to use this, I learned and my hair looks great! The delivery was quite fast and the product itself really does work regardless of how cheap it actually is. My curls come out great and my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy at all! I love this!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the other ones, I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 kinds from Claitol to Helen of Troy. This one is so superior to the others I got an extra one for a spare and one for my travel bag. Why so great? 1. Heats up in seconds. 2. Has 30 heat levels I only use 11 of 30 to curl my hair in 10 seconds. 3. The spacing of the tines comb through my hair to smooth it while keeping it taught but not snarling it. This is so much better and more effective for your hair than the cylinder and clamp kind. Plus you can brush it through your hair to smooth it.</li>
    <li> I like to use this type of styling tool, but this one does not get hot enough to fluff my hair!!  I am disappointed with the performance of this product.</li>
    <li> if you have curly hair -- like REALLY curly thick hair that&#x27;s generally dry -- put this in your hair and you will instantly lose it.  yes, you will spend 40  minutes trying to get the thing out and then give up and cut it out.  ONLY FOR STRAIGHT HAIREDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this hair tool!  I have very thick hair and it gives me the body and loose curls I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This hot stick is soooo easy to use and maneuver! I haven&#x27;t used a &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34; since the 90&#x27;s. I am afraid Ill burn my head, forehead, finger, etc...I can&#x27;t curl quick and fast like I use to as a teenager. THIS is super easy to use...plug it in...in like 2 mins it&#x27;s ready...take a piece of hair...wrap it around...leave on for maybe a minute...DONE:)  I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s thin..I set this on 5 and perfect curls. I am very happy with this purchase.  I wish I would have bought months ago.</li>
    <li> My hair gets caught in the crease between the barrel and the handle, it heats quick and will get very hot so be careful setting it past 18.  I have thick hair and that is high enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> it does not keep the curl and it pulls out my hair when i use it. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I got my hair tangled it in big time and it took my husband ten minutes to pry it out. After a little practice, it works well but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my hair. What it does is add body and a little wave.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly. Holds curl well. Nice big waves. I have used the 3/4&amp;#34; model for years and was glad to find it in a 1 1/4&amp;#34;. Now I use both.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for a birthday present , and the person loved it .,&lt;br /&gt;She had been wanting one for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this hot brush.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this a while back but just never got around to using it. I tried it out two days ago and I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a hot brush or curling iron so I really didn&#x27;t know how to use it at first and had to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;I found that this can be used a couple of ways:&lt;br /&gt;Because it has a brush, I use it to brush through my hair for to give me a full voluminous look;&lt;br /&gt;I can brush it through my hair and gently curl the tips for a flicked out or flicked in effect;&lt;br /&gt;For waves, I part my hair in sections and roll each around the hot brush from the roots or wefts when I&#x27;m wearing a weave. But you have to hold the hair and be careful when wrapping so your hair doesn&#x27;t get all tangled, trust me its not fun.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do love this. Its a multifunctional brush and it gets the job done excellently well. I thought I would have to purchased a ceramic iron but I don&#x27;t need to since I got this. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well on my very fine and limp hair when it is both short and shoulder length. I use on a medium setting which seems to work the best. I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> It does not give a tight curl, just enough to make me look presentable.</li>
    <li> So nice for the perfect hair style.</li>
    <li> I just bought this curling brush and it is fantastic! I couldn&#x27;t find this size in Canada so was thrilled that Amazon would ship it to me here. I own the smaller version of this and it is also wonderful but I am growing out my hair and it was just too small. This size of hot brush gives my hair body and shine, great for my fine, shoulder length hair.  Since I also have a cottage, I will be buying another one to have there.  I know I won&#x27;t want to be without this!!</li>
    <li> My favorite. This is my 3rd, they last about 3 years and I use it every day, sometimes twice a day. It travels overseas with me and the dual voltage is great.</li>
    <li> This iron is perfect for my very thick and curly hair especially when I am straightening it, great buy highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these for my wife and each time there was a problem with the on/off switch.  The first one, it took numerous times to get the switch to turn on.  The second one, the switch light is suppose to stop blinking when the brush ie fully warmed up, but it took approximately twenty minutes to do so.  Currenly they are both in need of repair and have been sent back to the factory for repair/replacement.  It costs about four dollars to mail to factory, so i would figure this in to your purchase price!</li>
    <li> Love this!  This is the second one I ordered since the Belson 1&amp;#34; curling brush is no longer being made.  I want to make sure I have an extra in case this is also discontinued.  This is a little larger than the Belson but it works just fine.  I have baby fine hair and need something larger than the 3/4&amp;#34; curling brushe for volume.  The teeth are not removable which is the only thing I wish was different.  With the Belson you could remove the teeth and clean them and the barrel so it was easy to keep it clean.  I highly recommend this item and am happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Works well. It does pull your hair out when it gets wrapped between the combs and the rubber part of the iron. The tip also seems to get pretty hot and makes it hard to hold on to. Other than that it heats up fast and provides a nice curl that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought a smaller one because my hair is short so it doesn&#x27;t work as well!</li>
    <li> I have short hair, just below my ears, so I was hesitant which size to get. I opted for the larger 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel, and I&#x27;m very happy with it!  I don&#x27;t need curls; I just want body and waves, and this does the trick!  Not having to put it down and section out hair with my comb and then pick it up again to curl is so WONDERFUL!!</li>
    <li> Looked all over for years for this size curling iron.  Very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> So hard to find a curling brush in the stores - let alone some options. Have always had great luck with conair products</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with this curler.  I have thin hair, use a spritz of hair spray and I&#x27;m able to curl my hair easily.  It has no &amp;#34;blower&amp;#34; like the old style Conairs did - it&#x27;s just a curling iron with bristles. These bristles are thick, like 1/8&amp;#34; thick each - not wire bristles, don&#x27;t seem to cause any unpleasant tangles nor static frizz.  Great buy for the price for sure.  I like the turbo setting - it works super fast.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no automated shut off on this though.  Remember to un-plug it!!!!! That&#x27;s the only down side.</li>
    <li> love it!  low price and I get great results.  it is not a dryer, more like a curling iron with brush bristles.</li>
    <li> I am super excited to have this curling stick! I works great and came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great for styling - my hair is between short and medium, i&#x27;m no pro when it comes for hair styling but this brush is so easy to use! Even i end up with amazingly styled hair!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair. Brush is easy to use. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my mom.  She recently asked me to order her another one!  One at work and one at home.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and Hot.</li>
    <li> Great body for fine hair!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  My hair is thick and wavy and has a great tendency to frizz.  After blow drying, I use this to smooth out my hair and add a little curl at the ends.  It does not blow air - it&#x27;s like a curling iron and a brush combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it&#x27;s not as harsh as a flat iron (harsh is the only word that comes to mind).  There are many different heat settings and it&#x27;s really quick to heat to the applied setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It works fine.  I wish the teeth would grip the hair some to make it easier to curl.  The hair slips out pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and gives a loose curl to my fine hair.  Teeth do not get caught in my hair.</li>
    <li> did not work very poor.</li>
    <li> good, as exactly as it said in the description, conair is a good brand</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking for a good hair brush for a while online and came across this one and she really loves it because the barrel is larger than others on the market.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair Hot Brush. It is a great curling brush, easy to use and you don&#x27;t burn your neckline or around the face like you can with a regular curling iron. It heats up fast and you can use it for the back of your head where you can&#x27;t see what you are doing. Works really well.</li>
    <li> This is okay, but it is not a replacement for the curly blowdryers like http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022WA9K/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_19</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair that tends to look a little frizzy. This curling iron smooths it and gives it a gentle curl, without making it flat. I usually flip the ends under. I think I have owned 3 of these over the years. They probably last 2-3 years. I like the adjustable heat setting. It turns itself off if you leave it on too long. It heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I somehow got sucked into watching an infomercial about the Perfecter fusion heated brush, and even though it seemed stupidly expensive I thought I might get one. When I was researching it online I read a lot of reviews about problems with it, but saw this much cheaper and higher-rated Conair hot brush come up as an alternative. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste money on something more expensive. This inexpensive little brush works perfectly on my medium-length, thick hair. I shower at night and let my hair dry while I sleep, then get up the morning and brush my hair into shape with this. It&#x27;s faster and gives you more styling options than a clamp curling iron,  plus it&#x27;s easier on your hair; mine always looks soft and shiny after I use it.</li>
    <li> Heats fast, arrived fast, economical. Mulitple settings for desired results. Much better than an iron, no sausage curls just nice waves. So happy I found.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Heats instantly.  Works great for long hair and if you want body.  I actually need a smaller handle as this one fills my hand and makes it difficult for me to handle.  The product does what it advertised, and I received it much more quickly than anticipated.</li>
    <li> I really like this item heats up quick and it gives my flat hair so much volume and for the price its a must have</li>
    <li> i hope they never stop making this Hot brush! This  is the third one  I bought. It  perfect for medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
