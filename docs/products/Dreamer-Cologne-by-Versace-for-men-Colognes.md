      <li>If it smells good on my skin, I will gladly wear it.</li>
      <li>So I then ordered this full size bottle which came for a great price.</li>
      <li>But if it is the original then it is a good product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be overpowering or overwhelming.  </li>

      <li>I have been using this(my favorite) cologne/ love potion for many years.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Packaging could not have been better.</li>
      <li>love the smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s authentic</li>
      <li>and I was more than pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my husbands favorite.  </li>
      <li>The smell was great and soft, but i suggest this product mostly for dates not celebrities.</li>
      <li>It is a softer scent, not as strong as some others.</li>
      <li>Cologne smells kinda cheap, like aftershave.</li>
      <li>I truly enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I enjoy Dreamer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to know where reviews on products like these are coming from.</li>
      <li>This smell perfect from when I first purchase this roughly a decade ago.  </li>
      <li>This was an original, not a copy.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance  as seen on the product page is original since I owned this perfume before.</li>
      <li>It is a clean and relaxing scent.  </li>
      <li>The scent is unique and sweet.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this seller and I will buy again soon, keep up the good work , thanks.</li>
      <li>On time and a full bottle</li>
      <li>After first spraying and suffering for about 15-20 minutes, the scent settled down and turned into something pretty dang delicious.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male... but better, more grown up I suppose.</li>
      <li>would suggest this to anyone looking for something that smells nice (spicy, flowery, fresh and maybe kind of sweet), lasts long and isn&#x27;t loud or offensive.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s saying a lot because over the years I&#x27;ve accumulated enough cologne to start my own mail order business.</li>
      <li>Clearly one of my top three scents of all time</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cologne by far.</li>
      <li>described, original packaging, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers mention, this scent smells best after the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; period (</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the few colognes I own that continues to smell nice throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It smells even better the next day!  </li>
      <li>it was not the exact scent, I tried at the stores.  </li>
      <li>Also, the further along the scent evolves,the better it gets.</li>
      <li>The notes that I am pretty certain</li>
      <li>so I ordered the small sample bottle on Amazon to try it out and loved it.</li>
      <li>Comparing the product I received from this Amazon vendor, I can say that the scent wears exactly the same as the original bottle I purchased from the department store.</li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 29 and a female who happens to enjoy wearing fragrances marketed towards males and females.</li>
      <li>It looks like it has nothing to do with the real Versace product.</li>
      <li>this is the real deal...</li>
      <li>and I can verify that what I received is the real deal.</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne in the world and not one that is worn by every other person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I say this because I purchased my first bottle of Dreamer by Versace from a department store for nearly $100.</li>
      <li>Just as expected, I have been using this cologne for several years, and I love the scent.</li>
      <li>Nice and subtle..</li>
      <li>The longevity and smell of the scent are exactly the same</li>
      <li>while some say it doesn&#x27;t last long, it definitely lasts longer than I thought it would and people love it.</li>
      <li>men that are looking for a masculine cologne that will make people think you can grow a beard at will-</li>
      <li>Old</li>
      <li>Some people think it smells good but to my untrained nose, the beginning smells like baby powder, fake pine trees and rubbing</li>
      <li>While the dry down is very clean and fresh, it&#x27;s still slightly powdery.</li>
      <li>read a lot of reviews on this particular cologne and the general consensus is this stuff is kind of atrocious for the first 30 minutes</li>

<li> Not good, not bad.</li>
<li> Also, the first 30 minutes of this IS kind of atrocious!</li>
<li> Other fragrances I use are JPG Le Male Terrible (for men), D&amp;G Light Blue (for women), Burberry Brit Summer (for men), Armani Code (for men), John Varvatos Vintage (for men and my present favorite) and CK Euphoria (for women).&lt;br</li>
<li> I would suggest applying this 30 minutes or so before you expect to be around other human beings.</li>
<li> I am not a professional perfume/cologne sniffer!!</li>
<li> Arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very soft and subtle, and I wouldn&#x27;t even call it musky...</li>
<li> He wont use any other.</li>
<li> Just an average cologne for men.</li>
<li> I got/get, it in 3day Average *win-win*</li>
<li> With every spray, a bit leaks from under the sprayer and will either drip down the bottle or get on your hands.</li>
<li> I think you could get away with wearing this around an office without burning anyone&#x27;s nose hair or definitely on a date, but it sits way too close to your skin and is way too subtle to think it&#x27;s going to get you any attention in a crowded club or bar.</li>
<li> Not sure if the product is cut or it is some other reason.</li>
<li> It is not a watered down version that was cut with alcohol or any other cutting agent as some other reviews may suggest.</li>
<li> Maybe atrocious is a strong word, but it is definitely unpleasant.</li>
<li> As for longevity, I washed my hands a couple times (I spray on the wrists, chest and behind the ears) and took a shower after the gym and this fragrance still managed to stick with me for</li>
<li> I was wrong to choose this one.</li>
<li> HOW CAN YOU G O WRONG?</li>
<li> the Bad</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed</li>
<li> The sprayer on this bottle is annoying and wasteful.</li>
<li> (don&#x27;t let the bad deter you!!)</li>

    <li> This cologne is awesome my husband loves it almost as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Great smell I will buy it again and again</li>
    <li> The smell was great and soft, but i suggest this product mostly for dates not celebrities.</li>
    <li> I enjoy Dreamer it was a great buy and smells good nice smelling.</li>
    <li> This fragrance  as seen on the product page is original since I owned this perfume before. I highly recommend this seller and I will buy again soon, keep up the good work , thanks.</li>
    <li> Beware! It looks like it has nothing to do with the real Versace product. I took my product to a local shopping mall and compared the scents....I don&#x27;t know how this is possible, but I am deeply disppointed!</li>
    <li> It Smells Great and is just like the one I owned before.  Definitely one of the few colognes I own that continues to smell nice throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My Guy loves this stuff.  I think he thinks all the gals do too.  Maybe not.</li>
    <li> Versace did it this time they came up with a antique smell which insinuates the smell of a supreme being or God</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s authentic so that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
    <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> it was not the exact scent, I tried at the stores.  I would not buy it again and I do not recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to clarify that this is my 3rd time purchasing this scent and I can verify that what I received is the real deal. It is not a watered down version that was cut with alcohol or any other cutting agent as some other reviews may suggest. I say this because I purchased my first bottle of Dreamer by Versace from a department store for nearly $100. Comparing the product I received from this Amazon vendor, I can say that the scent wears exactly the same as the original bottle I purchased from the department store. The longevity and smell of the scent are exactly the same and I was more than pleased with the product. As other reviewers mention, this scent smells best after the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; period (approx 30 minutes after application) but is truly timeless and is sure to bring you compliments all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this(my favorite) cologne/ love potion for many years. I love the smell n the responses from people who walk by n turn around to stop my in the middle of, u name it; just to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing/have on...so they can buy it for theirs. I&#x27;ve it n Amazon shipped it asp with just standardized shipping n I got/get, it in 3day Average *win-win*</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  My grandson loves it!</li>
    <li> Smells very similar to Jean Paul Guiltier</li>
    <li> Great smell great price  and absolutely great results lol but it stopped spraying I went in hospital and forgot about it my fault I lose on this one</li>
    <li> read reviews on You tube (Marc), and bought it out of curiosity. Blew me out of the water. Clearly one of my top three scents of all time and that&#x27;s saying a lot because over the years I&#x27;ve accumulated enough cologne to start my own mail order business. Truly remarkable, Versace has out done themselves with this one!</li>
    <li> This smell perfect from when I first purchase this roughly a decade ago.  this is the real deal... love the smell</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne in the world and not one that is worn by every other person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described, original packaging, fast shipping. Would definitely by from this seller again in the future and recommend to others. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s important to know where reviews on products like these are coming from. I&#x27;m 29 and a female who happens to enjoy wearing fragrances marketed towards males and females. If it smells good on my skin, I will gladly wear it. Other fragrances I use are JPG Le Male Terrible (for men), D&amp;G Light Blue (for women), Burberry Brit Summer (for men), Armani Code (for men), John Varvatos Vintage (for men and my present favorite) and CK Euphoria (for women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men that are looking for a masculine cologne that will make people think you can grow a beard at will- I don&#x27;t think this is it. It&#x27;s very soft and subtle, and I wouldn&#x27;t even call it musky... but it is quite nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews on this particular cologne and the general consensus is this stuff is kind of atrocious for the first 30 minutes and then when it settles on your skin, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;First the Bad (don&#x27;t let the bad deter you!!) The sprayer on this bottle is annoying and wasteful. With every spray, a bit leaks from under the sprayer and will either drip down the bottle or get on your hands. Also, the first 30 minutes of this IS kind of atrocious! I would suggest applying this 30 minutes or so before you expect to be around other human beings. Maybe atrocious is a strong word, but it is definitely unpleasant. Some people think it smells good but to my untrained nose, the beginning smells like baby powder, fake pine trees and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The (mostly) Good- After first spraying and suffering for about 15-20 minutes, the scent settled down and turned into something pretty dang delicious. It reminds me of Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male... but better, more grown up I suppose. Please keep in mind I am not a professional perfume/cologne sniffer!! The notes that I am pretty certain I picked up are cedar/fir, some tobacco and a lot of floral &#x27;stuff&#x27; going on. While the dry down is very clean and fresh, it&#x27;s still slightly powdery. Also, the further along the scent evolves,the better it gets. I really like this, it will be a nice scent to use when I want to change things up. I think you could get away with wearing this around an office without burning anyone&#x27;s nose hair or definitely on a date, but it sits way too close to your skin and is way too subtle to think it&#x27;s going to get you any attention in a crowded club or bar. As for longevity, I washed my hands a couple times (I spray on the wrists, chest and behind the ears) and took a shower after the gym and this fragrance still managed to stick with me for about 5 or 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to anyone looking for something that smells nice (spicy, flowery, fresh and maybe kind of sweet), lasts long and isn&#x27;t loud or offensive.</li>
    <li> Loved the book and the series</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive Dreamer was.  I had to buy it it&#x27;s my husbands favorite.  He wont use any other.</li>
    <li> I gave the Dreamer by Versace a two star because if you buy the $36 dollar bottles the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last as the 76 dollar bottles. Not sure if the product is cut or it is some other reason. But if it is the original then it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Smells really good!! I got this for my friends 30th and he loves it. Its a chick magnet lol</li>
    <li> ITALIAN COLOGNE--HOW CAN YOU G O WRONG?</li>
    <li> Just as expected, I have been using this cologne for several years, and I love the scent. Always get multiple compliments when I have it on. Magnet, if I may add.</li>
    <li> This was an original, not a copy.  Purchased as a gift for my Dad that has been using it for 10 years. Can&#x27;t beat the price!  Packaging could not have been better.</li>
    <li> Put on this cologne and you will receive a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> Nice and subtle.. Old but will still get plenty of compliments..</li>
    <li> This is a glorious scent.  I love it.  It is a clean and relaxing scent.  I don&#x27;t find it to be overpowering or overwhelming.  I truly enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I will never wear another cologne!  Women love this stuff! It smells even better the next day!  You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I was wrong to choose this one. I did not like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not good, not bad. Just an average cologne for men. Packaging is kinda girly. Cologne smells kinda cheap, like aftershave.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this stores so I ordered the small sample bottle on Amazon to try it out and loved it. So I then ordered this full size bottle which came for a great price. The scent is unique and sweet. It is a softer scent, not as strong as some others. I feel as though it&#x27;s an anytime cologne. Some colognes are better suited for winter as opposed to warmer months or nighttime as opposed to daytime, but this a great all around scent. It is not overpowering and while some say it doesn&#x27;t last long, it definitely lasts longer than I thought it would and people love it. This is my favorite cologne by far.</li>
    <li> On time and a full bottle and I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere to have to get it.  Front door service</li>
