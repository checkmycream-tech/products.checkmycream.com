<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good hydration and its non greasy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It&#x27;s really perfume-y, kind of like johnsons baby oil actually. Thankfully the it goes away but the initial feeling of putting that smell on my face is really off putting to me. I don&#x27;t know if they have this in a version without this perfumey smell, but if so that would be great.</li>
    <li> It is light and easy to apply.  it is just enough moisture for hot summer days.  I love the fragrance too.</li>
    <li> The Oil of Olay which I  became familiar with, in the glass jar, had a more pronounced  fragrance. It is associated with lots of very special memories of  the ladies, and myself, who used this product.  It still is a superb  &amp;#34;Beauty Fluid&amp;#34;  but just lost something when the fragrance was  &amp;#34;diluted&amp;#34; or in some way altered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for many years, it is excellent, and the price is also very good.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love Oil of Olay but I felt the price listed was misleading.  I thought the $18 was for both bottles, not $18 each.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my wife, she likes it very much. It keps her skin smooth and it has no smell, she told me to give it a 5 stars because it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Superior product.  Using Oil of Olay for since the age of 16.  Now forty years later have never needed to change to another product.  Light, rich and creamy.  No oily residue.  Luscious scent.  Would highly suggest purchasing, You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every day!</li>
    <li> This is a light, non-sticky, non-greasy, moisturizer that will moisturize your skin fairly well.     However, I like moisturizers that feel nonexistent, and this one I can still \\&quot;feel\\&quot; on my face.  For the record, I am new to beauty products and have not found one yet that I love.     I do like this product, and though I will continue to search for better products, also feel that this one gives a good bang for your buck.      Overall, recommended.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using this product for as long as I can remember! She is 53 years of age now, but people continuously compliment her on her skin, and how beautiful, clear and wrinkle free it is. She can practically get away with being my sister! I am 25 and have combination skin. I have just started using this product every morning after I wash my face, and I have been using it for about a month and a half now, and I believe this product is something that I will continue to use for a very very long time! Thank you, Olay for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> Is as expected. My skin must have changed over the years as this isn&#x27;t working out well on my face. Too greasy for me.</li>
    <li> My wife has used  for years, likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> After using up all my day and night moisturizers, I found a bottle of Oil of Olay at the back of my closet and used it for the first time in many years.  What a surprise!  Oil of Olay (or, Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid, as it is called today) is better at moisturizing than anything else I have used to date!  It works great under makeup during the day and is wonderful for night moisturization.  All this and no sticky or greasy residue or feel!  I&#x27;m very grateful that Amazon carries this product, as it is not possible to find it anywhere else.  As an over-60-yr.-old woman, I have tried them all, and I highly recommend Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid as the very best moisturizer.</li>
    <li> What can I add to the discussion for Oil of Olay (Delay), but that it is a timeless moisturizer to ward off wrinkles and the discomforts of oncoming age.  I am now a veteran of this product - 40 years later I still feel like a sixteen year old and sometimes glimpse the mirror and swear it is the same 16 year old face staring back, because of Oil of Olay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Oil of Olay user for years and have always been told I look younger than my age. There was a girl at work who made it her job to ask older women who looked good what moisturizer they used and she said it was always Oil of Olay. Okay, not the most scientific approach, but I love the feel of Oil of Olay. It&#x27;s light and not greasy, and just maybe it&#x27;s helping me get that look of shock when people find out my age.</li>
    <li> My Mother is a young 92 years old and has been using this Oil of Olay lotion for years. In fact, I can&#x27;t remember ever seeing her use anything else to moisturize her complexion. This amazing woman has no crow&#x27;s feet, no sagging and very few wrinkles. In fact, the only signs of age on her face are a few wrinkles around her mouth. Her skin is in incredible shape. It&#x27;s hard not to rave about this product seeing the results of many years of use by Mom.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out when I was a teenager. Most people guess me younger than my actual age so I am pleased and you are never to young to start the younger the better in my opinion. I like the smell and texture it is nice and smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I always make a point to ask the older women I meet with few wrinkles what they use for their moisturizer. They almost always respond with Olay. That&#x27;s because this product is a classic that works. The fact that it has always been offered at a reasonable price has contributed to its popularity over the years. Compared to pricy alternatives Olay blows them out of the water. Generations of women in my family have used it and I&#x27;m sure this tradition will continue.</li>
    <li> Always order for mom. Continue to buy</li>
    <li> MY MOM REALLY LIKES THIS PRODUCT. SHE USES IT ALL THE TIME</li>
    <li> I am 25 and I am lotion obsessed... with that sad I have never moisturized my face. I just learned that it is necessary to retain elasticity in your skin to fight off wrinkles in the future. After I learned this common sense, my silly self went right out and purchased Olay Active Hydrating Fluid. I never lotion my face in the past because I have very large pores and very irritable skin so most products cause me to break out. I was finally willing to try this products because I heard it is not pore clogging and sensitive on skin. It is. It never once caused me to break out and that is extremely rare. It smells kinda grannyish but as a lover of old people I can handle it. I am definitely hooked on this product and it is not too expensive. I purchased it at Walmart for around six dollars.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to keep my wife happy. Keeps her skin smooth and she swears by it, so it must be good.</li>
    <li> THis is a classic product that has always worked really well for me and my daughter  - even though we have very different skin types. It&#x27;s just a great moisturizer. I often mix a little with my liquid foundation to get a more natural look. Love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion because i am not a very big fan of creams. I wanted something that will moisturize well and does not make the skin greasy. I came across this product while browsing for good face lotions and i wanted to try it. The product arrived pretty soon and the quantity is very good. You get more for what you pay for. I like the lotion&#x27;s smell, which is mild and nice. The skin feels well hydrated after use and is not oily. I did not break out either. I think this lotion can be used by any skin typed people. A great buy for lotion lovers.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really go with my skin type, everyone is different. My main complaint is just the smell, I felt like an old woman coming out of a closet of moth-balls.</li>
    <li> This little bottle of magic really won my heart over after a month of use! I&#x27;m in my 20s, and the golden rule dictates that anti-aging regime should begin at 25, instead of having to play catch up later in the 40s. I had been using a very expensive french brand prior to stumbling across this on Amazon. The french brand had boasted all these essential oils and over 95% natural ingredients. It had a big selection to include a specialized cream for almost every skin type. I thought I was as set as I could be. Until I tried this. This was smooth and light and easy to apply. My skin immediately felt moisturized and soft. After a night, my makeup went on much smoother than it had been due to a better canvas.&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using it, I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts. Its a fantastic product, and everyone should try it. I wouldn&#x27;t say its good for everyone, but at least 80% of skin types do great with it.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I used to work in a mid-end spa and seen almost every type of skin and recommended products accordingly.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for years and she loves it.  I&#x27;ll say it definitely keeps her skin soft and wrinkle free.  She tried the one with the yellow label which has spf in it and she still wants me to get this original one for her.  I&#x27;d recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used this for over 40 years and when she passed away at age 100, she didn&#x27;t look a day over 60. Every night before we went to bed she would use this on her face. I know this is a good product but now they make it hard to find because of all the new stuff they come up with. Thank God for Amazon where we can always find what we need.</li>
    <li> Works great at keeping the eye bags away.</li>
    <li> Olay best lotion for face non grease have used it for over 30 years. Also great sun screen protection.</li>
    <li> Great product and is really good for your skin.  Rates an EXCELLENT for sure.  The two pack is a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay (original hydrating) beauty cream is the best ever created.  It is non-greasy and does not leave your skin with that feeling.  I started using it back in the 1970&#x27;s have have done so every winter since.  Growing up in the east it help releive those ugly dry patches that leave your skin feeling irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccommend this to anyone espeially in the winter.  I have tried the \\&quot;complete\\&quot; with the UVA protection, but it does not compare to the original hydrating lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shopping on Amazon also will give you the best price over local drug stores, incluing Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> No expiration date. Other than that its good.</li>
    <li> This product is a classic!  Great product. Three generations in my family use this product and everybody loves. This pack of 2 has a great price too.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I live in a desert area in Southern California and I would apply and reapply other moisturizers just to not feel like my skin was drying and dying. This is the first product that&#x27;s been strong enough to make me feel properly moisturized when only applied once, yet feel clean not oily or grimy. My skin is much healthier since discovering this, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone whose current moisturizer wasn&#x27;t up to snuff.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff. My husband uses it more than I do. It does have a clean, almost non-existant fragrance, unlike some lotions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this formula for decades.  It has a very subtle scent, leaves my skin hydrated, but not oily or greasy.  2 large bottles...great price.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff; super moisturizing without feeling heavy on my skin. I&#x27;ve used this while living in Arizona and again while living in Texas (super dry vs pretty humid) and I use it in Florida (very humid) and it&#x27;s still amazing. I convinced my fiancee to use it, too. The only complaint is it smells weird. I would prefer a fragrance free of some sort.</li>
    <li> Olay Active Hydrating is absolutely terrific. I put it on in the morning and evening and my face feels like it has been rejuvenated.  You gve to try this and you will be amazed.  I am trying to get my hubby to put it on -  I know it will work wonders for him.</li>
    <li> My grandmother lived through both world wars and the great depression.  She allowed herself few luxuries in life, yet Olay sat by her chair from as far back as I can remember.  My Aunt continued the chain, and even in her last days the Olay was not allowed to be moved from her bedside.  Today my wife got her resupply and as soon as she could open it she applied it to her face.  The gentle scent and the softness of her face reminded me that truly, it&#x27;s the little things that count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple pleasures don&#x27;t have to cost alot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my mid-30s and I have to say it&#x27;s some of the best and least expensive stuff around. I do usually opt for the store brand though, as it&#x27;s exactly the same thing and an even lower price. Even after scrubbing and cleaning my face, I have dry and oily patches. I use a Buf-Puf. Yes, I &amp;#34;sandpaper&amp;#34; my face because it&#x27;s good for it. This moisturizer does the trick and isn&#x27;t as oily as outrageously expensive &amp;#34;men&#x27;s facial moisturizers&amp;#34;. It smooths out the patchiness and leaves my face as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind. I use Gillette aftershave lotion on my neck and ears to cut the &amp;#34;rosey&amp;#34; scent. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> True to form, Oil of Olay is a quality product for a great price. I have not used it in years, and had forgotten how nice it is.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! Been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this cream for more than a decade now. I use only this one. ONLY!&lt;br /&gt;and I love it... is this cream is a good match for your skin then it&#x27;s a must.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I use everyday of my life. The price for this pack of 2 was very good, and it arrived in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This is an old cult favorite for a reason! It absorbs rapidly and seriously moisturizes without making your skin sticky or greasy. It makes your face baby soft. I have pretty dry skin and it moisturized it perfectly...I&#x27;ve tried sooo many drugstore face lotions! I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal, Neutrogena, St. Ives, even the supposedly super moisturizing Cetaphil! Even Aquaphor didn&#x27;t do anything for the dullness and lack of color. Nothing worked on my dull tired looking dry skin....I even tried using almond oil as a moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t work. Absolutely none of it worked. I got a small sample bottle of Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different face lotion and liked it...I was going to buy it but decided to try this first. So glad I did! It has a very similar consistency, both leave your skin silky smooth and absorb super quickly. Additionally, both have mineral oil as a main ingredient. BUY THIS you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Have used Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid for close to 40 years.  My dermatologist tells me that my skin looks more than 10 years younger than my actual age of 84 years.</li>
    <li> great product the original pink formula I can&#x27;t find this in stores any longer in my area so I&#x27;m so happy amazon has this unique light skin formula and yes I have combination skin and it does not make my acne show up at all I&#x27;ve been using the bottle of white it just ok in comparison the original pink is by far superior</li>
    <li> I have been sing Olay since I was younger.  It used to be a treat at my grandmother&#x27;s house.  Now it seems to be the only moisturizer that I prefer.  It does not leave my skin greasy, it is light under my makeup and keeps my face soft and supple.  Leaving in extreme heat I need to protect my skin and this does it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A REASONABLE PRICE-I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 20 YEARS &amp; I LOOK AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THEN WOMEN I KNOW THAT USE THE EXPENSIVE STUFF.</li>
    <li> I have used the Original Olay for many years and love it as it is not a greasy product and just soaks in nicely on my skin.  I can&#x27;t stand greasy and this one feels so good.  Good price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a product I can&#x27;t live without!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before and it was branded and smelled like the real product. This time the font isn&#x27;t right, there isn&#x27;t really any branding and the smell is definitely not the same - almost smells like baby magic baby lotion. My face hasn&#x27;t broken out but I&#x27;m not going to wait to see if it does. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> Have been using Olay for years and wouldn&#x27; t change for nothing else in the world, even if told there are best products, I love it and it does and have been doing great for me since I was a young girl</li>
    <li> BEST MOISTURIZER ever -- Have used for years (am 67 now) -- have fewer wrinkles than most people my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Just reordered (get the 6 oz 2 pack for the best price) and had to repeat myself again in a review.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use expensive creams -- Aside from this the only product I also now use is the Vit C eye and facial creams from Avalon Organics -- but I never go without a morning and evening dose of this for an instant &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; feel to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Ahhhh and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to those expensive ones that do nothing more!</li>
    <li> I use this fluid for years. And I think this price is the real bargain. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Posted publicly.  Clear&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this all my life and the price is great, the original formula is the only one I will use</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer since I was little kid because it is what my mum used. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and keeps my skin nice. My husband even uses it now.</li>
    <li> Started using this after my old facial cream stopped working (my hormones changed) and I love it! My mom tried it years ago and said it burned her face but I have no problem with it!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin smooth and plump!  I like the soft fragrance, it is very relaxing.  This is a bit heavier than the sensitive skin version (classic series as well) that I use every day because it has niacinamide.  However, I need this classic beauty fluid for the winter.  The sensitive skin version is too light.  So I combine both - apply a light layer of the sensitive skin after my shower, then wait about 10 minutes or so for it to dry, then apply this over it at night to seal it in and add an extra layer of moisture.  I wake up flake free and with super soft skin!  I&#x27;ve been using Olay products all my life.  I still get carded for alcohol and sometimes people still think I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m closer to 40!)  I love getting the shocked reaction when people check my driver&#x27;s license and say, &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t think you were that old!  You look so young!&amp;#34;  I thank them politely and tell them, &amp;#34;Yes, I am pretty old!&amp;#34;  I love it when they guess I&#x27;m 26 or 29 at most!  Who wouldn&#x27;t want to shave off a decade or more by just applying a moisturizer to your face twice a day?  So many testimonials are like mine, and from women who are a lot older than even me!  Just order it, you know you want to try it:)  And if it doesn&#x27;t agree with your face, you can use it for the rest of your body and not feel guilty - it&#x27;s so affordable!</li>
    <li> This lotion is very irritating to my skin.  I remembered not liking this lotion but couldn&#x27;t remember why, until I put some on my arms as a test. It began to sting right away.  It was still stinging after I washed it off.  I was really surprised because I do not have sensitive skin at all, including my face.  Even with other Oil of Olay products.  I really don&#x27;t understand the high rating.  It must bother others.  I do not care for the fragrance either.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this product - olay active hydrating beauty fluid - before but could not find the original in any retail store.  i thought it was discontinued - bummer after 30 years of using it, but, of course, i found it on amazon at the best price i had ever paid.  everything about the purchase was smooth and efficient.  the seller did exactly as requested, from timing of delivery to condition of product when received.  i would purchase from them again without a moment&#x27;s hesitation.  amazon rocks!</li>
    <li> I buy this and use this for my face. My face has always been a problem child, dry and peeling. With this stuff I use it right after I wash my face and am then able to keep moisture all day long. It does not leave my face to oily either like most of the other lotions I have tried. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.....It is a good moisturizer and have always been happy with it. My mom used it before me.</li>
    <li> Love this inexpensive hard working Olay product.  My sister has used this for 30 years and her skin is incredibly smooth and wrinkle free!  I started using it just a couple years ago (wish I had started 30 years ago as well...darn!), but it has made a noticeable difference in smoothing out my fine lines.  The lotion soaks right in, is not greasy, and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
    <li> Very good at calming irritated skin and sun burns</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for much in the way of skin care.  I have sensitive skin and most things cause break outs or itchiness.  This hydrating fluid is the best thing ever!  My skin gets really dry in the winter time.  I put this on from forehead to neck after my shower every morning.  My skin just sucks it in.  I put on several layers of it until my skin stops sucking it in.....sounds crazy, but wait until you try it!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily, it just gives my skin the moisture that it needs.  I love it so much!</li>
    <li> I started using this product as face, hand, and body lotion when I moved to the desert in 1981, and the lotions I&#x27;d used before just didn&#x27;t cut it in the dry climate. Still using this, along with the one with the SPF-15 when I&#x27;m spending time in the sun, and the Nite of Olay as additional facial cream, all of which I&#x27;ve used for many years. Will be 60 next month, and my dermatologist says I have great skin. Have never used expensive products, just the Olay basic stuff. Works for me! I finally got to leave the desert 3 years ago after retiring, but will never leave my Olay products!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years...would not change !! It does not leave a heavy greasy feeling...very light .my skin feels fresh and clean after using Olay Beauty Fluid also smells great..overall great product!!</li>
    <li> my girlfriend and love this stuff. great smell. absorbs quickly. gentle to the skin. not greasy. i use it for my face. moisturizes just enough to not be thick on the skin. very light on my skin. i have oily skin, so this is great for me.</li>
    <li> This was a bargain in the 2 for 1 package. This is my best moisturizer - fresh, light, and it smells lovely!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product. My introduced it to me when I was younger and had dry skin around my face. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and has been wonderful for my skin in the -20 degree winter we&#x27;re having! It definitely keeps your skin smooth and hydrated!</li>
    <li> This is my second Olay lotion. I used it for about a month. This item doesn&#x27;t adequately moisturize and is greasy for my combination skin. It makes my dry cheeks greasy and I don&#x27;t need that. I only dab a tiny amount all over face and gently rub in. A few hours later it looks like I took a bath in an oil spill. So gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it works well for my mom, who has normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried Mario Badescu Seaweed Night Cream, and I highly recommend that for oilier skin types. That stuff truly soaks in my skin, and leaves it velvety and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this but sorry to say I will never buy another Olay product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of Olay products but this one was a huge disappointment. There&#x27;s no other word I can find to describe the scent but AWFUL! I also found it to be heavy and oily and generally not suitable for sensitive/acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve only been using this for just over a week and I have 2 of these bottles. I am very reluctant to continue using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read that Proctor &amp; Gamble are one of the worst offenders of animal testing.  I used this many years ago until I read that they burned the eyes and skin of innocent creatures with chemicals and since I&#x27;ve found cruelty free products that work so much better!</li>
    <li> My mom has used this same lotion since she was a teenager, and she has always told me that thanks to Olay her skin is still soft and in great condition. Who am I to argue with a mother&#x27;s wisdom?? I use this every day!</li>
    <li> super light, i wish costco still sold this</li>
    <li> I have used this since I was a teenager and 35 years later I am still using it.  I apply a light coat in the morning before putting on my makeup and have done so almost every day of my life.  I also apply some before bed (only very rarely since my skin tends to be oily) if I need a bit of extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t have as many wrinkles as other people my age (according to my daughter).  Some of that is genetics I am sure, but I do believe this moisturizer plays some part.  It also allows the foundation makeup to go on smoothly and more evenly than if I don&#x27;t apply Oil of Olay first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried some higher-priced products over the years, and I always go back to this.</li>
    <li> I never used a moisturizer when I was younger, but like everyone else, I am aging. My parents have used Olay for as long as I can remember and they look very young for their age. I started using Olay about a year ago and my skin is softer, brighter and healthier. I get a lot of compliments on my skin and my youthfulness appearance. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this product (the 4 oz. two-pack version) on the recommendation of a couple of older acquaintances. They have lovely skin for their age and they swore by the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Oil of Olay. (I&#x27;m no spring chicken either, so that was not a back-handed compliment of any sort.) I will say that the product seems to work. I have a little patch of dry skin between my eyebrows that disappeared when I used this lotion. I also did a little experiment. Over the past two months, whenever I applied it to my face I also applied it to the back of my right hand. There is now a small but noticeable difference in the skin tone between the backs of my hands, with my right hand showing fewer small wrinkles. This lotion is also not oily (although mineral oil and petrolatum are among its ingredients). There may be something in it that irritated another reviewer&#x27;s skin (on the \\&quot;4 oz.\\&quot; page), but it wasn&#x27;t excessive oil. You can tell because it will wash right off of your fingers after application with just water - no soap needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can&#x27;t get past is the fragrance. If it were unscented I would probably give it a 5. I am not allergic to any scents but I do have a pretty acute sense of smell and I just can&#x27;t stomach this one any longer. I am now looking for a good unscented facial moisturizer and I plan to give away the second bottle of the two-pack I bought. If the fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this would be a fine moisturizer.</li>
    <li> exactly want I wanted,</li>
    <li> Great price... I have been using this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> What is there to say, really?  This is the basic Olay moisturizing cream for everyday use.  It&#x27;s not irritating, greasy or smelly.  It&#x27;s simply a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used Oil of Olay some years ago and really liked its hydrating quality and the scent.  However, it seems to leave my face a bit dry now.  (It seems that the product used to contain a little more oil.)  I mixed a few drops of sweet almond oil with the lotion before applying it again, and this provided my skin better hydration.  The lotion still has the same great scent.</li>
    <li> my wife &amp; I both use it, after washing with Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar, I don&#x27;t know why it says add 6 more words - so here!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic value for a great product. Two bottles will last me 9 months so I was very happy.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product initially due to the it&#x27;s heavy mineral oil content. I had used moisturizers with mineral oil before and they lack moisture and hydration. Worse, they clog your pores. I read a lot of good reviews of this product and decided to purchase it anyway. It&#x27;s just like any other cheap moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t do much at all for your skin, and clogs up your pores causing acne. Do youself a favor and purchase a quality aveeno face moisturizer. After switching back to Aveeno my face looks as good as before. It costs around $20 for a small amount but it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might as go to your kitchen cabinet, pull out the vegetable oil, and smear it on your face. Only got 2 stars because of the low cost, but this product really is trash.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used daily for decades.  Texture is light and non-greasy and my face soaks it up but I never \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it there.  Unless Olay does something stupid and changes the formula, I will never use anything else. Another reviewer mentioned disliking the scent; however, I&#x27;ve had allergies and asthma since birth and am very sensitive to perfumes of all kinds, so I always seek out unscented or extremely lightly scented personal care products, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Olay Original in this regard...it&#x27;s never bothered me whatsoever.  If you&#x27;re seeking a time-tested moisturizer that&#x27;s reasonably priced (though certainly not cheap) for what it delivers, try this.</li>
    <li> This was  a great deal on a wonderful product. I will buy again &amp; again. Looked everywhere for this&lt;br /&gt;but either couldn&#x27;t find or was way more expensive. Bought it for someone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m using it too. It&#x27;s also great for men who have sensitive skin &amp; need to shave daily . No skin irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I know there are a lot of higher priced products out there, but I have used this for years and love it!! Not greasy, absorbs well.  Why pay a ton more if the original works just as well?</li>
    <li> Good old Olay...this is a really nice, light moisturizer for daily use.  I use if before I put on my make up.  It soaks in fast and there&#x27;s no weird smell or residue.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this. I was fully prepared to hate it. My skin is very testy and I was worried that it would clog my pores if it was too rich or leave my skin flaky if it wasn&#x27;t rich enough. I think it&#x27;s a wonderful balance. I feel soft, smooth, and supple all day long without being greasy or slimy, and makeup goes on very well over it. Impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it seems like I need a lot of product in order to make it go a long way and spread over my face without pulling on my skin. I don&#x27;t really mind, but it sometimes leaves residue collected around the edges of my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Ok so I was looking for something that was really hydrating because my skin has been on the extra dry side and with my makeup it would be flaking in certain areas of my face so I started looking for a moisturizer that was not going to be so darn expensive. Well this is working out so great on my skin. It leaves my skin so soft and when I apply my makeup it looks great. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft I slide out of bed</li>
    <li> This was a great deal. Two pack for the price of one and they are the larger sized bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, it&#x27;s not greasy and treats the dry area&#x27;s of my face well. My only complaint is that it has too much fragrance. I don&#x27;t mind a little perfumey smell but it&#x27;s a little overbearing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for 20 years. I just love it. It&#x27;s light and smells nice, not too strong. Moisturizes well and absorbs perfectly. It might not have some of the benefits of all the anti aging products - but it really makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> great price full bottle</li>
    <li> Moisturizer. Does as claimed.</li>
    <li> Please keep this product!  And don&#x27;t raise the price</li>
    <li> If there is such a thing as a a perfect moisturizer then this is it!  It gets absorbed into the skin leaving no residue but gives the skin a healthy glow.  I live in a dry climate and I have dry skin, and I have found this brand to be the best over and above other time tested cream brands, including the high end labels.</li>
    <li> I am quite old,but my skin still breaks in pimples.It is awful to have both -pimples and wrinkles.The only lotion that does not irritate my skin ,which smoothes my wrinkles and can be worn day or night,any season,under any makeup, is my tried and true &amp;#34; Original Olay Hydrating Beauty fluid&amp;#34;.In our local wallgreens it cost much more( plus taxes).It is a beautiful bargain ! And did I mention ? I look at least 15 years younger than my biological  age,thanks to this product !!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion to use on my face. Works like a charm in the winter time and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It&#x27;s so gentle I even put it on my lips when they&#x27;re chapped...works better than my chapstick!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! My aunts been using it for years and she looks great! Smooth, creamy and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 50 years and I love it !  My skin, for a 79 year old, looks and feels very good</li>
    <li> very good experience. Product come in time and are in good shape. Thank you! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Poor hydration, old-timey smell, ugly packaging. Not sure why I believed all those raving reviews. It&#x27;s just an old formula it seems. There are better products from the same company as well as other manufacturers.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for something that works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so cheap I can lavish it on my neck. It helps smooth the wrinkles on my face, but it leave my skin feeling slightly suede-like.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way Clinique leaves my skin feeling,but it is sooo expensive I don&#x27;t want to buy it. Anyway I do like this product and would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried SOOOOO MANY moisturizers and this one is simply the best! It&#x27;s so light and gets absorbed fast! great value too!</li>
    <li> Good product I have used for years.</li>
    <li> My face is healthier looking than it has been in a long time.  I used this back in the eighties then it became hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using department store products but always either felt greasy or dried out no matter what I used.  I developed dry patches on several places on my face that I could not get rid of no matter what I tried.  After using Olay several weeks now they are finally gone.  I hope I never have to give original Olay up again.</li>
    <li> This is my old reliable that doesn&#x27;t make me break out like everything with sunscreen.  So glad I could find it.</li>
    <li> as described would buy from again</li>
    <li> Great price for a product I&#x27;ve been using for years and years. My next purchase of Olay is going to be by order from Amazon, for certain. I saved a good bit compared to the prices at box stores. Nice!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for decades, very pleased.</li>
    <li> All the reviews for this product makes it sound magical. Ito does make my skin soft and smooth, but it isn&#x27;t anything amazing. It doesn&#x27;t really improve the condition of my skin. It just keeps it moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best moisturizer i&#x27;ve used so far is the Olay 7-in-1 cooling hydrating moisturizer. AMAZING. And oil free too. The beauty fluid has mineral oil. I don&#x27;t understand why so many products that contain oil claims to not clog pores. Oil clogs pores. period. Only plus side to this one is that it is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews mention their moms and grandmas. Since then, the product has changed, and so if you are reviewing the product because your mom or grandma had no wrinkles, they were using a different formula with the same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product four stars because: it is affordable. It is a high quality product. Hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores (yet). Smells ok, though I would order the scentless, colorless one in the future. Makes my skin silky smooth. Hydrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t improve condition of my skin. (wish it contained vitamin E or something)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Ignore what I have written above, except for the fact that this moisturizer is overrated. In year 2013,I&#x27;ve learned sooo much about skincare. The best moisturizer is the Cerave moisturizing lotion, which contains ceramides, which help the skin repair itself. It is wayyy more affordable than this Olay stuff, and wayyy better. It is scentfree, color free, and contains hyalauronic acid and ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you want to prevent/reduce wrinkles, get something with retinol in it! Make sure that the packaging doesn&#x27;t expose the product to air or light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and I like the consistency, but I usually have to put it on twice to feel hydrated.  I will use this and then try another product.</li>
    <li> I tried couple of other facial moisturizers before this but was not completely satisfied. I was just walking through the aisle in W**mart and spotted this one. I picked it up, came home applied it before I went to bed. I could not believe my skin texture and fthe feel of it in the morning. It was so soft and glowing. That&#x27;s it. I have been using this for 2 years and never want to try anything else. I am a 30 year old Asian female with normal to dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and Olay for keeping up the good work over the years. I am a loyal customer of their skin care products and I just wished that they made organic products as well since that is in nowadays. Great pricing and Amazon always delivers with the widest selection for whatever i am looking for.</li>
    <li> Nicely scented, and easy to apply as it gets absorbed well, and leaves the skin soft and hydrated, even in the cool weather.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Everyone tells me how beautiful my skin is.  I also use the night cream.  Not greasy.  Feels great when you put it on in the morning.  Will now use anything else.</li>
    <li> Used this product for many many years. Love the moisture.  No comparison for the price.</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion.  It is what my mom uses, and what I have used ever since I started using face lotion.  It is nice and smooth, and has a light pleasant scent.  It really feels like it keeps my skin hydrated!</li>
    <li> Ok..so.I took an unofficial poll of people I know who are in their 40&#x27;s, 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s and have beautiful skin. I asked them about their skincare practices and all of them had one thing in common. They all used the original Olay moisturizer. So I bought some and have been using it for approx 2 months. I am 40 years old and have spent 1/2 my life out on the lake in the sun :(  So needless to say, my skin is far from flawless, but my biggest challenge has been finding a moisturizer that I feel does it&#x27;s job without leaving a heavy, greasy layer on my face. My skin is definitely softer and the area under my eyes (you know, the area that starts to look like crinkled tissue paper) looks a lot better! My face used to feel dry just ah hour or so after put on other moisturizers. But that is not my experience with the Olay. I use it morning and night and am very happy with it! I also like the scent of it too.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a guy.  But this product has a strong unpleasant odor.  It does smooth out the wrinkles around the eyes.  I&#x27;ll use it up but will look for something different in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> 5 star rating, must I say more?</li>
    <li> The product is great. You need to try it and see the results.</li>
    <li> Used this product for 50+ years and have the beautiful complexion to show for it.  It is an excellent product..  Worth every penny, plus.</li>
    <li> Great cheap daily face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am past 70 and use this daily - high quality product - takes a very small amount to do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay for forty years.  I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face except cocoa butter on my lips.  I have also had trouble finding the original because the spf version has taken its place.  This is a good price for a good product.  I enjoy the fragrance, it&#x27;s very light and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is the original PINK moisturizer I used years ago.  Most stores only carry the white one with SPF in it.  I had a difficult time locating this product in stores.  If you&#x27;re lucky enough to find it, it&#x27;s usually the 4oz size and it costs more than this item on Amazon.  This order had TWO, 6oz bottles.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin so smooth. i have gotten tons of compliments that my skin looks great. I use it twice daily, and it&#x27;s not oily at all. It smells fresh and clean. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This fluid has the best smell. I was so happy to be able to find the original container. That way I know I have the right thing!</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ver used it for many years</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Olay products. This is a lighter moisturizer than I am used to but it does the job. I have extremely dry skin so I like to lather my moisturizer on :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, (the original Oil of Olay) for years.  Years ago I used to buy a copy of this called &amp;#34;Oil of Nature&amp;#34; at Woolworths and it was every bit as good for a fraction of the price. Since Woolworths went out of business, I&#x27;ve tried every copy of this product that I can find. None even come close. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because of the price. If Woolworths was able to sell a product identical to this for a fraction of the price, I feel this product is over priced. It&#x27;s still a great product. Just wish it were cheaper.</li>
    <li> The product arrived  safely and in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, I would probably order this again, I also bought other products of oil of oly for other areas.</li>
    <li> My face is dry during winter and oily during summer and a mixture in the other seasons. I&#x27;ve tried other face lotions (including Burt&#x27;s bees and Nivea), however I still find this one is still my favorite. It&#x27;s not flawless, but it&#x27;s still one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-does not leave behind oily feeling or residue&lt;br /&gt;-does not cause me to break out&lt;br /&gt;-absorbs into skin fast&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not hydrating enough for very dry skin (during winter, I have to mix this lotion with another, thicker face lotion)</li>
    <li> Olay Active Hydrating fluid is one of the best beauty fluid I have ever used and will continue to use.I would recommend it to all women especially in their late forties and beyond.It is truly .the best.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a  moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t expensive and decided to try this, mainly based on the long history of the brand. I was very disappointed by this product. First of all, I found the smell to be weird and potent for a facial product. Secondly, I tend to have dry skin on my face and this product just wasn&#x27;t rich enough to hydrate and moisturize my skin. My skin didn&#x27;t feel soft afterwards. Instead, the product kind of dried on the top layer of my skin, making it feel like a mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product and bought Nutrogena Naturals multivitamin daily moisturizer instead and I am much happier. It actually makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Same as in the store. Price was okay.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Item received as described.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law only used this and when she passed away at 91 she had no wrinkles. This is all she used and ivory soap...I love this cream and love the smell..</li>
    <li> It is a very good moisturizer,  It keeps skin hydrated.. the only draw back is the parfume.. But the smell wont last for long time while hydrated skin lasts !.</li>
    <li> Used this for years I&#x27;m 63 and don&#x27;t look like it .. I swear by this stuff .. it&#x27;s not greasy either .. my mom worked for Maxfactor and old makeup company from years back and she told me never to use soap on my face and that the closest I should use would be DOVE.. she told me to use Ponds cold cream to take my makeup off and I added the OIL OF OLAY after she died and I think its one of the best things on the market I know that have other products that are supposed to reverse the aging process for a lot more money but since I&#x27;ve used this I&#x27;m 63 and just have a couple laugh lines around my eyes which i think gives you a wise appearance ..no one can guess my age,, I swear by the original basic formula and its not to expensive..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for year and I just turned 60.  Love this product</li>
    <li> I remember my grandmother wearing this. I love it! It&#x27;s not greasy but hydrates my skin perfectly! No need to buy all, the expensive creams. This has always worked or me!</li>
