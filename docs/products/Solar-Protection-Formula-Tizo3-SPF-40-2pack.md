      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask from a suncreen/foundation?</li>
      <li>They gave me samples and I fell in love with the smooth feel and texture.</li>
      <li>I use it in the am insted of makeup, it is silky smooth to the touch and sets to a matte finish.</li>

      <li>I have been using this product since I was 16 years old based on the recommendation of my dermatologist and I am absolutely in love with it!</li>
      <li>but I am fair and have alot of red in my skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light in texture, the tint is just right</li>
      <li>will definitely be ordering more once I run out. :)</li>
      <li>This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve used that actually feels good on your skin instead of sticky and stifling.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>The tint does come off on your clothes but it washes right out</li>
      <li>It smoothes on your face easily and the tinted one gives a natural look so you don&#x27;t need makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout or get inflamed.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product by my waxing salon.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert and have normal skin, with a light to medium complexion depending on the time of year.</li>

      <li>It looks dark (i am very light skinned irish) but it blends in with my skin perectly and actually provides coverage leaving my skin smooth and even toned.</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t got any new brown spots since I started using it.</li>
      <li>I actually like it because it gives a nice tint and coverage instead of turning your face pasty white like other mineral based or zinc based sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>the tint gives a more natural look than the pastey white look other sunscreen creams give you.</li>
      <li>I bought the package of 2 on May 2013, and I still have more then half left one one of them.</li>

      <li>doesn&#x27;t sting when it gets near your eyes.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised to find it at this price</li>
      <li>It is all natural, mineral sunblock.</li>
      <li>I live in South Florida and spend as much time as possible in the water; I&#x27;ve found that absolutely every \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; sunscreen stings my eyes terribly; I check every product via the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website and discovered that all the popular brands off-the-shelf are pretty much toxic in one way or another, and was using Minus-Sol until my dermatologist recommended this stuff; from him - at $38 (saw it at another doctor&#x27;s office for $45!)-</li>
      <li>I found the price outrageous; nevertheless, I tried it and found it to be nothing short of incredible; first, it absolutely feels like silk when I apply it  (that \\&quot;mineral</li>
      <li>First she got at her salon for only $35 for one tube and then found it on Amazon from a different supplier for only $23.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product but is very expensive for a tiny tube.  </li>
      <li>Super expensive but worth it.  </li>
      <li>It gives me much protection than other products.  </li>

<li> Super expensive but worth it.  </li>
<li> It gives me much protection than other products.  </li>
<li> and I like the fact that it is water/sweat resistant for such a long period of time.  </li>
<li> FYI, its tinted and looks fairly dark when you squeeze it out of the tube but its actually quite sheer esp if you use with moisturizer.  </li>
<li> It has a strange consistency and a brownish tint, but that doesn&#x27;t show up on your skin.</li>
<li> &quot; I suppose); it \\&quot;goes a long way,\\&quot;</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s a little dry, and difficult to smooth over your face especially if you have dry skin.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way and one tube will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The item stays very dry on skin all day.  </li>
<li> year round recommended it last year</li>
<li> Another trick: when you can&#x27;t squeeze anymore out of the tube, start cutting the end off an inch at a time - there&#x27;s actually quite a bit of sunscreen still in the tube - no waste!</li>

<li> and I usually don&#x27;t wear anything on my skin because products break me out and give me blackheads.</li>
<li> Hopefully they restock it soon before I run out! :/</li>
<li> and my skin looks as if I don &#x27;t have spf ( hate white lines from other spfs).</li>
<li> I am disappointed because I have purchased this product several times on this site and this time there is a problem with the product.</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> Not greasy or uncomfortable and provides unsurpassed sunscreen protection.  </li>
<li> That is all I know as she is very sick</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great to keep one in your purse and one in your gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;Best sunscreen for face, neck, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Was recommended by my sister who works in the dermatology industry.</li>
    <li> This product really delivers. It has a matte finish and is tinted just enough so I don&#x27;t have to put on any make up. It is waterproof and does protect the skin from the rays.  I have to avoid sun as much as possible because of some medicines I take and this has worked well for me. My daughter, who is fair skinned and swims year round recommended it last year and I have used it regularly since then.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was 16 years old based on the recommendation of my dermatologist and I am absolutely in love with it! It&#x27;s creamy and NOT greasy at all! It gives me great coverage and I feel confident walking out in the sun with it because I know I am protected. Also, the tube last a while! I bought the package of 2 on May 2013, and I still have more then half left one one of them. Love it! Hopefully they restock it soon before I run out! :/</li>
    <li> I like the protection that titanium and zinc offer. My doctor recommends those ingredients. It is a nice texture. However, I prefer TIZO 2 because it doesn&#x27;t have the tint in it that TIZO 3 does.</li>
    <li> I Love Tizo3 but this order was damaged. I am disappointed because I have purchased this product several times on this site and this time there is a problem with the product. I am hopeing to get this issue resolved.</li>
    <li> Super expensive but worth it.  Not greasy or uncomfortable and provides unsurpassed sunscreen protection.  Well worth it and cheaper than plastic surgery later in life</li>
    <li> Mail order arrived promptly.  Love the product!  I&#x27;ve been ordering it online for sometime for the savings and the hassle free shopping.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product by my waxing salon. They gave me samples and I fell in love with the smooth feel and texture. I called the salon to find how much it would be to purchase a tube and they told me $40 for one tube. Thus I went to Amazon to see if I could find it for less. What do you know, Amazon had two tubes for around the same price! I live in the desert and have normal skin, with a light to medium complexion depending on the time of year. I love the product and it has been great for my skin.</li>
    <li> It is all natural, mineral sunblock. It gives great protection and at the same time a little bit of the tint. I break out from every sunscreen product, but Tizo does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this product.  It has a tint and I am fair but it provides a way to have even looking skin without applying makeup!&lt;br /&gt;This tint is for darker skin but I am fair and have alot of red in my skin so I prefer this formula because it provides a nice tint to my skin that gives it an all over glow without having to put makeup on!</li>
    <li> I have used over many years (7 already), and I still love it.  It&#x27;s light in texture, the tint is just right and my skin looks as if I don &#x27;t have spf ( hate white lines from other spfs).</li>
    <li> It has virtually no scent, soaks in immediately for a matte finish and evens out skin tone.  What more could you ask from a suncreen/foundation?</li>
    <li> this product works no matter what color your skin is.  It is wonderful, light but full coverage, and smooth.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to order this skin and sun protection cream for her and I know that she used the product and liked it. That is all I know as she is very sick and I won&#x27;t bother her.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve used that actually feels good on your skin instead of sticky and stifling. It has a strange consistency and a brownish tint, but that doesn&#x27;t show up on your skin. It glides on effortlessly and you don&#x27;t even feel like you are wearing it. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product as I have a lot of sensitivity to skin care and sunscreen items. I tired the white my friend ordered from this site and liked it better than the tinted. Good product though either way.</li>
    <li> Covers well and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  The item stays very dry on skin all day.  I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was recommended by my doctor. It&#x27;s mineral based so provides a physical and I think stronger sun protection than chemical PABA based sunscreens which I&#x27;m allergic to.  It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout or get inflamed.  A little goes a long way and one tube will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is actually more  like a paste. It&#x27;s very matte which is great since it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. The only issue is that bc it&#x27;s so matte, it&#x27;s a little dry, and difficult to smooth over your face especially if you have dry skin. I have to mix it with a bit of moisterizer (Replenix-see my review) and then apply.  FYI, its tinted and looks fairly dark when you squeeze it out of the tube but its actually quite sheer esp if you use with moisturizer.  I actually like it because it gives a nice tint and coverage instead of turning your face pasty white like other mineral based or zinc based sunscreens.  I don&#x27;t use anything else now and my friends have started using it too.  Another trick: when you can&#x27;t squeeze anymore out of the tube, start cutting the end off an inch at a time - there&#x27;s actually quite a bit of sunscreen still in the tube - no waste!</li>
    <li> Very smooth, stays on in water, protects my face and does not look like I have a thick paste of makeup. Great for the beach.</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida and spend as much time as possible in the water; I&#x27;ve found that absolutely every \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; sunscreen stings my eyes terribly; I check every product via the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website and discovered that all the popular brands off-the-shelf are pretty much toxic in one way or another, and was using Minus-Sol until my dermatologist recommended this stuff; from him - at $38 (saw it at another doctor&#x27;s office for $45!)- I found the price outrageous; nevertheless, I tried it and found it to be nothing short of incredible; first, it absolutely feels like silk when I apply it  (that \\&quot;mineral fusion,\\&quot; I suppose); it \\&quot;goes a long way,\\&quot; is truly water-resistant, provides great burn-protection, and did I mention it feels great...lemme see...yeah, it feels like silk!  I was really surprised to find it at this price - Kevin and Skin Boutique have a customer (and friend!) for life.</li>
    <li> Love it. Goes on silky and stays where I put it. I haven&#x27;t got any new brown spots since I started using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but is very expensive for a tiny tube.  Too bad Tizo charges so much for such a small amount of sunscreen.  That&#x27;s what would prevent me from being a constant customer.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed my girlfriend that turn me on to this product informed me that I paid way too much for it.  First she got at her salon for only $35 for one tube and then found it on Amazon from a different supplier for only $23.  So, I don’t feel I can give you 5 stars because it cost way too much…..Sorry.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this product! My dermatoligist recommended it and Iv&#x27;e been using it ever since. I use it in the am insted of makeup, it is silky smooth to the touch and sets to a matte finish. It looks dark (i am very light skinned irish) but it blends in with my skin perectly and actually provides coverage leaving my skin smooth and even toned. It does not break me out at all and I usually don&#x27;t wear anything on my skin because products break me out and give me blackheads. I love tizo products and will absoulutly continue to use them!</li>
    <li> quality product  better price  i have used for years&lt;br /&gt;great price  love this product would recommend to every one .</li>
    <li> I have oily/acne prone skin and have used a lot of sunscreens.  This sunscreen is not oily at all.  I run alot outside and I like the fact that it is water/sweat resistant for such a long period of time.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product has titanium dioxide which has been a proven ingredient in sunscreens to provide the best&lt;br /&gt;coverage. It smoothes on your face easily and the tinted one gives a natural look so you don&#x27;t need makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And the tint gives a more natural look than the pastey white look other sunscreen creams give you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Tizo3!  I don&#x27;t even use foundation anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my shipment very quickly and it was all individually wrapped.  I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering more once I run out. :)</li>
    <li> I have used Solar Protection Formula Tizo3 SPF40 for 2 years.  It gives me much protection than other products.  I love it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t sting when it gets near your eyes. The tint does come off on your clothes but it washes right out</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.  Just enough coverage and easy to apply. Well worth it.</li>
