      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many concealers and this one is a keeper.  </li>
      <li>Goes on white but blends into a perfect match with my skin.  </li>
      <li>; that fades away and you get pretty good coverage without it&#x27;s accentuating the &amp;#34;creepy&amp;#34; lines that some others do.</li>

      <li>Nice product, as described, fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>Great for younger crowd.</li>
      <li>Its great if you need minor coverage though.</li>
      <li>love that it self adjust to my skin tone which is very fair  and hard to match</li>
      <li>so I cannot attest to how it wears over time or looks with a full face of makeup.  </li>
      <li>Probably made more for the thirtysomething age before you get real signs of aging.  </li>
      <li>so I had to throw the practically full tube away.</li>
      <li>In other words, I think it&#x27;d be more suitable for light touch ups.</li>
      <li>I give this product an A+ because it glides on very smoothly and will give your skin a very natural</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and very light skin.</li>
      <li>this concealer honest to goodness blended into my pale/splotchy/red/white face absolutely everywhere, left me with a perfectly even tone, covered my dark eye circles and the really red spots around my nose and mouth.  </li>
      <li>goes on smoothly and completely.</li>
      <li>and it felt soft and light.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>product did not make me look noticeably younger, nor slow any signs of aging that I can tell, but like I said, had excellent moisturizing properties).</li>
      <li>blends easily and leaves skin feeling soft .Doesn&#x27;t seem to accentuate  or settle into the fine lies around my eyes as much as other  concealers .I</li>
      <li>I am really sold on this product.  </li>
      <li>I recently ordered it in the regular formula, and it&#x27;s nice, just not as silkily moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It did feel nice and not too greasy, and required very little fiddling to get to blend.  </li>
      <li>went with the lightest shade of this concealer just to be on the safe side, and it is so dark!  </li>
      <li>last pretty much all day o</li>
      <li>this removes puffy look completely!  </li>
      <li>Too dark for a light concealer.</li>
      <li>the smart shade actually does adjust to your skin tone</li>
      <li>I am certainly fair-skinned, although definitely not pale enough to be porcelain.  </li>
      <li>I get a stream of clear liquid followed by a darker liquid before the skin tone color appears.</li>
      <li>I am 55 years old</li>
      <li>I like to wear this to school for a natural look.</li>
      <li>I only give the extra star because the ingredients were pretty mellow</li>
      <li>I usually go with the second lightest shade of most brands as the lightest gives me a raccoon</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m thinking this smart shade technology has absolutely no bearing because it was not even close to being right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and since it works as a anti-aging cream I don&#x27;t feel bad wearing it all the time....all the time :P</li>
      <li>I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t conceal dark circles very well.</li>
      <li>I can tan without burning, and have both yellow and pink undertones to my skin so finding a matching makeup shade is usually quite easy.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m just sad that I can&#x27;t find this particular shade in the anti-aging formula anymore on Amazon!</li>
<li> I purchased it to cover dark circles and a melanoma on my face</li>
<li> The concealer covers any flaws or dark circles and lasts all day.</li>
<li> It looked so dark brown</li>
<li> And I have dark under-eye circles, too!  </li>
<li> For me it was a waste of money.</li>
<li> There really is not much more I can say about this concealer lol.&lt;br</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
<li> This product is spot on when it comes to matching your skin but its a very thin formula.</li>
<li> What I&#x27;m really unhappy about is the fact that I can no longer use it because the ingredients have separated in the tube.</li>
<li> Depending on how bad your undereye circles are, it probably won&#x27;t cover them up too well.</li>

    <li> This product is spot on when it comes to matching your skin but its a very thin formula. In other words, I think it&#x27;d be more suitable for light touch ups. Depending on how bad your undereye circles are, it probably won&#x27;t cover them up too well. Its great if you need minor coverage though.</li>
    <li> I love this make-up, can&#x27;t even tell you have it on, plus it has sunscreen in the ingredients which are good for your skin</li>
    <li> Too dark for a light concealer.</li>
    <li> Goes on white but blends into a perfect match with my skin.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about having lighter patches under my eyes (and in other places) that don&#x27;t match the rest of my skin which is what happens with every other concealer I have used.  I&#x27;m sold and buying the makeup now!</li>
    <li> Shipping was very quick, within 4 days. The product is creamy and goes on like foundation but lighter. I like to wear this to school for a natural look.</li>
    <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I am certainly fair-skinned, although definitely not pale enough to be porcelain.  I can tan without burning, and have both yellow and pink undertones to my skin so finding a matching makeup shade is usually quite easy.  I usually go with the second lightest shade of most brands as the lightest gives me a raccoon effect.&lt;br /&gt;I went with the lightest shade of this concealer just to be on the safe side, and it is so dark!  And I have dark under-eye circles, too!  It looked so dark brown, I cannot believe this is the lightest shade.  Also, I&#x27;m thinking this smart shade technology has absolutely no bearing because it was not even close to being right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I didn&#x27;t continue wearing the product so I cannot attest to how it wears over time or looks with a full face of makeup.  It did feel nice and not too greasy, and required very little fiddling to get to blend.  I give 2 stars because of how unhappy I am with having purchased the lightest shade, it not working, and not being able to return.  I only give the extra star because the ingredients were pretty mellow and it felt soft and light.</li>
    <li> I am really sold on this product.  It comes out of the tube very, very white.  It only takes a little bit of product.  When you dab it on your skin it miraculously changes color to match your skin and hide your blemish.  I will ALWAYS have this product in my line-up of necessary items.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be comparable to Almay&#x27;s stick concealer but it doesn&#x27;t blend as well.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t conceal dark circles very well.</li>
    <li> There really is not much more I can say about this concealer lol.&lt;br /&gt;It stays where I put it and last pretty much all day o and it conceals things. :D</li>
    <li> Note:  I did not buy this product from an Amazon retailer&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product less than six months ago to conceal the occasional blemish. It worked so-so for that purpose. What I&#x27;m really unhappy about is the fact that I can no longer use it because the ingredients have separated in the tube. I get a stream of clear liquid followed by a darker liquid before the skin tone color appears. I can&#x27;t remix the ingredients as if they were in a bottle so I had to throw the practically full tube away. For me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve used thus far.  Don&#x27;t be concerned when it goes on white (very white!); that fades away and you get pretty good coverage without it&#x27;s accentuating the &amp;#34;creepy&amp;#34; lines that some others do.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to be able to get this product. nowhere to be found in stores. covers any blemishes, especially age spots.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I was extremely skeptical about the whole &amp;#34;smart shade technology&amp;#34; schtick and was a bit concerned that I would come out looking like I&#x27;d been striped up to play football, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they mean what they say -- this concealer honest to goodness blended into my pale/splotchy/red/white face absolutely everywhere, left me with a perfectly even tone, covered my dark eye circles and the really red spots around my nose and mouth.  I&#x27;m just sad that I can&#x27;t find this particular shade in the anti-aging formula anymore on Amazon! I recently ordered it in the regular formula, and it&#x27;s nice, just not as silkily moisturizing.  (Disclaimer:  product did not make me look noticeably younger, nor slow any signs of aging that I can tell, but like I said, had excellent moisturizing properties).</li>
    <li> This product is a great fine!  I&#x27;ve tried so many concealers and this one is a keeper.  I will buy this again and again.  I am very light colored and this concealer in light, works perfectly w/out looking like I&#x27;ve painted areas on my face.</li>
    <li> If you need a little extra cover up under eyes or anyway else, this is the ticket. Sometimes I just use it on those areas and nothing else. I have sensitive skin and very light skin. Works great for me. ;)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  I like it&#x27;s applicability and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Works great as a concealer can even been used as light coverage foundation if needed. I love it. Only wish that was bigger packaging and product.</li>
    <li> love it.  goes on my face easily, doesnt cake or smudge.  i prefer this line over all of the others i have used.  no creasing, stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference in this one vs my other concealers.  They all seem to emphasize age lines.  Probably made more for the thirtysomething age before you get real signs of aging.  Great for younger crowd.</li>
    <li> Tried everything on earth...this removes puffy look completely!  Want to buy 1000 of them!</li>
    <li> blends easily and leaves skin feeling soft .Doesn&#x27;t seem to accentuate  or settle into the fine lies around my eyes as much as other  concealers .I love that it self adjust to my skin tone which is very fair  and hard to match</li>
    <li> Nice product, as described, fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I have so many concealer, but they are so dense that makes me look like I have wrinkles, or they are too liquid and useless. This one is perfect! and since it works as a anti-aging cream I don&#x27;t feel bad wearing it all the time....all the time :P</li>
    <li> I purchased it to cover dark circles and a melanoma on my face it did not work as well I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I use just a bit of the product and blend with a makeup sponge. The concealer covers any flaws or dark circles and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I hate this product.  It is white with no hint of beige.  I&#x27;m fair-skinned....but not paper white!  I tried it anyway and it makes my under eye area look grey.  The lack of beige makes this unusable to cover the occasional pimple.  Will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I give this product an A+ because it glides on very smoothly and will give your skin a very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;It is very effective at covering up darkness under the eyes and I also wear it on my eyelids as a primer before I apply my powder&lt;br /&gt;eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small tube and some people might hesitate because it is a few dollars more than Almay&#x27;s other concealing products.&lt;br /&gt;But I won&#x27;t switch because of the quality of the product. I am 55 years old and I have taken very good care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount, which I squeeze onto the tip of my ring finger and apply carefully (dab on) to the under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;If you are fair skinned, you will want to buy the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade. It comes out of the tube snow white but when it is applied to the skin it will match your skin tone.  It also comes in a medium shade.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Nice product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> handy to have delivered to my door as I kept forgetting to replenish my concealer. the smart shade actually does adjust to your skin tone and I like the cream&#x27;s feel. goes on smoothly and completely.</li>
