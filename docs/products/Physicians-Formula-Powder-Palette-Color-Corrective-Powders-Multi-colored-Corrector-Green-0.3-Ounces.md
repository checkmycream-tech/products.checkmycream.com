### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>An excellent product.</li>
      <li>Best for dealing with redness</li>
      <li>It is great!</li>
      <li>and it works wonderfully for me.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and have redness on my cheeks</li>
      <li>A great powder.</li>
      <li>Works great...</li>
      <li>I thought this product would be great to reduce the redness on my face.</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>The price is fair.</li>
      <li>after some trial and error in how and when I applied this, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
      <li>Happy it is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>My skin has a ruddy tone at times Nd this powder balances that out nicely.</li>
      <li>Because my skin is very prone to breakouts, I decided this probably wouldn&#x27;t be the best product to try.</li>
      <li>It does conceal redness, but you can kind of tell there&#x27;s powder on your face.  </li>
      <li>Formula over where I have the most redness (T-zone, nose, and chin).</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect cover for red or ruddy skin.</li>
      <li>I have even flirted with buying an illuminator or blush, to bring a bit more color to my face (something I never would have wanted before).</li>
      <li>but I found something better.  </li>
      <li>It lasts most of the day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an awesome powder to counteract the red on my face.</li>
      <li>Powder goes on easily and does conceal most of the redness.</li>
      <li>I recommend their muti colored powder which works really well, even better than Clinique&#x27;s redness reducing powder (and it&#x27;s cheaper too)!</li>
      <li>I will keep searching for the perfect green color correcter.</li>
      <li>Foundation goes on smoothly over the powder.</li>
      <li>This is truly a fantastic product, and it is well worth the price!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine though if you need a quick fix.     </li>
      <li>The green powder counteracts the redness leading to flawlessly beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then, though my face is somewhat more evened out, I apply a light powder over the areas of my face that are not red (like my forehead, nose, and under eyes), to set the makeup and prevent shine.</li>
      <li>Because of the price of the product (about $14.00), I thought I would check out some reviews online first to see if it was worth the money.    </li>
      <li>On days when I want to look my best, I use this then I use bronzer on top because the Physicians Formula does make your skin appear a little lighter and at times green if you put too much on.</li>
      <li>Fine from far away</li>
      <li>But many of the correctors out there have yellow built in.</li>
      <li>I first saw this product in CVS and was interested in purchasing it.</li>
      <li>When I first used this product, I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  </li>
      <li>However, PF stopped making the stick form of their color correction in favor of this, and at first I did not care for it.  </li>
      <li>However, now I love it and recommend it to my friends who have the same issues.  </li>
      <li>I was able to transfer the powder to a different container and still use it.</li>
      <li>This powder does a great job helping to tone down the redness of my rosacea, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It only takes a very small amount of this to get the best results.  </li>
      <li>I have a great deal of redness in my face everyday due to rocesea and this does a great job of toning that down.  </li>
      <li>A larger brush would be fine as well.  </li>
      <li>I use the green one to retouch my face for rosacea, it works very good, just need to be careful not to have to much in the brush</li>
      <li>Bought this in a fit of desperation after running out of my oil free MAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer in green.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this green tint easily locally and was happy to find it here.</li>
      <li>Also works well for absorbing shine and setting makeup.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes that this device would work, but it did not work!</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>I simply apply a bit more of the powder with a fluffy brush to disperse the powder more evenly and feather</li>
      <li>I ordered two because it&#x27;s not always available in my  local drugstore.  </li>
      <li>- in addition to the redness I have very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>It really works</li>
      <li>Also I love how the little brush slides right in under the powder.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the results as it definitely seemed to minimize the red areas.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
      <li>Definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re willing to spend the money.. it does help!</li>
      <li>I have fair skin with a very pink undertone, and I often find my face gets red and blotchy in the middle of the work day.</li>
      <li>it is worth noting that the flat brush gives a heavier coverage than a kabuki-style brush.</li>
      <li>One of the Main claims this product has is that it will look natural.</li>
      <li>Recently I had my whole nose operated on by a Mohs surgeon and it turned out very well except my nose is noticeably redder than the rest of my face.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to people who have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It covers all my redness and my skin looks natural!</li>
      <li>I use it right after I apply moisturizer, and before I apply foundation and blush and loose powder.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t feel self conscious.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Delivers a natural Matte finish&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It really helps red spots!</li>
      <li>However, it came completely cracked.</li>
      <li>It neutralizes red spots, and blends colored makeup very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d imagine a larger fluffy brush would be better, and I will have to look into purchasing one.     </li>
      <li>I apply this with a large brush - not the brush that comes with it, that one is too flat and doesn&#x27;t distribute the powder evenly.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if you use a very little amount and had a different skin tone, it would be better?  </li>
      <li>I thought the color would be more subtle.</li>
      <li>My advice is to use a larger brush, small amount of powder, apply after foundation and apply a face powder on top.</li>
      <li>Long behold, right next to this product, there was a Talc-free version.   </li>
      <li>Kind of hard because I have red and yellow undertones, which means I need a green/blue corrector.</li>
      <li>It would simply be too green and light.  </li>
      <li>If I applied too much, I could see hints of the powder on my face, so really you only need a little bit.  </li>
      <li>Instead of a Green-mosaic pattern, there are simply light green splotches mixed with a translucent white color.</li>
      <li>I use several Physicians Formula products because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>After using the flat brush for application, my redness is almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>This is only facial powder that I have found that will completely cover the redness on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>Major difference in the red areas of my face.</li>
      <li>The talc-free version is a very light green color, and the white helps balance the green color as well.    </li>

<li> have found that this product is very long lasting and keeps my facial redness away even in the (112 degree summer!)</li>
<li> It does have to be used sparingly - too much and your face feels dry, pores are visible, and the green is visible.</li>
<li> The brush is rather flat and does not evenly disperse the powder.</li>
<li> The next time I visited CVS, I looked in the Physician Formula section again to see if there were any other similar products.</li>
<li> Just a little bit keeps my ruddy skin clear and even.</li>
<li> so I tried the mixture powder with the pink and yellow too and it doesn&#x27;t cover the redness as well.</li>
<li> The one I received was not mixed with pink tones..</li>
<li> I like the Make UP FOR EVER better, BUT it&#x27;s sooo expensive and comes in such wasteful, heavy packaging.</li>
<li> Other reviewers have mentioned the tiny brush; well, I did not even bother with that.  </li>
<li> This dried my skin out a little too much.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately this turned my nose white / light green?  </li>
<li> apply a light moisturizer, then apply either a face primer or BB cream (since this product covers the redness, heavy foundation is unnecessary), as well as minimal concealer where needed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product I got from Amazon was busted into tiny pieces and not usable.  Either it was very old or was carelessly handled. I like the product, though, and have since bought this at the drug store.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect cover for red or ruddy skin. You can control the amount of powder, and the shade, when running the enclosed brush across the multi-colored powder. Apply the green tinted powder to the reddish areas and then follow up with your usual face make-up. The green powder counteracts the redness leading to flawlessly beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for rosacea redness, if approved by your medical provider.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d throw this review out there because this is probably a product a lot of people are hesitant about trying (I know I was a little skeptical, but hopeful).    I first saw this product in CVS and was interested in purchasing it. I have fair skin with a very pink undertone, and I often find my face gets red and blotchy in the middle of the work day. Because of the price of the product (about $14.00), I thought I would check out some reviews online first to see if it was worth the money.    I read mixed reviews, and saw a lot of complaints about the product containing Talc. Because my skin is very prone to breakouts, I decided this probably wouldn&#x27;t be the best product to try. The next time I visited CVS, I looked in the Physician Formula section again to see if there were any other similar products. Long behold, right next to this product, there was a Talc-free version.   The Talc-free version is a little different. Instead of a Green-mosaic pattern, there are simply light green splotches mixed with a translucent white color. Other reviewers complained of the concentration of color in the mosaic product. The talc-free version is a very light green color, and the white helps balance the green color as well.    I decided to go ahead and buy the product in the store. I applied my regular liquid foundation and mineral powder, then dusted a little of the Physicians Formula over where I have the most redness (T-zone, nose, and chin). I was pleased with the results as it definitely seemed to minimize the red areas. If I applied too much, I could see hints of the powder on my face, so really you only need a little bit.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is I&#x27;m not very fond of the brush it came with. The brush is rather flat and does not evenly disperse the powder. I&#x27;d imagine a larger fluffy brush would be better, and I will have to look into purchasing one.     Definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re willing to spend the money.. it does help!</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of surgery done on my face because of basal cell cancers.  Recently I had my whole nose operated on by a Mohs surgeon and it turned out very well except my nose is noticeably redder than the rest of my face.  I find that a dusting of this powder helps to tone it down so that it matches the rest of the flesh on my face and I don&#x27;t feel self conscious.  It really helps red spots!</li>
    <li> I wished it would have worked!  I had high hopes that this device would work, but it did not work!</li>
    <li> I have a great deal of redness in my face everyday due to rocesea and this does a great job of toning that down.  I use a different bigger brush than the one that comes with it.  After applying it I do need to use bronzer under my cheekbones to add definition.  I would not recommend this for people with darker skin or who do not have flushing.  It would simply be too green and light.  I have very fair skin and it works wonderfully for me.  I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore so I tried the mixture powder with the pink and yellow too and it doesn&#x27;t cover the redness as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this in a fit of desperation after running out of my oil free MAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer in green. It does conceal redness, but you can kind of tell there&#x27;s powder on your face.  Fine from far away but I can tell close up that I have it on. It&#x27;s fine though if you need a quick fix.     I like the Make UP FOR EVER better, BUT it&#x27;s sooo expensive and comes in such wasteful, heavy packaging. Plus the pump never seems to work for me. I will keep searching for the perfect green color correcter. Kind of hard because I have red and yellow undertones, which means I need a green/blue corrector. But many of the correctors out there have yellow built in.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I have very fair skin and have redness on my cheeks and so when I saw this in the store, I knew I had to try it since green neutralizes red. It covers all my redness and my skin looks natural! However, my redness is not severe so if your skin is really red, you may have to add foundation (this is only a base to get you started). On days when I want to look my best, I use this then I use bronzer on top because the Physicians Formula does make your skin appear a little lighter and at times green if you put too much on. I always get complements about my skin when I add the Physicians Formula and the bronzer together. Definitely recommend this product, because it does work!</li>
    <li> This is only facial powder that I have found that will completely cover the redness on my cheeks.  Have been using this for years.  When I can&#x27;t find it in the stores, I buy it on line.</li>
    <li> Turned my face green, made me look like the Wicked Witch of the East. I thought the color would be more subtle.</li>
    <li> girlfrend looks green</li>
    <li> Covers redness very well, but BEWARE: it has a faint shimmer to it. Would be five stars without the shimmer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It neutralizes red spots, and blends colored makeup very well. You only need a dusting though, as if you over do, yes it will look green.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit keeps my ruddy skin clear and even. Also works well for absorbing shine and setting makeup.</li>
    <li> Works great... Just don&#x27;t use too much. It left me with a green hue.</li>
    <li> Hides the red, doesn&#x27;t cake up or irritate</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on reviews that this helps hide the redness in my face.  It does work but I found something better.  This dried my skin out a little too much.  If you have dry skin, not a good idea to buy this.</li>
    <li> Very nice. It really works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome powder to counteract the red on my face. However, it came completely cracked. I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> I use the green one to retouch my face for rosacea, it works very good, just need to be careful not to have to much in the brush</li>
    <li> My cheeks (and chin, to a lesser extent) are quite red and blotchy. I have tried for years to find products that would minimize the redness, and none have worked. Foundations always end up looking caked on, and powders are always too sheer. However, this Physician&#x27;s Formula green mosaic is a godsend! Maybe I have been applying it differently than other reviewers, but I have not experienced a green cast or any unsatisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a light moisturizer, then apply either a face primer or BB cream (since this product covers the redness, heavy foundation is unnecessary), as well as minimal concealer where needed. Then, though my face is somewhat more evened out, I apply a light powder over the areas of my face that are not red (like my forehead, nose, and under eyes), to set the makeup and prevent shine. Lastly, I use the flat brush that comes with this powder to apply it to my cheeks and chin- it is worth noting that the flat brush gives a heavier coverage than a kabuki-style brush. After using the flat brush for application, my redness is almost completely gone. I simply apply a bit more of the powder with a fluffy brush to disperse the powder more evenly and feather the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that this product is very long lasting and keeps my facial redness away even in the (112 degree summer!) heat! I have even flirted with buying an illuminator or blush, to bring a bit more color to my face (something I never would have wanted before). This is truly a fantastic product, and it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Always like this product, which is why I searched for it on line when my local store stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> This powder does a great job helping to tone down the redness of my rosacea, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to put this on my face to know I do NOT like this product. One of the Main claims this product has is that it will look natural. &amp;#34;Delivers a natural Matte finish&amp;#34;. Now tell me WHY this powder is sparkly! There is glitter everywhere! How is sparkles &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t even know if the green counteracts The redness because I refuse to look like a discoball! I had high hopes for this. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best for dealing with redness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it has always met my expectations. I will continue using it. It is great!</li>
    <li> A great powder. Happy it is fragrance free. My skin has a ruddy tone at times Nd this powder balances that out nicely. It blends in invisibly. I will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> This helps eliminate the redness around my eyes and on my cheeks. It&#x27;s gentle and so I can use it everyday.  I reccomend this to every woman with this redness on the cheeks and eye area.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product, I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It seemed to make my face look pale and, well, green . . . you could tell that I used a green powder.  HOWEVER . . . after some trial and error in how and when I applied this, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I have rosacea and my face always looks red, especially around my nose.  I apply this with a large brush - not the brush that comes with it, that one is too flat and doesn&#x27;t distribute the powder evenly.  I apply this powder after I have applied foundation and then I apply a pressed powder after I have applied this corrector.  I have found that it also helps to reduce the amount of oil on my face as well, probably because of the talc - in addition to the redness I have very oily skin.  It only takes a very small amount of this to get the best results.  My advice is to use a larger brush, small amount of powder, apply after foundation and apply a face powder on top.</li>
    <li> This causes me to look green. Even if I use it under make up. I am trying to cover the excess red... But I don&#x27;t want to be green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have played around with it, and VERY careful use under another powder can help with the redness. It takes a lot of trial and error.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be great to reduce the redness on my face. However, it&#x27;s a little too green. I end up with a pasty look. I recommend their muti colored powder which works really well, even better than Clinique&#x27;s redness reducing powder (and it&#x27;s cheaper too)!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does have to be used sparingly - too much and your face feels dry, pores are visible, and the green is visible. It lasts most of the day.  Major difference in the red areas of my face.</li>
    <li> I use several Physicians Formula products because I have sensitive skin.  I use this blend every day to cover roseaca.  I ordered two because it&#x27;s not always available in my  local drugstore.  Poor packaging resulted in one being crumbled.  I was able to transfer the powder to a different container and still use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS. It evens out redness in my face from excessive dryness and acne. It does not look green whatsoever on your face. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this turned my nose white / light green?  The one I received was not mixed with pink tones.. All green (light/dark) colors?  Maybe if you use a very little amount and had a different skin tone, it would be better?  For me it was very obvious I had powder on my nose!</li>
    <li> This product helps me a lot with evening out my skin color and take away the reddish blushing look to my face. I would highly recommend this product to people who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Completely evens out my pink complexion. Also I love how the little brush slides right in under the powder.</li>
    <li> My face is prone to redness in the T-zone, and I have been using color correction for years.  However, PF stopped making the stick form of their color correction in favor of this, and at first I did not care for it.  (I use the one with all shades of green and white.)  However, now I love it and recommend it to my friends who have the same issues.  Other reviewers have mentioned the tiny brush; well, I did not even bother with that.  I use half a cotton ball to apply the powder, and this works well for me.  A larger brush would be fine as well.  I use it right after I apply moisturizer, and before I apply foundation and blush and loose powder.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Use to cover redness on cheeks, then use a foundation. Powder goes on easily and does conceal most of the redness. Foundation goes on smoothly over the powder. I couldn&#x27;t find this green tint easily locally and was happy to find it here. The price is fair. It arrived intact. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and doesn&#x27;t smell perfumy.</li>
