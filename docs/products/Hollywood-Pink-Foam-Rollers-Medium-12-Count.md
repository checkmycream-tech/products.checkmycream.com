<li> These rollers were so dense that it was next to impossible to even wrap my hair around a roller.</li>
<li> I ordered these rollers for my mother (she has used this type my entire life) but was disappointed with the sizes.  </li>
<li> I bought the medium size and was disappointed at how small these are.  </li>
<li> I use a Ricard Caruso hair setter and curlers &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; these work well with this setter---but unlike the foam rollers they used to make--these are very poor quality and fall apart  while you wind your hair.  </li>
<li> so I use the foam part of these---and throw the base away that came from Amazon (or their client)</li>
<li> The clip separates from the base.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Have been using this product for dozens of years, with dwindling resources to purchase them from. Wish they were still made in the USA</li>
    <li> This product is very user friendly. They are easy to put in and comfortable to sleep with them on. I would recommend them to anyone. :D</li>
    <li> Guess this is just another instance of you get what you pay for.  The foam on these rollers is not very dense and does not do a good job of forming curls.  I would advise against buy these curlers.</li>
    <li> These rollers were a gift for someone. She loved them but I do not think has used them yet. They were smaller than I thought they were going to be.</li>
    <li> These rollers were so dense that it was next to impossible to even wrap my hair around a roller. The hair just kept sliding off. Also the clips  were way too big!  The clips looked like they were for a 2\\&quot; or 2 1&#x27;2\\&quot; roller. I had some extra small rollers that I took the clips out of and used them with the Hollywoods, that at least helped. I will never buy Hollywoods again.  Does, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; ring a bell.</li>

I reordered a second set.</li>
