### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Not the best fuzz shaver I have ever owned,</li>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>LUCKILY THEY ARE AFFORDABLE!!!!!  </li>
      <li>but the RTFS-2 is awesome.</li>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and works great!</li>
      <li>Just hoping what was sent works just as good!</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>This device removes pills on fabric beautifully.</li>
      <li>Happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Very handy.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best pill shaver I&#x27;ve used and is easy to hold.</li>
      <li>The Remington travel fabric shaved works great on getting MOST of the piling off!</li>
      <li>I think this would be a good backup, or even better, a good one to take with you in traveling.  </li>
      <li>the compact size is perfect &amp; more importantly</li>
      <li>I love this thing!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>, I know she is going to love it!</li>
      <li>Powerfull ...very handy.....</li>
      <li>the joy of removing all the pills from a beloved garment that looked wretched and now looks new!</li>
      <li>This product took the threads right off and the seat looks great again.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, the correct model is way more stylish than the one pictured, IMO.</li>
      <li>I had fuzz all over my favorite shirt, a lint roller didn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied with my Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver.</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>It had so many pils on it from fuzzy sweaters</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>but I was creative to find a way to continue use.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love that I can take it anywhere</li>
      <li>Just make sure you put your garments completely flat (an ironing board is the best place)</li>
      <li>The holes seem a reasonable size to me on this device and the power level seems good.</li>
      <li>... maybe it&#x27;s best to just pay a little more and buy the RTFS-2?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to use the fuzz shaver as the lint holder very easily comes off...not a great design!</li>
      <li>This little guy is totally awesome.</li>
      <li>This little shaver is wonderful!</li>
      <li>This thing is totally worth 10 bucks and works wonders!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>box sent a similar item in replacement of th pictured item it is not as good Tool box said once it was opened it could not be returned</li>
      <li>Not the same as the picture but still good</li>
      <li>If you want something that will be quick, look for one with a bigger shaving head, but this is good in a pinch or while traveling.</li>
      <li>excellent little machine, does the job very well, would fully recommend proves the point, always buy products with a known name</li>
      <li>Love the feel of no bunches on it, and cleaned it completely!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, but it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
      <li>Here I am, to order more, another one for the both of us (using the old ones for spare parts)  </li>
      <li>Not much power and fairly ineffective.</li>
      <li>Aww</li>
      <li>Works very good and battery lasts long enough</li>
      <li>The only think I don&#x27;t like about it is that the cover that holds the lint, comes off very easily.</li>
      <li>The one I got works well but the back and the front where the fuzz goes keeps coming off very easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty small, but it did a pretty good job, considering its size!  </li>
      <li>This thing barely picks up the pills on your clothes and to top it off when it did pick one up...</li>
      <li>The main problem with this is that even though it does a pretty good job, the shaving head is pretty small and it took forever on a pair of pants I had to do (I use them mostly on knit clothing, not sweaters).  </li>
      <li>It works well, is easy to use, and easy to empty.</li>
      <li>Wore an Evan Picone knit dress for the first time and my car&#x27;s seat belt picked the fabric.</li>
      <li>This shaver is much higher quality than the others in this price range.</li>
      <li>The machine works ok overall but get stuck or hung up on pills.</li>
      <li>I know exactly what happened.</li>
      <li>Where has this been my whole life!</li>
      <li>This easy-to-use, well designed gadget saved my new hoodie which was full of pills after laundering.  </li>
      <li>Sweaters that looked old and frumpy look clean and crisp now.</li>
      <li>This is nice to get the lint pills off of my sweaters but careful because clothes will get caught in the spinning blades making holes in clothing!!</li>
      <li>My friends made fun of me because I thought it was a new thing...</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this item!</li>
      <li>This little tool worked quickly and was easy to use.</li>
      <li>It takes a while to do a whole sweater, but it really does make them look like new.</li>
      <li>Restored my pilled up clothes to like new condition!</li>
      <li>My last one was better, but apparently they don&#x27;t make them anymore, so I&#x27;m gonna stick with this until I find one to really replace the old one.  </li>
      <li>They both worked great for first few days, snagged a little, but we just needed to get use to the machines...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other fabric shavers in this price range and they were cheap plastic, which broke easily when trying to empty the shaved fabric or change the batteries.  </li>
      <li>This works beautifully, much better than the one I had previously which had a larger &amp;#34;head.&amp;#34; It is also easy to hold (which was not apparent from the picture).  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something I wasnt going to use very often and this little razor fit the bill.</li>
      <li>It makes clothes look like new.</li>
      <li>The pulled fabric were immediately removed and the dress looks new again.</li>
      <li>When I was finally done, it looked good, just takes a long time because the head is pretty small.  </li>
      <li>Works well so far!  </li>
      <li>But it made my 9 year old wool coat look new.</li>
      <li>Makes all my old sweaters look new.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat spending $12 as opposed to near $100 for a new coat.</li>
      <li>I am only giving this product 4 stars because to maintain adequate power, frequent battery changes are necessary.</li>
      <li>and I mean the big chunky kind</li>
      <li>But If one is not careful to avoid seams or fails to flatten fabric absolutely it will cut a hole by catching fabric and pulling it temporarily into the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Since the lint trap comes off so quickly, there is always little lint balls in my purse.</li>
      <li>This little guy quickly removes fuzz and &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; from clothes.</li>
      <li>I was pushing down WAY too hard to try to get an item super smooth.</li>
      <li>the shape is different on the new model but it works as well as ever to remove fuzz and pilling.</li>
      <li>I had to buy a new one because my old one (different, not the same) broke when I accidentally dropped it.  </li>
      <li>I titled this the \\&quot;little engine that could\\&quot; because that was my first thought using this.  </li>
      <li>we also had a lot of catching up to do on the laundry, so maybe we simply over-worked the poor little buggers.  </li>

<li> It eats through mountains of fuzz in no time flat.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have any prior experience with fabric or clothes shavers, but this little one did just what I was hoping - gave my wool coat a second life.  </li>
<li> Blades do not seem sharp enough, will not remove all the lint away</li>
<li> It&#x27;s only February, so they only lasted a few months.</li>
<li> I bought this product because I had a clump of loose threads on my drivers side front seat of my mustang from getting in and out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS SAME ITEM I ORDERED, ANOTHER TYPE WAS SENT TO ME.&lt;br /&gt;THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS O.K. BUT PREFERRED TO HAVE GOT THE ONE I ORDERED.</li>
    <li> The person who gave this thing a bad review must not own this model or something. This thing is totally worth 10 bucks and works wonders! I own a lot of shirts that are cotton and rayon and where I carry my purse (typically my left shoulder) tons of my tops and dresses tend to \\&quot;pill\\&quot; terribly in that area. I had clothes that I couldn&#x27;t wear for years because of this. This little guy is totally awesome. Just make sure you put your garments completely flat (an ironing board is the best place) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> The machine works ok overall but get stuck or hung up on pills. Be careful with delicate items because a hole can develop if not careful.</li>
    <li> This thing barely picks up the pills on your clothes and to top it off when it did pick one up...it tore a hole in my sweater!! Urgh! Buy a different brand, this one sucks.</li>
    <li> I bought one for me, and one for my mom this Christmas. They both worked great for first few days, snagged a little, but we just needed to get use to the machines...  on mine, the lint tray broke but I was creative to find a way to continue use. My moms broke the metal-grate cover, and now blades scrape on it and it snags, rendered unusable! :(  It&#x27;s only February, so they only lasted a few months. BUT- we also had a lot of catching up to do on the laundry, so maybe we simply over-worked the poor little buggers.  LUCKILY THEY ARE AFFORDABLE!!!!!  Here I am, to order more, another one for the both of us (using the old ones for spare parts)  We will see how this goes...</li>
    <li> I use this product on a monthly basis - not daily, I have never had a problem with getting rid of the little pill balls on my clothes.  I bought this as a gift for a teen, I know she is going to love it!</li>
    <li> Not the same as the picture but still good</li>
    <li> I am quite satisfied with my Fuzz Away Fabric Shaver. It eats through mountains of fuzz in no time flat. I am only giving this product 4 stars because to maintain adequate power, frequent battery changes are necessary. We use rechargeables in my house, so this wasn&#x27;t a massive problem, but it wasn&#x27;t convenient either. A wall plug just wouldn&#x27;t be practical for this small of a device, so I wouldn&#x27;t even wish one was included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE** The safety screen on my unit failed after about 50 uses. I know exactly what happened. User error. I was pushing down WAY too hard to try to get an item super smooth. Nevertheless, Remington replaced the ENTIRE UNIT for me. This \\&quot;failure\\&quot; on my part in no way affects my rating of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE**  The product image on the seller&#x27;s page is NOT the device that you will receive. It is the one in the photos that have been added by other users. Honestly, the correct model is way more stylish than the one pictured, IMO.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Restored my pilled up clothes to like new condition! I was tired of retiring some of my favorite clothes due to pilling and sweater fuzzes, but after purchasing this I don&#x27;t have to part with them. I HIGHLY recommend this item!</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase. Didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something I wasnt going to use very often and this little razor fit the bill. Works well, may take a little longer to get the job done, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works very good and battery lasts long enough</li>
    <li> It takes a while to do a whole sweater, but it really does make them look like new. Sweaters that looked old and frumpy look clean and crisp now.</li>
    <li> The Remington travel fabric shaved works great on getting MOST of the piling off! I love it! Just be careful on the edges not to destroy the fabric like I did....oops!hmm</li>
    <li> I titled this the \\&quot;little engine that could\\&quot; because that was my first thought using this.  It&#x27;s really pretty small, but it did a pretty good job, considering its size!  I had to buy a new one because my old one (different, not the same) broke when I accidentally dropped it.  I think this would be a good backup, or even better, a good one to take with you in traveling.  My last one was better, but apparently they don&#x27;t make them anymore, so I&#x27;m gonna stick with this until I find one to really replace the old one.  The main problem with this is that even though it does a pretty good job, the shaving head is pretty small and it took forever on a pair of pants I had to do (I use them mostly on knit clothing, not sweaters).  When I was finally done, it looked good, just takes a long time because the head is pretty small.  If you want something that will be quick, look for one with a bigger shaving head, but this is good in a pinch or while traveling.</li>
    <li> Hard to hold and not remove battery and canister. But it made my 9 year old wool coat look new. Love the feel of no bunches on it, and cleaned it completely! My friends made fun of me because I thought it was a new thing...</li>
    <li> It works great! It doesn&#x27;t look like it does in the picture posted. The only think I don&#x27;t like about it is that the cover that holds the lint, comes off very easily. I bought this to carry in my purse as my work pants get fuzzes all the time. Since the lint trap comes off so quickly, there is always little lint balls in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is nice to get the lint pills off of my sweaters but careful because clothes will get caught in the spinning blades making holes in clothing!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to use the fuzz shaver as the lint holder very easily comes off...not a great design!</li>
    <li> Powerfull ...very handy.....</li>
    <li> Wore an Evan Picone knit dress for the first time and my car&#x27;s seat belt picked the fabric. I was so upset as the dress could no longer be worn with an obvious patch of pulled threads in the front. Then I remembered sweater shavers and purchased this one. I followed the directions and used it with the dress flat on the ironing board for support. The pulled fabric were immediately removed and the dress looks new again. This small appliance improved my dress 100% and took it from the donation pile to the closet again.</li>
    <li> It works great! Love that I can take it anywhere the compact size is perfect &amp; more importantly it does what it says &amp;#34;Shaves Fabric&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Where has this been my whole life! Aww the joy of removing all the pills from a beloved garment that looked wretched and now looks new! The holes seem a reasonable size to me on this device and the power level seems good. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it as of yet.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this product! !!&lt;br /&gt;Tool box sent a similar item in replacement of th pictured item it is not as good Tool box said once it was opened it could not be returned</li>
    <li> the shape is different on the new model but it works as well as ever to remove fuzz and pilling.</li>
    <li> This little guy quickly removes fuzz and &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; from clothes. Does not hurt the fabric. Very handy.</li>
    <li> Not the best fuzz shaver I have ever owned, but it will make do.</li>
    <li> excellent little machine, does the job very well, would fully recommend proves the point, always buy products with a known name</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It is still working years later!</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t look like this picture. Not much power and fairly ineffective. When I want to defuzz an entire sweater, I&#x27;ll really be sorry I bought this!</li>
    <li> This easy-to-use, well designed gadget saved my new hoodie which was full of pills after laundering.  Also like the fuzz collection receptical attached..</li>
    <li> The picture and what I got were two very different products. The one I got works well but the back and the front where the fuzz goes keeps coming off very easily. Kinda disappointed</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works great!</li>
    <li> Works well so far!  I can see where it may not last for years, but it is an immediate solution.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Makes all my old sweaters look new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other fabric shavers in this price range and they were cheap plastic, which broke easily when trying to empty the shaved fabric or change the batteries.  This shaver is much higher quality than the others in this price range.</li>
    <li> You seriously can&#x27;t beat the price. I love this thing. You know you&#x27;re getting old and lame when a fabric shaver is your big excitement.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any prior experience with fabric or clothes shavers, but this little one did just what I was hoping - gave my wool coat a second life.  It had so many pils on it from fuzzy sweaters I wore with it that I thought it&#x27;d be hopeless.  But, this little guy grazed over the coat, cutting them and making the coat look almost new.  I say \\&quot;almost\\&quot; because now it just needs to be gone over with a lint remover.  Would definitely buy again.  Can&#x27;t beat spending $12 as opposed to near $100 for a new coat.</li>
    <li> This device removes pills on fabric beautifully. But If one is not careful to avoid seams or fails to flatten fabric absolutely it will cut a hole by catching fabric and pulling it temporarily into the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second device I&#x27;ve owned having worn out my previous one.  I have depended on it for years to add life to my sweaters and other clothing that pills.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look anything like that e picture, but it&#x27;s still a small portable pill shaver. Works well, doesn&#x27;t make holes like other reviews mentioned.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the reviews boy was I disappointed. It takes for ever to get just a tiny bit of lint away. Blades do not seem sharp enough, will not remove all the lint away and I mean the big chunky kind so you can imagine  the small ones.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had a clump of loose threads on my drivers side front seat of my mustang from getting in and out.  This product took the threads right off and the seat looks great again.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works beautifully, much better than the one I had previously which had a larger &amp;#34;head.&amp;#34; It is also easy to hold (which was not apparent from the picture).  However, I would have preferred a model that works as well as this one but that covers a larger area.</li>
    <li> I can use it on anything and wipes the fuzz away</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same product shown! Just hoping what was sent works just as good!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Remington RTFS-1 but the seller sent me the RTFS-2 which is the bigger one. I want to write a review for that one but I can&#x27;t because I didn&#x27;t actually purchase that one. I don&#x27;t know about the Remington RTFS-1 but the RTFS-2 is awesome. I love it and I use it on everything. Like any fabric shaver it will leave holes in your clothes if you use it on delicate fabrics and press down too hard. It makes clothes look like new. Nooo complaints... maybe it&#x27;s best to just pay a little more and buy the RTFS-2?</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for a small compact clothes shaver.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is wonderful! I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, but it&#x27;s fabulous. It&#x27;s the best pill shaver I&#x27;ve used and is easy to hold. It also doesn&#x27;t nip or tear at the fabric like others I&#x27;ve used in the past. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This did not work AT ALL</li>
    <li> Works great! I had fuzz all over my favorite shirt, a lint roller didn&#x27;t help. This little tool worked quickly and was easy to use.</li>
    <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this little shaver.  It works well, is easy to use, and easy to empty.</li>
    <li> Of the 3 blades inside,  one is not spring loaded.  I do not know if that is causing reduced function or not.  You can send me another one if you like.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I thought it would. I would say &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> if you have OCD tendencies like myself, then you will revel in using this on everything from quilts to sweaters to bras.</li>
