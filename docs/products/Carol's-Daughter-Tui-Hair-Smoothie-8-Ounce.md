      <li>and didnt smell right.</li>
      <li>So glad amazon carries this especially when we need it in a hurry!</li>
      <li>&quot; I first used this on my sister&#x27;s transitioning hair after shampooing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many curly hair products (aveda be curly, mixed chicks, shea moisture, kinky curly, miss jessies)</li>

      <li>My hair and hands tend to feel very coated after using this.  </li>
      <li>His hair stays very moisturized.  </li>
      <li>It really helped keep my hair hydrated</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It did not \\&quot;intensely condition...</li>
      <li>I left it on for about 15 minutes with a cap and honestly, I have mixed feelings.  </li>
      <li>This is great for natural hair because it makes my hair super soft and manageable.i never thought i could manage my natural thick hair until i found these products.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and works best when I put it in my wet hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was shiny and the curls were tight and better defined</li>
      <li>sure to use it with other natural leave-in conditioners and styling products.</li>
      <li>My natural hair texture is mainly 3c with 4a in the nape area.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair very soft.</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve used it as a deep treatment by leaving it on for 10 minutes and a plastic cap wrapped with a hot towel, per the directions.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and bought this because my hair is super dry</li>
      <li>The Carols Daughter Tui hair smoothie is hands down one of my favorite deep conditioners.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, tames my hair, smooths, shines, FRAGRANT (kinds strong - little goes a long way), and really puts that much needed moisture into my thick coarse hair.</li>
      <li>BUT, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>i also complete my look with carol&#x27;s daughter hair milk.</li>
      <li>A Carol&#x27;s Daughter representative recommended the Tui line, saying that it will work well for natural hair.</li>
      <li>this product gets 3 stars from me because I believe that it was not the real thing i have been using this product for over 4 years, and this one wa a different color</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>My sister&#x27;s natural texture is 4b.</li>
      <li>I am a 4C natural.</li>
      <li>My hair is chemically treated and my girls hair is natural.  </li>
      <li>my hair is natural.</li>
      <li>This product delivers what it says it is going to do and the smells are heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell it is an all natural product</li>
      <li>I got Carol&#x27;s Daughter Tui Hair Smoothie because I&#x27;m a natural 4B girl and like to use purely natural products.  </li>
      <li>This treatment did not make her hair soft.</li>
      <li>thought maybe her hair didn&#x27;t work well with the Tui Hair Smoothie since her hair isn&#x27;t completely natural yet.</li>
      <li>My son has thick curly hair and we love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>The cost was just too high and the results did not reflect the price and what I expect my hair to feel and act like after a deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
      <li>Go directly to Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s website of a local store in the mall.</li>
      <li>I even use it on my one year old&#x27;s hair and it detangles it enough that I can comb it without tears.</li>
      <li>I used this on both my natural hair and my sister&#x27;s transitioning hair as a \\&quot;Deeply Moisturizing Hair Treatment.\\</li>
      <li>he expensive side though but a great product none the less.</li>
      <li>I am an African America woman, with natural curls and my hair loves this product I definitely will purchase it again and again!</li>
      <li>I immediately followed the Tui Hair Smoothie with my regular deep conditioner to restore the softness to my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>too much money for so little.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not intended for us girls who have very coarse, nappy hair. If you hair is long, kind of smooth then this is your product. Stick with Cantu hair products that is intended for women with really coarse tightly curled hair. This will only make it worse.</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter Tui Hair Smoothie is so incredibly awesome! First of all, the aroma is wonderfully delicious. I can&#x27;t stop applying this product in my hair. It comes out of the jar very light, creamy and heavenly (LOL) and it makes my hair soft and manageable. After I&#x27;ve washed it out and my hair is still wet, I apply another one of her products, Lisa&#x27;s Elixir. They work great together on my hair! On the days when I want to pull my hair back in a ponytail (my hair is natural, thick and curly when wet), I use the smoothie to lay it down and it does the trick for that as well!</li>
    <li> It makes me sad to say that the Amazon purchase of this is a faulty/ bad purchase. Go directly to Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s website of a local store in the mall. Amazon waters their product down and recently I have found tiny pieces of plastic in the container. Not at all what the original product is intended to be. The product when properly made is extraordinary on thick, dry hair.</li>
    <li> My son has thick curly hair and we love this conditioner.  We leave it on while he plays in the tub then rinse it out.  His hair brushes through so easily with it on in the bath prior to rinsing.  His hair stays very moisturized.  So glad amazon carries this especially when we need it in a hurry!</li>
    <li> First off, this hair smoothie smells sooo good. As soon as I put in my hair (which is very coarse type 4a hair) I can feel it detangle and smooth out. It really emulsifies the hair and feels very good, very moisturizing. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while when i was growing my hair out. It really helped keep my hair hydrated and I loved the smell. I think it is kind of ont he expensive side though but a great product none the less.</li>
    <li> this product gets 3 stars from me because I believe that it was not the real thing i have been using this product for over 4 years, and this one wa a different color and didnt smell right. i notice the difference in my hair. its ok</li>
    <li> This deep treatment was a disappointment. A Carol&#x27;s Daughter representative recommended the Tui line, saying that it will work well for natural hair. I used this on both my natural hair and my sister&#x27;s transitioning hair as a \\&quot;Deeply Moisturizing Hair Treatment.\\&quot; I first used this on my sister&#x27;s transitioning hair after shampooing. My sister&#x27;s natural texture is 4b. This treatment did not make her hair soft. If anything, it made her hair feel as if I hadn&#x27;t conditioned it at all! Her hair felt so fragile and brittle. Her hair never feels like this when I use my regular conditioner or deep conditioner on her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe her hair didn&#x27;t work well with the Tui Hair Smoothie since her hair isn&#x27;t completely natural yet. So I used the Tui Hair Smoothie on myself as a deep conditioner. My natural hair texture is mainly 3c with 4a in the nape area. My hair felt so dry after rinsing out the hair smoothie. My hair almost felt like straw!! My hair never feels like that after conditioning!! I immediately followed the Tui Hair Smoothie with my regular deep conditioner to restore the softness to my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Tui Hair Smoothie once a week in different ways, hoping to benefit from this \\&quot;Deeply Moisturizing Hair Treatment.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used it as a deep treatment by leaving it on for 10 minutes and a plastic cap wrapped with a hot towel, per the directions. The results were dry feeling hair. I tried to use it as a deep treatment again, this time leaving the Tui Hair Smoothie on for about 5 hours, thinking that 10 minutes wasn&#x27;t enough time for the deep treatment to penetrate my hair. The results were -- dry feeling hair. I tried to use the Tui Hair Smoothie as a leave in. Again, my hair felt dry and looked dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not repurchase this item. It did not \\&quot;intensely condition... hair so it has a healthy texture and natural shine.\\&quot; I do like the way the Tui Hair Smoothie smells. However, it does not deliver as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> This smells great and moisturizes so well that I can actually get a comb thru my head after using it.  I even use it on my one year old&#x27;s hair and it detangles it enough that I can comb it without tears.</li>
    <li> I love this product i use it on my hair and my skin.  i mix it with coconut oil  its marvelous</li>
    <li> I do like Carols Daughters products however not every product is for everyone and I must say that this arrived very messy.  My hair and hands tend to feel very coated after using this.  I am not a fan of the Tui smoothie.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner for natural hair. The scent is amazing!  Leaves my hair soft and manageable. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a hair, which tends to be dry, and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Carol&#x27;s Daughter tui. I&#x27;ve tried many curly hair products (aveda be curly, mixed chicks, shea moisture, kinky curly, miss jessies) and this is now my go-to product. I use it virtually every day, and love the smell and texture. A little goes a long way, and works best when I put it in my wet hair. If you&#x27;re still searching for a hair pudding that isn&#x27;t too heavy, moisturizes, and smells great, this might be it.</li>
    <li> I got Carol&#x27;s Daughter Tui Hair Smoothie because I&#x27;m a natural 4B girl and like to use purely natural products.  I left it on for about 15 minutes with a cap and honestly, I have mixed feelings.  My hair was shiny and the curls were tight and better defined BUT, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft.  If anything, it felt &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know, maybe that&#x27;s what hair is supposed to feel like?  It felt strong and styling it went fine but there was no slip whatever. For the cost, I will for sure use it up but I probably wont be buying this again.  The cost was just too high and the results did not reflect the price and what I expect my hair to feel and act like after a deep conditioning treatment.  I still get curl definition, less frizz, AND soft hair at the fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> So Expensive thats why I shop on Amazonto get discounts, but I love it and it works great in my hair</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for my hair and thank you for the fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This rich creamy deep moisturizing hair mask is a really FABULOUS product! I was excited to get it, it came right on time. When I opened the jar the fragrance was luxurious, it smells absolutely delicious. What it dose for my hair is amazing moisture. I am an African America woman, with natural curls and my hair loves this product I definitely will purchase it again and again!</li>
    <li> For kinky curly hair Carol&#x27;s Daughter is the best product line ever.  This cream is a little runny, bit leaves no &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; or residue in my baby girl&#x27;s perfect curls.  Very moisturizing and leave silky, tangle free locks.</li>
    <li> This product delivers what it says it is going to do and the smells are heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell it is an all natural product and it is very creamy and goes smooth on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product because it really works and makes the hair nice and conditioned even days after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use it with other natural leave-in conditioners and styling products.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It moisturizes my and my daughters&#x27; hair after shampooing.  My hair is chemically treated and my girls hair is natural.  Before using this product I would dread washing their hair.  I did not like dealing with the dry and brittle mess.  This was before switching to Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.  I would never go back to the products I used before.  Weekly washings are more pleasant and our hair is soft and manageable.  If you are trying to decide on whether to spend the money, let me say that Carol&#x27;s Daughter products are worth the expense.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product. it smells good and works well. my hair is natural. This is great for natural hair because it makes my hair super soft and manageable.i never thought i could manage my natural thick hair until i found these products. it also gives a healthy natural glow/shine. this product is definetly worth the money. i use all carol&#x27;s daughter products. i also complete my look with carol&#x27;s daughter hair milk.</li>
    <li> This product left my natural hair drier and more difficult to comb through and manage than before I used it! Expensive experiment!</li>
    <li> I am a 4C natural. I like this product. It silky, moisturizes, smooth and smells great. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, tames my hair, smooths, shines, FRAGRANT (kinds strong - little goes a long way), and really puts that much needed moisture into my thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> The Carols Daughter Tui hair smoothie is hands down one of my favorite deep conditioners. This stuff keeps my hair so moisturized days after I wash it out. It smells sooo good. The smell stays on my hair for an entire week. I wash my hair weekly.</li>
    <li> I loved the smoothie, the smell  is great and it made our hair soft, and smooth , we will contunue to treat our hair with the smoothie</li>
    <li> love the product,but after use the consistency changes and becomes very loose,somewhat watery. still used it but wont but it again.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS YALL! THIS COMPANY IS STEALING YOUR MONEY. too much money for so little. That&#x27;s annoying. 8.oz for like 3 time use. And they recommend you use it like every week. Who in the world would do this. Make your own, im sure the ingredients aren&#x27;t rocket science!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and bought this because my hair is super dry but I think it&#x27;s just an ok product. I don&#x27;t think it justifies the price though. I have bought some loreal products that work just as well for 1/3 of the price.</li>
