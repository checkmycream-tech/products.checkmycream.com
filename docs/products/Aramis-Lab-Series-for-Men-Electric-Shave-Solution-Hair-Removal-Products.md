      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s fair to say that when it comes to shaving I&#x27;m a bit obsessive.</li>

      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything out there that I liked.  </li>

      <li>A while ago, I tried Afta by Mennen and liked it a lot</li>
      <li>But the smell was downright obnoxious and splashing it on your face kind of felt like taking a shot of moonshine.</li>

      <li>Though a bit pricey in my opinion, I find that it helps my whiskers to stand out nicely resulting in a closer electric shave.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;it has a nice texture, and feels nice</li>
      <li>I must say the fragrance is nice</li>
      <li>The razor works well on its own</li>
      <li>My husband always liked the Aramis Pre-Electric lotion.</li>
      <li>product was the one that I had initially expected to win the contest, as Amazon feedback would have you believe that it is the World&#x27;s Best pre-electric shave enhancing product.</li>
      <li>No residue, and quick drying great for those who want a closer electric shave.</li>
      <li>But the bottle sure is cute!</li>
      <li>He likes it just as well as the Aramis for quality of shaving and I love it 100 times more because it is odorless!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Speick was BY FAR the BEST of the bunch, delivering the closest shave along with zero greasiness and zero undesirable</li>
      <li>/&gt;Speick works the best, by far.</li>
      <li>Brisk, smooth and easy on my skin and helps give a great shave with no odor...</li>
      <li>Great, close, smooth shave, and equally important</li>
      <li>No terrible scent, washes right off with no greasy residue and greatly improves the quality of my electric shaves.</li>
      <li>The Aramis is much more mild and pleasant to my nose.  </li>
      <li>Not as close as a blade, nothing will ever be that close, but almost as good and a lot easier and no blood, no cuts, no expensive blades!</li>
      <li>i just love this product.</li>
      <li>What more   can you ask for in a pre-shave?</li>

      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>Much better smelling than [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The Williams product always worked okay</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having tried many electric pre shaves</li>
      <li>I tend to use more than the instructions call for because of the sensitivity of my skin.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will be part of my routine going forward.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s more than three or four drops.  </li>
      <li>Nice light scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is slightly better than nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once you apply it, it&#x27;s best to wait for a couple of minutes for it to settle into your skin properly</li>
      <li>I was searching the web for a better product and found the Aramis Lab Series Electric Shave Solution.  </li>
      <li>I found this Lab series to be 3x better than any product I tried.  </li>
      <li>You will probably not find a better pre electric shave lotion.</li>
      <li>probably closer to 6months or more.</li>
      <li>I love this preshave.  </li>
      <li>It lubricates as well as Lectric Shave, but there&#x27;s no awful lingering smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Last year I stumbled across Lab Series at our local Kohl&#x27;s Department Store.  After buying two bottles, it was no longer available in  the store.  A clerk told me that she had been told that for whatever reason, Aramis would only be offering it online.  The stuff is incredible.  Great, close, smooth shave, and equally important your face feels clean after the shave. It has been my experience that other products I&#x27;ve used or tried left your skin feeling dry or sticky. I now buy my Lab Series three bottles at a time and hope the company never decides to drop it.</li>
    <li> Works like they said it would.  I would buy this product again.  Perfect for pre shave.  This product works great.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for am alternative to Lectric shave and its strong smell. I found this product which had good reviews and thought I would give it a try although it is pricey. The item arrived promptly  and well packaged from amazon. After multiple uses I have been unimpressed with this product. I must say the fragrance is nice but that is about it. This product does not work any better than Williams Lectric Shave, In fact, for myself, Lectric Shave leaves me with a closer shave and less skin irritation. The only product that worked better than Original Lectric shave for me was Williams Lectric Shave Tender Face, which is no longer made. I have a hard time recommending this product because of its price. If you happen to find it for under ten dollars, give it a try, if not save yourself some money and try a different product. I would rate this item 2.5 stars but amazon does not allow that. If this product was less expensive it would get a higher rating, but due to its price and effectiveness I can&#x27;t give it higher than 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lectric Shave in the past, which did a good job of lubricating for electric shaving. But the smell was downright obnoxious and splashing it on your face kind of felt like taking a shot of moonshine. This Lab Series Electric Shave Solution is not at all as caustic as Lectric Shave. The directions say to shake the bottle four times and therefore you use a very small amount of liquid for each shave. It lubricates as well as Lectric Shave, but there&#x27;s no awful lingering smell. In fact, the directions say that you don&#x27;t even need to wash it off. I wouldn&#x27;t even think about leaving the house with Lectric Shave on. At more than twice the price of Lectric Shave, it might not seem like a bargain, but a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> When I shave with my Braun electric razor, i use the Lab Series before I shave and it gives me a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other pre-shave products and found the Aramis Lab Series to be the best of them all and worth the additional cost.  I apply it a minute or two before I shave with my electric and I get a much smoother, closer shave with no irritation, no greasy residue and no alcohol burning sensation.  What I also like is that it has a very mild clean, crisp smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to the world of electric shavers, having used a variety of razors for the last 35+ years. The electric razor works great, but I felt it could shave just just a tad closer. I tried the old standby of lectric shave, but was not too thrilled with it. After reading some reviews about the Lab Series of pre-shave I thought I would give it a try.     Sprinkled a few drops in my hands and rubbed it on my face, very nice light scent. The shave was not only closer, but was very smooth. After shaving, I rubbed my hands on my neck and chin and it was noticeable smoother.     Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and find that it does exactly what it is supposed to do--helps create a smoother and easier electric shave. As another reviewer stated, it is getting harder and harder to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using an electric shaver and when I first used it, it gave my skin elec. razor burns. Since it was a wet/dry shaver, I shaved with a shaving gel the second time. Although it was much smoother to shave, it was messy. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. At first I was a bit skeptical, but I&#x27;m so glad that I got this. The shave was just as smooth without all the mess and gave me a really close shave. No burns, no mess. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Much easier to shave ! and there is no irritation after ;-)</li>
    <li> It did the job, but the odor discouraged repeated use.</li>
    <li> I totally agree with JS 2012-02-07:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This is probably the best electric pre-shave solution on the market so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle but nice, and won;t interfere with cologne. Much better smelling than Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, Original, 3 fl oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The splash is not inundated with alcohol, so it won&#x27;t dry out your face nor make you smell like a bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very cool &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; effect - your face will feel slightly warmed as you apply it. It quickly subsides to leave a nice cool feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lifts hairs and provides a lubricating, slightly moisturized feel to make shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be an absolute necessity, but in the rough game of shaving, every advantage helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warming sensation upon application&lt;br /&gt;Subtle scent - will not overpower cologne&lt;br /&gt;Perceptible lubrication for a smoother shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Been using this with an electric shaver for almost a year now and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference, both in the quality of the shave and the soreness (or lack of) after. It seems a little pricey, but when you factor in how many shaves it lasts (approximately 5 months of daily shaving use), it is much better. It smells pleasant too, though I do generally wash my face after.</li>
    <li> I love this preshave.  I used to use William&#x27;s Lectric shave Ultra and then they discontinued it.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything out there that I liked.  I tried others but they were either too strong smelling and didn&#x27;t really do the job without heating up or they got sticky if I started sweating.  Lab Series Preshave has the most pleasant odor I have found and it moisturizes and lubricates the skin for a great shave.</li>
    <li> I had been using Afta and decided to try this.  I&#x27;ll compare them heads up:  1)  Closeness of shave. Tie.  Both do a nice job, and both are an improvement over no product.  2)  Smoothness/lubrication.  The Aramis wins here, just feels a lot smoother than Afta.  It is also easier to clean the razor after using the Aramis.  3)  Scent.  Aramis wins by a long shot.  The Afta is way too strong to even consider using without washing off.  Even after washing, I can smell the Afta.  The Aramis is much more mild and pleasant to my nose.  4)  Ease of use.  Slight advantage to the Afta since it is a gel instead of a liquid.  But, the Afta gets pretty thin from the warmth of my hand, so not a huge benefit.  5)  Price.  Afta wins here, but the cost per use is so low, that I consider almost a non-factor.  I&#x27;m using a Braun 7000 series razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product when I ordered a new electric razor, this pre shave lotion helps give that clean shave like a straight razor.  I highly recommend a try.  If Amazon sells it, that&#x27;s where I get it, right time every time.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me... I&#x27;m either using it wrong or its just an expensive waste..</li>
    <li> Was using Williams Lectric Shave and did not really like the product.  I did not like the smell and it really wasn&#x27;t giving me as close a shave as I was hoping.  I was searching the web for a better product and found the Aramis Lab Series Electric Shave Solution.  I have been using for a month and it is an excellent product far superior to Lectric Shave.  First, it has a mild likeable aroma and secondly it gives me a much better shave than the Lectric Shave product.  I highly recommend this product.  I have purchased 3 bottles.  You should as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric pre-shave. My husband received it as a gift from me 12 years ago. Gradually it has become increasingly more difficult to get at local department stores. I checked Amazon and there it was. I was so happy. My husband is happy and his face is happy. Thanks for carrying this item</li>
    <li> A while ago, I tried Afta by Mennen and liked it a lot but just couldn&#x27;t handle the  heavy smell. So I went searching for a fragrance-free pre-shave and hit on Aramis.  Am I glad I did! This stuff is terrific. It is light, odorless, non-oily and  leaves no residue on either your face or shaver--doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off.    It lifts and softens your beard so your shaver glides smoothly (although perhaps  not as smoothly as Afta) for a close and comfortable shave, and leaves your face feeling great.    Most importantly, it has given me some of the closest electric shaves of my life. What more   can you ask for in a pre-shave? It even has knocked off about two minutes of my shaving time.    Being a liquid like most pre-shaves (but unlike Afta which is a gel), application  can be difficult. A solution is to use a small sample size spray bottle-- just  spray directly on your face, rub it in a little, let dry for a minute or so and you&#x27;re good to go without waste.    All in all, a great product I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> From someone with a thick to heavy beard:  I consider this particular pre-shave product by LAB Series to be excellent!  Though a bit pricey in my opinion, I find that it helps my whiskers to stand out nicely resulting in a closer electric shave.  Also it should leave your skin feeling very smooth after the shave which is a nice bonus as well!  Note: Though I believe it to be somewhat over priced, this small bottle should last you many many months!  Therefore and because of that, I didn&#x27;t mined (within reason of course) paying a higher price.</li>
    <li> It gives me smooth shave.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Don&#x27;t like smell too medicinal. Very good shave with no irritation.  2-3 drops is all that is needed.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on the reviews, because Afta, while effective, has such a strong scent.  There is no question that the Lab Series pre-electric lotion has a much more pleasant and subtle scent than Afta.  But in side-by-side tests on my face (Afta on the left, Lab on the right), it was very clear to me that Afta, being more astringent, is more effective at getting my whiskers to separate from my skin.  That&#x27;s not to say the Lab Series doesn&#x27;t work. It does, just not as well as Afta (at least on my beard).</li>
    <li> I just ordered the Lab series Pre shave for the first time in a while.  In the past it has always worked very good for me.  It is non fragrant and did not burn.  I used it for several years.  I have been using electric razors since my father gave me one around 1960.  After Lab series I used a brand called Pitralon from Germany, it is great but it is unavailable currently on Amazon and extremely difficult to find in US.  I would buy it overseas.  So I went back to Lab Series and know I&#x27;ll be satisfied.  Why are good electric pre shaves so difficult to find in the US?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Williams Lerctric shave for years and tried Afta as well neither of these compare to LAB Series.  It has incredible lubricating properties, my razor glides over my face like it&#x27;s on ice.  I agree with others... it has very little scent so it doesn&#x27;t fight your cologne or after shave. Buy this stuff you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed...for me oily mess with kind of a oily smell. I dont want to have to wash my face again just to put after shave on.  I prefer to just use Mennen skin bracer and the lubricant and the aftershave.  But the bottle sure is cute!</li>
    <li> Since Williams STOPPED making their version of &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; pre electric shave this is the best thing on the market........still has a slight smell to it though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric pre-shave that works this well.  Doesn&#x27;t take much, so its definitely worth the money. Will definitely purchase again, and I do recommend to others...especially if you have a really sensitive skin like mine.  I get infections from reusing disposables if I don&#x27;t blow-dry them after every use. &gt;&#x3D;( Using this with the Panasonic ES8249s, and the shave is amazing</li>
    <li> You will probably not find a better pre electric shave lotion. Once you apply it, it&#x27;s best to wait for a couple of minutes for it to settle into your skin properly and then your electric razor will easily glide over your skin. Bear in mind that I am using a Philips Senso Touch 3D electric razor</li>
    <li> Best product if you use an electric razor and like to use a pre-shave.  I have used it for years and will not shave without it.  It also is 3.4 ounces and should be TSA acceptable.</li>
    <li> It is OK, but just costs too much!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff the first time because it came up as one of those \\&quot;Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\&quot; things when I bought my [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]].  Wow.  What a difference. After using it one time I pretty much was a customer for life.  In fact, it worked so well that I had to do all sorts of tests to make sure it was the solution and not the razor.  The razor was an upgrade for sure, but this stuff is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use three or four shakes or fluid.  That&#x27;s more than three or four drops.  I&#x27;ve noticed that less solution comes out when the bottle is new and mostly filled so maybe 5 shakes is good for starting out.  I put in my palm and then rub my hands together before applying it to my face and neck.  After a few days of using it, it becomes stupidly easy to apply.  No drips.  No mess.  I waited to post my review until I went through an entire bottle.  It lasted almost exactly 7 months, or, less than 3 bucks a month.  SO while it seems like a lot to pay per bottle, it turns out to be definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fluid seems to be a combination of alcohol and a very (extremely) light oil.  The alcohol evaporates on application and leaves your skin ready for shaving, and allows the razor to just glide.  It also seems to make the hair stand up straighter...  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s my imagination or not.  I&#x27;ve never noticed the need to wash my face after shaving, and the fluid is completely odorless which I really, really like.  I absolutely hate when manufactures decide to add some kind of fragrance with something like this.  I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of things on my skin so in my case, less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this stuff a try.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> There is none better ... at any price.  Re-ordered several times. And if you get &amp;#34;too close&amp;#34;, like on the necklace, I suggest their &amp;#34;Razor Burn Relief Ultra&amp;#34; ... fragrance free and super.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth it with my electric trimmer/razor.  Helps lubricate and lift my fur for an easier shave.</li>
    <li> Using a newer Braun 780 shaver, I did not find the Aramis to be a big improvement in shaving. Messy application and not providing any friction reducing feeling over dry shaving. Was ready to return the shaver but tried Afta pre-electric lotion. Much, much better than Aramis with a huge improvement in reducing the feeling of friction when shaving. Feels like a teflon coating on my face. Shaves just as close. Also being a lotion not a watery liquid the Afta application amount is not messy at all and you can feel where you are putting it. Much better smell than Aramis also, and the Afta was about 25% of the cost. Way to go Afta!</li>
    <li> Aramis Men&#x27;s electric shave is the best pre-shave on the market.</li>
    <li> The Lab Series pre-shave seems to work well.  The shaver glides a bit more smoothly over my face after using it and as a result I get less irritation.  The scent is decent, although since I shower after shaving, it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.  Overall, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s such an upgrade over other (cheaper) brands, and that&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t much better than CVS branded lotion. Cost too much for little extra benefit.</li>
    <li> Smell is good but not as effective as Afta</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Non-greasy and only a few drops required. Dries  and sets up your beard quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.  Best pre-electric I have used.</li>
    <li> My husband always liked the Aramis Pre-Electric lotion. The last time I got it for him was in London as never could find it in US.  I ordered this to try when he ran out.  He likes it just as well as the Aramis for quality of shaving and I love it 100 times more because it is odorless!</li>
    <li> Great product for a closer shave. No residue, and quick drying great for those who want a closer electric shave.</li>
    <li> good, gentle on skin, does not seem harsh or drying, decent smell, easy to shave with an electric razor.  although a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> I bought a $350 5 blade electric razor and was still unhappy with the comfort/glide, and cutting. after trying a variety of creams, soaps, andd lubricants I found this Lab series to be 3x better than any product I tried.  Though Im not crazy about the price, igf you are looking for the best shave you can get, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I have a braun electric razor and shave my head. The razor works well on its own but I was hoping for a little preshave help to smooth things out. I tried another product (Kyoku for Men Electric Pre Shave Optimizer) that was aerosol but it took far too many sprays to get any kind of a buildup going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aramis Lab, by contrast, is terrific. a few drops gets a good lubricated base going. Since I&#x27;m shaving my face and head, I use more than less but it definitely prevents additional knicks or snags from the razor as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered my second bottle and I&#x27;m sure it will be part of my routine going forward. Nice clean scent too without a strong alcohol odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of electric pre-shaves, but this one is the best.  I get the closest and most comfortable shaves using this product.</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive skin and i get a lot of irritation even if i shave after 3 or 4 days. i&#x27;ve used many products in the past but they didn&#x27;t help me much. i decided to try the lab series pre shave solution after reading the good reviews. the product was shipped very quickly and i got it in a day. i just used 3 drops and the shave was awesome. i use a panasonic shaver and the shave was very close and my skin felt very smooth and  most importantly no irritation. i just love this product. i dont think i&#x27;ll ever shave without it in the future. people with sensitive skin should give it a try</li>
    <li> i was hoping to find something like this product, which, when i use it, makes my braun electric razor shave as close as a blade, and the irritation i got after every shave is now non-existent. i havent compared this to afta that everyone keeps talking about, but, the aramis doesnt have much scent at all. i would be surprised if anyone was able to smell it at all after a shave.  i have only had this a few weeks, but based upon my usage this bottle should last at LEAST three months. probably closer to 6months or more. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Started using this product about three years ago and noticed an immediate change in how my face and neck reacted to shaving.  It greatly reduced redness, bumps, and ingrown hairs.  I don&#x27;t shave without this product!  Use this before shaving and use Tend Skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> I have tried most of the high end pre-electric shave products.  I use a Panasonic razor that everyone raves about, and I was about to give up on it until I purchased this product.  Using other products my shave time averaged at least 7 minutes and was tedious with not always optimal results.  Using the Aramis product I am down to &amp;#60;4 minutes with excellent results.  My only minor complaint is the dispenser could be more tightly organized to avoid waste.</li>
    <li> Great product to lubricate my beard to set up for shaving (Braun series 7) with a three-day beard. Not need for regular daily shaving, but after 3 days, it really helps.</li>
    <li> Hard too find, but the best to use!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best electric pre-shave solution on the market so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle but nice, and won;t interfere with cologne. Much better smelling than [[ASIN:B000052Y6Z Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, Original, 3 fl oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The splash is not inundated with alcohol, so it won&#x27;t dry out your face nor make you smell like a bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very cool \\&quot;warming\\&quot; effect - your face will feel slightly warmed as you apply it. It quickly subsides to leave a nice cool feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lifts hairs and provides a lubricating, slightly moisturized feel to make shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be an absolute necessity, but in the rough game of shaving, every advantage helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warming sensation upon application&lt;br /&gt;Subtle scent - will not overpower cologne&lt;br /&gt;Perceptible lubrication for a smoother shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey</li>
    <li> provides a smooth shave, great sent and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Determined to solve the &amp;#34;Pre-Electric Shave Additive Riddle&amp;#34; I secured a bottle of each of the following still-in-production products and set about scientifically testing each one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speick was BY FAR the BEST of the bunch, delivering the closest shave along with zero greasiness and zero undesirable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speick Pre Electric Shave Lotion&lt;br /&gt;Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave Original&lt;br /&gt;Lab Series Electric Shave Solution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the exception of Lectric Shave, ALL of the tested products cost about the same $20-22(USD) SHIPPED, and NONE of the tested products readily available at US retailers outside of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried each product exclusively for a 2 week period, using them two ways to make sure and not overlook anything.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving was always conducted first thing in the AM immediately after waking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method A: Without washing face beforehand (as per directions, generally)&lt;br /&gt;Method B: After Washing Face with Exfoliating Scrub (gritty, marketed as being useful for preparing skin for the rigors of shaving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1ST - SPEICK&lt;br /&gt;Speick works the best, by far. It ensured a wet-razor-comparable shave every time, while not drying the skin or causing any irritation. On top of this superior efficacy this product SMELLS AMAZING, while not smelling strongly enough to interfere with other scents. It never gets in the way of my cologne, while at the same time it has easily become one of my favorite smells, and I genuinely look forward to using it on a daily basis. The fascinating pamphlet that comes packaged with the product explains that Speick has exclusive access/rights to the rare plant that provides the active ingredient in the product, and this uniqueness is readily apparent. There is something almost magical about the product that I have never experienced with anything else, it works far better than the usual alcohol/lubricant/fragrance formula utilized by the other products. On top of all this, Speick is ORGANIC and as result of Germany having much stricter standards with regards to what chemicals can be safely used, entirely devoid of toxic chemicals and colorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2ND - LECTRIC SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;The Lectric Shave works exceptionally well, with several serious drawbacks. It allows for an extremely close shave, (as close as with Speick), although it SMELLS OBVIOUSLY UNHEALTHY/REVOLTING. This on top of the fact that the manufacturer clearly states that it must be washed off immediately after shaving, and you need to wash it off of your hands after application. Not following the advice to wash hands after application will result in stripping of paints/lacquers/finishes from the shaver, something similar to what I noticed with the bottle the solution comes in, the label melted off after the first week of daily use. There is no telling what this does to your skin/body, especially if you screw around and don&#x27;t wash it off after shaving. Washing the product off is basically a gut-level instinctual response to being in effect splashed with any blatantly offensive smelling toxic chemical, and anyone with any decency would never allow themselves to smell like this product. My biggest fear with this was that the smell would somehow &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; after thoroughly washing my face, this fear being compounded significantly by my inability to wash the stuff off of my hands after application. IT LITERALLY WON&#x27;T COME OFF WITHOUT USING GOJO OR SIMILAR INDUSTRIAL HAND CLEANER, you can feel it there and smell it long after rinsing with normal bathroom soaps. By far the most scary of the products tested. The ONLY &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; with this product would be the low price, if you don&#x27;t think about the fact that the super low price all but guarantees the manufacturer is using the absolute cheapest and least pure/healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3RD - LAB SERIES&lt;br /&gt;This product was the one that I had initially expected to win the contest, as Amazon feedback would have you believe that it is the World&#x27;s Best pre-electric shave enhancing product. This is NOT the truth of the matter, and in fact Lectric Shave is actually far better at providing the close shave. Lab Series has the &amp;#34;advantage&amp;#34; of being the only non-scented product of the three, although it has a greasy chemical smell that I disliked intensely. Lab Series is essentially the same product as Lectric Shave with a less-complex chemical coloring involving only Green 6(CI61565), as opposed to Lectric&#x27;s more sophisticated blend of Green 5, Yellow 10, and Orange 4 coloring, and at 5x the price. The listed ingredients are fancy [Cola Nitida (Kola) Nut Extract] although completely ineffective, they seem to be 100% marketing BS aimed at tricking you into thinking you&#x27;re not being ripped off as badly. This was least effective of the three products at providing any enhanced closeness or improved shaving. This product was the 2nd most greasy product, rivaled only by Lectric. It is possible that Lab Series and Lectric are equally undesirably greasy, although determining this would require outside input from a 3rd party along with prolonged investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All testing was conducted with Braun 7 Series shaver cleaned after each shave with the Automated Braun Cleaning System. Cleaning System kept fresh with Genuine Braun Cleaning Solution, replaced as directed by cleaning system indicators. No cleaning solution sparing efforts or tricks were employed and I don&#x27;t refill it with off-label refill solutions or industrial solvents/solvent blends as some users do.ack would have you believe that it is the World&#x27;s Best pre-electric shave enhancing product.

    <li> Excellent shave with Braun Series 7 + original pulsonic cartridge (blue cutting strip). Just about as close as 5 blade Panasonic (wet shave) but more comfortable.</li>
    <li> so so. lectric shave is still king.</li>
    <li> I recently went back to a Norelco rotary razor after having used a Braun for a couple of years.  The Norelco write up said that it could be used dry, with a pre-shave or with lather.  I tried the lather, and it was simply too much trouble.  I tried using it dry and I felt what I thought was some drag of the heads over my face...not painful, just not slick.  I bought some of the old standard, Williams Lectric Shave.  It did improve things, but left and oily feeling on my skin...I also did not like the scent.  Long story short, I ordered some of the Lab Series, and find it to be the answer.  Brisk, smooth and easy on my skin and helps give a great shave with no odor...the best electric razor shave I have ever had.  This is a rel winner.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if it makes a difference in the shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to electric shaving having used a Fusion for a few years now.  I&#x27;m surprisingly happy with my Panasonic shaver but this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to make that much of a difference in closeness, smoothness, or ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly better than nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a nice texture, and feels nice on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got no strong odor and doesn&#x27;t fight with my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.  So far I think I like the Remington powder pre-shave best.</li>
    <li> If you are an electric razor user and want a pre-shave that isn&#x27;t perfumed and isn&#x27;t razor-clogging gummy, this is your best choice. Actually, as far as I can tell, it&#x27;s your only choice. I prefer not to be surrounded all day by an olfactory halo -- even brisk scrubbing with a soapy washcloth won&#x27;t make the sickening LectricShave odor go away.-- but couldn&#x27;t find a product other than this one that yielded a close, smooth and comfortable shave that didn&#x27;t clog the rotary blades of my trusty Norelco triple-head razor. The price is the only downside. It&#x27;s five times the price of the otherwise excellent LectricShave, but until there&#x27;s another viable alternative, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I think my objections to this are likely just personal preference, but for the price of the item I was hoping to be wowed. When I used this after showering I felt like my face had residue on it all day. And when I used before showering to soften whiskers it felt like there was minimal difference compared to dry shaving (other than my face was much slipperier and more difficult to get to certain spots.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric shaving lotions that I&#x27;ve used.  It reminds me of Lectric Shave Tenderface, which has been discontinued.  Since then, I&#x27;ve been using regular Lectric Shave Tea Leaf, which has a mildly-annoying smell.  This has good lubrication and a pleasant smell.  But unfortunately, it&#x27;s about 5x the cost.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t shave without this stuff. My skin is sensitive to shaving and this electric shave solution keeps me from having red bumps and sensitive skin. It works well for me I have tried a few other brands and this is the best for my face.</li>
    <li> Works well on my tough beard inconjunction with a new Braun shaver I purchased.  Doesn&#x27;t have the heavy after scent of Wlliam&#x27;s Lectric Shave.  Also tried Afta Pre-Shave!  Didn&#x27;t like it as much due to the residue left in the shaver blades and foil.  Makes it much harder to clean the razor.&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product for the purpose it&#x27;s made for.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. You do not need it and it stinks, is greasy, and does nothing at all. Buy A Braun Series 7 shaver and youwil get a close shave. Not as close as a blade, nothing will ever be that close, but almost as good and a lot easier and no blood, no cuts, no expensive blades!</li>
    <li> Very happy to find this product which is not greasy like mennen pre-shave and is fragrance-free which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I suppose it&#x27;s fair to say that when it comes to shaving I&#x27;m a bit obsessive. I became a fan of old school wet shaving many years ago. This is shaving using a DE (double edge razor blade) or straight razor - both of which provide an excellent barber shop quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s time consuming and although a great indulgence my schedule has me at the mercy of electrics. I use a Braun 790cc and a Norelco Sensor 3D 1250 and a Panasonic  ES8249S Nanotech 4-Blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All do a decent job on my cheeks, the neck area is never blade close - and as I&#x27;m a head shaver none of them do a particularly great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried many electric pre shaves I have found them all marginal at best. When reading the glowing reviews of the Lab Series electric pre shave I figured, why not and ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply stated - I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product coats even the shortest, hard to shave down hairs and makes them stand up as opposed to laying flat. You feel this effect immediate with your hand as you apply it. This lift makes it much easier for an electric to mow down even the most stubborn whiskers and leave as close to a blade shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fewer passes needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t clog razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Evaporates Quickly - no waiting time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Provides a significantly closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fair to say that the performance of my razors have improved a good 50% and again using the Lab Series pre shave get&#x27;s you as close to a blade shave as you&#x27;re going to get from an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A superb product that does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shave I have found. Also it is not greasy. This is the only one that use.</li>
    <li> As a decades-old user of Williams Lectric Shave, once they started putting green tea fragrance in it, I can&#x27;t stand it.  This has a very mild fragrance and lubricates well without being greasy.  Highly recommend, even at its high price.</li>
    <li> Quite simply, it works and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  The product provides the astringent and drying effect that you get from products like Lectrik shave (sp?), but without the overpowering and objectionable aroma. I like it very much and will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my shave.  It did not reduce fric tion.  It did not stand wiskers up for a closer shave.  I will not purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have a very sensitive face.  In addition, I also shave my head; there isn&#x27;t that much hair up there to bother with at a barber.  I use a Panasonic shaver both at home and when I travel.  The instructions tells you to put four drops of the solution in the palm of your hand, rub it into your beard, and shave.  It sets up the beard for the electric shaver and at the same time provides protection for the skin.  I tend to use more than the instructions call for because of the sensitivity of my skin.  By doing so, I get a shave that approximates the close shave one gets with a razor blade, and very little if any electric shaver burn.  I highly recommend it to anyone who uses an electric shaver and wants a very close shave.  As I said, this is a great product.  Five Stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALL of the preshaves I could find and keep returning to this one in spite of the outrageous price.</li>
    <li> When I first stated looking for a pre-electic shave lotion, I immediately went towards Williams Lectric Shave.  I&#x27;ve seen the commercials many times on TV and thought it was the only product of it&#x27;s type.  After finding it on Amazon it had almost 5 stars, it must be great.  I still read some of the reviews and I was really put off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just compare the ingredients with LAB and you can see a big difference.  I don&#x27;t need my pre-shave to have added color or fragrance, and Lectric was full of it.  The reviews got worse, some said after applying this product and not washing their hands it would eat away at the coating on their razors.  That&#x27;s not a good sign.  The instructions clearly say to always wash immediately after use.  Not something I wanted on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, LAB pre-shave is 360% more expense, but that didn&#x27;t matter to me at the end of the day.  LAB is the only pre-electric shave i&#x27;ve ever used so I can&#x27;t compare it.  But the shave is much closer than dry.  Not quite as close as using an actual razor but almost.  The one reason I can never go back to dry shaving, the lubrication.  The razor glides so smoothly with no irritation.  I can go over the same spot a few times with no issue.  Recently while I was traveling and didn&#x27;t bring LAB with me, I regretted it.  The difference is drastic after you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only smell from this product is of slight alcohol, which is the ingredient that makes your hairs stand up straight for the close shave.  The color is clear, and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  It&#x27;s not overly greasy feeing and is very gentle on my sensitive skin which is prone to breakouts with anything harsh.  There is no requirement to rinse the product off after use, and LAB even says so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is $18 a bottle, I could see it lasting at least 6 months.  I&#x27;m 5 months into my first bottle and I have a quarter left.  I use it 4-5 times a week.  $36 a year for a gentle, safe and natural shave everyday seems worth it to me.orth it to me.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of favorable reviews for this product and based on my prior knowledge of this type of product know it lasts a while so it didn&#x27;t bother me to pay the premium for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lectric Shave but am tired of smelling like my Dad and just not too fond of the spicy aroma in general so I though I&#x27;d try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is the lack of aroma.  I like that about this product.  It didn&#x27;t visibly raise the whisker on my face as Lectric Shave does, but I figured it might work differently than what I&#x27;m used to.  Everything went fine with my shave but when I went to rinse the product off after my shave, my skin felt like I dabbed mazola all over it.  It took me a long time to rinse off and still left a greasy film.  I had to break out the wash cloth and scrub it off.  Also, when I did the after-check for closeness I liken the feeling to when I dry shave; not so close.  I think it&#x27;s because they layer of oil this puts on your face won&#x27;t let you shave all that close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have extremely dry skin, I could see where this may come in handy.  I don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> A great product, orders of magnitude better than &#x27;Lectric Shave, harder to get off of your hand though. Maybe that&#x27;s why it works! I just ordered my second bottle from this vendor, who ships it for free.</li>
    <li> My husband says it&#x27;s fantastic.  Makes for an extremely close shave.</li>
    <li> Does the trick, no lingering odor, and lasts quite a while even though a small bottle. A little pricey but otherwise pleased.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent. Smooth sensation. Very good shave.</li>
    <li> Best electric pre-shave on the market. No terrible scent, washes right off with no greasy residue and greatly improves the quality of my electric shaves. You can actually find cheaper on the manufacturers website usually, so shop around.</li>
    <li> arrived quick and exactly as expected</li>
    <li> This product actually works well!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. After years of using Williams Electric Pre-Shave for my daily electric shaving needs I was in the market for a substitute. The Williams product always worked okay but the smell was terrible (to me and others) and I found myself needing to use inordinate amounts of the stuff to get a reasonably close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this product here on Amazon and was skeptical based largely on the high price tag and the price/quantity ratio. Well I shouldn&#x27;t have been and I have found my new daily pre-shave product. The smell is very faint and not unpleasant. More importantly I find I get a far closer and smoother shave with this product then I did before with a much smaller amount of product. To give an indicator for my fellow review readers, my first bottle of this stuff lasted just over three (3) months with daily use. This is the result of a rub-on bottle top applicator that allows you great discretion in how much is applied directly to any particular area of the face/neck versus say  the splash on bottles where I seem apt to splash on prodigious amounts of the product and stink up both my hands and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of this product and will be buying more as needed.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for electric shaver users. It&#x27;s pricey, but you only need a tiny bit to get the job done. My first bottle lasted nearly a year.</li>
    <li> Occasionally a product comes along that exceeds my expectations. A dab or two of this solution and my shave is a snap. It does seem expensive until you try the alternatives,</li>
    <li> This is a super product.  It has a really nice aroma, and it doesn&#x27;t sting.  My husband loves it.  Better than anything you can buy in the drug store, but a bit costly. But as they say....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> best electric shave stuff on market IMO.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is better or worse than the Jack Black Electric Shave Enhancer I was using ( not sold anywhere I can find now ). No scent and the alcohol helps the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One annoying point: the bottle has a child-proof cap. Some child-proof caps ( such as those on prescription bottles ) can be changed into a regular cap with a small tool but not this one ( YMMV ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have mentioned, the liquid ( and not a gel like the Jack Black mentioned above ) application to the face can be wasteful.</li>
    <li> Have no complaints. You should rinse off your shaver and blades after using it though.</li>
    <li> Williams Lectric Pre-Shave works great, but smells like something from a chemistry lab mixed with cheap perfume and afterward feels like you&#x27;ve rubbed bacon grease on your face.  This stuff, on the other hand, works just as well as Lectric but has a very faint scent and is as light as a lubricating liquid could possibly be.  I put the stuff in an aerosol spray bottle so as not to waste a drop.</li>
