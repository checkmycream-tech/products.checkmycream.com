      <li>Though the fragrance is a bit strong for my taste.</li>
      <li>This product has a strong fragrance that may not be acceptable to some people.</li>
      <li>I have never had a true favorite face lotion.  </li>
      <li>that I am on my third bottle, I can honestly say my fine lines are more smoothed out than ever before!  </li>
      <li>I use it after showering and shaving and have noticed a HUGE difference in every aspect of my skin.</li>

      <li>The cream is quite rich</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m bald and even wipe some across the top of my head and noticed the skin being much softer and not itching as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion with alpha hydrox enhanced lotion 10 percent glycolic aha 6 oz, mixed them because each of the lotions has ingredients that are good for strech marks.</li>
      <li>very soft , no harsh smell at all  works great for my skin</li>
      <li>I love amazon and am a good customer but this waste of money has me wondering if I should use amazon again.</li>
      <li>recently started using an eye cream that had retinol in it, and was very pleased with how well it moisturized and made my under-eye skin look.  </li>
      <li>I immediately  broke out for the first time in years!</li>
      <li>I apply this after I use my derma roller and the combination has improved my laugh lines.</li>
      <li>creme soaks right into my face.</li>
      <li>But it made my skin very soft and that was fine.</li>
      <li>I have pretty normal skin, but I do tend to battle dryness more now that I&#x27;m getting older.  </li>
      <li>I do use coconut oil on my face first then this retinol cream</li>
      <li>in 1 week i have seen such a differnce, I love this cream it does work, I will buy again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second jar, and will order more.  </li>
      <li>Have at last seen results on face cream after buying and returning many item that promised  but never delivered.  </li>
      <li>I love how my face felt the next morning</li>
      <li>I have noticed the tiny lines on my chin and truly much more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Once you use Retinol on a regular basis, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference without it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used the whole jar.</li>
      <li>It really helps with lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>I know this is just my case, but it&#x27;s the one that really matters to me.</li>
      <li>OMG I cannot believe they would add so much perfume.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>So figured....why not try my whole face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this item.</li>
      <li>I really like this cream and use it at night.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for those who want to slash their beauty budget.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and after a few days, my skin looked better</li>
      <li>but I feel it is a little strong for my skin which has thinned over the years.  </li>
      <li>It is probably my fault that I didn&#x27;t check the ingrediants before buying but the picture of the cream isn&#x27;t large enough to see that fragrance is listed.</li>
      <li>Not heavy, oily or drying.</li>
      <li>and it leaves my skin so soft ..</li>
      <li>With this cream my face stays clear, and makes my face feel soft, and I will buy this cream again.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just too old</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and clears up any acne I may have.</li>
      <li>I have adult acne and it helps fade marks from my skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see results fast enough on my face</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any major change in my skin other than it keeps it hydrated but at the price I was not expecting much.</li>
      <li>Not only for older women.</li>
      <li>Slightly more expensive than generic, but worth the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This extremely economical Retinol Cream is proving to be just as effective as over the counter types. And the price point is amazing. The cream is quite rich so it&#x27;s not necessary to pile on a lot. A dab, warmed by your hands, truly will do it. I have noticed the tiny lines on my chin and truly much more noticeable. Highly recommend for those who want to slash their beauty budget.</li>
    <li> I love it, this is a thicker purer blend.  The best I have found on the market.  I am 53, I use for crepy skin.  Works wonderfully for me</li>
    <li> really did nothing but dry out my face</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastic and can&#x27;t beat the price!!! I&#x27;ve stopped buying expensive creams and just use this as my wrinkle killer</li>
    <li> Saw no improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> The cream was okay I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of improvement in wrinkles . But it made my skin very soft and that was fine. It does have a smell to it, it was kind of strong but I didn&#x27;t mind it. If you happen to get any on your lips that will be all you can taste. I also found any residual cream that was left on my hands seemed to stay and if you ate something after applying, your food item would tend to taste like the cream. Even after washing your hands it seemed to linger, a lot of times I would just rub extra cream in to hands if it was before bed and the smell and taste would be gone in the morning, but if applied during the morning under makeup or just for moisture it seemed to stay on your hands a long time.</li>
    <li> It was opened, seems kinda sketchy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my facials said the best for your face is vitamin a..remarkable..dark circles, puffiness and dryness is gone</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream feels on my face.  I use it as a base and use a moisturing cream on top.</li>
    <li> I like this cream.. Though the fragrance is a bit strong for my taste.</li>
    <li> Very good product that appears to be fulfilling its intended use. I am very satisfied with the product. I intend to continue using it.</li>
    <li> My skin clears up the next day. Guess no need to go after expensive ones. BTW, I&#x27;m 31 ans with uneven tone and some acnes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years now, but particularly in the winter when the air indoors (I&#x27;m in Minnesota) is very dry. I apply it like a moisturizer on my face and around my eyes before bed. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clears up any acne I may have. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, and just a personal bonus I&#x27;m not allergic to it. These jars last a while, and a small dab can go a long way.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this item. Make sure you read the ingredient label thoroughly before you buy. Whatever combination of coconut oil, mineral oil, or fragrance it was...I immediately  broke out for the first time in years! My skin is still recovering a week later and I only used it two nights. I really wanted to like this item.:*(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting to try this, but easy to use and feels good. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 , because it still was on trial base.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this before -- repeats don&#x27;t improve the product.  I can&#x27;t see any improvement it&#x27;s made in my face.</li>
    <li> Actually I do like the product but I feel it is a little strong for my skin which has thinned over the years.  So the product is good but not for me.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time. My wife is the person who uses this product and says that she likes it a lot as she gets the desired results</li>
    <li> This product has a strong fragrance that may not be acceptable to some people. I used it twice and then pitched it.</li>
    <li> I have pretty normal skin, but I do tend to battle dryness more now that I&#x27;m getting older.  I have never had a true favorite face lotion.  I would always buy something different each time....nothing ever really impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using an eye cream that had retinol in it, and was very pleased with how well it moisturized and made my under-eye skin look.  So figured....why not try my whole face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is amazing!  I use it every morning and night, and it has made my skin look totally refreshed!  It dries quickly enough that I have no trouble applying my makeup before work, and my face has not had any dry issues this winter season!&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am on my third bottle, I can honestly say my fine lines are more smoothed out than ever before!  I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> When I went searching for a retinal cream, I found several brands, and they all had one thing in common.  They were very expensive!  This product has the same amount of retinol, and costs much less.  I&#x27;m on my second jar, and will order more.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion with alpha hydrox enhanced lotion 10 percent glycolic aha 6 oz, mixed them because each of the lotions has ingredients that are good for strech marks.</li>
    <li> Seriously after one use I see the difference, never thought I would say this over an eight dollar cream. Goes on smooth smells neutral, Great stuff for mature skin</li>
    <li> OMG I cannot believe they would add so much perfume.  I wanted to use this on my face...well this was a waste of money.  I use Loreal cream and it has some perfume but this is loaded!</li>
    <li> I get botox and filler .....and buy really expensive creams ......in 1 week i have seen such a differnce, I love this cream it does work, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it on the back of my hands. They are smooth and beautiful. I apply it in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> The cream works well. I have adult acne and it helps fade marks from my skin.</li>
    <li> i dont like it because i thought it was for razor bumps but its not and it doesnt help at all.</li>
    <li> Not a bad price for this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and use it at night. I apply this after I use my derma roller and the combination has improved my laugh lines. Will order more when needed.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, nice scent.</li>
    <li> i recently purchased this puritan&#x27;s choice retinol cream from Amazon i am horrified that the product contains so mcuh fragrance i.e. perfume I have psoraisis and any cream with fragra&lt;br /&gt;nce causes a serious break out. It is probably my fault that I didn&#x27;t check the ingrediants before buying but the picture of the cream isn&#x27;t large enough to see that fragrance is listed. I love amazon and am a good customer but this waste of money has me wondering if I should use amazon again. i beg you to please give me an idea of how to resolve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Verna Kresse</li>
    <li> Second time I have ordered this.  Really love it.  I do use coconut oil on my face first then this retinol cream and it leaves my skin so soft .. Will keep using it!</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy feeling cream. I put it on and feel like I have rubbed petroleum all over my face. In addition it burns, which may be because I have a sensitivity to it, not sure. Also, it has a very strong smell and I broke out after using it for a few days. It is going in the drawer.....</li>
    <li> With this cream my face stays clear, and makes my face feel soft, and I will buy this cream again.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with this product.  I like the way it feels and I like the way my skin looks.</li>
    <li> Great cream.. It really helps with lines and wrinkles</li>
    <li> Have at last seen results on face cream after buying and returning many item that promised  but never delivered.  LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does the job and helps heal my acne overnight. It does not clog my pores and it can be worn before putting on makeup and especially on some what broken skin from acne. Not only for older women.</li>
    <li> Once you use Retinol on a regular basis, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference without it. This is a must for aging skin. Slightly more expensive than generic, but worth the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s a really nice cream and it helps remove dead skin and makes your skin so soft. I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see results fast enough on my face (I was looking for something to start working within the week) so I switched tactics. It also has a thicker, heavier, creamy feel to it that I decided I don&#x27;t like (I tend to go for more oil based products). I didn&#x27;t get rid of it and ended up using it on my feet though and that has really done wonders on my rough patches. I would recommend it for anyone who has corns or calluses. Rub it on at night and leave a little dollop on it while you sleep.</li>
    <li> THIS CREAM IS OK, NOT THE BEST I&#x27;VE HAD BUT OKAY!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a bigger jar</li>
    <li> Items arrived very fast in perfect condition .seller did a great job packing the product.I love how my face felt the next morning very soft , no harsh smell at all  works great for my skin I would order from this seller again 5 stars!!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and have already seen great results.  It has a clean scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
    <li> To me, this has a really strong unpleasant smell that is just toooo much for me.  It lingers and lingers, too.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best retinol cream I have ever used.  The scent is very pleasant, and the cream itself is very luxurious.  My hands have never looked better.  Of course this price is great too.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel really soft and after a few days, my skin looked better but I truly cannot stand the fragrance. It&#x27;s overwhelming. Don&#x27;t know if I can get past the smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. While not &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; my sebaceous hyperplasia, it really made the signs incredibly minimal. Everyone, even my 10yo son, noticed the difference in the bumps being gone. After using liberally for a few days the bumps itched and started actually falling off. I know this is just my case, but it&#x27;s the one that really matters to me. After they all &amp;#34;shrunk&amp;#34; I cut back and applied less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme soaks right into my face. Not greasy at all.  I use it after showering and shaving and have noticed a HUGE difference in every aspect of my skin. I&#x27;m bald and even wipe some across the top of my head and noticed the skin being much softer and not itching as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have reported they are put off by the scent. I&#x27;d hate to be them if this caused them not to use and benefit from this product. There IS a scent, but not an appalling one. When I first opened it I was a bit fearful, but all was fine. I don&#x27;t smell it at all once it&#x27;s applied and I have my cologne on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered more since my other half has been dipping into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my skin.  My face is actually smooth.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price!  I&#x27;ve tried the expensive retinol creams, but read about this brand in a women&#x27;s magazine and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m quite pleased.  The odor is a bit off, nothing terrible, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  And the consistency is thick and creamy, so a little goes a long way.  I combine it with a hyaluronic acid cream, too, at night.  I read that retinol creams work best when applied at night, because sunlight degrades it.  If you apply it at bedtime, it soaks in during sleep and penetrates your skin better to do its miracle work.  I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, and nobody believes me when I tell them my age!  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over a year now.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels so nice on your skin. Not heavy, oily or drying. It&#x27;s really awesome and I&#x27;m planning on stocking up.</li>
    <li> Love the cream. Not oily!</li>
    <li> I helps with moisturizing/hydrating the skin. I use it in combination with the Collagen Beauty Cream sold by Amazon for about the same price.  I haven&#x27;t really seen any major change in my skin other than it keeps it hydrated but at the price I was not expecting much.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference and I&#x27;ve used the whole jar. Maybe I&#x27;m just too old or it&#x27;s just my skin type.</li>
