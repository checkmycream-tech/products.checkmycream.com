<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> did just what i needed.</li>
    <li> I do like the Plastic Ointment Jars, they hold a lot and are light weight and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> nice sturdy jars for balms, salves and butters.  Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> These jars are awesome! I use them for storing homemade toothpaste, homemade deodorant, and whipped coconut oil infused with lavender oil. My homemade toothpaste and deodorant is simply coconut oil mixed with baking soda yet these jars are always easy to clean with dish soap despite storing oils for months at a time. The oil washes out fast and easily every time! The plastic is very durable and I know they will last for many years. The lids are easy to open and never have any problems screwing them on or off quickly. In the future I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> These are great! I will definitely buy them again!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, wish I&#x27;d ordered more</li>
    <li> These were long skinny containers not wide mouth as shown. Boooooo.</li>
    <li> just as expected. good quality at a fair price</li>
    <li> Picture of product is not what the actual product is</li>
    <li> Basic and functional. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> nice size a bit bigger then I thought but also nice to store beads and they don&#x27;t take up a lot of space like a lot of other containers I have used.</li>
    <li> These were packaged well and arrived on time.  I would definitely order them again.  I am using them for making homemade lotions and to give out to friends.  These are perfect!</li>
    <li> I have used these containers to make balms and salves.  They work wonderfully.  The threading on the bottle makes the caps easy to open and close.  They are the perfect size to get your fingers into the bottle or use a small spatula as to not contaminate the contents.  They were shipped extra fast and I would suggest these to others and I have already purchased more!</li>
    <li> The Youth of my church used these jars to put lotion that they made for the Mothers of our Church for Mother&#x27;s day.  They were a hit.  Just the right size to keep in the purse.  The Mothers loved it.  Would order them again for other craft projects that requires jars with lids.  The lids fit great.</li>
    <li> Size is accurate, seals well. I bought them to put home made creams and salves in and they work well for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Use these jars to old coconut oil and lotions in for my infant, they are a good size and the lids are easy to get on and off.</li>
    <li> The picture shows jars with lower height.  Jars arrived with narrow diameter and longer body [height].  Will not reorder again jars from GBO.  Kindly read through feed backs; I&#x27;m not the only not happy with order.</li>
    <li> Solid product. Love them, except that they are plastic. I just didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on glass because I planned on giving some of the salve I made and poured in them away.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Good value. Never disappointed with this company&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for ointments or salves. They are well constructed. Smooth with flat sides which makes labeling easier.</li>
    <li> My only issue with these is that they are more vertical than they are shown in the pictures which makes them not what I was looking for - which was a small container to hold home made body butters. Because they are tall and thin, about 1.5&amp;#34; wide and 2.5&amp;#34; tall, they are just OK for my needs. I was hoping for a more wide, less tall proportion.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  I used them for small containers to put homemade lotion in for gifts.  Add a cute label and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
    <li> I used these jars for homemade body butter.  The quality of the jars is fine, no sharp edges or manufacturing defects.  Jars seal tightly.  I just wish they were a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. Although I haven&#x27;t used them yet, on a tight budget these would work as well as any other. I wish I had spent a little more and been satisfied with my purchase.  Maybe I can dress their plainness up with colorful labels.  I realize what&#x27;s inside the container is more important than the container .</li>
    <li> They are of really good quality, I bought them for my mom&#x27;s vitamins so that she can do 30 days at once and it is easier for her.</li>
    <li> i use them to store seeds, and like that they are not see through, and the lids work perfectly.  glad i got them.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, easy to open and close. Nice flat top for labels. Would highly recommend for creams and body butters</li>
    <li> I needed some small jars to mix my products in and this works great. The lids are tight and stay on. I&#x27;ve still got several left to use.</li>
    <li> love them!  works for so many different things.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I ordered.  They will be very useful. Will most likely order them again in the future.</li>
    <li> LOVE these. I used them for body butter. I&#x27;ve purchased body butter at craft fairs, usually in these same containers. At craft fairs the body butters are very expensive, and I decided to make my own. But of all the ingredients I had to buy, the containers were the MOST expensive and most difficult to choose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally body butter is in larger, 4-ounce jars but these smaller jars are a great size for a harder butter to use on lips and hands, and to keep in your purse or car. The screw lid is secure and they are reasonably attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the BEST value I could find in 2 oz containers. VERY priced.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size that I needed for my Miracle Salve.  And unlike the picture, the bottom is more rounded, so I was very happy.</li>
    <li> Good and sturdy containers. I did not have to worry about filling them with hot liquid, and they can survive drops and other accidents without fear of cracking. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great! I make homemade salves an they are perfect! although I did want these boxy sqaure looking ones when what I got was a softer edged, more round container. Just keep an eye out amazon products may have small writing sayin &amp;#34; product may be different than pictured&amp;#34;. kind of irritates me they do that! just be aware. great containers though!</li>
    <li> Perfect size an well made.  Exactly what  needed for my homemade salves.  Most definitely will purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> had to get glass,  product was hot.</li>
    <li> I am starting to use essential oils. I am wanting to create creams and ointments. I was looking for ointment jars with lids. This vendor offered 1/2 oz, 1 oz and 2 oz sizes. They delivered as promised and I received exactly what I ordered. Product looks solid and will hopefully prove reliable.</li>
    <li> Great price.  I use these jars to make travel size containers of cleansing creams, conditioner and other thick liquids.  Have carried them in my purse and in luggage and have never had a spill.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> These are leak free. I have oil in mine and no evidence of leakage or aroma coming from the jars (mine are filled with oil and dried roses). They look exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> used these for Christmas. Made moisturizing cream. These are a great size and worked well</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered them.  They worked perfect for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Perfect little jars for homemade hand creams and I am still trying to find more uses for them.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my salves and homemade tooth paste. So far seems to not let any liquid out, so pretty air tight.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.  Lids screw on tightly for my salves.</li>
    <li> I use these for my face wash when I travel so I don&#x27;t have to deal with messes and exploding plastic bottles and/or leaks.</li>
    <li> I use these to keep little containers of coconut oil in my car, gym bag, work, etc.  Coconut oil (good for moisturizing lips, hands, face) is solid up until 76 degrees or so, so I needed something that won&#x27;t leak in various temperatures.  These fit the bill!</li>
    <li> The images provided do not match the actual product. They are about double the height of the images provided.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to store my homemade body butter and give them as gifts.  They work perfectly.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in a timely manner and priced reasonable. I particularly like the size, large enough yet small and easy to carry. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice and useful product. I received it right away, nicely packaged. I would recommend it to anybody that has to travel or for any other use.</li>
    <li> These jars are perfect for carrying around salves and ointments.  I use them in my purse and for travel, so that I don&#x27;t have to take a large container with me.</li>
    <li> I made some lotion and these jars were perfect to store it in! They are nice and dark so the sun can&#x27;t get through and they have nice liners on the top of the lids to help keep things fresh. I would order from this company again if needed. Delivered on time and I had no issues with any of the jars or lids.</li>
    <li> I like them for the reason they hold up well when you are pouring very hot liquids into them.I like the doudle wall construction on the jars. It makes them easy to handle when they are hot.</li>
    <li> The bottom is longer than the picture and they look like medicine pill bottles. I know when this bottle is half full, I will have difficulty getting the ointment out.</li>
    <li> perfect size for salve</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and work well. The kids can seem to be a little loose but with a solid lotion inside I have not noticed any leaking.  They are thin and light weight, but have worked perfect for my homemade lotions.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for packaging my own scented oil combination for gifts.</li>
    <li> These are ok. They are taller than pictured. Maybe they sent the wrong size?</li>
    <li> These work great for my homemade salve! The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, is even with permanent marker, anything you try to write on them for labeling, wipes right off, but the sticker labels don&#x27;t come off as easy!</li>
    <li> The containers I received are more narrow than pictured.  They measure approx. 1-5/8&amp;#34; wide and 2-3/8&amp;#34; tall.  Diameter of the lid is 1-7/8&amp;#34;.  My order was from Glass Bottle Outlet with fulfillment by Amazon.  I would have preferred wider shorter containers, but they seem to be well made, and they should be handy for traveling.</li>
    <li> I like, but now I have too many. I really only needed a couple :/</li>
    <li> Wrapped nicely, easy to use and would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for homemade balms and salves.</li>
    <li> Fine jars and a good price</li>
    <li> The 2 ounce size is great for lotions and small amounts of face / body scrub.  They are a great quality - plain and simple design.  I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for homemade diaper creams that I make for my own child and my friends who are parents. It is a good size for taking along in the diaper bag or leaving on the changing table, and the screw on cap is especially nice for traveling in the diaper bag as it has never popped off. It is a durable material, I have never had any cracks or leaks in the diaper bag and I am pretty rough on my diaper bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item for travel or homemade items. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I used for homemade body butter. They are durable and don&#x27;t leak. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> They are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> Great little bottles that are sturdy and seal well. Perfect for traveling and craft items.</li>
    <li> 2oz is the perfect size - about as big as a baby&#x27;s fist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twist cap keeps it sealed well so I can leave it in the bathroom without worrying about mold or melting/leaking or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for oil + shea butter moisturizers. I wanted something I could leave in the shower for shaving butter - these jars work perfectly. As long as your hand is dry when you take butter out, no water will get in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero complaints.</li>
