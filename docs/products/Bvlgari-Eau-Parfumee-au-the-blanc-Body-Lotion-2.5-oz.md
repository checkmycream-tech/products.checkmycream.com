<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice and light.  Perfect for the summer.</li>
    <li> smell is rather strong, but the lotion itself has a smooth consistency</li>
    <li> This product had no perfume...it is plain white body lotion.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but didn&#x27;t realize that 2.5 oz of lotion is A LOT LESS than 2.5 oz of perfume. The lotion came in a mini size bottle...like the kind you get when staying at a hotel. So beware if you are buying LOTION.....Now I know!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent and love that I can get smaller quanities.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the fragance that I&#x27;d wear, but my mom loved it. It smells like forest or somthing like that. If you like that kind of fragance this could be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at the rave reviews on the scent. It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s also not fabulous. It&#x27;s ....odd. Not sweet, not spicy - not like much of anything I can think of. Cucumbers, possibly? Mild herbal? I found it did soak into my hands OK, not greasy like some reviews mentioned, so it must depend on skin type.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, I would not buy this again. It&#x27;s just - ok and mostly forgettable.</li>
    <li> I was not care of the size. 2,6oz its like a pocked hand cream and for the Price its not worth it. It were going to be a precent now i have to buy another one</li>
    <li> Simply Fabulous, the scent is divine.</li>
    <li> this lotion was at both the ritz carlton and four seasons hotel.    it&#x27;s unique in that it&#x27;s a lotion without a greasy feel.  you can still grab things with a sticky feel.  but it&#x27;s best attribute is it&#x27;s great smell.      highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> bad product and he send them used product</li>
    <li> This is just okay.  Not crazy about the scent.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little strong for me.</li>
    <li> great smell but for being bvlgari their  lotion its self wasnt high quality.  it felt as though i bought it from a dollar store. not very moisterizing</li>
    <li> Love the product. The bottle size was perfect. The price was right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price I paid</li>
    <li> Arrived in record time!!  Birthday girl was so happy!!!</li>
    <li> The lotion feel like it is diluted. The fragrant is not as strong as the one I have at home and I concluded that it is because the texture of the lotion is different. The one I have at home is more creamy but the one I just brought is like water. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a different kind of lotion I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like it I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a small bottle cause I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I think this smells like a mans cologne.  I like Bvlgari fragrances for women not unisex I guess.  I don&#x27;t know if it moisturizes because I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with great expectations but it is really a bad product, which has a terrible smell. I couldn&#x27;t even wear it once, had to wash it off. ....</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good! Like a cool summer breeze.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS LOTION - SO NICE THE REAL THING!  TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this cologne, it smelled like men&#x27;s cologne. The only reason I didn&#x27;t send it back is I gave it to my son, and I didn&#x27;t pay very much for it.</li>
    <li> For this price quantity should be more</li>
    <li> Great condition, I am happy I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> Let me count the ways, Bvlgari! &amp;#34;Au The Blanc&amp;#34; is a scent that is simultaneously fresh and haunting.  The lotion itself has the perfect amount of scent without being overwhelming, and does a great job moisturizing as well. For being just 2.5 oz, it still lasts a long time and this size is perfect to throw in your travel bag.  I keep one at home and one at the office.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  But the lotion does not seem to be a good value, small bottle for the price.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good deal and just what the wife wanted</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the first time, I ike the cologne so I just tried this I will be purchasing it again. I really like this scent.</li>
    <li> I had first become aware of the Bvlgari Blanc scent when I stayed at a Rtiz Carlton hotel and this brand was the complimentary bath and shower toiletries including the soap, lotion, shampoo and condition.  I fell in love with the scent and have been buying the entire product line for the past 2 years.  The prices found on Amazon for the body lotion and cologne are the best you will find anywhere.  The lotion feels silky has a wonderful, sexy, soft scent that I and my husband both love.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Very quick and prompt delivery. I am not sure about the quality of the product as a cream but the smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing ! I heard of it in Janet Evonivichs Stepanie Plum books,really didn&#x27;t think there was such a fragrance,...hubby love it!</li>
    <li> This size is too small.</li>
    <li> I get tons of &amp;#34;you smell amazing&amp;#34; compliments and tons of hugs every time I wear this lotion. It is a people magnet!</li>
    <li> This particular fragrance was too strong.  I thought from other feedback comments that it would be a lighter, more subtle fragrance.  Wore once and gave it away.</li>
    <li> great fragrance with not over whelming you&lt;br /&gt;fresh scent with hint of sex appeal&lt;br /&gt;goes great with the soap and perfume&lt;br /&gt;will order again for sure</li>
    <li> I enjoy this scent.  I receive the body bar every Christmas from my sister.  Using the lotion helps the wonderful scent linger throughout the day.  It is not overbearing, if you don&#x27;t slather it on excessively.  Fresh and light scent that pleases and lingers nicely throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this scent when I stayed at the Ritz. The smell is classy and long-lasting, but not too overwhelming. Received tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> I first time used it on vacation in Punta Cana. It was in my bathroom, I had lotion shampoo and conditioner. Since then I&#x27;m addicted to that smell and it&#x27;s always remind me of that beautiful place.</li>
    <li> Previous. Bottles of the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; had a stronger perfume smell which I preferred.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s smells like perfume...got many compliments from friends!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine at my office wears this lotion and buys it at a very exclusive department store. I loved the light fragrance ~ not too strong ~ very clean. I was extremely pleased to see I could purchase the same lotion without leaving my home and at a much better price. I like wearing lotions vs. perfume because they don&#x27;t seem to be as overwhelming with the fragrance. I gave this product 5 stars becasue it is the exact same lotion that I wanted and at a very great price.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer and I try to stockpile it as my funds allow. I MUST absolutely have this daily</li>
    <li> Great lotion! I got a sample when I stayed at a hotel and I simply fell in love with the smell. Not greasy. The fragrance lasts all day. Leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Since I m not able to return to Naples and the grand hotel, my olfactory sense has returned with this product at hand.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I bought it even though I have tons of bottles of lotion from hotel stays.  I love the cologne, too, but this is great when I want a lighter touch.  It&#x27;s very pricey for a small bottle of lotion, though, so I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> I first used this body lotion when staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh when I got married.  It was in the rooms and the set included the Bvlgari shampoo &amp; conditioner which also smell divine - not just tiny ones but 2.5 oz each.  I put as many as I could in my suitcase as it had such a luxurious scent.  I am still using it a year later.  I always get complimented on it when I wear it and I know others that ran out to buy it after I told them what it was.  You don&#x27;t need anything stronger than this body lotion - the scent lasts all day.  I&#x27;m not fond of strong perfumes, preferring to use a body spray or lotion in place of perfume. Not cheap, but it lasts a long, long time as you only need a little if you are using it mainly for the scent, not as an all over body lotion (use something less expensive for that!).</li>
    <li> Excellent when traveling</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
    <li> Enjoy the product-very prompt.</li>
    <li> Like the fragerance ,just a bit small</li>
    <li> Wonderful Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I like the scent on my wife, but she complains that it is greasy (it is) and doesn&#x27;t soak into her skin well.  Should do better for the price, she wound up using it as a perfume because as a lotion it was useless.  So depending on what you want...</li>
    <li> Ditto see above did not meet expectations.  May have been old inventory or could they have been seconds?  May want to look into supplier.</li>
    <li> Love the formulation for this product which applies smoothly and is just the correct consistence for after shower use.  I use it with the spray version of this scent and it is lovely.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful lotion. Aside from the heavenly scent, the lotion quickly absorbs into the skin leaving it lightly scented and fresh.</li>
    <li> Very, very, very BEAUTIFUL!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Such a sexy fragrance, although I can&#x27;t take it on the go . The cap opens easy , spilled lotion in your purse</li>
    <li> Was exactly as I expected, wish it came in a bigger bottle. Would buy it again. The scent is very original. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Great for every day wear</li>
    <li> Pretty smell and good quality of lotion!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for a dear elderly lady, she loved it. i guess is a great buy</li>
    <li> Kings of Comfort - Values its Customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items was neatly packed and arrived on time the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider the Kings of Comfort if you are order this items.</li>
    <li> Fantastic feeling of freshness and soothing to the skin makes this a success story.</li>
    <li> As far as the lotion, it&#x27;s divine.  It smells amazing, and the scent is truly lasting.  Now, as far as the packaging...these look like left over large samples.  I was expecting a nice bottle in a box, not a flip top in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, product is great and I would rate it 10 stars,  but cannot be gifted as is.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, calidad excelente, entregado en los tiempos estipulados, muy buen vendedor, lo recomiendo para futura o futuras compra o compras.</li>
    <li> Clean scent, love it.</li>
    <li> Good fragance, but smal!</li>
    <li> Always love this lotion! I must say that I have gotten it at a better value at times but I love it just the same!</li>
    <li> What a lovely scent!!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect size. Its wonderful scent, which lasts and lasts, has garnered many compliments.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my selection.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where this thing came from it looked like and had the name but it surely did not smell the same.</li>
    <li> Another beautiful product from Bvlgari!  The body lotion fragrance stays all day!  The price is great, for such a luxurious&lt;br /&gt;Product.</li>
    <li> I love Bvlgari, but the size that was sent to me was too small. I wanted this as a gift, but by the size of what was sent me, I will not give it to my friend.</li>
    <li> Very light scent and light moisturizing.  Nice if you don&#x27;t have really dry skin.  Also the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long and the bottle is really small for the price.</li>
    <li> smallest bottle of lotion ever. seems more of a complimentary you would get as a hotel guest. I just keep it in my purse.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance delivered in a silky lotion!</li>
    <li> Silly me, I thought it was a helluva deal, but then when I opened the box, i realized it was a really small bottle. I love the lotion itself, but I was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t pay closer attention to how small it was. I should have know it was too good to be true to get a full bottle of this lotion for $8. Anyway, at least I have a travel size now. Put it on before you go to bed. Heavenly.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and love the small bottles!&lt;br /&gt;Gave one as a gift, too.</li>
    <li> Small bottle but the smell wasn&#x27;t how I remembered at Mandalay Bay years ago...&lt;br /&gt;pretty strong smell..</li>
    <li> woodsy smell.. unisex appropriate.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I first found it in a resort I stayed at in Mexico. It&#x27;s so light and even be worn in humid tropical weather!</li>
    <li> Clean fresh scent. Great product. I&#x27;ve use this product before while stay at a Ritz Carlton. I&#x27;ve had nothing but compliments about how good this product smells.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, fabulous. Great fragrance and long lasting aroma.</li>
    <li> Refreshing scent. What I like about it is that it is not overwhelming, and as the day goes on, it becomes more subtle and calming. I first tried this when a coworker who has it at her desk, offered me a few drops. After I tried it, I knew I wanted to have my own bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the cream!  Light and lovely!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and scent lasts a long time, and for me, lasts longer than the perfume. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this perfumed body lotion....the price was right, so I bought three!....love this product...when you wear it, you do not need to put on any perfume...the wonderful scent from the lotion on your hands , face or neck...or wherever, is so pleasant and compliments always abound...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for offering this product!</li>
    <li> The bottle was very small, but I love the scent so it&#x27;s definitely a keeper.  I&#x27;ve been searching for this scent for a long time.  I wish the lotion was offered in a large container.</li>
    <li> Not smelling good , disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this scent. A coworker had some at her desk and this prompted me to buy some. I really loved the scent of this one. Matter of fact, I think I&#x27;ve used it all...maybe I need more!</li>
    <li> I love it, and will be buying more when this runs out.  In the future I will buy a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Richer than the emulsified version but smells and and feels great. It can be worn alone as well and still keeps you smelling so nice.&lt;br /&gt;My husband liked it so much that he stole 2 of the six bottles I bought!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion!</li>
    <li> smells awesome and not overpowering</li>
    <li> This product smells incredible.</li>
    <li> The fragrance last a long time.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have ever had! Goes on SMOOTH.</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly, but the flip-top cap was broken. Ah well... It&#x27;s not worth sending back. I&#x27;ll just hope for better luck next time.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Receive compliments whenever I wear this lotion.  Long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> the lotion was an xtra small.</li>
    <li> Great scent. I didn&#x27;t realize it was so small! On the other hand it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent but too small</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I went to Los Angeles and this lotion was at my hotel and I could not get enough of it.  It had such a clean smell. I went to look for it in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I finally decided to check Amazon and there it was.  I get a lot of compliments on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described, carefully packaged and quickly shipped.  Many thanks!</li>
    <li> I love it .... it is so hard to find only the body lotion</li>

    <li> I really like it, any real man in this earth should get one</li>
    <li> smells great and is very soft.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for women!! I&#x27;ll buy moré next month</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for years... It has a fresh--just got out of the shower nice soap smell that lasts all day--not heavy or aggressive like perfume. It&#x27;s more of an earth tone than overly sweet.  (I wear it with a tiny drop of good patchoulli oil--and always get compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this and get lots of complements and people asking where to purchase it. Great product but tiny bottle.</li>
