<ol>
      <li>Awesome product!</li>
      <li>I used it in combination with the 1 hour Detox tabs for insurance and they worked marvelously.</li>
      <li>Excellent to cleanse your organism.</li>
      <li>Works great!!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>Great for a home test not lab probably.</li>
      <li>but I was good to go.  </li>
      <li>, I even took my own creatine  and vitamin B,  for fear of a diluted sample.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t clean your system for good</li>
      <li>Probably would of worked more if I quit a couple days or week before the test.</li>
      <li>4 more aspirin</li>
      <li>After the test the mans exact words were &amp;#34;we&#x27;re gonna call it good</li>
      <li>Just wanted to share how happy I was with this product for anyone else who may not be given time to \\&quot;detox\\&quot; naturally.</li>
      <li>Will work fine for at home drug tests but when at a facility they will know you did something too mask the pee and will ask you to take the test over.</li>
      <li>(and yes, I DID follow the instructions precisely).</li>
      <li>it gives you a 5 or 6 hour window where you are clean if you follow the instructions I&#x27;m about to give you it will work.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything thought it would clean my system.</li>
      <li>I did not eat on day 4, did the carbo clean as directed urinated 3 time</li>
      <li>This bottle of Q Carbo tastes great and will get you clean in as little as an hour or two before your start any workout program — or the biggest (employment) test of your life.</li>
      <li>I had a UA, stay clean by not putting toxins into my body for 48hrs as stated, began my detox followed all steps EXACTLY.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re golden.  </li>
      <li>drank first one after a 3 day juice cleanse before a meal.</li>
      <li>I took the tabs and liquid detox early after a light breakfast.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>when i got home as a safety precaution i tested myself with a at home dip stick test and came up positive for THC still.</li>
      <li>and my test was positive for thc.</li>
      <li>I would not be able to write this review if it hadn&#x27;t, as I would be in jail.  </li>
      <li>the juice is the real deal....had a drug test for my job ND didn&#x27;t believe it would work after I took</li>
      <li>This cleanser really works.</li>
      <li>so i got a job and lost that fast.</li>
      <li>been &amp;#34;toxin&amp;#34; free for 3 weeks prior to using this, did everything it said on the bottle EVERYTHING.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>For the third time, Herbal Clean worked for me.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>The night before I drank two pedialytes as fast as I could in order to clear my urine.</li>
      <li>I stopped consuming/breathing toxins a week before using the product(a stark contrast to the multiple times a day kind habit I have had for 9 years).  </li>
      <li>You cannot use sorry to say, its no one business what you do on your own time.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not have any right or permission using my name or e-mail with my review.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly, including not eating that morning and gave my sample on the 3rd pee.</li>
      <li>I have used 2 different products from this q-carbo company 4 days after a small amount of cocaine was used, I had 3 days to clean out my system before test was given</li>
      <li>still positive dont waste ur money.</li>

<li> Not only was I sent the wrong flavour, but it didn&#x27;t work at ALL</li>
<li> I past with flying colors.</li>
<li> Not sure if this drink is what helped me pass or if it was not smoking for 2weeks, the ODing on niacin for 2 weeks, the gallon of water a day for 2 weeks, or vinegar for 2 weeks, but I passed with flying colors after taking this drink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> did not work, took my test at 11am. drunk the 16oz bottle around 7am and pissed like 10 times before my actual test and drank 3 bottles of water on the way to the lab. when i got home as a safety precaution i tested myself with a at home dip stick test and came up positive for THC still. I will admit i have yet to learn the lab results but even if the worked with the bach i gave the lab, I hear this stuff is detectable. so i got a job and lost that fast. waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;facts:&lt;br /&gt;- i havent smoked for 3-4 days (usually i smoke almost everyday of the week)&lt;br /&gt;- im about 150lbs&lt;br /&gt;- i work out and sweat alot&lt;br /&gt;-  i brought my bottle from a GNC store also</li>
    <li> WORKS! Heavy smoker for years. I had a piss test at 9:45 today and passed I&#x27;ll tell ya how. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; tall and a 160 lbs. I smoked a bowl 11 hours before my court appointed test and pissed cold. The night before I drank two pedialytes as fast as I could in order to clear my urine. Before bed (about 2 am) I took 3 325mg aspirin. I woke up periodically throughout the night to pee and every time I did I would drink a glass of water. My alarm for 7:30 and I popped 4 more aspirin then it was time to start the qcarbo process. I began the process at aprox 8:00 am and was done with it at aprox 8:30 am. Waited until about 9:30 and drove to court. After the test the mans exact words were &amp;#34;we&#x27;re gonna call it good but you were cutting it close, stay away from that stuff&amp;#34;. I would recommend a couple days of not smoking before taking your test but with my experience it works only 11 hours after smoking.</li>
    <li> Works great!! It works for a stick test but not lab. Smoked same day and had a unknown drug test in the evening and passed barely. Probably would of worked more if I quit a couple days or week before the test. Took drink at 315, went pee twice and third time at 445 for the test and passed. Great for a home test not lab probably.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me! I did everything it asked me to do even starting my nonstop drinking of water multiple days before using the drink. I smoke A LOT of weed and took a clinic test not a normal at home test. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T PURCHASE. This is my warning to you. I had a UA, stay clean by not putting toxins into my body for 48hrs as stated, began my detox followed all steps EXACTLY. Went to take my test, couple days pass I failed with a THC level at 226. Prior UA I have used THE STUFF, smoked a blunt right b4 using the drink and then went and took my test and failed at 149. If you&#x27;re purchasing ANY detox drink, go with THE STUFF.</li>
    <li> Q Carbo is detected by a lot of labs now a days, be careful. I have passed with THCclear</li>
    <li> This cleanser really works. I used it in combination with the 1 hour Detox tabs for insurance and they worked marvelously. I took the tabs and liquid detox early after a light breakfast. Then follow up with a liquid cleanser again in the afternoon. You&#x27;ll be peeing up a storm but then again you want to pass the test. Take the test within 5 hours of the last cleansing. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this drink is what helped me pass or if it was not smoking for 2weeks, the ODing on niacin for 2 weeks, the gallon of water a day for 2 weeks, or vinegar for 2 weeks, but I passed with flying colors after taking this drink. I drank 6 bottles of water throughout day, took this with the 5 capsules drank another 6 bottles and peed maybe 5-6 times afterwards, then took exam 2 hours after drinking; and passed. Hello big time job with big time money 😎 thanks Qcarbo, I&#x27;d recommend to all dedicated to it</li>
    <li> Useless!  Tried it how some people said with the 2-3 hr window yet still couldn&#x27;t pass.  I also had the Q carbo 32 about a week ago and that couldn&#x27;t pass me either.</li>
    <li> I used the 16 oz. the night before as instructed and the used the 20 oz. 5 hours before my physical. I past with flying colors. Awesome&lt;br /&gt;JC</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend who got out of the system. He partied one night and his PO had to pee test him a couple days later. So I ordered and gave it to him. He passed his test and didn&#x27;t get locked up.</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm.  Just follow the instructions and you&#x27;re golden.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Anyone looking to rid their system of any bad toxins (he, he) should look no further. This bottle of Q Carbo tastes great and will get you clean in as little as an hour or two before your start any workout program — or the biggest (employment) test of your life. ;-)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything thought it would clean my system.</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Ran it thru twice in 4 days, still failed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Does just what it says. Trust me….you will not be let down! Daily smoker for about 16 years. Follow instructions and test during peak hours of drinking the supplement.</li>
    <li> Excellent to cleanse your organism.</li>
    <li> For the third time, Herbal Clean worked for me.  I would not be able to write this review if it hadn&#x27;t, as I would be in jail.  I stopped consuming/breathing toxins a week before using the product(a stark contrast to the multiple times a day kind habit I have had for 9 years).  I also weigh 175 lbs, so the drink had its work cut out for it.  I drank a LOT of water, ran, and avoided fats for the week, although I did still drink alcohol.  I followed the instructions exactly, including not eating that morning and gave my sample on the 3rd pee. About an hour and a half after I finished drinking the drink, my pee was an eerie, neon, yellow color but I was good to go.  It appeared to last for another 2 hours or so.  I highly recommend this product.  (My test was not sent to a lab, it was a simple 7-panel, although it was court ordered.)</li>
    <li> I have used 2 different products from this q-carbo company 4 days after a small amount of cocaine was used, I had 3 days to clean out my system before test was given I ate fruits drank plenty of water quit smoking . I did not eat on day 4, did the carbo clean as directed urinated 3 time , I even took my own creatine  and vitamin B,  for fear of a diluted sample. my results came back diluted with traces of cocaine . do not use this product. It does not work.  don&#x27;t waist your money. don&#x27;t let these people put any thoughts in your head that you can use .  You cannot use sorry to say, its no one business what you do on your own time.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not have any right or permission using my name or e-mail with my review. if this cannot be said anonymously  then it is used with out my permission. I just wish to help someone who might make a poor judgment by thinking this product will allow them to get away with something.  this is not  a review about  Amazon. its the product.</li>
    <li> Take it from me.....the juice is the real deal....had a drug test for my job ND didn&#x27;t believe it would work after I took it got nervous nd quit ND told my boss why.....a week later my boss calls and says u overreacted nd that I had passed the physical.....smh.....qcarbo is the truth ie. I smoked the night b4 I took it at 500 pm nxt day</li>
    <li> Hint it doesn&#x27;t clean your system for good it gives you a 5 or 6 hour window where you are clean if you follow the instructions I&#x27;m about to give you it will work. I have used this several time to pass a test and has worked every time. I only smoke so it works for cleaning your system of THC can&#x27;t comment on how it works for other drugs. This is not intended to pass drug test it&#x27;s meant to start you off on a diet so that is what the instructions on the bottle are meant for. If you drink this stuff followed by like 4 to 6 glasses of water then pee at least  twice by your third piss you will be clean for around 5 to 6 hours maybe a little longer. I have used this to get a job, once to pass a test for getting hurt on the job and once to get a promotion and worked every time. (All piss tests not blood tests will not work on blood tests)</li>
    <li> waste of cash. failed dip strip test.back to the drawing board for a reliable detox. any other suggestions are needed.</li>
    <li> I would not trust anything out there that says you can take this and pass a piss test, I got 2 of these to help with a detox for a UA. drank first one after a 3 day juice cleanse before a meal. Drank second one 2 days before UA, i had been staying away from fatty snacks, eating raw as much as i could, ran every other day, LOTS OF WATER. passed ua with flying colors. Dont run the risk of failing and just quit for 3-4 weeks and detox you will pass</li>
    <li> I was given notice for a job that I needed to take a drug test Friday after smoking Monday (I&#x27;m a moderate user). I went to GNC and crossed my fingers that this would work for THC not just \\&quot;toxins in your body\\&quot; and it did! My urine was crazy clear and I passed! Just wanted to share how happy I was with this product for anyone else who may not be given time to \\&quot;detox\\&quot; naturally.</li>
    <li> Will work fine for at home drug tests but when at a facility they will know you did something too mask the pee and will ask you to take the test over.</li>
    <li> Worked extremely well for me, passed my drug screen with only 2 weeks abstaining from marijuana.</li>
    <li> been &amp;#34;toxin&amp;#34; free for 3 weeks prior to using this, did everything it said on the bottle EVERYTHING. and my test was positive for thc. this drink, did not work at all. *PSA: IF YOU ARE A HEAVY TOXIN USER, THIS WIll NOT WORK*  smoked toxins for 6 years everyday. been at the gym everyday and drinking a gallon of water, havent eaten anything but lean foods... still positive dont waste ur money. use the money and join a gym.</li>
    <li> Not only was I sent the wrong flavour, but it didn&#x27;t work at ALL (and yes, I DID follow the instructions precisely).</li>
