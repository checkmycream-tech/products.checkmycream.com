      <li>Well worth the price, I&#x27;m used to paying more for specialty face washes because my skin reacts to just about every chemical, but not to this product.</li>

      <li>It is non-drying and my skin has never looked this fresh and healthy.  </li>

      <li>Please go back to the old pump which worked perfectly.</li>

      <li>With the new pump, it comes out more liquid than foam.</li>
      <li>Have used it for many years for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>but I use it on my hands more frequently during the day.  </li>
      <li>, the price is great, especially for a natural, non-toxic, foaming face wash.</li>
      <li>Scent is pretty neutral.</li>
      <li>I think the store I bought from originally had really old stock.  </li>
      <li>My friend had it at their house when I was staying over and tried it there and loved it so much I have made it my everyday fsce wash now.</li>
      <li>Seems to do a thorough job of cleansing, does smell a bit medicine-y though, but not terrible, and Doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all.</li>
      <li>I love it because it takes ALL of my make-up off easily with 1-2 pumps, one bottle lasts a very long time (3-4 months), it smells nice, has nothing harsh or damaging in it and it has helped clear away and keep away my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very light..packaging is horrid</li>
      <li>Unusual smell, but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>It is so gentle on her skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keys really get it.</li>
      <li>Works really well to get makeup off.  </li>
      <li>make sure to buy the all-white bottle, not the blue plastic with white label.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products to everyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I will never go back to what I was using before (Olay, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear.)  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how much product I got for the price.  </li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, and Keys&#x27; formula cleanses without over-drying.  </li>
      <li>My face always FEELS clean and never feels beaten down by the ingredients.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear my husband&#x27;s face and clearing up mine.</li>
      <li>Because it lasts so long and is made with natural ingredients, it can start to mold a little around the top of the container if kept in a bathroom</li>
      <li>Not sure if this is normal since this is the first time I have gotten the new bottle.</li>
      <li>This is actually the new packaging, which is 7.1oz, not the 8 as advertised.</li>
      <li>I poured into the old pump that works fine, but one should not have to monkey around with product that is not cheap.</li>
      <li>But this is not the major issue.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin but get a lot of white heads.</li>
      <li>not  dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>Has helped cleared up my dry sensitive skin without stripping!</li>
      <li>Need to do a second wash under eyes to get the last of my mascara off, but that&#x27;s pretty typical of non-harsh, no chemical face washes.  </li>
      <li>Used to have a pleasant citrus-herbal fragrance, now it smells like herbs gone bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The plastic pump bottle always topples over, and a good product needs sensible packaging. The cleanser is fine, and has a nice clean sage smell. Very light..packaging is horrid</li>
    <li> Have used it for many years for sensitive skin.  It continues to be therapeutic.</li>
    <li> I have used several products from Keys and I am a total convert.  I will never go back to the harsh, chemical-laden soaps and lotions that I was using before.  The foaming soap lasts FOREVER (I use it once a day and one bottle has lasted me over a year.)  I put some of the foaming soap on a cotton ball and remove my eye makeup (totally removes the makeup, no eye irritation) and then I use it as an all over face wash.  The soap gets my skin clean, smells fresh, and most importantly, is all-natural.  It is non-drying and my skin has never looked this fresh and healthy.  I also use the foaming soap with my baby.  It is so gentle on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Butter is also amazing.  I use it every night under my eyes and on my lips and it moisturizes without overydrying like chapstick can.  The Tortuga lotion is great, and I also use the Luminos at night.  It is light and my skin looks perfect in the morning.  All of these products last a long time.  The only thing I might recommend is keeping the Luminos moisturizer in the fridge.  Because it lasts so long and is made with natural ingredients, it can start to mold a little around the top of the container if kept in a bathroom cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about the Keys line of products.  I was surprised at how much product I got for the price.  Usually when I have ordered face products online I receive them and the bottles are about half the size I was expecting.  Not so with Keys.  Each product has numerous uses.  I think that I cover most of my lotion and soap needs with just a couple of Keys products, instead of a cabinet full of drugstore products, which is really great.  It cuts down on clutter and helps to simplify the daily routine.  Now that I have been using the Keys products on a daily basis, I can see how harsh the products were that I was previously using.  I will never go back to what I was using before (Olay, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear.)  I highly recommend these products to everyone.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is amazing! I have VERY sensitive skin, and Keys&#x27; formula cleanses without over-drying.  It&#x27;s helpful for mild acne. Scent is pretty neutral. The ingredients are harmless. It also rinses quickly. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One of the best face wash products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;skin feels extremely clean and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;no need to worry about dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best facial and hand cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s labeled as a facial cleanser and it&#x27;s a good one but I use it on my hands more frequently during the day.  My hands get dry and have a tendency to get tiny skin splts in the winter and this helps prevent that.  It&#x27;s non-greasy non-stick and leaves your hands and face with a light smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My friend had it at their house when I was staying over and tried it there and loved it so much I have made it my everyday fsce wash now. Leaves skin super clean feeling without drying out. I have really sensitive skin but get a lot of white heads. This product helps keep my pores open without irritating my face. I absolutely love it. Well worth the price, I&#x27;m used to paying more for specialty face washes because my skin reacts to just about every chemical, but not to this product. Natural, and smells great too.</li>
    <li> i like that since you only need a little, This bottle will last a LONG time.  Seems to do a thorough job of cleansing, does smell a bit medicine-y though, but not terrible, and Doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all.</li>
    <li> It foams nicely and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;My skin in very dry because I use Retin-A and this product helps keep it moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it took me a while to get used to the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! Makes you look forward to washing your face! I Love it! So gentle and smells great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for well over a year now.  I love it because it takes ALL of my make-up off easily with 1-2 pumps, one bottle lasts a very long time (3-4 months), it smells nice, has nothing harsh or damaging in it and it has helped clear away and keep away my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often get compliments on my skin.  I attribute it to a healthy diet, lots of water drinking, and this line of facial products (and good make-up).  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price is great, especially for a natural, non-toxic, foaming face wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried TONS of facial cleansers - I am just as picky as my skin is sensitive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this face wash in tandem with same brand&#x27;s luminous moisterizer for 6 months now. My face always FEELS clean and never feels beaten down by the ingredients. This size runs out about the same time as the moisturizer does and I only have to buy every 75 days even though I use it twice a day, sometimes 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint - it&#x27;s that I can&#x27;t buy it in bulk...</li>
    <li> I have many allergies to products!&lt;br /&gt;This is the only facewash I can tolerate!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I like the way this product cleans my face however it does not foam the way it is supposed to. It comes out very watery and there is a lot of waste.</li>
    <li> I love the product itself, but for some reason, the one I received had a faulty pump, so there is no foam...just thin liquid.  Thus, the foamy, wonderful effect and affect is gone.  Sad.  Not worth wasting the product to return it, so I&#x27;ll just use it. I wish there was a way to test the pump prior to buying... *sigh</li>
    <li> This is great! Only cleanser I use on my face. I can understand the entire ingredient list. That makes me feel better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Keys for years and will not use anything else.  My husband even uses it.  Keys cleanser fully cleans my face and removes all traces of makeup without stripping my skin.  I use their moisturizer as well.  Top notch product!</li>
    <li> Works really well to get makeup off.  Need to do a second wash under eyes to get the last of my mascara off, but that&#x27;s pretty typical of non-harsh, no chemical face washes.  Smells like spruce trees, but not overpowering.  Clean ingredients and toxic free!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week now and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;LIKES:&lt;br /&gt;Does not  dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Does not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;Gently deep cleans.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little of the product.&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be helping my millia.&lt;br /&gt;Rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good for entire family.&lt;br /&gt;DISLIKES:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to be a foaming cleanser but the pump doesn&#x27;t always work so sometimes the product comes out as a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best smell.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working and clearing skin of bumps caused by other cleansers. Unusual smell, but doesn&#x27;t linger. Cautiously optimistic.</li>
    <li> Keys really get it. My wife and I both use this cleanser and love it. No harmful additives and a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> This is actually the new packaging, which is 7.1oz, not the 8 as advertised. With the new pump, it comes out more liquid than foam. Not sure if this is normal since this is the first time I have gotten the new bottle.</li>
    <li> Has helped cleared up my dry sensitive skin without stripping! Love this product!</li>
    <li> What I like about this product is the ease of use of a foaming cleanser but even more importantly, the fact that it does not contain any harmful chemicals.  Both my husband and I use it.  Keys also has a travel size which lasts for weeks and weeks.</li>
    <li> Usually I am very pleased with the Keys line. However the new pump does not foam like the previous one, it dribbles down the side and does not foam. Please go back to the old pump which worked perfectly. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product does not remove most makeup or dirt.  I use it in the shower but use other products as part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> So disappointed with the new version. Pump does not work properly, so product dispenses as a runny liquid. I poured into the old pump that works fine, but one should not have to monkey around with product that is not cheap. But this is not the major issue. Ive been using for a long time and something has changed - cleanser does not smell the same. Used to have a pleasant citrus-herbal fragrance, now it smells like herbs gone bad. Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/10/2016:  bought the improved version of the facial cleanser, and it&#x27;s a completely different experience.  smells nicer, and the pump works much better.  I think the store I bought from originally had really old stock.  make sure to buy the all-white bottle, not the blue plastic with white label.</li>
    <li> After learning about parabens and toxins in cosmetic and beauty products, I used this to switch from using Proactive.  I love how it smells and its very refreshing to use.  It&#x27;s clear my husband&#x27;s face and clearing up mine.</li>
