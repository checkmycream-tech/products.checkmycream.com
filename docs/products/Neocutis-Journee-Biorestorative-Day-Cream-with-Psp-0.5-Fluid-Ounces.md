      <li>I love the products and love the pricing on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love the stuff.</li>
      <li>I would not be able to afford it without the discount.</li>
      <li>I love what this product does to my face.</li>
      <li>I love it and now my sister is using it too.</li>
      <li>then most moisturizers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>Glad to be able to put this over the neocutis serum.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>but it also gives my face a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>Works great on sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I can wear a light foundation over it, if needed, but most days it&#x27;s fine by itself.</li>
      <li>I tend to break out easily, but no issues with Journee.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and does not feel greasy</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth but not greasy.</li>
      <li>I love the light feel yet powerful moisturizing of the Neocutis bio restorative Day Cream..</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this lotion and try it out .im</li>
      <li>The zinc percent is higher than most leading brands.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>My skin always feels very soft and this goes on so nicely</li>
      <li>sure it&#x27;s a great lotion because it was highly recommended to me from several people.i</li>
      <li>They should make 1 application be 1 full pump.</li>
      <li>I put the date I start using the product on the bottom of the container with a sharpie and it has lasted me a full three months.  </li>
      <li>My mom&#x27;s dermatologist wants about 40% more for the products.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything else out there that I love as much on my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I goes on very smoothly and not a thick coat is needed.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, is moisturizing, and provides effective daily sun protection.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>There is no other product that makes my face look as fresh and bright as this one does, and I have tried many different products.</li>
      <li>this gives such a wonderful finish and has lots of active anti-aging ingredients.</li>
      <li>She was right.</li>
      <li>If you want a healthy makeup base with very good sunscreen, you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t let the serum get absorbed first, though, it can pill.</li>
      <li>There are many other products more reasonably priced that do the job.</li>
      <li>I love Journee, it is worth the extra cost.  </li>
      <li>More time is needed to actually see the results Journee claims this product does.  </li>
      <li>so I gave it a 2star review because I really didn&#x27;t get any product for my money!</li>
      <li>did not have a positive effect on me.</li>
      <li>but I noticed that it was making my skin become more combo (dry in some areas and oilier in others).</li>
      <li>It has definitely reduced the appearance of fine lines and helped minimize some of the spots on my face.</li>
      <li>Still recommend based on the quality but will probably look for something a little more economical for sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Very high-quality brand.</li>
      <li>I really like the Journee biorestorative day cream with the added bonus of the spf and zinc oxide.</li>
      <li>but I think the price is much too high for frequent use.  </li>
      <li>I would not have purchased this item here if I had thought it was the new packaging (would have sourced older type).</li>
      <li>I have normal skin and this cream</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a few weeks and love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>Shame on Neocutis for false advertising and changing a good thing.</li>
      <li>Image needs to be updated to show the new packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a senior lady and this product works great for my thin fragile skin.</li>
      <li>doc said it the moisturizer for my 55 year old face.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I will be more careful in ordering larger size next time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m obsessed with skincare and was glad to have purchased the smaller version of the Neocutis Journee instead of getting the full bottle.</li>
      <li>the bottle is pretty much empty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s twice as large as old one, twice as heavy, not suitable for travel and takes up more space.</li>
      <li>I like how light the cream is and it does not feel oily or heavy after wearing it all day long.</li>
      <li>I am starting to convert to their whole line once I get all my other products used up.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like the Journee biorestorative day cream with the added bonus of the spf and zinc oxide. The zinc percent is higher than most leading brands. I like how light the cream is and it does not feel oily or heavy after wearing it all day long. I have sensitive skin and I have been using this cream for 9 months with no breakouts. It is pricey but it goes a long way if you don&#x27;t over apply.</li>
    <li> This project is great. I stayed the night at a friend&#x27;s house and discovered her secret- Journee. I love it and now my sister is using it too. I&#x27;m a woman in her mid-30s with sun damage. I like the natural look, but I need a little help. This is the product to buy!</li>
    <li> The combination of generic Retin A and the dry air of winter have made my face so dry that I decided to try something other than Neutrogena Liquid Sunblock on my face on weekends (during the week I wear makeup and am in an office building all day so I get by with the spf of my liquid foundation.)  I like the way this day cream moisturizes but I think the price is much too high for frequent use.  I&#x27;ll put it aside and only use it after I have procedures done at the dermatologist and need both the repair effect and the sun protection.</li>
    <li> Ok,don&#x27; think I would order it again,but good price!</li>
    <li> I like it...doc said it the moisturizer for my 55 year old face. Goes on smooth and does not feel greasy</li>
    <li> This product continues to amaze me! One of the best age reversing products that I have used.Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love the light feel yet powerful moisturizing of the Neocutis bio restorative Day Cream.. The sunscreen is a perfect 30!</li>
    <li> Was not as expected.  Did not like the feel or the finish it leaves on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to put this over the neocutis serum. nice shade and consistancy. if you don&#x27;t let the serum get absorbed first, though, it can pill. not at all chalky.like some others with spf.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and love the way it makes my skin feel.  I use it religiously.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this from my dermatologist who promised results.  Buying it on line was cheaper than in his office.  My only disappointment was I did not realize this was going to be a smaller size.  I will be more careful in ordering larger size next time.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this lotion and try it out .im sure it&#x27;s a great lotion because it was highly recommended to me from several people.i choose to buy from amazon instead of where they buy...the bottle is pretty much empty so I gave it a 2star review because I really didn&#x27;t get any product for my money!</li>
    <li> I love Journee, it is worth the extra cost.  It goes on smooth, is moisturizing, and provides effective daily sun protection. The light tint is perfect for my skin tone (fair to medium).  I believe that the appearance of my skin has improved since I started using it over two years ago.  Neocutis was recommended to me by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service from Amazon was excellent, thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with skincare and was glad to have purchased the smaller version of the Neocutis Journee instead of getting the full bottle. I have normal skin and this cream did not have a positive effect on me. It was BAD but I noticed that it was making my skin become more combo (dry in some areas and oilier in others). It was just a weird reaction and I cut my losses after 10 days.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for the more mature skin!</li>
    <li> I started using Neocutis about 2 months ago. I love the products and love the pricing on Amazon. I would not be able to afford it without the discount. My mom&#x27;s dermatologist wants about 40% more for the products. Ouch!!  I am starting to convert to their whole line once I get all my other products used up.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and moisturizer in one.  Works great on sensitive, acne prone skin. It is expensive but lasts a long time and well worth it after unsuccessfully  trying nearly every product on the market. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Neocutis Cream for over two years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I put the date I start using the product on the bottom of the container with a sharpie and it has lasted me a full three months.  I religiously use it every night and every morning along with a moisturizer.  It takes the smallest amount, smaller than a BB pellet per eye.  I carefully pat the cream in and I immediately see a difference of less crows feet and tiny wrinkles.  I&#x27;m a senior lady and this product works great for my thin fragile skin.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with new packaging. It&#x27;s twice as large as old one, twice as heavy, not suitable for travel and takes up more space. Waste of materials. Image needs to be updated to show the new packaging. I would not have purchased this item here if I had thought it was the new packaging (would have sourced older type). Product itself is awesome. Shame on Neocutis for false advertising and changing a good thing.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone with very dry skin.  My skin always feels very soft and this goes on so nicely</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now and it not only protects my face but it also gives my face a healthy glow. I love this product</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product to me after a laser procedure I had done on my face. I was skeptical about the price of it, but a friend of mine said it was worth it. She was right. There is no other product that makes my face look as fresh and bright as this one does, and I have tried many different products. I RARELY go without any foundation on, but I am happy to say that after consistently using this product, I do so and feel my skin looks good that way. It has definitely reduced the appearance of fine lines and helped minimize some of the spots on my face. There is a tint to this product which some say fades when applied, but I think it seems to enhance my skin tone. I haven&#x27;t found anything else out there that I love as much on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could be improved. One application is supposed to be a half a pump. That is counter-intuitive. They should make 1 application be 1 full pump. If you do use a full pump each time you will be shocked at how quickly you run out, even when purchasing the 1 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> More time is needed to actually see the results Journee claims this product does.  For the price, it&#x27;s just another day cream.</li>
    <li> The cream works great and it feels very nice going on. The only thing is .5 ounces is not much product for sunscreen and it does not last very long at this price. Excellent product but the bottle emptied quick! Still recommend based on the quality but will probably look for something a little more economical for sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It works as a sun screen and provides just a hint of tint. I goes on very smoothly and not a thick coat is needed.</li>
    <li> This is an refill for me. I love what this product does to my face. I will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> I use a other brand that I went back to. luv it better and better results!</li>
    <li> This item is also deliver on time and the deliver man is very nice too! I also would like to recommend my friends to use Amazon when they need something.</li>
    <li> If you want a healthy makeup base with very good sunscreen, you&#x27;ll love this product. On days I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, I use it alone as a sunscreen with a little evener...</li>
    <li> Neocutis daycream is the best day moisturizer Ive used with SPF.  Usually spf makes a moisturizer chalky or makes skin oily looking and this gives such a wonderful finish and has lots of active anti-aging ingredients. Very high-quality brand.</li>
    <li> The consistency of this cream is dryer then most moisturizers I&#x27;ve used before. It glides on smooth but not greasy. It appears to have some softening effect on my skin but I still need an eye cream and night cream because it&#x27;s not a strong enough moisturizer for dry skin. It does seem to be improving my skin texture. I like it!</li>
    <li> The most amazing day cream I have ever tried.  Beautiful light finish. Protects, moistuirizes and gives a nice glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> $50 is just about one squirt.  Extremely overpriced. There are many other products more reasonably priced that do the job.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I tend to break out easily, but no issues with Journee.  I wear it every day.  It has SPF 30.  I can wear a light foundation over it, if needed, but most days it&#x27;s fine by itself.</li>
    <li> Does what Neocutis says it will do. I use it sparingly around the eyes.  Neocutis Peche for rosacea also works great.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff. Product arrived on time, I would buy again.</li>
