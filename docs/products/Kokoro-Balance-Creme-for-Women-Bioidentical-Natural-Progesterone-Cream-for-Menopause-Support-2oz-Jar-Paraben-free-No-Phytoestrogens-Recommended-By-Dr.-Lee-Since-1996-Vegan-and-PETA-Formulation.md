      <li>I wish this had more progesterone per oz.</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It is great and came highly recommended from Dr. Lee&#x27;s book, &amp;#34;What</li>
      <li>but I do feel much more cheerful and while that may have to do more with the lack of headaches and better sleep patterns I still credit this product.  </li>
      <li>I have felling better light periodsmzy moods are better.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sleeping good, no energy and my moods were really off.</li>
      <li>it really helped along with a good diet and excercise regimen.</li>
      <li>Good product and fast shipping, I like it.</li>
      <li>the ones I do have are very mild, not the killers I had that made me want to tear off my clothes and run out into the snow.  </li>
      <li>However, my sleep is still interrupted and have been looking for a natural product to help me sleep better and also a good moisturizer, which I didn&#x27;t think I could find in one product.</li>
      <li>I still menstrate just fine.</li>
      <li>My doctor says it&#x27;s important to switch off areas</li>
      <li>It is extremely important not to miss a dose.</li>
      <li>Ordered them both and got free shipping.  </li>
      <li>no longer available</li>
      <li>I have been using this brand for years, but I purchased it primarily to reverse my bone loss, not for hormonal imbalance.</li>
      <li>I noticed a significant reduction in the severity of my cramps.</li>
      <li>wasnt worth the time or money!..</li>
      <li>: The Kokoro Creme seemed to work a lot better than the Emerita I tried first.</li>

      <li>EVERYTHING WAS JUST RIGHT AS IT SHOULD BE!</li>
      <li>I love this product - it really did bring me balance.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I have a ton more energy and haven&#x27;t felt like I needed to sleep as much.</li>
      <li>I will definately keep using it until I am in full menopause, and may even use it after that for a while.</li>
      <li>Was glad to try this without buying so much.</li>
      <li>I was stressed out and full of anxiety and depression.  </li>
      <li>This product has made a TREMENDOUS difference.  </li>
      <li>You provided prompt and quick service</li>
      <li>Also it absorbs quickly and the scent is pretty light.</li>
      <li>, 3.3 oz cream]]period problems very nautral easy to use.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell you all how much this cream has saved my life!!</li>
      <li>It is essential therefore, to find a product which delivers a healthy amount per purchase, yet which is not too strong, so that it can be measured out in something like a 1/8 teaspoon measure.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone can go the whole week like the instructions say without the cream because of the intense hot flashes, so I am able to stay off of it for at least 3 or 4 days, and this works best for me.</li>
      <li>I really felt good about purchasing this product for the sole reason that it&#x27;s a bio-identical.</li>
      <li>So to me, that is worth the price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am 51. My lining was thickening and thickening, but not shedding. So, I was having very irregular periods with sometimes heavy flow, and then nothing, then heavy several days later, then nothing, and the lining was not shedding all the way, so much so that I needed an emergency D&amp;C. I started progesterone pills prescribed by my doctor. I took them the last 5 days of my cycle (the best that I could tell anyway) and then stopped. That started a normal period. But, I was still having break-through bleeding in the middle of the cycle, and the pills caused me to get a red, itchy face and neck, so severe that people would wonder what was wrong with my face. So, I decided to try the Kokoro cream. I chose it because it has bioidentical progesterone. It is a little higher priced than some of the other ones available, but it is very important to have bioidentical progesterone from wild yam. I used 1/4 teaspoon on days 12-26 of my cycle, and I didn&#x27;t even bleed once. My period came right on day 29, and was a normal period. Yay! I also had a better libido, no cramping, and absolutely no bleeding before day 29. My hot flashes were very mild also, and no itchy red face and neck. I love this stuff! I will definately keep using it until I am in full menopause, and may even use it after that for a while. Now I am adding to this review 2 years later. I am still using the cream, and it is still working perfectly. It is extremely important not to miss a dose.</li>
    <li> This is a great all natural progesterone cream and after months of trying to get pregnant, my wife got pregnant her first month on this cream. She said it really helped to balance her out too.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the lovely land of hot flashes about 10 years ago and although intense at first, they have subsided considerably. However, my sleep is still interrupted and have been looking for a natural product to help me sleep better and also a good moisturizer, which I didn&#x27;t think I could find in one product. I&#x27;ve tried several moisturizers, in addition to natural sleep aids but have not been satisfied. I was at a health food store and talked with the woman was demonstrating this product. I really felt good about purchasing this product for the sole reason that it&#x27;s a bio-identical. I apply it only on my face, twice daily and have been using it for a couple of months now. Needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled with the product. Not only do I wake up refreshed and rested, but my face is soooo much smoother and softer. It took about 2 weeks for me to really start feeling like I&#x27;d had a good nights sleep, but ever since, it&#x27;s my new best friend!</li>
    <li> I have used this product from the beginning since at least 10 years ago.  I tried other things.  Usually they had a medicine smell, which you do not need any smell because you will be putting this on every day.  I do not like smell in lotions either but maybe someone else wants smell.  I do not want any smell at all.  The quality of the cream is excellent.  At first I only put it on in the morning.  All hot flashes left after a week.  You build up to what the cream will do. After that I have never had any symptoms.  I put this on me every day.  The directions tell you to use it 3 weeks on and 1 week off.  I do not do that and never have.  I do  use it once in the morning only now.  I am 70 and have never had any symptoms after I started using it. I do think it is a little pricey, but Amazon is in the middle. They used to sell if for $15 and now it is $20 and up.Top prices are around $25.  It is a monthly thing you need.  The more you buy the lower the price on some sites.</li>
    <li> I am 32 and never had a kid.  I would get terrible night sweats every night and my mood was very erratic.  I tried another cream, but it only seemed to make me feel worse.  I read &amp;#34;Sex, Lies and Menopause&amp;#34; and think I am perimenopausal.  When I finally saw a doctor she recommended this cream.  She uses this cream on herself and I have been as well.  I use 1/4tsp on the insides of my arms and legs twice a day.  My doctor says it&#x27;s important to switch off areas so I don&#x27;t build up dominance in one spot.  I think I might use this stuff for the rest of my life, because I notice an immediate difference if I don&#x27;t take it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (1/1/13): I still use this cream twice a day.  If I go without it for a half a day I will notice that I get a little anxious/moody.  I tried the Emerita progesterone cream since writing this review in an effort of saving money, but it was not nearly as good as this brand is.  Also, some women stop taking this during their menstrual cycle, but I apply it twice a day every day and still get periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (6-16-16) I&#x27;m 37 now and quit the cream a month ago to see if I could go without it. I&#x27;ve done that a few times, but kept getting intense night sweats so I&#x27;d always go back and have to apply it every day, which is more than what the directions call for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this time I did not get night sweats so I went until my period to see how I felt. I am on day 2 of my period and I vomited last night. The nausea is so intense and I recall vomiting monthly for a half a year right before I found this cream. I think I didn&#x27;t mention that before because I was embarrassed, but I don&#x27;t care anymore if I think it&#x27;ll help someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I plan to start applying this cream again, but to only apply it as the directions state, which is not every day, as I had been applying it, since it seems the intense night sweats have subsided. Menstruating women are directed to take it on days 12-26 of their cycles. Hopefully it makes this debilitating nausea during my period go away again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update 7/2016) I&#x27;m so glad I started up using this product every day this past month. My period is back to normal! No nausea/vomiting, milder cramps. Thank goodness for this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so scared after being sick for three days in a row during my last period, so I decided to use it every day, which is what my doctor said I could do back when I first started it. I still menstrate just fine. I&#x27;ve never missed a period.</li>
    <li> Having tested many progesterone creme, some good, some not so good, this Kokoro cream is one of the best. I will keep ordering it. It has no smelly odor, and it is all natural.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream before and so I knew what I was ordering and was very glad to find it on Amazon.com. It is a very good product and works as a natural hormone balancing cream. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. the price was good too.</li>
    <li> was hoping this would help with psorisis problim, but didn&#x27;t see any change</li>
    <li> I have used this creme for years. I didn&#x27;t want to go on traditional hormone replacement therapy after a hysterectomy when I was 46 yrs old. I had heard of wild yam cream helping with the symptoms of menopause so I started trying different brands when I came accross Kokoro. It&#x27;s the only one that has ever worked for me. There have been times that I would forget to put it on before going to bed. I tossed and turned feeling like I was coming out of my skin when it dawned on me I had forgotten to put it on. Within 1/2 hr of putting it on I would be sleeping like a baby. I can&#x27;t find it locally any more so I was tickled to death when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I found this cream to rub in nicely and does not have a bad smell.  Unfortunately, it made me very dizzy and extremely tired when used as directed.  I may try to use it again but next time a much smaller amount and none in the morning.</li>
    <li> I had a hysterectomy 6 years ago, and have suffered from hot flashes and cold sweats for the past 5 years and within the past 6 months I&#x27;ve been getting them every hour. My life has been miserable. My Dr. would not prescribe me anything and told me to try black kohosh, estroven, or primrose; I&#x27;ve tried all 3 and non worked. Yesterday, I tried Kokoro, and it immediately worked. I had only one mild hot flash and slept through the night. Though it might not work for everyone, it worked for me when nothing else did. I love it, Thank you God!</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed anything on Amazon before but this product is so good that I felt that I had to throw in my two cents.  I have suffered, and I do mean suffered, hot flashes for thirteen years.  They interrupt my sleep nearly every hour all night long.  Tried HRT for about three months but that gave me side effects that were very unpleasant and I dropped it.  I ran across this cream on Amazon by accident and since the reviews were so good I bought two jars and have used it for two months.  Hot flashes are 90% gone, the ones I do have are very mild, not the killers I had that made me want to tear off my clothes and run out into the snow.  I sleep like a baby through the night with no tossing and turning and kicking off of covers.  I used to have bad headaches nearly every afternoon and they are 95% gone, such a relief.  I never had much in the way of mood swings but I do feel much more cheerful and while that may have to do more with the lack of headaches and better sleep patterns I still credit this product.  At the price asked I still believe it to be a bargain.  Using the one eighth teaspoon twice daily this two ounce jar will likely last about three months, possibly a bit more.  I use the product as the directions state, taking a week off every three weeks for non-menstruating women.  I expected the hot flashes and headaches to come back, but the product must stay in your system because I did notice an increase in them, but not to the levels I had experienced them before starting use of this product.  I put the product on my face and neck and my skin has improved in texture and clearity.  The small lines around my eyes are lessened and my skin is very soft.  Give this product a try, I hope it works for you as well as it has for me.  I will be a costomer for life, that is for sure.</li>
    <li> It seems to help me by lessoning my hot flashes. So far I am pleased with the product. The product that I have used for years&lt;br /&gt;is no longer available so I have been searching for a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now on my second jar of Kokoro Balance Creme. When a friend recommended it to me, I was skeptical, but I can feel a difference when I use the cream consistently ... I just feel more at ease. I now purchase it two jars at a time. Helps with shipping costs, and I like to have a spare in the cupboard.</li>
    <li> I was getting ready to go out of the country and had run out of my progesterone cream. You provided prompt and quick service and I was able to secure this product and receive it before I left. It worked out great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had been searching for something natural to help with my non-existing menstrual cycles. (I diagnosed myself with insulin resistance.) The birth control pills that I used for about 10 years to have a cycle only made me sick and sicker. This stuff is wonderful.  I&#x27;m 49 and my cycles comes every 30-40 days.  It doesn&#x27;t make me sick and I don&#x27;t have cramps. The only thing I noticed is that I feel slightly bloated during this time, but that&#x27;s the only complaint.  I use it starting on day 10 and stop when the cycle begins.  Also, I use herbs as an extra help with my cycle (also sold by Amazon/Banyan Products):  shilajit, shatavarri, womens support.  These herbs are supposed to help with menopause symptoms also.  I have done a lot of online research and helped myself.  My OB/GYN doctor has tested me and everything has resulted in normal.  He is amazed and encourages me to keep doing what I&#x27;m doing.  For those who are looking for help, keep searching and you will find your answer.  Best wishes and best of health to all...</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you all how much this cream has saved my life!! I have been miserable as I&#x27;ve gotten older...(over 40). Although I am not in menopause yet, my moods were so erratic right before my period that I was about to go crazy, and take my husband with me. This worked for me the first month I used it. I have tried another brand, but was very disappointed. This cream is the best one, and I highly recommend it. No, I am not a doctor, but a woman who has suffered with PMS emotional issues for too long and this cream has saved my life and possibly my marriage..LOL!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if how this is working for sure.  Going into winter, hot flashes are not as bad for me.  I&#x27;m using just a little morning and night, about a 1/4 tsp size, rub it on both palms and then on my breast &amp; belly.  I still have hopes for this one.  Hot flashes don&#x27;t appear to be as bad at this point, but I am sleeping in a cooler bedroom and the ceiling fan is on.  I&#x27;ve so many that didn&#x27;t do anything, but this one may be doing the trick.  Give me another month of it, and I&#x27;ll have a better feel for it.</li>
    <li> I have to get back to you on a later date. I used it sometimes, so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it works. Peace, love and more love.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to me by a friend, who said it is the \\&quot;best\\&quot;.  Looked it on on the official Kokoro website, and was planning to order.  Looked up Dr. John Lee&#x27;s book to order that as well.  Ordered them both and got free shipping.  The cream was 2 oz in the jar, smaller amount, and much less expensive.  Was glad to try this without buying so much. Great value, recycled book, win-win.  So again, Amazon comes to the rescue. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several days now and I don&#x27;t see any difference in how I feel, my weight, or my hot flashes.  Maybe it needs more time to work for me but, so far, I don&#x27;t see the great difference in how I feel like some other reviews I&#x27;ve read.  I just don&#x27;t see the benefit.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as Natpro, but a great alternative if you&#x27;re in between orders. I wish this had more progesterone per oz. It&#x27;s a nice consistency and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I suffer from PCOS and had thought that I had low progesterone for awhile now. I wasn&#x27;t sleeping good, no energy and my moods were really off. Especially the last 3-4 months. It didn&#x27;t matter what I did I just wasn&#x27;t happy. Not to mention that I always felt groggy and couldn&#x27;t really think clearly. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 8 or 9 days now and I can really tell the difference. My moods are definitely more stable! I feel like I have a ton more energy and haven&#x27;t felt like I needed to sleep as much. I feel like I can think like a normal humen being now! I don&#x27;t feel so ditzy all the time! I love feeling like me again!! Oh and I use 1/4 tsp 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> Hello energy!  And a higher libido.  So to me, that is worth the price.  I bought this to help balance my hormones and maybe reduce my cellulite.  Haven&#x27;t noticed much on the cellulite yet, but the energy increase is good enough for me!  Also it absorbs quickly and the scent is pretty light.</li>
    <li> This product did not help with hormonal changes</li>
    <li> Great product!  Hot flashes go away within days of first use. Why did I wait  so long to re- order</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy the strongest cream available, because it is impossible to administer the same dose each night, when you have to use a toothpick or something extremely tiny to use simply what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one would want to take in more progesterone than they need!! It is essential therefore, to find a product which delivers a healthy amount per purchase, yet which is not too strong, so that it can be measured out in something like a 1/8 teaspoon measure. That&#x27;s what I use--half of a 1/8 teaspoon each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need of the stuff and have been for some time, you&#x27;d want to take less and work your way up because otherwise you&#x27;d suffer unpleasant side effects--not just from this brand but any brand of progesterone cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this steadily for years now, after trying out several other brands, and it has proven to be the most cost effective, has the right amount of progesterone in it, and is a quality product. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, when I moved 4 hours away to a new home, somehow I managed to misplace the all important progesterone cream. Panic in the ranks! I called the company, in tears, to explain why I needed a jar emergency rushed to me and they were wonderful--very caring and compassionate and willing to help me out. They realized that no one wants to screw up their hormones by going off schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, right after the call, my daughter located the missing jar of cream. Whew! But I&#x27;ll never forget how wonderful that company was in my &amp;#34;emergency.&amp;#34; My emergency became THEIR emergency too. As long as the quality of their cream remains constant, they will have a customer for life in me!!</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipping, I like it.</li>
    <li> I showed no improvement to my menopause symptoms.  I showed no improvement to my menopause symptoms. This product was returned.</li>
    <li> I did notice a big difference on this ... hot flashes, mood swings and skin tone all improved.  Scent is good, absorption fine, and I think for the price you&#x27;re getting a fair amount.  I did do quite a bit of research before purchasing any progesterone product, and this one is truly one of the natural ones.  A suggestion is to be certain you&#x27;re not getting synthetic hormones.  I rated it five stars... but here&#x27;s the thing with anything hormonal, nerve, energy or mentally related -- it truly depends upon your own body&#x27;s response.  If you&#x27;re going to give this product a try, be certain to follow the directions and apply with the frequency and changing up locations as is suggested.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use and last a long time. It has been a blessing for me.&lt;br /&gt;Helped with the night sweats and over eating urges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this crème. It has really helped to reduce the pre-menopause symptoms especially the weight gain. Use it correctly and it&#x27;s like a miracle cure.</li>
    <li> My PA suggested using this product a few years back. It really helps me to balance my hormones.</li>
    <li> So a nutritionist recommended it to me, I have been using for 4 days 1/8 and my skin under my jaw and neck started breaking out. I told the nutritionist and she said to stop using as it was messing with my hormones. I also cant use EFA Im just sensitive to certain vitamins and ingrediants. Im just one of the unlucky ones as there is alot of people that have benefited from this. Give it a try and I hope it works for you like I said im just a small portion of people that is sensitive to products! I hope they accept returns</li>
    <li> This product stops my hot flashes and gets my hormones back to their normal level.  I am able to sleep better and it gets rid of the night sweats.  It also stops my headaches, depression, sadness, irritability and mood swings.  Low progesterone can cause severe depression and anxiety and this product restores the progesterone level back to where you are sane again.  During the week that I am not supposed to apply it, the hot flashes become unbearable and I have to apply some of the cream to stop it.  I don&#x27;t think anyone can go the whole week like the instructions say without the cream because of the intense hot flashes, so I am able to stay off of it for at least 3 or 4 days, and this works best for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year that was recommended by a woman at the heatlh food store. I had previously tried several others that worked minimally with more hot flashes and irritability. This product was much better. No more hot flashes waking me up at night. I sleep better and have less irritability. The other side effect is that I feel like my old self hormonally with more energy.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift because I believe in the product and wanted to share it with my cousin.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST progesterone cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I should be on a comission for this product! I have told so many friends about it. It works, is totally natural and not tested on animals. Do NOT get involved with synthetic hormone proudcts or those created from horses urine (Premarin I think is the name).   This cream is the best thing. The first time I used it I used too much and got a few spots on my face but these cleared up in a few days when I reduce the dosage. You only need a very small amount. I guess the dosage is different for each person. I suggest anyone thinking of trying this product reads up about it on the internet then you will understand how great it is.</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of internet research, as well as read Dr. Lee&#x27;s book on the subject of progesterone cream. I am 48 and have had very few, light  &#x27;periods&#x27; the last year. But the last one wouldn&#x27;t stop! So I tried progesterone cream and then bled more and more. The more I used the heavier I bled (for 6 weeks). All the info I could find was to keep using more! This kind of freaked me out. (M.D.&#x27;s everywhere rolling their eyes). But it did finally stop! And I feel good. I put a little on my face too and it is really nice. I had to use the cream for about 4-5 weeks pretty heavily to get it to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note. It seems that M.D.&#x27;s in general do not believe in or endorse the use of progesterone cream. While holistic, N.D.&#x27;s in general, do. I wanted to give the cream a fair shot before going to my ob, where she would undoubtedly order a multitude of tests to rule out all the horrible diseases I could possibly have. I still plan to go to my ob, but I am pleased this product worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS :: The Kokoro Creme seemed to work a lot better than the Emerita I tried first.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING WAS JUST RIGHT AS IT SHOULD BE! IT WORKS WELL IF USED CORRECTLY.  I AM NOT SURE WHAT ELSE I NEED TO SAY.</li>
    <li> This product has made such a difference to my quality of life at this present time. It is being used in the treatment of my Lupus and, in combination with other products to assist with weight loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for years, but I purchased it primarily to reverse my bone loss, not for hormonal imbalance. It is great and came highly recommended from Dr. Lee&#x27;s book, &amp;#34;What Your Dr. May Not Tell You About Menopause&amp;#34;. In 3 years of use, my bone density went from Osteopenia to Normal. I did, however, learn that putting it on fatty areas of the body is no longer recommended. Instead, rub into areas of the skin that are thin, where you can see veins. This prevents the progesterone from building up in the fatty tissue, which can cause hormonal imbalance leading to depression and other hormonal disorders.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. Excellent cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after much research and I have been using it for three weeks.  The directions advise using the cream for three weeks on and one week off.  I apply 1/4 teaspoon twice daily to my skin in non-fatty areas like the insides of my arms, legs, hands, chest, and neck.  I am 46 years old and I have random periods so I am positive I am entering the beginning stages of menopause.  So far, the cream has eliminated soaking night sweats and random daily hot flashes. For months, I tossed and turned and sweated at night until I thought to myself that sleep was a thing of the past and my life would never be the same.  I was stressed out and full of anxiety and depression.  However, I feel pretty normal again.  It took several days to notice that the hot flashes were starting to wane.  Then after a week or so I noticed they were completely gone.  This alone makes me happy.  I started sleeping through the night as well.  During my research, I read that if you try progesterone cream and you do not get good results you should then try a progesterone cream with phytoestrogens next.  One last thing...now that my symptoms are under control I am planning to use less cream...only 1/8 of a teaspoon twice daily.  I have been told a little dab will do.  If my symptoms return I will increase it as needed.  I will update if anything else changes.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for Hormones it&#x27;s natural, I can sleep no side effects. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 20 years after I was treated for skin cancer. It&#x27;s a miricle cream to me. It&#x27;s the only natural HRT therapy you need, also helps with sunburn on face or menstral cramps I would rub it on my daughter when she had cramps it really helped along with a good diet and excercise regimen. You don&#x27;t have to be goin through menopause for it to be helpful in your life. Also on amazon there is a book on how to use this cream. It&#x27;s awesome you can&#x27;t go wrong. Try it!</li>
    <li> I got this jar from a close friend after suffering from hot flashes for about a year. I have to say it is life changing...i have not had a single hot flash since I started using it. Have already recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is very easy to use- just apply on a different body part every day with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;It has stopped my night sweats and I will not be without it!</li>
    <li> Performed as advertized.  night sweats are gone and mood is lifted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve researched this Product and refuse to take any type of Prescription hormonal products. I refer this product to all my friends in their 40&#x27;s suffering from hot flashes or imbalanced to stress of the up&#x27;s &amp; down&#x27;s...Seems to &#x27;balance&#x27; everyone for whatever ail&#x27;s you. We follow the directions &amp; it does balance us all. I had many questions which I did call the company in Irvine (I believe). They are so available to help!! (I have friends from 40&#x27;s to their 80&#x27;s..all using this product)</li>
    <li> This cream helps me sleep (which became a problem in recent years) and prevents pms rage. If I&#x27;m having particularly bad pms month (let myself eat sugar), I can put a little extra on my chest or hands and stop it before it becomes a full-on melt down. I am in my 40&#x27;s. I also take chaste berry each day, which helps regulate my menstrual cycles as well.  Wish I had known about these products while in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the reviews &amp; hot flashes were killing me. Couldn&#x27;t get any sleep..helped a \\&quot;tad\\&quot;..not much..matter of fact bought it months ago&amp;quit using it....wasnt worth the time or money!..Went to the Dr. Instead...NOW..I can sleep..OH!...and did NOTHING for the skin like people said.</li>
    <li> Have used this for many years for post menopausal health.  Love it!  Highly recommend for balancing hormones naturally.  Great moisturizing cream, also.</li>
    <li> I love this product - it really did bring me balance.  I was dealing with perimenopausal  symptoms ranging from headaches, mood swings (to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t even want to be married to me because I was so wretched for a few days each month!), massive bloating and an overall blah feeling around my period.  This product has made a TREMENDOUS difference.  I rarely take the time to write reviews... but this time I feel I owe to anyone going through the same thing - try it!</li>
    <li> Although my hot flashes haven&#x27;t stopped, this creme has made them not as intense.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 mos.</li>
    <li> I suffered from horrible cramps during my menstrual cycle. They were usually so debilitating that I had to stay home from work or school. Over the counter pain medicines were not effective and the only thing that helped was birth control. However, I did not like the idea of being on birth control indefinitely, so I stopped taking it a few years ago. Of course, the difficult periods returned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a friend asked for advice for her PCOS diagnosis (and people recommended progesterone cream), I decided to try it for my symptoms. I was desperate. About a year before, I&#x27;d started having lots of back pain and emotional symptoms on top of the cramps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of months, the mood swings went away. I was taking the cream 2 weeks and going off for 2 weeks. A few more months went by and I decided to start taking the progesterone cream for 3 weeks instead of 2. I noticed a significant reduction in the severity of my cramps. I still get them, but now they are more manageable and respond better to over the counter pain medicines. I am not always consistent about taking it twice a day. I think I would see better results if I did. But the Kokoro Balance Cream has made a difference for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for 11 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect I might have endometriosis, which is why my cycles are so severe and don&#x27;t respond as well to over the counter medicines. From what I&#x27;ve been reading, progesterone can help with reducing the growth of endometrial cells, so that may be why my symptoms have lessened but I still have pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest trying the product for a couple of months before deciding if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Helps with many menopausal and per-menstrual symptoms.  Easy to use apply twice daily.  Really can change your life and make you feel back to yourself.</li>
    <li> I TRUST THIS PRODUCT AND WOLD BUY IT AGAIN. I FEEL WOMEN IN POST MENOPAUSE STILL NEEDTHE HORMONE BALANCE HELP.</li>
    <li> I am a heavy bleeder and have Pms and pain .&lt;br /&gt;A the wellness vented recommended this and it save my life.  I tell friends about it. I have felling better light periodsmzy moods are better. More engergy I am always happy. I recommend this to any one who has [[ASIN:B003NDRT1O Kokoro - Balance Cream atural Progesterone), 3.3 oz cream]]period problems very nautral easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great for women with low progesterone due to having PCOS. Helps bring on AF too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kokoro for a few years now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  Many of the progesterone creams have extra ingredients that I did not want.  Kokoro is the &amp;#34;purest&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found.  I watch my friends have some awful side effects with the pharmaceuticals they are prescribed.  None of that here!</li>
    <li> Looking for natural product to help with hot flashes. Have been using diligently for couple months. Only slight improvement really.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this is doing anything or not. My older (50) sister swears by it, but perhaps I&#x27;m too young to begin using it (30).</li>
</ol>
