      <li>Thank you very much !</li>
      <li>ITs a very pretty color</li>
      <li>My daughter loved the gel polish she received as a Christmas gift along with the light kit and other gels.  </li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Great everyday polish.</li>
      <li>Applies more evenly than other more opaque versions.</li>
      <li>The polish was watering and everytime I go over it, it just comes right off.</li>
      <li>In a bright light, there are small hints of purple shimmer.</li>
      <li>Is nice to mix with other colors to add cool tones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice fresh white, looks like a real gel, not like regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>but I like it better than whitest white.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite colors I wear is white.</li>
      <li>This color is actually not white like the top would make you think it is.  </li>
      <li>But still pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you can put a coat of white underneath though.</li>
      <li>ok for french manicure</li>
      <li>I was looking for something without a pink tint like most pretty whites are.</li>
      <li>This color is beautiful, durable, not only delicate but also elegant and it has extra shine.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>otherwise it&#x27;s very opaque.</li>
      <li>And I paint nails very well.</li>
      <li>Guess I should have read the reviews more carefully.  </li>
      <li>Has purple and blue colors mixed in a shimmer effect (kind of like oil)</li>
      <li>its nice to have a white that is more &amp;#34;pearlized&amp;#34; and less like white out painted on my fingers!</li>
      <li>Works with everything goes on very well and high quality polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, sheer, white polish with hints of purple - just enough to keep it from looking chalky and flat.  </li>
      <li>The color is the exact same as the non gel one.</li>
      <li>Shows any little flaws easily.</li>
      <li>Instead it&#x27;s like a super iridescent pink.  </li>
      <li>thought it would be more white and less translucent.  </li>
      <li>The color is fairly sheer, but you can probably get it to be more or less opaque in 3 coats.  </li>
      <li>The seller was very unprofessional they did not want to give my money back!!!!</li>
      <li>Its not even completely opaque after seven (yes seven) coats.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a more solid color, when i finished my nails, they looked unprofessional and uneven coated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good for casual or dressy.</li>
      <li>Very subtle but a nice neutral shade.</li>
      <li>Initially bought it for french manicure tips (which it should work fine for) but ended up needing to do the whole nail white due to another color not being shipped in time.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of white from Essies Blanc in the summer with a tan to Waltz and Marshmellow and Funny Bunny beats them all to wear alone without a French Manicure anytime of year.</li>
      <li>Less than 10 minutes with acetone balls in foils, and it flakes right off with no scraping at all.  </li>
      <li>With two coats I can barely see my nail line (but I like that</li>

<li> Beautiful transparent white, great translucent tinting for the base on the French look if you prefer an extra white French look instead of the average pink base.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a crisp white, sort off white -</li>
<li> Last a full week and a half (I&#x27;m very hard on my nails).</li>
<li> It can look a bit harsh if it is too opaque, but this color looks soft and cushiony.</li>
<li> I guess it&#x27;s part white and part pink.</li>
<li> OPI gel stays on so long</li>
<li> It went on smoothly, but you have to remember to put on very thin coats with a gel polish.</li>
<li> The little bit of glitter gives the nail an extra sparkle.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m at 3 weeks with no peels or chips), will look for other colors.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like if you slightly tinted a bunny with pink mist.  </li>
<li> Not only was it SO thick</li>
<li> I prefer to use 3 coats with any lighter color to make it less opague.</li>
<li> I applied a 2nd coat - worse.</li>
<li> Even after seven coats, I could still see the nail tips and unfortunately a dot of glitter that got left over from the previous color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Polish is streaky and hard to get it to look opaque.</li>
<li> It goes on thick &amp; streaky.</li>
<li> I will wear it again and It has a subtle blueish tint.</li>
<li> The first coat was horrible!</li>
<li> but it is an extremely chalky white color and just looked disgusting.</li>

    <li> ok for french manicure</li>
    <li> One of my favorite OPI gelcolors. Great for any time of year.</li>
    <li> Opi has great nail polish products. This color is beautiful, durable, not only delicate but also elegant and it has extra shine.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described! Great price, and speedy delivery!  For those who love to get nails done at the salon, this is a fantastic alternative to the high prices.  I love being able to change the colors weekly, or leave it for the three weeks that gel nails are renowned to last. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this color for my wedding day. It is the perfect white. I was looking for something without a pink tint like most pretty whites are. I will wear it again and It has a subtle blueish tint. My bridal maincure and pedicure lasted for 5 weeks! It still was not chipped when I went in to get a color change.</li>
    <li> lovely color, if you want a stronger effect do three coats instead of two, but is super cute</li>
    <li> Nice color.  Has purple and blue colors mixed in a shimmer effect (kind of like oil) so it changes color with different angles, is mainly white though.  Is nice to mix with other colors to add cool tones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and make your nail look natural.  The little bit of glitter gives the nail an extra sparkle.</li>
    <li> the order was received well . Thank you very much !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice fresh white, looks like a real gel, not like regular nail polish. I apply three coats for an even coverage.</li>
    <li> Funny Bunny is my very favorite OPI color and since they don&#x27;t sell it anymore I bought the Gel and the regular polish from Amazon. I&#x27;m so happy I found it on here!! It gives great coverage with 2 coats and in my opinion the perfect white for nails. I&#x27;m a big fan of white from Essies Blanc in the summer with a tan to Waltz and Marshmellow and Funny Bunny beats them all to wear alone without a French Manicure anytime of year.</li>
    <li> great price so much easier to have on hand for touch ups and taking with you to the salon to always have in case the salon does not have your desired color...</li>
    <li> I wanted a more solid color, when i finished my nails, they looked unprofessional and uneven coated.&lt;br /&gt;I had done my nails with other gel colors and they were beautiful, except this one. I regret buying this.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for something similar to a marshmallow. This was my first at home gel manicure, this color is beautiful. I prefer to use 3 coats with any lighter color to make it less opague. It went on smoothly, but you have to remember to put on very thin coats with a gel polish. In a bright light, there are small hints of purple shimmer. I am starting nursing school in the spring and not allowed to wear any bright nail polish and this color is going to be perfect!</li>
    <li> I got it on time, a very nice colour! very good quality  and texture, I recomand it for summer fun!</li>
    <li> Polish is streaky and hard to get it to look opaque. Shows any little flaws easily.</li>
    <li> Not as opaque as I hoped it would be. But still pretty.</li>
    <li> Works great as a base under nail design, as a white tip or just by itself. It&#x27;s not a crisp white, sort off white - but I like it better than whitest white. Looks great with neon colors</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color, as do my girlfriends!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best neutral without being too pink, or too flesh toned. :)&lt;br /&gt;Staple of mine, always!!!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. And works perfectly. The color is the exact same as the non gel one.</li>
    <li> its nice to have a white that is more &amp;#34;pearlized&amp;#34; and less like white out painted on my fingers! ITs a very pretty color the only downside is that its very sheer. I&#x27;m sure you can put a coat of white underneath though.</li>
    <li> Not the color I imagined.  thought it would be more white and less translucent.  Good product just not the color I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  It isn&#x27;t gloppy, goes on smooth, and is a nice, bright white to finish off my french!</li>
    <li> Guess I should have read the reviews more carefully.  This is not an opaque white.  Its not even completely opaque after seven (yes seven) coats.

Even after seven coats, I could still see the nail tips and unfortunately a dot of glitter that got left over from the previous color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a translucent white, this is a nice color, but you need to make sure your nails are pristine clean before using this color on the whole nail.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t never recommend opi gel collection to a dog with four legs. The qualitie of the nail polish is very cheap and the cost of it is extremely high. The polish was watering and everytime I go over it, it just comes right off. The seller was very unprofessional they did not want to give my money back!!!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the polish to anyone</li>
    <li> Great everyday polish. Elegant. Good for casual or dressy. Works with everything goes on very well and high quality polish.</li>
    <li> Used this transparent white color to achieve an extra white French look. (See attached photo). Beautiful transparent white, great translucent tinting for the base on the French look if you prefer an extra white French look instead of the average pink base.</li>
    <li> Love this polish! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> In reading reviews for this color, I thought it was going to be a SHEER, Translucent white with a blue/purple/pink shimmer. As soon as I opened it, I knew the reviews were wrong. This polish could not be any more OPAQUE!!! It is completely white with NO color whatsoever. Still - I applied it. The first coat was horrible! Un-even-And I paint nails very well. I applied a 2nd coat - worse. After the 3rd application - I had to take it off. Not only was it SO thick it looked horrible - but it is an extremely chalky white color and just looked disgusting. It is in NO WAY Sheer!!! I have photos of this terrible color and will post as soon as I can. I will never buy this again! YUK!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the gel polish she received as a Christmas gift along with the light kit and other gels.  would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors I wear is white. It can look a bit harsh if it is too opaque, but this color looks soft and cushiony. Applies more evenly than other more opaque versions. Last a full week and a half (I&#x27;m very hard on my nails). My favorite gel I own.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Very subtle but a nice neutral shade.</li>
    <li> This color is actually not white like the top would make you think it is.  Instead it&#x27;s like a super iridescent pink.  You will love it.  It&#x27;s like if you slightly tinted a bunny with pink mist.  I guess it&#x27;s part white and part pink. I have gotten a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I usually love OPI products but this one is an exception. It goes on thick &amp; streaky. You can possibly get by with one coat otherwise it&#x27;s very opaque. WOuldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Loved the name, but love the color even more.  OPI gel stays on so long (I&#x27;m at 3 weeks with no peels or chips), will look for other colors.</li>
    <li> I just love this color.  It&#x27;s a beautiful, sheer, white polish with hints of purple - just enough to keep it from looking chalky and flat.  It&#x27;s a great neutral and is very office-appropriate.  The color is fairly sheer, but you can probably get it to be more or less opaque in 3 coats.  With two coats I can barely see my nail line (but I like that look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it soaks off like a dream.  Less than 10 minutes with acetone balls in foils, and it flakes right off with no scraping at all.  Love this stuff.</li>
