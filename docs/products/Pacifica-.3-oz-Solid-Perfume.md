### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for Spring.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful!</li>
      <li>I loved this product!  </li>
      <li>Beautiful lilac smell and great for travel</li>
      <li>love this !</li>
      <li>I love the product, however it was melted and oozing out of the tin when it arrived.</li>
      <li>This is an authentic floral scent.</li>
      <li>My Aunt, loves her perfume,  she&#x27;s been wanting lilac perfume, for a long time, perfect Mother&#x27;s Day gift!</li>
      <li>for those of you who love these perfumes and have no complaints, couttos to you and enjoy the lovely fragrances that were creates by the geniuses at Pacifica.</li>
      <li>great fragrance - I get a lot of compliments on it - small, great packaging.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to something in them, but I do enjoy wearing perfume at times, so this was an answer for me.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t add more than a dab or the whole thing would finish in a month.</li>
      <li>I have not had any trouble breathing, or skin reactions with this product, and it smells very nice.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I love the soft flowery smell that really stays with you, it made my whole room smell like it.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered from this company and I can tell I will be a returning customer.</li>
      <li>It has a soft light scent that captures the real essence of lilacs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry in my purse and simple to apply on skin.</li>
      <li>smells pure like the flower</li>
      <li>there are a lot of complaints as well about some of the more strange or non common scents like jasmine or fig, i would strongly suggest trying the more simple fragrances like rose and lilac fist to see if you like using solid perfumes</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s available in a larger quantity I might buy it again.</li>
      <li>I had lilac bushes in my backyard while growing up, so I was hoping that this would be a nice little scent to use when I&#x27;m feeling nostalgic or something, but it smells more like someone&#x27;s dear grandmother, with a lovely undernote of chemicals.</li>
      <li>for starters there seems to be some comparisons of the solid perfumes and the spray perfumes, spray perfumes are very strong and condensed in scent, especially if you smell the liquid straight up because people can normally wear only a spray or two, if there was no strong scent then they&#x27;d be soaking wet trying to apply enough to create a good scent.</li>
      <li>It really smells like lilac, which I&#x27;m very happy about because a few other brands I bought hardly smelled like lilac at all.</li>
      <li>This has a soft, yet natural bold lilac fragrance that lingers for a while but not long enough.</li>
      <li>Old lady and baby powder scent.</li>
      <li>so Pacifica seems to have fixed that problem</li>
      <li>my husband who usually can&#x27;t stand perfumes is fine with this one.</li>
      <li>the solid perfume is not condensed in smell because it is a solid and there is a limit to how little you can put on if it was strong like spray perfume it would be overpowering and nauseating, obviously an oil like solid is going to have a different scent than a liquid perfume that is condensed in smell, i just purchased a new one and the lid seems secure and tight</li>
      <li>this review is not for any particular scent but for the product overall as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;i have tried lots of these solid perfumes</li>

    <li> love this ! subtle aroma, but enticing!</li>
    <li> I got the French Lilac perfume and got instant compliments. I love the soft flowery smell that really stays with you, it made my whole room smell like it. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered from this company and I can tell I will be a returning customer. Super fast shipping. Ordered on wednesday got it friday!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! It really smells like lilac, which I&#x27;m very happy about because a few other brands I bought hardly smelled like lilac at all.</li>
    <li> great fragrance - I get a lot of compliments on it - small, great packaging.  I take it everywhere with me.  my husband who usually can&#x27;t stand perfumes is fine with this one.</li>
    <li> smells pure like the flower</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough lilac scent to suit me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as I expected, not a fragrance I will purchase again but will try the coconut scent</li>
    <li> I love the product, however it was melted and oozing out of the tin when it arrived.</li>

    <li> Smells great....like spring.</li>
    <li> this review is not for any particular scent but for the product overall as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;i have tried lots of these solid perfumes and i personally like all of them but this review is based on multiple opinions of people i have asked. and also based on the other reviews  i have seen. for starters there seems to be some comparisons of the solid perfumes and the spray perfumes, spray perfumes are very strong and condensed in scent, especially if you smell the liquid straight up because people can normally wear only a spray or two, if there was no strong scent then they&#x27;d be soaking wet trying to apply enough to create a good scent. the solid perfume is not condensed in smell because it is a solid and there is a limit to how little you can put on if it was strong like spray perfume it would be overpowering and nauseating, obviously an oil like solid is going to have a different scent than a liquid perfume that is condensed in smell, i just purchased a new one and the lid seems secure and tight so Pacifica seems to have fixed that problem people are saying that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long and that&#x27;s because it soaks into your skin if your skin was perhaps already moisturized the solid perfume wouldn&#x27;t immediately sink in and the smell would last longer. there are a lot of complaints as well about some of the more strange or non common scents like jasmine or fig, i would strongly suggest trying the more simple fragrances like rose and lilac fist to see if you like using solid perfumes and if so if you like Pacifica solid perfumes. for those of you who love these perfumes and have no complaints, couttos to you and enjoy the lovely fragrances that were creates by the geniuses at Pacifica.</li>
    <li> My Aunt, loves her perfume,  she&#x27;s been wanting lilac perfume, for a long time, perfect Mother&#x27;s Day gift! Thank You.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the compact package. It&#x27;s easy to carry in my purse and simple to apply on skin. I do have to agree with some other comments that this product does not last very long after application. The scent disappears after about an hour, and unlike the spray, this lasts way too short in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The scent just doesn&#x27;t last! Can&#x27;t add more than a dab or the whole thing would finish in a month. A small amount definitely does not go a long way.  I need to reapply after 3-4 hrs. If it&#x27;s available in a larger quantity I might buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Old lady and baby powder scent.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with a lot of perfumes. I am allergic to something in them, but I do enjoy wearing perfume at times, so this was an answer for me.  I have not had any trouble breathing, or skin reactions with this product, and it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> This is an authentic floral scent. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, unless I apply it VERY liberally.</li>
    <li> My mom had got this perfume earlier in the year and she told me she loves it so i bought a second one for her. She loves it!</li>
    <li> This has a soft, yet natural bold lilac fragrance that lingers for a while but not long enough.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lilac smell and great for travel</li>
    <li> I loved this product!  Perfect for Spring.  It has a soft light scent that captures the real essence of lilacs.</li>
