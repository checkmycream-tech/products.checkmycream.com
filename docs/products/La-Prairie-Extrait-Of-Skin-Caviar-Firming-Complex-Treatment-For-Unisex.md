    <li> Amazing! My skin looks so much better! I have normal to dry skin, and I do use moisturizing before this, it&#x27;s not enough to use it alone before foundation. However, it&#x27;s worthy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using La Prairie for almost 30 years and I&#x27;m constantly told what skin I have, so now I&#x27;m afraid to ever stop using it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and find it does a great job of moisturinzing and keeping skin firm.  Recommend it for mid and mature!</li>

It absorbs immediately and the skin looks beautiful. Price is worth every drop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manuela Hidalgo Rose-Price from CHILE</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the end of 2011 on amazon, and recently I have seen it in a shopping mall. It is totally different. The one I bought on amazon has a cheap-looking package and cheap smelling. , I cannt believe it is a luxurious skin care. However, the one in shopping mall looks worthy.  I am so mad about it since I have finished using it and I&#x27;m not able to return it. I have bought many skin cares on amazon, I hope they are not fake. My friend bought a fake Kiehl&#x27;s skin care on Amazon, too. I will never buy skin care products on amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I think this product is overpriced and overrated.  I used it for about a week or so and within 2 hours of application my face was shiny, super greasy-looking.  Gross. I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> so good ,my wife love it……&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;14 more words required&lt;br /&gt;ok~</li>
    <li> There are 3 products I consider REQUIREMENTS for good, healthy skin in the long run.  THIS is basic to that collection in the LaPrairie line.  Start every day with it... and I&#x27;ve never been sorry.</li>
