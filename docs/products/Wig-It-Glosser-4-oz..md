    <li> I like this product. I don&#x27;t only use it for my wigs but also for my own batural hair and it works perfectly good. It makes my hair shiny and smooth, no frizz and has a very nice smell too. Keeps all of my wigs fragrant and in good shape and form. A  must have for those who own to wigs and would want to take good care of their investment.</li>
    <li> Little too oily for me!!!</li>
    <li> I like this glosser, it smell nice and it helps remove the shine and residue left behind by glue and the wig it product.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing wigs after my cancer scare (I had it and now I don&#x27;t). I have found that the wig it products are better for synthetic wigs. If you spent any money on your wigs (over $200) then use a better product.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. You dont have to use a lot of it to get good results</li>
    <li> Without this product...the [[ASIN:B004BG6B2U Wig It Gripper 2 oz. Jar]] product would have been a disaster!  I use it to clean up the mess from its sister product and use what left in my hands to spread over my hair or wig unit..works just great! A MUST buy if you are getting the Gripper.</li>
    <li> I only used this product to remove the gripper product and it does so rather well. It would probably place a nice glossy shine on your hair as well.</li>
    <li> I do not think I will get this again</li>
    <li> It gives a great shine, it does what it said it would do. I like it very  very  very much.</li>
    <li> Removes gripper in seconds</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is a great shine booster for your wigs.  and it will also help in the removal of the Grip-it product by the same brand.</li>
    <li> Yes the product does work. I cannot say more since have only used it twice but so far it&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> Love this product smells nice with a nice shine</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004BG7TD0 Wig It Glosser 4 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product along with the gripper and I have to say that this product is a winner!  I tried it on a curly wig that was tangled and shedding and it brought new life to that wig.  Since then I&#x27;ve used it on all my wigs and it gives your hair a nice sheen that&#x27;s not greasy looking or greasy feeling.  It even works as a detangler on wet hair.  I onky buy human hair wigs and this product is excellent on those.  I cannot vouch on how well it works on synthetic wigs but I wiuld imagine that it would probably work well cause of the non greasy factor!  I highly recommend this product.  If you spend a lot of money on your wigs you could use this glosser to extend the life of your wigs.  Works well in straight hair also!</li>
    <li> SPRAY ON SHINE BUT NOT GREASE.</li>
    <li> Wig it Glosser is not heavy; it gave my wig a natural shine and look.  I loved the way it made my wigs feel.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Super shiny, not greasy.  Word of caution it will make your floor slippery so I spray it over my wig while it holding it over the sink.</li>
    <li> This Wig It gloss spray leaves a nice shine, and it truly does smooth tangles out of the hair. It smells good as well. This Gloss can be used on human and syntehtic hair.</li>
