      <li>They work great!</li>
      <li>These are perfect for me.</li>
      <li>but these are really great!  </li>
      <li>Great fabric weight, does not stretch out and washes wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Great gloves.</li>
      <li>Great gloves.</li>
      <li>They look good and feel good.</li>
      <li>These are not as good as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>All I can say about these gloves is that they&#x27;re exceptional.</li>
      <li>I ordered these for a man with good sized hands and fingers and they fit him great.</li>
      <li>The gloves fit snug but don&#x27;t cut off circulation which is nice.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s able to do just about everything wearing them, including using his iPhone.</li>
      <li>Love these...great for nightly moisterizing.  </li>
      <li>(My thumbs get even more aggravated from the flossing I do.)</li>
      <li>I WILL be ordering a couple more pair to have on standby. .</li>
      <li>As other writers have observed, the fit isn&#x27;t flawless, but they are quite good, and they&#x27;re very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Very nice large size</li>
      <li>When applying your favorite gel, cream, lotion etc make sure you apply a lot around the affected area as the snug fit will slide around your application area and the cotton will absorb some of the stuff.  </li>
      <li>In addition, the manufacturer is first rate and provides exceptional service.</li>
      <li>I would really give them a 4 ¾ stars because they&#x27;re the best gloves I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>Washing along with our hand towels and letting the gloves air dry worked brilliantly.  </li>
      <li>the great part is that the hand lotion/cream does not saturate the gloves on the outside.</li>
      <li>Got a pair for my husband, liked  them so much I ordered a pair for myself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>go ahead and get the ones that Wil fit,  be comfortable, and protect your hands.  </li>
      <li>These are comfortable and fit well, no shrinking in the length.</li>
      <li>I found moisturizing gloves that work well and fit well.</li>
      <li>They fit comfortably; my fingers don&#x27;t quite go to the ends.</li>
      <li>The gloves used with Vicks Vapor Rub over night made a significant improvement for healing and eliminating cracking of my fingers and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Seaspider</li>
      <li>They are much thicker then the flimsy cotton gloves most places sell</li>
      <li>And the delivery was super quick and the seller kept me updated with shipment.</li>
      <li>I am a woman with large hands and women&#x27;s sized gloves rarely fit me.</li>
      <li>Finally it&#x27;s worth mentioning the washing of the gloves...</li>
      <li>These fit perfectly fine with about 1/4 - 1/2 &amp;#34; extra finger length.</li>
      <li>I like them very much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used &#x27;exam gloves&#x27; (WAY too hot) and socks (fingers get sweaty)</li>
      <li>They last much longer than the cheap cotton gloves.</li>
      <li>I suffer from hand eczema around my nuckles and thumbs, this product really helped in relieving the pain and itching.  </li>
      <li>These gloves have long fingers to fit a mans hands.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly as advertised, they are not a burden to wear while sleeping and breathe well enough my hands didn&#x27;t sweat.  </li>
      <li>This product could not possibly receive a higher recommendation.</li>
      <li>My basketball player hands typically need a XL glove and these are fine.  </li>
      <li>Ordering other pair so he always has a clean set.</li>
      <li>These are a little big, but much better than having them too tight.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The day they arrived, my fingers were dry, cracked and bleeding...not a pretty sight.</li>
      <li>Great gloves used to help moisturize my dry, cracked hands but these started discoloring a little after a few uses.</li>
      <li>My hands are large and at long last</li>
      <li>I was having a hard time finding Gloves that fit and would  stay on my hands at night. .</li>
      <li>For the first few days, I also wore them while working at my computer.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate and my hands crack constantly.</li>
      <li>The gloves were a little tight to put on initially but after that they went on easily.</li>
      <li>The result: They&#x27;re kind of uncomfortable to wear for long periods, including especially overnight.</li>

    <li> ...they still felt too tight, and I don&#x27;t have especially big hands. The result: They&#x27;re kind of uncomfortable to wear for long periods, including especially overnight.</li>
    <li> Great gloves used to help moisturize my dry, cracked hands but these started discoloring a little after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and my hands crack constantly. These gloves work wonders, I wear them every night while sleeping and the great part is that the hand lotion/cream does not saturate the gloves on the outside. I find after 2-3 weeks I just hand wash and start over. My hands are large and at long last I found moisturizing gloves that work well and fit well.</li>
    <li> All I can say about these gloves is that they&#x27;re exceptional. During the winter months, I suffer from extremely dry hands and fingers. My fingers are cracked to such a degree that it causes excruciating pain. As a last resort, I decided to purchase these gloves. The day they arrived, my fingers were dry, cracked and bleeding...not a pretty sight. I applied moisturizing lotion to my hands and started to wear the gloves while I was sleeping. For the first few days, I also wore them while working at my computer. After 3 days, all of my cracks had healed and I reverted back to just wearing these at night. Now, after having used them for a few weeks, my skin has completely recovered and is soft and crack free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that these gloves are the only thing that has ever worked to treat my dry hands and fingers. This product could not possibly receive a higher recommendation. In addition, the manufacturer is first rate and provides exceptional service.</li>
    <li> Son uses it every night to moisturize hands.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, but husband did not like them  found them to be uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered. . I was having a hard time finding Gloves that fit and would  stay on my hands at night. . These did both and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It seals in the medicine I have to put on my hands every night and my hands are showing massive improvement in just the few days I have worn.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the flimsy Gloves at the pharmacy,  go ahead and get the ones that Wil fit,  be comfortable, and protect your hands.  I can&#x27;t say thank you enough. . And the delivery was super quick and the seller kept me updated with shipment. I WILL be ordering a couple more pair to have on standby. . You want be dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> These are not as good as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Product is as described.</li>
    <li> I am a woman with large hands and women&#x27;s sized gloves rarely fit me. I wear a size 8.5 which means the circumference around my four knuckles is 8.5&amp;#34;. These fit perfectly fine with about 1/4 - 1/2 &amp;#34; extra finger length. These are perfect for me. I use them with Flexitol Hand Balm, worn overnight as needed, and my hands and cuticles have never been softer.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them!!  He uses them every night!</li>
    <li> Great gloves. Got a pair for my husband, liked  them so much I ordered a pair for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Saved our hands during the harsh winter!</li>
    <li> The gloves used with Vicks Vapor Rub over night made a significant improvement for healing and eliminating cracking of my fingers and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Seaspider</li>
    <li> Love these...great for nightly moisterizing.  Great fabric weight, does not stretch out and washes wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised, they are not a burden to wear while sleeping and breathe well enough my hands didn&#x27;t sweat.  The gloves fit snug but don&#x27;t cut off circulation which is nice.  I&#x27;m 6ft 3 inch tall and weigh 205lbs to give you possible size reference.  My basketball player hands typically need a XL glove and these are fine.  When applying your favorite gel, cream, lotion etc make sure you apply a lot around the affected area as the snug fit will slide around your application area and the cotton will absorb some of the stuff.  I suffer from hand eczema around my nuckles and thumbs, this product really helped in relieving the pain and itching.  After a weeks use with vasoline and O&#x27;keefes Working Hands cream my hands are improving about 85%. Finally it&#x27;s worth mentioning the washing of the gloves...they didn&#x27;t lose shape!  Washing along with our hand towels and letting the gloves air dry worked brilliantly.  No lose of shape at all!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband whose hands get really dry and cracked in the winter but, if he put creams on before bed, they got all over his e-reader cover.  He loves them!</li>
    <li> I like them very much. They look good and feel good.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for a man with good sized hands and fingers and they fit him great. They are much thicker then the flimsy cotton gloves most places sell and they&#x27;ve held up to daily use and several hand wash/ hang dry rounds. He&#x27;s able to do just about everything wearing them, including using his iPhone. Ordering other pair so he always has a clean set.</li>
    <li> I like these lots.  As other writers have observed, the fit isn&#x27;t flawless, but they are quite good, and they&#x27;re very comfortable.  I am 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, a woman with hands that are slender with long fingers.  The gloves were a little tight to put on initially but after that they went on easily. They fit comfortably; my fingers don&#x27;t quite go to the ends. I wear them at bedtime throughout the night because my hands and tips of my thumbs especially get very dry in winter.  (My thumbs get even more aggravated from the flossing I do.) I washed them in the washing machine with cold water as directed, then laid flat on a towel to dry; they stayed the same size as well as the same fit &amp; fell inside.  I put moisturizing lotion on as well. I would really give them a 4 ¾ stars because they&#x27;re the best gloves I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> These gloves have long fingers to fit a mans hands.  I put my exema moisturizing cream on and then the gloves at bed time.  They work great!</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought these years ago!  I&#x27;m a woman with long fingers so women&#x27;s gloves never fit but these are perfect.  I&#x27;ve used &#x27;exam gloves&#x27; (WAY too hot) and socks (fingers get sweaty) but these are really great!  I&#x27;ve washed them a couple times too and they are holding up well.</li>
    <li> Great gloves. This is our second order. They last much longer than the cheap cotton gloves. My husband has to sleep with them on every night. These are comfortable and fit well, no shrinking in the length.</li>
    <li> Very nice large size gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I am a large woman with very dry hands and the women&#x27;s gloves are too tight&lt;br /&gt;for me.  These are a little big, but much better than having them too tight.&lt;br /&gt;They are made of a heavier material so I think they will last longer than the thin&lt;br /&gt;women&#x27;s gloves.  To me these gloves are expensive, but so far they are the only&lt;br /&gt;large size gloves I have found.</li>
