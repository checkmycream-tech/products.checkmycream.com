<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love my brushes!!!! They are sooooo amazing! Great price and great quality. I would recommend these for everyone.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush set and leather holder. Arrived promptly and nicely packaged. I did not receive the instruction booklet with my order. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got my brushes yesterday and used them this morning. They arrived so quickly and are amazing quality. I noticed the difference of how my make up went on smoothly and I can say I am truly happy with it. The only thing i would wish it had are just labels to tell the difference between brushes-yes some are obvious as to what they are but for a newbie, it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell which is which. Other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> So happy with the brushes. They arrived very quickly and they are stunning! Absolutely love the red travel cylinder. They are very soft on the face, apply makeup well and don&#x27;t shed. And I really love that they are vegan &amp; eco friendly. Big bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone really...a girl can never have too many brushes (like shoes!), but especially those either new/intermediate in makeup. There are some really great instructions included on how to use each of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy E.L.F instead.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;Glue everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;Sheds.&lt;br /&gt;Removes makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the case had glue coming out.&lt;br /&gt;May be doing a full review on my blog soon.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and the bristles do not break!  So far the quality and performance are impressive. The instructions were not included in the shipment, however.</li>
    <li> I love (love!) the brushes - they are hands down the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, for the brushes to keep their shape they need to be placed back in their plastic protective sleeve (this is a normal brush maintenance need). A handful of my sleeves separated - making them useless - within the first few days. It seemed like the plastic wasn&#x27;t molded properly at the seems, so any pressure applied to them broke the sleeves immediately. This product would be absolutely perfect with a little improvement on this.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this product but after only a few uses the Duo Fiber Foundation Brush top half (the brush and metal part) disconnected from the handle.  Unfortunately for me I waited to use these so by the time this happened, even though I had only used the brush maybe 5 times at most, it was past the 30 day warranty.  Haven&#x27;t really tried out the other brushes so far, I already had a good collection of brushes so I had been using those.  The instruction videos were very cool.  I especially found the the one for the eyeliner brush helpful as well as the how to properly clean the brushes one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the brush breaking the 2 things I would&#x27;ve loved to see different on this product were having all the brushes labeled with what brush/function they perform on the brushes handles (since there are a few that look alike and also a few that are for the same thing like the 2 foundation brushes) and I would&#x27;ve loved to see the protective covers on all of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Beautiful case to hold these very soft and sturdy brushes. Definately make a difference when putting on your makeup. I highly recommend this set to everyone</li>
    <li> Not only were the brushes beautiful and useful and durable,  each brush had a tutorial with it to teach proper techniques.  Great value and great product!</li>
    <li> Loved them. They worked amazing  I would highly recommend it to everybody. They were cute to look at too! Enjoy</li>
    <li> These are perfect brushes! Not only are they soft and perfectly shaped, Sorelle has made great tutorials and checks in on her customers satisfaction frequently. I&#x27;ve never known much about make-up. Always feeling confused and frustrated with brushes and figuring out colors and stuff. But with the PinUp Passion brush set I feel like I can finally perfect my make-up technique.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product, Pinup passion is the best! Beautiful, great quality brushes. Also comes with a cute case to store them. Love it! 😃</li>
    <li> Amazing!! These brushes are sooo soft!! I have been playing with them all day!! I am so glad I bought these brushes!!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes are super soft and so gentle with your skin!! Works great!! The case is beautiful and elegant! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are amazing. I like that they come in a case that is easy to carry around. The seller provides make up instructions/tips if you need them. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought them for my vegan daughter who lives in Germany. Her reviews and opinion in summary it is the best personal gift I given her in a long time. She likes them better than applying her make up with a sponge and are easy to clean. Long term $$$$ savings</li>
    <li> Women want a product that works and looks beautiful. These brushes not only work flawlessly, feel beautiful, do the job and look amazing doing it! I give it a pinup thumbs up!</li>
    <li> It came with a how to and a product guide. I am new to this style and completely love the set!!</li>
    <li> Best brushes, a rare manufacturer who wants you to get the most out of your product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. My friend loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes. They&#x27;re incredibly soft and not harsh on my skin. I have had problems with brushes making my skin itchy and blotchy in the past but these brushes are perfect! I&#x27;m so excited to do my makeup every day now that I have a good brush set to use :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful presentation, great portibility with the case provided great for beauty on the go! Whether your just starting out as your main set or make up obsessed and need a back up set this set is great to have on hand. I would definitely re-purchase for a friend.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have my Pin Up Passion 11 piece makup brush set!!!  First, I love the black box that it came in. The matte black box with the beautiful, deep red pin up logo embossed on it is absolutely beautiful!!  This is one box I WILL be keeping!!  When I opened the box, I was immediately thrilled with the makeup brush case!  It is a beautiful red, faux leather case with the cutest snaps on either side of it, to help ensure that the case stays closed.  The case has the beautiful Pin Up Passion logo embossed on it, too.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s the most adorable makeup case I have ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the best part....the makeup brushes!!  They are beautiful.  Each brush has a black handle with the Pin Up Passion logo printed on it in silver.  The brush bristles are soooo soft and feel wonderful on my skin!  To top it off, the brushes feel great in my hand...a very comfortable fit as I use them to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Included with the makeup brushes is a video tutorial on how to care for your new makeup brushes, as well as video tutorials explaining in detail what each makeup brush is intended to be used for and HOW to use each one.  In my opinion, the tutorials are great.  If you watch the tutorials, you should not be left with any questions as to how to use them.  I URGE YOU to watch the \\&quot;how to care for your brushes\\&quot; tutorial.  This will explain how to properly clean them, as well as the proper way to dry them and store them, helping ensure that you will enjoy your brushes for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and I am thankful that I discovered Pin Up Passion on Facebook.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas present for my wife.  She had the usual mixed collection of brushes.  She loves this set</li>
    <li> I love my makeup brushes. I&#x27;m still trying to get use to how they are work but it is coming along. Thank you for your help on how the brushes work it is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I just opened these about 3 minutes ago and I am feeling very ripped off. :( Maybe I just have bad luck, however... For $55.00 I got this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It comes with 10 brushes, not 11.&lt;br /&gt;- 4 of the 10 brushes were broken (metal not glued to the wooden handles).&lt;br /&gt;- The largest brush looks used! The bristles are bent and pushed out to the sides.&lt;br /&gt;- There is no instructions included! I havent recieved anything and there is nothing in box but the broken brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is really nice is the case, but wow... what a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to purchase this.... Being cruelty free and vegan was a huge plus for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking. :(</li>
    <li> I am super glad that I bought these, I needed some new make up brushes and this is something I can see myself using for a  long time. Shipping was quick and in a timely manner. If you are thinking about these don&#x27;t wait, these are probably the best brushes I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Got my brushes very quickly. Really enjoy the look and feel of them. When I used them I fell in LOVE!!! They work just as well if not better than my &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; makeup brushes.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are fantastic! Excellent quality and so easy to use! Lovely carrying case, soft bristles and great brush selection as well. These will definitely help me achieve the perfect pin up look for us girls with and inner pin up just aching to be let out. Sorelle you did an amazing job with these. Muchas gracias! From Tuti Lee Grajales - Brooklyn, NY</li>
    <li> most of my brushes worked great! unfortunately the powder and stipple brush are shedding which is very disappointing for the price of these brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great. Shipping was fast. I especially like the personal emails from the seller. My instructions did not come in the box, but I was able to contact the seller and have her send them to me, which she did very promptly. I like that this is included with the purchase you actually know what you&#x27;re doing. Great price for a starter set and the case is durable and compact for easy travel. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this set to others.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes! They are really made well. The absolute essential brushes to get started with fabulous make up techniques.</li>
    <li> The Brushes are made really well. Cute case. Mine did not come with their  paper that says what each brush is used for. And worst of all:&lt;br /&gt;My skin has had a horrible reaction to them! I&#x27;ve used the same brands make-up for years, needed new brushes and purchased these. Within HOURS  of using these brushes for the first&lt;br /&gt; (AND LAST) time, my skin turned into a bumpy mess, almosthive-like minus the itching...  6 days have passed, and  no relief. Time to see a dermatologist.  :/</li>
    <li> These are super cute .But I never received instructions with my brushes but still I love them and the case fits perfectly o. My vanity table</li>
    <li> I could NOT be happier with these brushes! They are super soft and do not shed like most of the makeup brushes I have spent a fortune on. It&#x27;s also reasonably priced considering how fabulous the quality is. I would highly recommend this set to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter as a belated Christmas gift...the price was awesome and she is so happy with them...They seem to be of good quality and a really good variety of brushes...They also arrived very quickly...</li>
    <li> I have been needing new brushes for awhile. I have a very large brush collection for my special effects makeup but really needed a small set for traveling with my personal  makeup. These are perfect the case is wonderful and unique and the brushes are high quality. Upon receiving the brushes(delivered quickly) they also sent links to tutorials on how to use each brush properly which is really neat. I look forward to using my new brushes often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes! The brushes themselves are soooo soft, and pick up product easily. I&#x27;ve had no problems while using them. Also, the box and the storage tumbler are both sweet and attractive. As of right now, I have nothing negative to say about this set.</li>
    <li> My wife love&#x27;s these.</li>
