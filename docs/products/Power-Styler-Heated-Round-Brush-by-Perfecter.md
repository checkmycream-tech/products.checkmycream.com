### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>and it gives my hair this incredible shine!</li>
      <li>but this is the best product I have ever bought for straightening/styling my hair.</li>
      <li>This is the best curling and smoothing tool I have found and the easiest to use.</li>
      <li>This brush works great.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this brush!!</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>If it had hairbrush bristles rather than the plastic ones, it would probably hold hair better, but it is perfectly usable as it is.  </li>
      <li>Worked great on my fine hair!!</li>
      <li>The plus side, it&#x27;s good to use on my toddler&#x27;s hair without burning her.  </li>
      <li>Showed up on time in good condition.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for the price and does everything it is advertised to do.  </li>
      <li>(It may be good for straightening??)</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, works great !</li>
      <li>Very nice and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>it is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Also, using the Perfector at my roots added nice volume that lasted all day.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled with the results.  </li>
      <li>Also the on/off and heat buttons should have a  lock as they are very easily changed while using the device.  </li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t damage my very fine processed hair, also leaves it shinny</li>
      <li>Shines, soft hair and love the curls and wave!!!</li>
      <li>Great product fast delivery!</li>
      <li>It works ok.  </li>
      <li>I love this styler .</li>
      <li>Love my power styler.</li>
      <li>but okay, I guess.</li>
      <li>Love this styler.  </li>
      <li>Either one of these alone works better than the Power Styler which claims to do all in one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a must buy for all types of hair:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money ordering from the infomercial.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Great styling tool at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Company accepted return immediately, so might be worth a try for you!!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel smooth and look shiny:-)</li>
      <li>My idea was to use 1 easy device, nut</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, affordable, makes my hair shine and works well.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>but, when I did my hair was so light</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smooth as advertised, made my hair frizzy instead.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my short hair.</li>
      <li>Probably works great for most hair, but mine is short, fine, and very straight...and it did not hold the lift/curl as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Its quick and easy.</li>
      <li>I really like having a product that I can style dry hair with and am very happy I bought it.</li>
      <li>It is cool to the touch.</li>
      <li>Heats up very fast and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>but it definitely helps smooth the unruly hair and gives a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>I already own one of these under the newer name (Perfecter) and, because I could get this one at such a good price, I decided on having one that is always packed (I travel a lot and left my styler home; that will not happen again.)  </li>
      <li>I have used the Instyler (which is an awesome product for someone wanting to smooth and shine any type of hair) to smooth and then follow with a curling iron to add a little body back.  </li>
      <li>I love being able to wash hair at night &amp; air dry.</li>
      <li>However, the Salon Shape requires repeated strokes to get a curl (like a blow dryer) and the curl did not hold on my fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>I like the way this gives a bit of fullness to fine straight mid-neck length hair.</li>
      <li>I have very puffy frizzy hair and it takes me forever to get it straightened and smooth.</li>
      <li>Therefore, the results I get from using it are far from what they would be if the bristles were authentic, brush bristles.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quickly &amp; the style really holds all day which is a miracle for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and am always looking for something to help smooth and relax the curl.  </li>
      <li>This review compares the Perfecter to &amp;#34;John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 Inch Hot Air Brush&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I still need to do some blow drying first with my hair dryer toi</li>
      <li>I was interested in purchasing the perfecter after using a friend&#x27;s, Perfecter by Calista Tools&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>While searching on Amazon, the Perfecter I purchased looked exactly like the one my friend let me use.  </li>
      <li>i am still hunting for the perfect combination of hair brush and flat iron, if such a thing is possible.</li>
      <li>For straight fine hair, I recommend the Perfector...to me it is worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>it was too large around.  </li>
      <li>My hair is too fine and short to make this power styler work for me!</li>
      <li>This iron works very well</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>Performs very well.</li>
      <li>but because it is a self-contained unit, it can be done one handed and is much easier to use than a brush-plus-blow-dryer.</li>
      <li>so I was very surprise when this happened.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for the infomercial results</li>
      <li>Really helps with styling hair.</li>
      <li>The low heat setting is very hot as my hair gets extremely hot after I wrap it around the wand.  </li>
      <li>Got this from Walmart for half this price, Only got to use it once so far to test it and it works great.....</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, color treated hair.</li>
      <li>was really expecting a little more.</li>
      <li>Wife loves it, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>Will update after a few more uses</li>
      <li>Really does get hot enough to straighten my curly hair.</li>
      <li>When I purchased, I assumed the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; was made with normal brush bristles, not synthetic.  </li>
      <li>The curl from the Perfecter only requires one stroke - and lasted much longer!</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>i do think it helped my day old, frazzled,</li>
      <li>However,  when I do use it my hair is silky and bouncy (I have natural wavy hair).</li>
      <li>So far.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair and it doesn&#x27;t  work very well.</li>
      <li>This hair styler combed right through my long hair for a long straight style.</li>
      <li>and I still have to blow my hair dry first.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for coarse hair.</li>
      <li>It does not do a great job on my coarse thick wavy hair which has been air dried.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it once so far</li>
      <li>Please note that it is for dry hair, so you have to blow dry first.</li>
      <li>My hair is not long at all</li>
      <li>Here are the pros- it created smooth, shiny straight hair with volume in less time than any other method that I have tried in the past.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works ok.  I found out you cannot use it on wet or damp hair and because my hair is thick I usually am styling it damp.  However,  when I do use it my hair is silky and bouncy (I have natural wavy hair).</li>
    <li> Can you use it with both hands with hurting yourself?</li>
    <li> Got this from Walmart for half this price, Only got to use it once so far to test it and it works great.....So far.  Shines, soft hair and love the curls and wave!!! Will update after a few more uses</li>
    <li> Description shows made by Calista. This is no way a Calista product and is not related to it.  False advertisements.  I am too lazy to send back as the price was so low.  The low heat setting is very hot as my hair gets extremely hot after I wrap it around the wand.  Wish there was a lower setting for my bleached dry hair.  Also the on/off and heat buttons should have a  lock as they are very easily changed while using the device.  It does not do a great job on my coarse thick wavy hair which has been air dried.  I still need to do some blow drying first with my hair dryer toi give it a chance.  My idea was to use 1 easy device, nut not so..just had my hair cut quite short, so will give it another try.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Performs very well.</li>
    <li> When I purchased, I assumed the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; was made with normal brush bristles, not synthetic.  I had no idea that it wasn&#x27;t. Therefore, the results I get from using it are far from what they would be if the bristles were authentic, brush bristles.  I was interested in purchasing the perfecter after using a friend&#x27;s, Perfecter by Calista Tools&amp;#34; while on vacation several months ago.  I was thrilled with the results.  While searching on Amazon, the Perfecter I purchased looked exactly like the one my friend let me use.  I had no idea it wasn&#x27;t the same at all.  That&#x27;s what I get for &amp;#34;assuming&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> it was too large around.  I have short hair and it doesn&#x27;t  work very well.</li>
    <li> Wow! I was skeptical about this working but this is the best product I have ever bought for straightening/styling my hair. Here are the pros- it created smooth, shiny straight hair with volume in less time than any other method that I have tried in the past. The con- my hair did get stuck when I tried to curl it like a curling iron. If you don&#x27;t twist the hair around the brush but go from underneath- it is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Works great on my short hair.</li>
    <li> The barrel is too fat- don&#x27;t work for me AT ALL..  Georgia</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price and does everything it is advertised to do.  If it had hairbrush bristles rather than the plastic ones, it would probably hold hair better, but it is perfectly usable as it is.  I do usually add a little hairspray or styling product when using my styler to help the curl last longer, but depending on your hair, you might not even need that.  I have fine hair.  I really like having a product that I can style dry hair with and am very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> I already own one of these under the newer name (Perfecter) and, because I could get this one at such a good price, I decided on having one that is always packed (I travel a lot and left my styler home; that will not happen again.)  I like the way this gives a bit of fullness to fine straight mid-neck length hair.</li>
    <li> hair was difficult to get out of the brush.  pulled hair</li>
    <li> Gets tangled and doesn&#x27;t curl like I expected</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Showed up on time in good condition. Heats up very fast and is easy to use. Makes my hair feel smooth and look shiny:-) I love it!!</li>
    <li> My hair is too fine and short to make this power styler work for me!</li>
    <li> This review compares the Perfecter to &amp;#34;John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 Inch Hot Air Brush&amp;#34;. I vastly prefer the Perfector over the &amp;#34;Salon Shape&amp;#34;. I have long, fine, color treated hair. The Perfector works on dry hair. The Freida Salon Shape&#x27;s biggest disadvantage is that it requires that hair be WET to work. So the Salon Shape is inconvenient to use for a quick touch-up, or say after work when going out. The Salon Shape merely gives the same results on my hair as a brush and blowdryer - but because it is a self-contained unit, it can be done one handed and is much easier to use than a brush-plus-blow-dryer. However, the Salon Shape requires repeated strokes to get a curl (like a blow dryer) and the curl did not hold on my fine, straight hair. (It may be good for straightening??) The curl from the Perfecter only requires one stroke - and lasted much longer! Also, using the Perfector at my roots added nice volume that lasted all day. I did NOT notice improved &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; from EITHER product. The &amp;#34;Salon Shape&amp;#34; does not require warm-up time (but it still takes longer to use). The Perfector requires warm-up time - but that is usually under one minute! For straight fine hair, I recommend the Perfector...to me it is worth the extra money. Anyone wanna buy a slightly used &amp;#34;Salon Shape?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery! Thx!</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived within 3 days after ordering.</li>
    <li> This hair styler combed right through my long hair for a long straight style. The brush tips didn&#x27;t burn or hurt my fingers when I had to put a few wild hair strands into the styler.</li>
    <li> Love this styler.  Can&#x27;t get burned doing back of hair!  Bought another one for my sister who has dexterity issues, and she can also use it without burning her neck.  Don&#x27;t expect BIG or TIGHT curls - but will straighten shorter hair or turn ends of hair under or flip it up.  I am 50ish with color treated shoulder length bob.</li>
    <li> It works ok.&lt;br /&gt;I was really expecting a little more.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling and smoothing tool I have found and the easiest to use. Please note that it is for dry hair, so you have to blow dry first.</li>
    <li> This brush works great. I love being able to wash hair at night &amp; air dry. Then get up in morning &amp; just using brush to style. It heats up quickly &amp; the style really holds all day which is a miracle for my hair.</li>
    <li> I like how this works but I have not mastered the curl with it.  I&#x27;m not sure that it gets hot enough for my hair but it definitely helps smooth the unruly hair and gives a nice shine.  I was really hoping for the infomercial results but I did not get them. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money ordering from the infomercial.</li>
    <li> This iron works very well, it doesn&#x27;t damage my very fine processed hair, also leaves it shinny</li>
    <li> Not sure what I was hoping for, but it&#x27;s just a curling iron with a brush.  Doesn&#x27;t smooth as advertised, made my hair frizzy instead.  I prefer my broken curling iron.  The plus side, it&#x27;s good to use on my toddler&#x27;s hair without burning her.  It is cool to the touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it  II heats almost instantly and gives lift to my hairstyle where needed.  I&#x27;d like it to be just a trifle smaller in diameter but all in all, I like it.</li>
    <li> Great styling tool at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Really helps with styling hair. Its quick and easy. No burning the skin .</li>
    <li> The TV ad got me to buy it. Probably works great for most hair, but mine is short, fine, and very straight...and it did not hold the lift/curl as advertised.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for coarse hair. i do think it helped my day old, frazzled, sweated like a pig during my workout hair look a little fresher. i am still hunting for the perfect combination of hair brush and flat iron, if such a thing is possible.</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Not great. Really does get hot enough to straighten my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, works great !</li>
    <li> I love this styler . My second one ! Recommend !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, affordable, makes my hair shine and works well.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my fine hair!!</li>
    <li> Tangles my hair.  Company accepted return immediately, so might be worth a try for you!!</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far but, when I did my hair was so light and I could shake it.  My hair is not long at all so I was very surprise when this happened.</li>
    <li> Love my power styler. I have very curly hair and it helps smooth out my hair especially in the morning when I&#x27;ve had a bad case of bed head.</li>
    <li> Unusable. Tangles badly,painfully</li>
    <li> Not what the commercials claim but okay, I guess.</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Average curl power and I still have to blow my hair dry first.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush!! I have very puffy frizzy hair and it takes me forever to get it straightened and smooth. Since I started using this brush it takes me half the time and it gives my hair this incredible shine! I would definetly recommend this brush for any type of hair. I also use it to wave and curl my hair and the curls actually stay!! My hair is totally different since I started using this brush!! It&#x27;s a must buy for all types of hair:)</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a  3/4 inch barrel, but it was actually 1 and 1/2 inches.  It was too big around for my short hair.</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  I have naturally curly hair and am always looking for something to help smooth and relax the curl.  I have used the Instyler (which is an awesome product for someone wanting to smooth and shine any type of hair) to smooth and then follow with a curling iron to add a little body back.  Either one of these alone works better than the Power Styler which claims to do all in one.  Found it left me with body but did not really smooth my hair to the level I am accustomed. I felt it left it almost straw like to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel like I got caught -- as seen on TV.</li>
    <li> bought it for my girl and she loves it</li>
</ol>
