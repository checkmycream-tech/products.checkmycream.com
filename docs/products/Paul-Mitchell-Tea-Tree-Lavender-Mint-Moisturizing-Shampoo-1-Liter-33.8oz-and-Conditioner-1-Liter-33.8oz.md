<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My niece had some &amp; I had used it before.</li>
    <li> Love this product smells wonderful and my hair feels great.</li>
    <li> My girls (3 teenagers) and I think this is the best shampoo and conditioner we have ever used. The price is awesome and love having it shipped right to their dorm or my house!</li>
    <li> Delivered was fast. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great smell and makes my hair feel great!  I live in humid city and this product helps with my hair not frizzing.</li>
    <li> I had bought this exact same set from amazon about a year ago for about the same price. I&#x27;m not one to spend alot of money on hair care products, however.....I felt like this was going to be worth the investment. I was using too much of the cheaper shampoo and conditioners. So when I had got my hair cut about this time last year, was discovered that I had ALOT of wax build up. I love my hair ALOT and knew I need to take better care of it. So I turned to this particular brand cause I know my sisters love Paul Mitchell. Yes it may suck having to pay 50-60 dollars but it&#x27;s for the BIG bottles. Even with long of hair that I have. My last set of bottles ended up lasting me like 8 or 9 months! So very well the 50-60 bucks if you ask me, not to mention my hair has been alot healthier since then!</li>
    <li> My son only uses this shampoo. It is expensive at the salon. This is a great way to save money. It is an identical product.</li>
    <li> Just got today, everything came in perfect condition. Left my hair sooo soft and shiny!! Only gave 4 stars because I hate the smell, other than that I love !</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. Hair is smooth and very soft! Great product!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner both were great and helped with my frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Love the conditioner.  Shampoo is also good but it does not have a cooling effect like a regular tea tree shampoo does.</li>
    <li> I have really loved this shampoo/conditioner combo!  My hair is now smooth and shiny, and smells great.  In fact, I have ordered bottles in the 1 liter size for my extra guest bathrooms, too!  My only complaint is when the bottles get close to empty, it is hard to get that last little bit out.</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil smell is not for everybody-- first time I smelled it, it reminded me of my grandmother. The smell is very strong, but I LOVE it. This shampoo is really hydrating, it&#x27;s definitely better than the awapuhi shampoo from the same brand. I have colored hair and so it&#x27;s really dry right about this time of the year. I have had my friends tell me that my hair looks shinier, and it feels very soft.</li>
    <li> bottles were open and leaking but other than that as expected</li>
    <li> Great for my daughters greasy/dandruff hair. The smell is pretty strong and not sure I really like it. Some girls at school make fun of smell others like it. Probably will look for another product that isn&#x27;t so smelly.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this shampoo/conditioner my stylist had given me samples and I fell in love with it. I recently moved and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so I decided to look online. I received these shortly after ordering and do like them don&#x27;t get me wrong.. but it doesn&#x27;t seem the same as when I tried the sample (it had this amazing tingling sensation and did my hair wonders in one wash). Also when I received these they were not in any original packaging which worried me. Next time I will defiantly just take the wallet hit and buy from my salon to assure I am getting the real thing.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product since the moment the salon used it on my hair, back in February 2011.  I don&#x27;t care what other critics think about this seller, because the price and quality made me go back to Paul&#x27;s Lavender Mint after continuously being disappointed with store-bought moisturizing shampoos &amp; conditioners.  You are Godsend, because this product is so expensive at the salons, which makes it affordable for anyone who&#x27;s on a tight budget.    The smell of this product and the results are wonderful!  All other shampoos and conditioners left my hair smelling good, soft &amp; shiny, but as the day went by, my hair became dry, frizzy, unmanageable and the scent faded away by the end of the day.  Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Lavender Mint leaves your hair moisturized, smelling great, manageable, smooth, soft &amp; shiny all day long. Even on the next day, my hair felt clean and still smelling great, unlike other products I&#x27;ve used.    With Paul&#x27;s Lavender Mint, I receive so many compliments about the scent and the difference of the appearance of my hair.  They ask if I cut or dyed it, which I didn&#x27;t, of course.  The lavender scent relaxes me while I&#x27;m washing my hair.  What more can you ask for when you are stressed out?  This is a top notch product, picks up my spirits and makes me feel so sexy.  There&#x27;s no need to add chemicals for air-dried hair styles, like mine, because it leaves no frizz and your fingers can easily go through your hair.      ABOUT THE SELLER...DELIVERY WAS FASTER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED, SECURELY PACKAGED, AND PROVIDES A PRICE THAT ANYONE WHO&#x27;S ON A BUDGET CAN BENEFIT USING THIS PRODUCT! THANK YOU SO MUCH!  YOU HAVE MADE ME A VERY HAPPY WOMAN!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I purchased it twice from this seller and was surprized how fast it was shipped A+ for satisfaction. Thankyou</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last year and both bottles had leaked about a third of the product in the box and both dispensers were damaged and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this was an anomaly and decided to order the same product this year.  To my disappointment, I once again opened the box to find that substantial amount of the product had leaked out of the bottles and into the box.  The dispensers were once again damaged and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell products for a few years.  This new lavendar product is equal in quality to the others.  My favorite is still the Tea Tree shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and condition combo was introduced to me by a hairdresser.  She ended up giving me a terrific discount on it, probably because she took one look at the terrible chop-job of a haircut I emerged with.  Still, bad haircut aside, I&#x27;m thankful to her for steering me in the direction of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lavender Mint shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s a definite winner!    This product, though not cheap, does last a very long time, and did end up being cost-effective.  You need only press the pump one time if you&#x27;re applying it to short or medium-length wet hair.  I bought my bottles back in January of 2009, and 9 months later, I&#x27;m only now restocking.  Since my college-aged daughter is back home for graduate school, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be going through it much faster.    Here&#x27;s the deal:  It leaves my hair smelling wonderful and feeling soft and manageable, moreso than any other product on the market.  The lavender mint also is fabulous for my scalp, which from time to time reacts to hair care products badly, by going all dandruffy on me.  I&#x27;ve had no dandruff worries with these products.</li>
    <li> Anyone nervous about purchasing this product because of the price, rest assured it is worth every penny. I have long hair that goes to the mid-back, and I&#x27;ve had these bottles for months. I use less than half the normal amount of shampoo or conditioner I would normally use with other products. It smells great, feels great, and leaves my hair feeling awesome. Hands down best shampoo and conditioner for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I was having issues with dry scalp and itching. After three uses my scalp feels better and my hair looks great. I was using paraben and sulfate/sulfite free shampoos and conditioners and unfortunately this product is not free of those chemicals. Maybe that&#x27;s why it made me feel better. Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> For roughly the same price as finding this item in a hair salon, I could just easily have it shipped to my house...and that is if the hair salon has it in stock (because most of them suck at keeping a positive inventory).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, does a great job of cleaning my hair, and the containers are durable enough to last for awhile. I have been able to save these pump containers for other shower products such as soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great item, and I would recommend everyone try the Tea Tree products, as they are VERY good.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday! Wonderful shampoo that smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Have to buy in bulk for my wife&#x27;s long hair.  It still lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Hands down best shampoo and conditioner. Smells amazing and works perfectly. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great Smelling shampoo and conditioner if you like the smell of lavender. It does a great job cleaning and conditioning, but this is obviously expensive compared to most. If you don&#x27;t love the smell of lavender this is probably overpowering. I think I like the Tea Tree Special better because to the tingling sensation, but this smells better and is just as good.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but not as strong or tingly as the original tea tree shampoo. After I bought this lavender and mint set, I read someone&#x27;s review that this didn&#x27;t tingle their scalp like the original in the small bottles - and it is true! That&#x27;s what I loved about paul Mitchell tree tree shampoo. This still smells good on the hair, and makes the whole bathroom smell good after someone has used it though.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditoner. I first tried on my trip to Puerto Rico where I purchase it at the resort and I love the softness ans shine</li>
    <li> My whole family ADORES the smell and feel of this shampoo/conditioner set.  It leaves all of our hair soft and manageable and doesn&#x27;t dry it out!  BUY THIS NOW!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product  great price</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo/conditioner duo.  Came super packaged so the bottles were kept safe and the pump form is oober convenient.  Smells great but not too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Love the product but find a different seller! This shampoo and conditioner line is EXCELLENT and I won&#x27;t use anything else. BUT the seller sucks, product arrived open / spilled in the container, sloppy packaging, not available to be replaced. Didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with the hassle of returning and repurchasing elsewhere for $50, so I&#x27;ll just put these into new containers -- you can probably find another seller on here for a comparable price that can fulfill this for you. Eat it, TK Beauty. You stink.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biolage for awhile and wanted to try something new, being a huge fan of lavendar scented products i thought this might be right up my alley. Now i was wary of the word Moisturizing because i have very thick long hair and those type of shampoo&#x27;s tend to make my hair a little greasier than i would like. But i have never had that problem with this product. I use it everyday and i love the way it makes my hair smell and it keeps it shiny and soft.I have not had a problem with greasiness like the previous reviewer with thick hair did. I think i will try the plein tea tree shampoo and conditioner next just to see if it is as good as this product. But if you like lavendar scents and need a good moisturizing shampoo then this product is for you!! Also it doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as some cheaper shampoo&#x27;s do like Suave and Pantene but that&#x27;s just because it doesnt have so many of the fillers and things cheaper products have. So don&#x27;t worry about it not getting your hair squeaky clean, it will it just doesn&#x27;t need all the extra bubbles to do it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite. Normally I would give it 5 stars but during shipping the conditioner cap opened and some had spilled out in the bag. Other than that, it&#x27; was fine.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo and conditioner.  I have been using it for about 3 years now.  I find that this cleans my hair so well that I actually need to shampoo less often.  My hair does not get &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; until the 3rd day, but remains shiny and moisturized.  This will obviously vary depending on the person, but I had to wash my hair nearly every day for other shampoos.  I also find the conditioner is very dense, meaning you don&#x27;t have to use very much. This makes it much more affordable that your standard shampoo purchases!  I also get a lot of compliments on the smell.</li>
    <li> I was using store bought shampoo and my hair was dry and brittle, some even fell out.  I used Paul Mitchell years ago so I thought I&#x27;d try this (great price). My hair feels  great, and I have alot of new growth. Smells good and my scalp feels great.</li>
    <li> Shampoo pump broken but good buy.</li>
    <li> This product is great!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and am glad to get it on Amazon for a few bucks less than the salon. Smells great. Feels like a spa treatment. Hope it isn&#x27;t full of chemicals. But I almost don&#x27;t care. It says &amp;#34;Lavender &amp; Mint&amp;#34;. Smells great. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I switched from the Moroccan shampoo and conditioner to save a bit of money. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again when I run out. It&#x27;s basically better-smelling Pantene; it does its job but I want my hair to look and smell like I walked out of the salon!</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!!  I believe I was ripped off when I received this product from \\&quot;All in Beauty\\&quot;. Cheap imposter! Neither the shampoo or conditioner has the mint tingle at all. And both products smell like cheap Men&#x27;s cologne!</li>
    <li> This is a great product... if you tried it then you already know-here&#x27;s a tip.. SUPERCUTS always have the LARGE bottles on sale.  For those who have not tried it yet-most chain Pharamcy stores sell the smaller bottles.  You will feel the Minty Tingling fresh feeling of this shampoo working immediately- I&#x27;m hooked and love this shampoo.  Hope my tips helped!</li>
    <li> love the smell of it and how it makes your hair feel soft and shiny very relaxing smell to the senses</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the scent and how my hair feels.  My scalp feels so clean from the mint.  Once a week I use a hairmask called Perfect 10 through out my whole hair.  This works so well together.</li>
    <li> this shampoo and conditioner set smells really good ,but not as kind to the hair as i thought it would be and doesn&#x27;t detangle as i hoped it would!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells wonderful, and you can smell it all day long.  I get a lot of compliments on it.  The shampoo lathers beautifully, and your hair feels really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product three stars because of the conditioner, I have medium length hair that I wash everyday.  The conditioner just doesn&#x27;t give it what it needs.  Maybe I need a deeper conditioner, but I thought this conditioner should have done it.  I am not someone who can skimp on conditioner, so if you are, I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I grew up spoiled when it came to hair-care products. My mother is a licensed cosmetologist and so we always had the best product. It wasn&#x27;t until I was in college that I had to buy store bought shampoo (gasp!) Now, as the mother of three the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lavender Mint Moisturizing Shampoo &amp; Lavender Mint Moisturizing Conditioner have saved my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick curly hair which tends to get very dry and brittle very fast, but this shampoo and conditioner has left my hair feeling moisturized and clean without feeling weighed down. Also, I use way LESS than I was using with store bought shampoo. I have medium length (past my shoulders) and 2- 10 oz bottles of shampoo and conditioner lasted me almost 2.5 months... So I think the price equals out in the end because I&#x27;m having to buy less.&lt;br /&gt;Another great pro to this set is the cool tingly feel on my scalp. The tea-tree does wonders if you have a flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> The scent is great and long lasting! The mint is nice and invigorating, and the conditioner makes my hair feel like silk. The pumps on the bottles make everything rather convenient.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this shampoo/conditioner.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> You will be smelling your hair all day long and even the next morning. Even my pillow cases smell like it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair so soft and shiny.  I&#x27;m really lazy and I don&#x27;t style my hair or anything.  I just wash it with this stuff every few days and let it air dry.</li>
    <li> On time and no issues</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoos I have ever tried and I&#x27;m not shy about spending money on shampoo. It smells good, makes your hair soft and has a little zing to it. You have to try it because I can&#x27;t really describe zing ...</li>
    <li> I only used the product itself once, it left my hair FEELING nice, but I got an instant headache from the scent.  A few of the other reviewers noted how the scent stays with you all day long. They were right.  I initially thought that I would like the scent because I usually like the smell of mint, and I also like the smell of lavender.    I however, never thought about the two smells combined.  It isn&#x27;t EXACTLY like patchouli, but WAY too close for my comfort!</li>
    <li> We enjoy this superior shampoo and conditioner.  I can feel a difference in our hair.  Would pay extra for this again.</li>
    <li> This product is not sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Price!</li>
    <li> This stuff tingles and makes your hair shine. If you care about your hair and are willing to invest a little of your hard earned bread, this stuff works well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this product makes my hair feel. It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft and it is so shiny</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo and conditioner! I love the smell and how my hair looks and feels. People follow me around in stores to ask what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing! Buying in the Liter size is the way to go, as this product is MUCH more expensive in smaller sizes. I have long thick wavy hair and this is a product I hate to be without!</li>
    <li> Smells really good after shower.</li>
    <li> My first impression open opening the package (and smelling the products, naturally), was \\&quot;This smells like allergies!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, that&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine, since I bought this having a pretty vague idea of what lavender, in particular, smelled like. I&#x27;m also allergic to a disturbing amount of flora, so to be fair, anything that smells vaguely earthy and plant-ish gives me a similar reaction. Given the titular \\&quot;lavender mint,\\&quot; I was expecting something of a cross between various Bath &amp; Body Works Lotions and my toothpaste. Not so. I think I have a decent idea of what smells minty, and this didn&#x27;t smell minty at all to me, so I can only assume it smells like lavender, in which case I apparently am not a particular fan of lavender. (Again, not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine.) The scent isn&#x27;t unpleasant, it&#x27;s just not something I&#x27;d pick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the scent being cloying, I found that I could really only smell it as my hair dried (which admittedly takes a while as my hair is waist-length and I very rarely blow dry it). After my hair was dry, however, I had to specifically grab a hunk of hair and place it under my nose and inhale to be able to smell much of anything, which is not something I&#x27;m in the habit of doing, but I guess if you sniff your own hair frequently, it could get annoying if you&#x27;re not a fan of the scent. As far as I&#x27;m aware, no one else could smell it on me, either, which is good, because I&#x27;m not of the school of \\&quot;well, I like this scent, so naturally everyone within a ten foot radius will want to smell me.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the supposed tingly feeling some reviewers did/didn&#x27;t get - the only tingly feeling I felt while using this product was in my arms trying to work this puppy into a lather. My previous shampoo lathered at the slightest provocation, so at first I was pretty determined to make this do the same. It didn&#x27;t work. If you find copious amounts of suds necessary for a pleasant showering experience, you&#x27;re going to besorely disappointed with this product. It lathers, certainly, but relatively minimally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got over the disappointment of not being able to create a bubble mountain atop my head and rinsed, I found that this shampoo left my hair feeling quite clean. I wash my hair every day (yes, yes, I know - hairdressers everywhere just died a little inside). It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m willing to stop, however, which allows me to find pretty quickly just how moisturizing (or un-moisturizing) a particular product is. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product dried out my hair, but it didn&#x27;t leave it looking like a Pantene commercial, either (I&#x27;m not endorsing Pantene here - there&#x27;s a reason I don&#x27;t use their hair care products, but the models in their hair commercials always have gorgeous, shiny hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly advise anyone using the conditioner to leave it in for as many minutes as you can. Even though the bottle doesn&#x27;t say to, let it sit in your hair for a bit. The few times where I was in a bit of a rush and basically applied conditioner and immediately rinsed it out left my hair feeling very dry. However, leaving it in for multiple minutes while I carried on with my shower left my hair feeling deliciously smooth and silky when I rinsed it out (some of this silkiness was lost as soon as I my hair started to dry, unfortunately.) On the whole, my hair seems slightly less frizzy than it was before I started using this product. The main difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that it definitely is softer - particularly at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I like this product, but once I finish the (rather large) bottles, I&#x27;ll probably try something else. It works, and more or less seems to do what it claims, but certainly doesn&#x27;t do anything beyond that.</li>
    <li> I am definitely no expert on hair care products. I can&#x27;t say this product is \\&quot;AMAZING,\\&quot; but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m dissatisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year&#x27;s use:&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about this product is that this is the first time.. I&#x27;ve been able to leave my hair grown out good few inches below my bust line without seeing any split ends. Additionally, my hair has grown the fastest it&#x27;s ever grown! I get a lot of comments on how fast my hair&#x27;s grown. I have no clue if there are any associations of the lack of split ends and fast growth with this shampoo and conditioner, but it&#x27;s the only difference between all the other years of retail shampoo and conditioner. It could be diet change, less stress etc, I have no clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m NOT a fan of is that during the drier months, I do noticeably see more dandruff than usual. I have black hair, so it makes me self-conscious. It led me to alternate and even limit using the product to 2-3 times a week instead of everyday. I&#x27;m not sure how much Tea Tree is put in these products, but I do recommend it for anyone who has really oily hair. My hair gets oily in about 2 days time, but it&#x27;s not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my hair does seem healthy (note: I don&#x27;t blow dry, straighten, curl, etc), but it does feel a bit drier than what I would like. I gave it 4 stars because again, this is the longest I have been able to let my hair grow out without split ends and it&#x27;s a fast growth (MAY be due to the shampoo and conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently changed to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree (I know.. dandruff will still be there) because I love the tingly sensation on my scalp that the Lavender does not give. I plan to alternate again to limit the dandruff.</li>
    <li> Love it, after washing you can feel the difference,I notice it even strengthen my hair, very expensive but it&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Favorite hair product</li>
    <li> I knew i needed to shell out a few bucks for quality hair products but was always hesitant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...that is until i fried my hair so badly that my ends were like rubber when wet. (sigh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cut my hair, and started using this shampoo and conditioner... and 6 months later, Here I am... Refilling my subscription ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my BF who has psoriasis LOVES this product. Very nourishing for your scalp.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this nearly as well as the tea tree shampoo I had before.  This one reminds me of my dog&#x27;s shampoo.  Not the best smell.  Also, the company I purchased mine from didn&#x27;t ship it well, and I ended up having to buy bottles to put the shampoo in.  The dispenser on top was broken.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Leaves your hair smelling great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry and damaged hair. Makes hair very soft. I would not recommended using this product for every day use.</li>
    <li> I received item broken and contents all over inside of box,  would like a replacement cap.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly so when I purchased it from this seller, I noticed the shampoo was considerably thinner as if water or something had been added to it.</li>
    <li> Folks, it&#x27;s shampoo, so not something I get too excited about.  Yes, it&#x27;s good shampoo, but I&#x27;m not convinced its any better that some of the better brands that they sell at many places like Target.  I think it does have a better fragrance, however, since I like the smell of mint.</li>
    <li> Good Price and fast delivery.  The Shampoo and Conditioner went beyond my expectations they make my hair soft.  Great product, Thank you.</li>
    <li> the shampoo smell good  and good for hair..................i like it will  buy again  it is very good size shampoo condition</li>
    <li> Made my head itch and brake out in pimples!</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo/conditioner and worth every penny.  I am usually pretty frugal when it comes to these items but this shampoo/conditioner makes my hair thicker and shinier.  The scent lasts all day...even the next day.  It only takes 1 pump of each (and I have long hair) so you can save money by not over-using.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I LOVE this product! However, the packaging on the bottles itself was poorly done.  The shampoo and conditioner had both leaked out spilling everywhere.  Plus the containers were sealed with regular scotch tape, I did not find this professional.  I will probably not order again from this seller, especially for the price I paid for my items.</li>
    <li> All of the Paul Mitchell products are pretty awesome.  This works well, so does the tea tree shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> If you have trouble with your scalp breaking out or your hairline, this product works great! I love the smell of it too. The tea tree gives you the medicinal healing while the lavender gives you a calming scent. It doesnt dry your hair out at all. I have been using this for a couple years now and my hair dresser says that she has noticed a difference in my hair. I have always had thick hair and not a lot of dead ends but over the years it seems like my skin has gotten more and more sensitive. I was told to try this for my scalp breaking out and sure enough it did the trick.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo which has restored my hair to its previous easy to style and maintain condition.  I don&#x27;t know why I sometimes think I can skimp on shampoo... it always bites me in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something which will smell like mint and give your scalp that mint tingly feeling - this is NOT the shampoo for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you hate the smell of tea tree oil - this is NOT the shampoo for you.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the scent is super strong.  You will notice it throughout your entire day, but only at first.  After about a week you get desensitized to the smell and you no longer notice it.  I&#x27;m actually sad about this because I liked being able to smell my hair because I think it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is strongly scented, I haven&#x27;t had a single person at work or otherwise mention they can smell my hair.  And yes, I work with people who would say such a thing.  So I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about other people sniffing you.&lt;br /&gt;These bottles will likely last me at least 4 months.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much.  It&#x27;s high quality.</li>
    <li> smells like pine wood at the lumbar yard!  Not the standard mint flavor that is popular in the salons.  Read carefully!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner! This is all I use, the scent is amazing and it works so great on my hair!</li>
    <li> Great product at an excellent price</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this shampoo...but the product itself really didn&#x27;t convince me to keep using it.  It didn&#x27;t do wonders for my hair and it wasn&#x27;t out of this world, but it&#x27;s a good product.  No, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money, however for what you pay for this stuff in a salon it&#x27;s a great price buying it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The product is good.  Downside is Amazon packaged it terribly for shipping and a bunch of the shampoo leaked out.  I let Amazon know, but never heard a word.  Very disappointing customer service.  Buy at your own risk.  The price is great, but with the leaking, you might be better off getting it from your stylist.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but the tingle isn&#x27;t there.  I read reviews about how this must be a weaker formula and I agree.</li>
    <li> Great!! Light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy</li>
    <li> The best shampoo that you can get for itchy scalp issues.  Incredibly expensive, but worth it!  I am always the person who goes for the cheapest thing that will do the job--I wash my face with baby shampoo--so it is rare for me to give such a good review to an expensive product!  I will buy it for as long as they make it, and will stock up in case it&#x27;s discontinued.  That&#x27;s how good it is!</li>
    <li> I love mint and I love lavender so I thought this would be a great shampoo/conditioner for me but boy was I wrong.  The scent of this is horrible.  It reminds me of a house full of moth balls.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again although it does get my hair clean and keep it in good condition.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my elementary aged daughter - expensive for a 1st grader - yes, but I am a firm believer in this preventing lice  - I stopped using this for a few months on her and what happened, she came home from school with lice - the eradication process once your kid has lice is ridiculous - this stuff is worth every penny and we are back to using it religiously on her hair, no additional outbreaks either (knock on wood!)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I do not feel that my head smells at the end of the day as with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> all was great, product worked as expected and required. Price was good, planning on refilling when run out of pro</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell products.  This shampoo and conditioner smell so good and are so good for your hair!  I do find though, that this conditioner is a little too moisturizing for my fine hair.  I only use it once every few days for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> We bought this and when we got it wasn&#x27;t sealed at all  the soap spilled everywhere and when I got it, it said that that s and c (shampoo and conditioner) was the same size. When I got it the conditioner was 10 ounces not 33.8. The shampoo is only 33.8 ounces!!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most shampoos and conditioners and get a terrible rash if I&#x27;m not very careful.  The Paul Mitchell Lavender Mint Shampoo and Conditioner have been one of the few things I can find that doesn&#x27;t cause problems for me.  I still get occasional reactions but it&#x27;s minimal.</li>
    <li> My beautician introduced me to this product and I LOVE IT!  My hair feels so clean and smells wonderful after using this product.  I ran out and went back to using the product I was using before this Paul Mitchell product and I noticed..what I thought felt clean really wasn&#x27;t compared to the lavender mint.  I was happy when my Paul Mitchell Lavender Mint was back in my shower and would highly recommend this product.  Also have to add...I&#x27;m not a fan of lavender at all, but this combination seems to work well and smells wonderful!  You really should give it a try and see the difference.</li>
    <li> not all are equal. it is obvious some suppliers are watering down their products. Stay away from the cheap versions, they are cheaper for a reason.</li>
    <li> I told my hairdresser that I was running low on shampoo &amp; conditioner and I was a bit surprised when she handed me this shampoo &amp; conditioner and not my usual products.  She opened the bottle so I could smell it and I liked the smell, so I said I&#x27;d try it.      I have very thin, fine baby like hair and I have recently lost some of it from medications I had to take, so I get a bit worried and tend to guard the little bit of hair I have left.  My hairdresser said it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my hair or my scalp and said the tea tree oil would make my scalp very healthy.     I tried it the next morning and I am thrilled.    I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!  The smell is really nice and the way it makes my hair feel is great. My hair and scalp seem to stay cleaner because I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day now.  My hair is shiny and smooth actually has some body &amp; fullness to it now.  I have been using it now for almost a month and I won&#x27;t be going back to my old products.    Amazing stuff.  I intend to stock up on it!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  It arrived after Christmas and after she had to leave to go back to college.&lt;br /&gt;With the delivery date given I would have expected to receive it no later than 12/24.  So she won&#x27;t get it until March - the next time she comes home because I don&#x27;t want to pay to for shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it last forever! The pumps make it easy for kids to use as well. Have bought it several times.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for both shampoo and conditiner  as far as price goes    as far as the product it is great for keeping healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Love the Mint Moisturizing combo for my fine, color-treated hair.  Great shine and smoothness without weight.  And the scent is a great pick-me-up in the mornings too, minty without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> The shampoo itself does a good job but I hate the smell. Its too much mint unless you want to smell like a strong mint tree!</li>
    <li> I love the Paul Mitchell products.  I have used both the Lemon Sage and the Lavender Mint and love them both.  I can wash my hair every day it is so gentle and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. You can save big bucks over getting this product in the stores.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo &amp; conditioner. U will love it and so will your HAIR!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought</li>
    <li> good smelling product and great price for the amount of product you get.  Doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your hair or dry it out like other products</li>
    <li> My friend had this product and I tried it.  First I tried it because the scent was so energizing.  After using it I discovered it made my hair feel so silky and thick.  My hair was so manageable after using the product that I had to order this product for myself.  I highly recommend this product for anyone that feels their hair needs a pick-me-up in texture and manageability. I would give it more stars if I could.</li>
    <li> It took me years to accept this, but there is a very legit difference between $5 grocery store shampoo and stuff like Paul Mitchell. As much as it pained me the first time I decided to drop $50 on shampoo and conditioner, I did not regret the decision. My hair has gotten a little thinner and dryer the last few years and I&#x27;ve been constantly switching brands trying to find something that actually conditioned well without weighing my hair down and making it look even worse. The lavender mint stuff is just perfect. It smells glorious, cleans and conditions well, and leaves no noticeable build up. My only problem with the online purchase is that the conditioner bottle (which is a pump) was damaged in shipping. I&#x27;m not sure if that is common or a one-time thing, but either way Amazon is great about dealing with that stuff.</li>
    <li> Then this is the answer! My daughter and I are both allergic to the added perfumes in shampoos and conditioners and this product right here is the answer to a healthy scalp. Because we are both racially mixed our scalp and hair is hard to keep consistently hyrdrated. My daughter was using head and shoulders for months and nothing was helping. We finally realized she doesn&#x27;t actually have &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; but instead a dry scalp from the products stripping her scalp of moisture. We both have had scalp acne which can be very painful and we both switched to this shampoo and conditioner and within a week we both had shining beautiful moisturized scalp and hair. This is truly a miracle product for dry scalp/scalp acne sufferers.</li>
    <li> These are all I use.  They last almost 6 months.  Great Buy! Fantastic Price.</li>
    <li> Helps with my dry scalp, leaves my head feeling clean and fresh. Love this combo, also bought the scalp treatment and use that once a week or less depending on if I remember to use it lol. The best combo for dry itchy scalp I have found so far. Head and shoulders and all the others in the drug store have done nothing for me and actually made my head drier. After a few searches and bit of research found this stuff and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just looking to try this they have a smaller size combo pack but I already went through those and was looking for the large bottles.</li>
    <li> Iwas very satisfied  thank you</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!! The scent is so relaxing and out of this world. The mint tingles on your scalp and helps stimulate hair growth. My hair feels so fresh, clean, and revitalized after using this. Anyone that catches a whiff of my hair always asks what is that?! It smells fabulous! Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lavender Mint Rosemary Shampoo and Conditioner are two of my little beauty secrets that will forever be kept in my arsenal!</li>
    <li> I love it how it feel and the smell. its so nice!</li>
    <li> Positive purchase, timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this product, helps keep my hair moisturized and healthy!!!</li>
    <li> great amount of moisturizing for curly hair. I normally purchase the tea tree mint - so I do miss the effect that has on me in the morning. but it leaves my hair looking, feeling and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a year now, only had my hair cut once as I am growing it out and I don&#x27;t have a single split end!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair fresh and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Paul Mitchell moisterizing shampoo and conditioner.  I purchase the big bottles and transfer it into 10 oz. containers to use in the shower.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like the pumps.  The last order was broken so the shampoo leaked all over the package.  However, the product is excellent for my thick, curly hair so I&#x27;ll put up with a little aggrivation.</li>
    <li> Product smells great and arrived in perfect condition.  I have always like P. Mitchell products and this size should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this Paul Mitchell shampoo it has a very clean feel no left over residue and it smells great</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the product and feel of my hair after using it, but it arrived spilled and all over the packaging.</li>
    <li> I have been thinking about cutting my long hair because my hair is constantly tangling.  I used this product this morning for the first time and was amazed.  I was skeptical about using only one pump, but it goes a long way.  My hair had no tangles, was/is super soft, and the scent lasted all day. Love it!</li>
    <li> I received my Lavender shampoo in good time and in good order.  This is a high quality shampoo and conditioner.  Great smell as well.</li>
    <li> Very good smells wonderful and my hair is soft.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend after I asked for a suggestion to help with year-after-year of dry, itchy, flaky winter scalp. Head and Shoulders and other shampoos do not help because dry/winter scalp is NOT the same as dandruff. The tea tree in this shampoo is key and it works! The shampoo does not smell at all like mint- but my scalp looks and feels much better!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Smells fantastic too!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and fine hair.  This is perfect for me.  I&#x27;ve continued to use this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product!</li>
    <li> Just okay. Scent is a little too medicinal for me. The products leave my hair very heavy. I find I have to alternate this duo with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> The smell of this shampoo and conditioner is ultra soothing and calming. The conditioner is rich and leaves the hairy soft and not heavy. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell products! These are no exception. Very good product and price point too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my 8 year old granddaughter who plays sports and after all the sweating needs a good hair deodorizer. This product works beautifully and the lavender smell lasts fresh for several days.</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t like the smell and for me personally did not provide enough moisture.</li>
    <li> I am compering it to tea tree shampoo by Paul Mitchell, which I got as a gift a while back, and I LOVED IT. However, this one was ok, I didn&#x27;t really like it and won&#x27;t buy it again. By the time I realized it wasn&#x27;t the tea tree shampoo it was too late to return so i kept it. The conditioner is amazing, but the shampoo is not, and im the type of person that doesn&#x27;t use conditioner every time i was my hair. I won&#x27;t buy again this product, but thats me.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable price for great oroducts. Great scent, not overbearing, completely satisfied. Purchased the lemon scent also. Highly recommend this product. Again, You won&#x27;t find this product at any retail store for the price.</li>
    <li> Was able to save almost $20 plus the cost of gas. Will buy in quantity again.</li>
    <li> I bought the smaller size at a local salon and my wife loves the smell and how it makes her hair feel so I thought I would get the larger size.  The outside of the box was perfect. When I opened it I found both bottles in the carrier with a sealed bag over them and both pump tops had a sticky strap across them keeping the pump top down. I open the bag and found shampoo and conditioner all over the inside of the bag and both pump tops are broken. The product seems the same as what I bought locally. Amazon was Great. They don’t accept returns of this product but refunded my purchase. Guess I will only be buying locally in the future.</li>
    <li> The packaging was perfect! When I have ordered this product from other places in the past it has shown up with broken pumps, but this time they got it right and I have new pumps for the first time in 2 years!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner.  Complete mistake.  This shampoo and conditioner had a horrible chemical smell.  Unfortunately I am unable to return it so it will be going in the trash.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless you want to smell like cleaning product with a hint of freshly mowed grass.</li>
    <li> I got this product ahead of scheduled date, very nice. I love this product, I bought a sample from my hairdresser and I fell in love with it. I am looking forward to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Smells like dusty spice</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner!  I love the scent.  It washes clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy build-up like other products.  This is a great price for Paul Mitchell.</li>
    <li> Its the BEST! I have natural curly hair (black girl) and  it makes my hair soft!</li>
    <li> The shipping was a little expensive, but totally worth it. Came immediately after I order it, and the shampoo and conditioner themselves are totally awesome. Would recommend to everyone who is considering Paul Mitchell Tea Tree.</li>
    <li> Great. no build up and the smell stays forever. buy it! you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> love it! love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last long time</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. keeps hair clean and smelling newly washed. shampoo and conditioner are hydrating and nourishing. salon fresh clean hair</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling shampoo and conditioner that I can think of. My girlfriend has tried several other brands and this one just works best for her hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of these products. Took a little while to figure how to get the \\&quot;locks\\&quot; off to make them functional but once I found a knife (since my fingernails weren&#x27;t strong enough) I was in business.</li>
    <li> This was not at all tingly to the scalp as described.  Also the conditioner pump was broken when received but no returns.</li>
    <li> My husband loved the fragrance and the composition until he started growing out his hair. Once his hair got to be more than  jaw length, I noticed that there was a lot of breakage and it felt like straw. He started using my Pureology and now his hair is Fabio-lous :)</li>
    <li> The shampoo for which I paid the most and the shampoo which gave me the most hair fall!&lt;br /&gt;Bad hair day everytime I use it and so much hair fall that my forehead seems almost bald.&lt;br /&gt;Bad shampoo recommended by paul mitchell school!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> This shampoo saved my hair when my scalp was really dry. After one use, my hair was much softer and my scalp was no longer dry or itchy. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is complete garbage. You have to use a ton it get it to detangle. There are much better products out there for conditioner, the shampoo on the other hand was great and smelled amazing.</li>
    <li> Made my hair super dry. It&#x27;s the fake stuff. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Bought two and need to buy more good price</li>
    <li> More lavender than I expected.</li>
    <li> Soft, not too soft and not sticky with a silky feel. Thank you. Marcia</li>
    <li> This is usually my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  However I feel that the shampoo in which I have brought for years appear to be watered down and thin in the usual quality that I am used to using in my hair.  I am not too sure however Amazon got this crop from a less than trustworthy company and should look into this.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best of the tea tree oil collection from Paul Mitchell. The scent is divine and my hair is tangibly softer after using. A must have.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on advice from my hair dresser/friend...I love it and will not ever use anything else.  Such a great buy on here too!</li>
    <li> As I am getting older, my once oily hair is getting dry.  This product keeps my hair shiny and soft and has a nice scent.  I would highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> in my opinion this is the best. I love the lavender/minty smell &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive scalps &amp; for living in a very dry climate.</li>
    <li> This product does wonders for my hair. Before trying this shampoo and conditioner I was a $5.00 a bottle guy. Just bought pantene or whatever but now I&#x27;m hooked! I don&#x27;t think I can go back. My hair feels very clean and soft. I am a frequent sauna user and the heat really messes up my hair but this product has helped 100 fold! Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t smell too girly. Love it.</li>
    <li> packaging was less than stellar.  Before shipping item, someone put enough tape on the pumps/top of bottles that it took me nearly a half hour of constant work to get it all of.....I&#x27;m assuming they thought this would keep the contents from leaking out.....wrong.....it oozed out plenty and just added to the mess I had to clean up.....most unnecessary/unappreciated mess......next, neither of the pumps work, they&#x27;re cracked; doubly :-(......I&#x27;m thinking they cracked because they were shipped in a thin envelope and the mail system just tossed them around; a box would have been more secure/cushioned and perhaps have prevented items from cracking. Having shared that about the shipper/seller.....the product itself in indeed wonderful; simply amazing.  Leaves scalp feeling clean/tingly/invigorating; the smell of lavender is yummy.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. Personally, I dont like the lavender smell, but I should have known that before I bought it. The conditioner makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> I have dry itchy skin on my scalp, but not dandruff.  I got this hoping the mint would help.  It does seem to help and the conditioner makes my hair feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> this has helped sooth my dry scalp and moisturize my hair and it really smells awesome - (I need 4 more words)</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever. Lovely smell, very calming. Best conditioner</li>
    <li> Delivery wasn&#x27;t on time. When I opened the back both bottles top were loose and shampoo and conditioner leaked out.</li>
    <li> I kept smelling this old pachouli smell, couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was until I realized it was my daughters hair. This shampoo stinks, and I find myself using DETANGLER. It just makes your hair a knott, pachouli old people mess. I hate it.</li>
    <li> There was no way to open these pumps!  I cannot believe how much time I have wasted just trying to get the pump to work.  Finally they each broke after being twisted and pulled on.  These bottles are too big to pour from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this shampoo for years and have loved it.  As for the comments that it might not be the real thing I cannot say because by the time I get it on my head I am p&#x27;ed off at how much I spilled trying to pour from the big bottle with soapy hands and have not been able to enjoy the relaxing scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome for itchy scalp!  I can go 2 days without washing with this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is not a good combo for curly hair. It really dried out my curls and left my hair frizzy. But. The smell is really nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because my hair was breaking. It&#x27;s great stuff! It did arrive damaged but the vendor replaced it FAST and after using the shampoo and conditioner my hair is softer, stronger and smells wonderful! I highly recommed to anyone who wants soft, fragrant hair.</li>
    <li> Body and a lovely scent that lasts all day! I love the way my hair looks and feels after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo / conditioner for about two years and I love it.  My hair had dried out a bit from coloring and I needed to make a change.  My stylist recommended this product and I have been hooked ever since.</li>
    <li> I love this product set!! It smells great and it leaves my hair smelling nice all day. The only problem is that the conditioner spilled over a bit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love what this has done for my damaged hair. After dying and bleaching all Fall, this product has made my hair feel soft and nice again--unlike my old shampoo which left my hair feeling brittle. It smells nice, makes me feel good, leave hair silky, and makes my scalp feel nice as well.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING.. makes me wanna spend hours in the shower! Also leaves my hair silky smooth. My man even likes to use it!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, smells great, makes your hair light and clean.  The seller charges about $20 less than the salons in our area. The conditioner pump top arrived cracked, a little bit oozing out, and unusable. Luckily, I just switched the pump from the bottle that just finished or I would have been sol. A little better packing next time, I hope.</li>
    <li> I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner, but I ended up returning the shampoo after a few uses. I really enjoyed the scent of both of these products, so it was hard for me to part with the shampoo because of that. Nonetheless, the shampoo made my hair dry, although it made my hair feel manageable and somewhat shiny. With the dryness came the \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot;/frizzy look, and I felt that an expensive shampoo like this one should not be lacking in such a big way. Lastly, this shampoo contains dimethicone (so does the conditioner, but it&#x27;s not as concerning in a conditioner), and this silicone is known to coat the hair making it look healthy/shiny/etc for the first few uses, but after a while the hair becomes dry and starved of moisture. I believe that is what was happening to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the conditioner, it returns some of the moisture that the shampoo takes out, and I&#x27;m now using it along with American Crew&#x27;s Moisturizing Shampoo, which also has a great scent but doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry. I can actually feel the conditioner making a difference, and that&#x27;s mainly the reason why I kept it. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a life-changing product, but it&#x27;s better than a lot of other cheap drugstore (even salon) conditioners. I&#x27;ll keep using it until the bottle runs out, but I might consider changing to something else.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try after running out of my Pureology shampoo/conditioner.  I&#x27;m glad to say that I made a good decision.  It smells wonderful, cleans well, and conditions beautifully.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she is 6 with super fine but thick hair).  She loves the smell and tangles are almost non-existent.  I don&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;scalp tingle&amp;#34; like some people do but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from loving this stuff.</li>
    <li> these are good quality....very nice fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;and you make your hair soft...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you get them...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied about them...</li>
    <li> I love this shamp/cond set its awesome for hair and skin!! But when I received it the conditioner was cracked and leaked out all over both bottles and the box it was in!</li>
    <li> Not the original shampoo. No cooling effect. Ineffective version of the original shampoo with the same scent. Amazon should stop selling these shampoos.</li>
    <li> i have psorias and it has relieved all scales and itching and my scalp and hair feels wonderful.  I will forever. Love it</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it!  Works very well for her dry scalp.</li>
    <li> This makes my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite! This stuff not only is tingly and smelly great but also tames my wooly, Italian mop!!</li>
    <li> Even though it costs a fortune, I will never use any other shampoo.  It has cured all my itchy scalp problems and my dermatologist said this is the best thing I can use.  I also get tons of compliments on my hair because it looks so shiny and healthy.  The smell is AMAZING and I smell my own hair all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few times I&#x27;ve run out of this shampoo and bought some other brand to use for a few days.  My scalp felt like it was on fire and broke out with nasty bumps and my hair was greasy and frizzy.  After getting more Paul Mitchell shampoo everything cleared up within 3 days.</li>
    <li> It is okay.  The smell is very good, but sometimes the conditioner smell is a little bit strong until you wash it out.  This is a very cleansing shampoo, so I would imagine most people will need to condition their hair each time.  For me the conditioner was a little too much; kind of took the life out of my hair.  I have very naturally curly hair and most conditioners do not work for me anyway.  This is probably a good product as most Paul Mitchell products are very good; but I probably will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but I think it has dried out my hair over time. Definitely like the tingly feeling it gives my scalp though, and it does smell great!</li>
    <li> only shampoo and conditioner i&#x27;ve used for 5 years. i love it.</li>
    <li> Product was great. I really liked the larger bottles because they came with the pump for easy use but when I received my bottles in mail the pumps did not work at all. They were not broken during shipment, it looks like the company mailed them to me that way. Very disappointing! Luckily I had small shampoo bottles left over to transfer the new shampoo/conditioner into. I do not believe I will be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on 1/15/2014 and it&#x27;s the end of March and I still have half left. The way it was packaged caused one of them to spill but it wasn&#x27;t much. I think they should be more careful and take into consideration that the package is going to go through a few bumps but the product is wonderful and I have no complaints on what came in the bottles.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner of all time.  I&#x27;ve used many types, high end, kerastase to drugstore brand and I can&#x27;t get over how my hair feels after using this product let alone how wonderful it smells.  Natural and clean.</li>
    <li> Fells so good. My hair is clean for couple more days. I usually shampoo every other day but now every two days. No more achy in my scalp. When I Blow dry my hair is very soft, smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Keeps my hair very silky and smooth.  Smells and feels great on my head.  Big bottles will last forever.</li>
    <li> I love my product.. Will refer to my friends.. Will give a 10 star.. Do not take much to lather up</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite hair care for dry scalp. It moisturizes and leaves hair shiny. The mint cools the scalp and the lavender cleans, recommended by my hair dresser for leaving no residue. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner! The smell is amazing and my scalp and hair have never felt better! The scent is just strong enough to get a hint of it throughout the day for a quick reprieve from the day. My daughter and husband have now started using it.</li>
    <li> Love it for my very straight hair. Smooth, healthy looking and feeling.</li>
    <li> Good product but the shippers didn&#x27;t package the product correctly. When I got it, both bottles where busted open and i lost about 1/4 of the product. I emailed to ask for a replacement or refund but no one contacted me back. The product worked good, but I definitely did not get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Purchased because of the great reviews, and it did make my hair silky, which I enjoyed.  However, my hair absorbs scents and that is usually a plus...as in &#x27;gee, your hair smells terrific!&#x27;  However, in order for my hair to smell terrific, the shampoo/conditionair needs to smell terrific.  This smells like &#x27;old lady perfume&#x27; or &#x27;1960 hippie&#x27; as my coworkers told me.  Not pleasant.  Trouble is, I HATE the smell and everywhere I go, there I am so I can&#x27;t get away from it.  I shampooed my hair 3 hours ago and now I&#x27;m at work and I&#x27;m nauseous from the smell.  CanNOT wait to go home and reshampoo!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I started getting really bad dandruff and this worked clearing that up right after the first use.  Love it and will never go back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my son in law.  When he saw the box under the tree, he could not imagine what it could be.  He guessed and guessed, but was never even close.  When he opened it, he was so surprised, happily I might add.  He loves these products.</li>
    <li> really good product for dry hair. awesome smell.  after a shower, hair feels really clean and healthy.  shampoo washes thoroughly and conditioner provides really good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Quick, easy and on time. No hassle packaging. Wonderful daily use Paul Mitchell hair product. My hair smells amazing all day long.</li>
    <li> great stuff helped my psoriasis of the scalp very much wont use another shampoo</li>
    <li> The shampoo bottle was not full due to it leaking all over the box. Also, the pump is broken and useless.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tea Tree products for @ 5 years.  I bought them at my hairdresser.  when she quit selling the product I bought thru Amazon.  It is a quality shampoo that I really like.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for the most part. I wish I could find something that smells as good and is as gentle but organic/paraben/synthetic free. I try to be conscious about what I put into my body. This is definitely one I limit my use of, because of it&#x27;s awful chemical properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This edition is incredibly hard to find but it works so well for dry scalp!&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the chemicals, then you&#x27;ll probably like it for itchy, dry, scalp and brittle hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good to use every day, doesn&#x27;t build up has a great sent.  If you have dry hair give this one a try to get some moisture back in.</li>
    <li> liked the product had to downsize into other hand pumps, product works geat but would probably suit a man than a women</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews online and decided I would love this product. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not as amazing as I thought it would be. It smells stronger than I would like and the sent last a long time. If you get overwhelmed by smell I would not recommend this for you!</li>
    <li> I love the mint shampoo so I wanted to try the lavender mint and I love it.  It leaves my color treated hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair strong and shine. Smells awesome too. I want to keep using this line.</li>
    <li> Besides the shipment arrived on time, when I got the shipment the hair conditioner was a little bit open so about 10 ml were spread around the box. Also, I did not like the fragance.</li>
    <li> Referred by a local salon, i was very glad i purchased this, great products, little expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on here or why there are such discrepancies between the reviews but recently I received this product from Beena Beauty Holding Inc.  I was expecting to experience a minty tingle on my scalp as I have with the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product I&#x27;ve used before.  Unfortunately the shampoo went on just like any generic shampoo except with a very strong and synthetic lavender (and to me unpleasant) odor.  This definitely doesn&#x27;t jive with the majority of the reviews and I&#x27;m wondering if Amazon hasn&#x27;t mixed all the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product reviews together.  The strong synthetic lavender scent lingers for a very long time.  I won&#x27;t be able to use this product due to the strong odor.  I plan on looking into this to see if I can get to the bottom of it.  Hopefully I can return these two bottles.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh smell of this shampoo and conditioner.  I generally like the more natural &amp; fresh-smelling products, versus the flowery &amp; fruity stuff.  The whole bathroom smells like a spa after using these products.  My hair feels great afterwards too.  I also love the fact that Paul Mitchell does not test or endorse testing on animals.  The company also contributes to environmental causes.  It&#x27;s nice to use products from a company that aligns with my values.</li>
    <li> Good product. Pump broken on delivery.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for dry scalps especially in the winter!  It smells wonderful!  I would highly recommend it for anyone that has problems with dry hair.</li>
    <li> This smells like an upscale spa with essential oils. I have fine hair, but a TON of it, and it is very long. I tend to have to wash my hair  every day because of oil, but am also prone to itchy scalp and occasionally dermatitis. This shampoo works great for my oily combination hair on a daily basis. My scalp feels clean and my ends are soft, moisturized, and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have bought this several times and will continue to.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only shampoo/conditioner that works and also makes my hair smell noticeably amazing- I get questions constantly about the shampoo/conditioner I use, and my hair looks great as well.</li>
    <li> love the way the shampoo and conditioner smell. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I used this product a few years back and LOVED it. Keeps hair extremely moisturized which I personally need for my thin brittle hair. This product is great. I never buy on amazon because I am skeptical about getting the “real” product. I will say that I purchased this thinking I was going to get 2 bottles the pair (shampoo and conditioner) at 33.8 oz each , instead I received the shampoo at 33.8 oz, and the conditioner I received 3, 10.14 oz which adds up to 30.42 oz. CHEATING ME OUT of 3.38 oz which in my eyes is a lot. I was cautious about buying from this seller because of the good reviews and the bad reviews and wanted to buy at an actual beauty store but there was a big price difference. I should have bought in the store because after reading reviews people are saying it was watered down. I decided to keep the product because I don’t want to deal with the hassle of returning and refunding. The product seems to be legit and my hair feels great but I am upset that I got 3 smaller bottles instead of the larger size. Who does that? Still over all a good product though.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these hair care products, and they make my hair so soft and tame my frizzies. Great products!</li>
    <li> Love the Paul Mitchel Lavender Mint Moisturizing scent and size.</li>
    <li> lavender mint scent is great and really leaves my hair conditioned and silky without being oily at all. the size is perfect too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SHAMPOO I USED THE SHAMPOO TO CLEAN MY FACE TOO AND USED THE LEAVE IN GAVE MY FACE A GLOW....</li>
    <li> Family loves the product. Key issue is consistent with other feedback: the product arrived with insufficient packaging and leaking inside the plastic overwrap. This was disappointing and could easily be addressed with proper packaging. Outside of this apparently frequent issue, we love the product.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and I do dye it from time to time, blow dry and flat iron often. My hair is so smooth, soft and luscious that I don&#x27;t ever want to buy any other shampoo. Everything else seems to make my hair dry and unhappy. The tea tree kind also tingles and feels so good on my scalp. I have dry skin when the seasons change and it helps calm the dandriff.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair feel soft and silky and smell amazing! Great priced. Dumping all other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> My salon uses this product, so I ordered them after coming home from a haircut. I kept reading that low marks were given because it didn&#x27;t tingle, but honestly, that would freak me out! Overall, the smell is great, it doesn&#x27;t dry (or moisturize) but one thing I&#x27;ve noticed over all other products is that the smell stays with you all day long. Every day the wind blows by you, everyone in the room will be knowing that you smell good!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It makes my hair super soft and it smells like heaven. However, the pump that came with the bottle was broken when it arrived so its difficult for me to get the proper amount of shampoo out of the bottle when I need to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> After a replacement pump was shipped to me the product was perfect</li>
    <li> Love this product, my husband had horrible dry scalp this is the only product that works. Instead of building up it truly cleanses the scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets one for me and one for my daughters shower we all have different hair types and it works great for all of us this is the best our hair has looked and smelled</li>
    <li> There are two features regarding this shampoo and conditioner duo, that make me love it!  The scent is lovely and the product leave your hair clean and undamaged.  The conditioner works as a de-tangler also...love them!!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately both pumps arrived broken (smashed).  Fortunately, I still had old ones of the same product and could swap them out.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the shampoo and conditioner very much.</li>
    <li> Great Product for dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos and after mentioning itchy scalp to my professional hair stylist she recommended this. I was extremely relieved when I tried it, it didn&#x27;t make my scalp dry it itchy at all. It also left my hair very well conditioned, felt great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this like some shampoos. Just use a dime sized drop of this for most short hair so in doing so these bottles will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo out there and it changed my hair for the better.  I always have my stylist tell me my hair is in such great condition.  This stuff smells wonderful and makes your hair feel even better.  It&#x27;s like magic.  If unicorns were going to use shampoo and conditoner this is what they would use on their magical manes.</li>
    <li> The paul mitchell lavender mint moisturizing products lathers one&#x27;s hair smoothly and leaves a good scent.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the shampoo bottle was open and leaked. It was quite messy.  This happened to my Oregon order. I haven&#x27;t checked my order to Los Angeles yet. Hopefully the same didn&#x27;t happen to that order.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I should have waited to go to my local hair place and picked up the Paul Mitchell Tee Tree stuff I really like. Not overly impressed with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Quality is very nice.My hairdresser had advised me to try several shampoos and not stick to the same product all the time.</li>
    <li> I am African-American and I love just about all Paul Mitchell&#x27;s products. I have been using them for many years. I purchased this set just to try something different. My daughter who is in college absolutely fell in love after the first use. It gives our hair so much body and shine. These products are definitely a permanent part of my hair ritual.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; leaves my hair feeling super smooth &amp; looking healthy &amp; shiny! Definitely my new go-to product &amp; highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product and it makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> Was using sulfate free products but was a sucker for the fragrance of this product.  The shampoo does a great job cleansing hair and scalp and the conditioner provides a lot of moisture and shine.</li>
    <li> I have always loved lavender and mint in my shampoos and this PM line is fantastic. I moved to California recently and my scalp was on fire from the water here. Plus it was impossible to comb out my hair after a shower. After trying this shampoo and conditioner for a week I no longer have either of those problems. It&#x27;s also sulphate free which is great.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It is amazing! I lost my hair because of chemotherapy (Ladies, get a mammogram - I was diagnosed at the age of 40 with no lump detected). After losing my hair, every strand of my hair that grew back was precious to me. So, the shampoo and conditioner that I used had to be the best! Tea Green shampoo and conditioner excelled my expectations! My hair grew back curly (my hair use to be straight) and I never had issues with frizz. Now my hair is growing back straight and it is still soft and silky! The smell of lavender is heaven! I feel like I just stepped out of a spa! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the fresh clean smell this leaves in my hair!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND IS CHEAP AT AMAZON</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I found I can use for my problem scalp!</li>
    <li> Wow! Just used it. My hair feels great, soft, shiny, manageable. Best hair care products I have purchased outside the salon. Super pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously the most wonderful shampoo and conditioner ever.  It smells so amazing, definitely a de-stresser after a long day at work.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it if you love having super soft and great smelling hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before, my mom bought it for me to try an I had to have more this summer! I love the sent an it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in my hair at all.. And it&#x27;s so refreshing after a long hot day.. It&#x27;s my summer shampoo and conditioner must have &lt;3 after ordering it , it came fast and well packaged :) worth every penny</li>
    <li> i started using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner and i love the smell and the tingling feel. This combo doesnt smell as good and it doesn&#x27;t have the tingling.&lt;br /&gt;I was talking to my wife and we decided to go back to the Tea Tree after this combo ran out but in a couple of weeks we started to feel our hair different. now its smoothier, and we didn&#x27;t get this result with the Tea Tree.&lt;br /&gt;We´re going to stick with the Lavender Mint because we´ve seen better results.</li>
    <li> This 1 Liter Duo is $36 at Ulta.  The pump was completely broken off during shipping so I have to tip a 1 liter bottle upside down with no cap in order to pour shampoo.  For $60 this is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Wow!! Absolutely fantastic smell, leaves my hair soft and makes my scalp feel SO much better. Very slight leakage during shipping but for the price, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not authentic. I use this shampoo all the time and had some to compare to side by side: consistency and aroma very different. Returned. Funny thing is my local salon is having a liter sale and I can get both for $42, so it all works out.</li>
    <li> Took my hair a little bit to get used to it, but now my hair is soft and it&#x27;s one of the only shampoos that my hair will still stay soft with after a bottle! My hair usually goes through a bottle of shampoo and conditioner being soft then as soon as I start the second bottle my hair gets yucky again. I straighten my hair everyday so even though my ends are a little damaged this shampoo makes the body of my hair really soft- I love it!</li>
    <li> So initially I had a 1 star review for the product because it had some defects. I purchased it a while ago and didn&#x27;t use it until I finished a different shampoo &amp; conditioner I was initially using. So knowing the whole 30 days return policy I simply wrote a bad review saying that this wasn&#x27;t a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Upon writing my review the seller contacted me in less than an hour telling me that he/she is willing to assist me in making the purchase a better experience for me. In less than 30 minutes I had all the problems settled with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER gotten any customer service better than from this store and now, I am glad that I made the purchase through this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY EXPERIENCE SO COMFORTABLE BEAUTY FOR LESS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, the product itself was not bad. My friend really likes the smell of it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about personal preference, but I hate it when shampoos smell too strong, this has a gentle yet refreshing type of smell that really wakes me up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets really dry very easily and I do have to say this shampoo dried up my hair a little, but the conditioner does help with making my hair smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I would say if you have a drier hair leave this for summer time!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re happy with the big bottles of shampoo and conditioner.  Pumps up top provide a good amount of product.  No need to keep pumping for product like on the small bottles.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to the lavender mint scent. Instead, it left my hair with an overpowering medicinal smell, a scent very similar to moth balls that lasted all day. Amazon was helpful in issuing a full refund for the product. Would highly NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> one should always never purchase something the same day they place in their cart and this item was something I should have waited on. The shampoo/conditioner worked more or less but was not more radiant than simple shampoo. Always wait before buying things or you will get buyers&#x27; remorse.</li>
    <li> wife loved the price for the two bottles</li>
    <li> It is ok, but too much shampoo.  I like to change daily, but that would cost more.</li>
    <li> I love the product. The only negative thing I have to say is one of the bottles arrived damaged. The pump was broken and shampoon was leaking. Also I had to replace the pump with one of the old pumps from a previous bottle. Luckily it fit. The shampoo and conditioner work great.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves hair shiny and smooth.  I use it all over now and my skin is softer than ever.</li>
    <li> Love the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
    <li> No tingling feeling on scalp. Disappointed.  Smells lovely though.</li>
    <li> This is the third set of bottles I have gone threw. I love the smell. I always get complements on how my hair smells. Do wish the smell lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  The only thing is that one of the bottle arrived with a broken pump that made it incredibly difficult to get any conditioner out.  Switched pumps with a different shampoo brand we had in the closet.</li>
    <li> Receive my shampoo and conditioner today, I like it however the shampoo was leaking and the pump is broken?</li>
    <li> The shampoo bottle lid was loose and a large amount dripped out of the bottle in the packaging</li>
    <li> Good but I like the tea tree better.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy into the hype of purchasing shampoo and conditioner&#x27;s like this but after my hairdresser used this on me, I fell in love. Goodbye to my $2 bottles of fruity shampoo and conditioner&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually the cheaper shampoo/conditioners leave my hair feeling very oily and heavy by the end of the night (I shower in the morning) but this one kept my hair clean all day and night! The scent of both is actually what drove me to finally buying this before I walked out of the place. They don&#x27;t smell overly floral but, in my opinion, does smell a bit more masculine than most might prefer. Personally, I hate smelling like a rose bush and loathe perfumes on or around me as well, so this was a welcome change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice, check your local beauty supply stores and even SuperCuts for this. You can actually go in and smell it before you buy it if you&#x27;re afraid of what some of the more negative reviewers have said about the scent. I paid $40 for the set but came here to see if amazon had it for less.</li>
    <li> Ok for years I never believed in spending more money on shampoo and conditioner the way I splurged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this since January of 2012 and absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and also long.  My husband has very curly hair and between the two of us we take 6 months to use the large bottles; where with cheap shampoo it was about a month or two for the same bottle size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair- my hair has never felt better, much more managable.  I hate to dry my hair so I let it dry naturally and this doesn&#x27;t friz or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE, I will never go back to the cheapo depo stuff!</li>
    <li> I was having a really hard time with dry hair, and my stylist suggested using this product. I love it! ! I will continue to buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, long, straight and pretty hair and this stuff works well for my oil! Beautiful hair comes at a price and my price is oil. The big L advantage is great but I get tired with having so much of it. It did last me almost a whole year but I am a shampoo and conditioner obsessed person so it made it hard to have for so long.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I used to be a Wen girl, but Wen dries my hair out. I think it doesn&#x27;t protect it from the elements  that well. This product is pricey...but I love it, my husband does too. It is very soothing to your scalp, and my hair is sosoft, managable, and shiny afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love the product..But absolutely horrible packaging. Horrible protection inside the box. Holes in the box. When opened I found the shampoo bottle tops had cracked and shampoo was all over the box and seeping through to the outside. Dissapointed that most of the product was spilled out into the box.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels on my scalp (mildly tingly) and how soft my hair is (Paul mitchel products make your hair soft no matter the kind) I like the smell but its a bit strong and lingers a long time. The smell of mint and lavender combined creates a masculine smell. Great on my hubby, a little weird on me. The first night I used this I already had a headache and the smell made it worse, so don&#x27;t use if you already have a headache. I wash every other day and the smell by wash day is wonderful, hair still smells great. Hubby has oily pimply scalp, it works great for him. I have dry flaky scalp and it works great for me, but then, tea tree is sort of a magic skin fixer. Helps bug bites, itchiness, dryness, and balances Olivier skin and soothes breakouts. Great product overall, just the scent could be milder.</li>
