      <li>I was thrilled when Jergen&#x27;s started making the &amp;#34;no odor&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>In all honestly.</li>
      <li>Best price anywhere by far!</li>
      <li>By far the best yet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally very fair skinned, but the fair to medium didn&#x27;t have enough of a noticeable color change for me.</li>
      <li>WITH NO ODOR&amp;#34; on it...which is very important.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really fabulous!</li>
      <li>I have a medium skin tone and noticed that my skin was a lot more tan within 3 days of once a day usage.</li>
      <li>I love this and use it on my legs every day.  </li>
      <li>but now I check with Jergens to make sure</li>
      <li>this helps :-)</li>
      <li>(The medium is more orange</li>
      <li>Anyways, I love this self tanner</li>
      <li>I love the color it gives you</li>
      <li>and so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>

      <li>Now I&#x27;m much more confident when I&#x27;m at the beach :)</li>
      <li>Yeah, people complain about you having a greater risk of cancer.</li>
      <li>Although most of you like this product.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>Ok, so I haven&#x27;t worn shorts in um... about 2 years</li>
      <li>The smell is quite lovely.</li>
      <li>I always get compliments on my sexy beach like tan.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many self-tanners and this is one of my favorite.</li>
      <li>I would recommend that most people should probably get the medium/deep color because I couldn&#x27;t imagine the lighter lotion having any effect after seeing the amount of color I&#x27;ve gotten from the medium/deep.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It smells a lot better than most gradual</li>
      <li>I noticed even more that I was getting tanner</li>
      <li>but i do enjoy having a nice tan without the costs of tanning booths.</li>
      <li>more pasty-face in the winter.  </li>
      <li>Now the hassle of having to return, etc., buy more, but probably not from this seller.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin looking way more moisturized and supple</li>
      <li>and I love</li>
      <li>love this product and have recommended it to my friends who also like it.</li>
      <li>Thankfully Amazon sent me a postage free return label and refunded my money immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Jergens for not having a &#x27;Use By&#x27; date on their product!</li>
      <li>(And colour also makes muscles look more defined.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is great, and it works really well.</li>
      <li>It just comes off your face faster, since we use so many products on our face a day.</li>
      <li>if you have an event to go to, make sure you start applying well in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just so I can get a better tan.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping. Such a great deal for 3. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jergens Natural Glow on and off for several years now and found that it&#x27;s the best gradual tanning lotion on the market (even including the more expensive brands). I&#x27;ll list the pros and cons of this product as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Works quick. I have a medium skin tone and noticed that my skin was a lot more tan within 3 days of once a day usage. So, if you have a special event to attend or just want a quick tan without having to spray tan yourself (yuck), this will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not look orange. Unless one is using the wrong product (i.e. - medium to tan for fair skin), this will not turn the skin Doritos orange. It provides the look of a natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells relatively good. Some people HATE the scent of this lotion because it reminds them of bug spray, and the no-odor formula smells almost exactly like the original formula, but I find the scent of this product to be quite nice. It smells a lot better than most gradual tanners.&lt;br /&gt;- Applies evenly. As long as you are using the product correctly and applying an even amount on the skin, the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; should develop evenly and not streaky. Make certain to not use too much product on the crevices of the body, or on the kneecaps or elbows, because it will leave residue that looks like dirt or caked-on makeup on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- One tube does not last very long. It seems like a lot of product is in the tube, but a lot of lotion is required to cover the entire body and the tube only lasts a couple of weeks at best. It&#x27;s not the most expensive product in the world, but if one is looking to use this year round as a daily lotion, the cost will add up.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves residue around the cuticles. Regardless of how much one washes their hands after using this product, a buildup of product will appear around the cuticles. Acetone polish remover should take it off.&lt;br /&gt;- This has micro glitter in it. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but I wish Jergens would make this product without the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.roduct without the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It provides moisturizer but I do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Keep a nice glow through winter</li>
    <li> This tanning cream works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> the lotion really does give you a nice natural looking tan, but don&#x27;t expect results immediately.  it takes about a week&#x27;s worth of applications to start noticing a tan, so if you have an event to go to, make sure you start applying well in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that it is very strong smelling and i&#x27;m not partial to the scent.  i don&#x27;t really want to smell like my lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, make sure you apply it all over, including your feet, or else you will look like you have a horrible sock tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in terms of it making you \\&quot;firmer.\\&quot; i have not really noticed a difference at all.</li>
    <li> I think this is the cheapest way to get yourself looking a sparkling bronze. I was completely pale and really wanted to get my skin a little tanner like all my other fellow human beings during the summer. Since my job pretty much keeps me indoors, all the live long day, I opted for this cheap alternative. Just follow the products instructions. Apply it daily, I usually did after a shower, and slowly your skin gets darker. It DOES however rub off onto your clothing. It did not seem to stain too much from rubbing off (came off after a couple of spins int he washing machine), but occasionally I did spill some of it on sheets and towels, in large quantities and it DID seem to stain those. Another thing you have to watch out for is that you don&#x27;t want to put too much on your elbows or knees, it gets really saturated there and you end up with orangy knees and elbows compared to the rest of your body. But yeah!! I used up the whole bottle and I think it did an awesome job. Highly recommend this, if you are careful in applying it evenly, to a nice bronzed look without going into the sun :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that Jergens was changing the Natural Glow line around a little bit, and I worried because the Natural Glow Firming in Dark is the only Natural Glow lotion I like. I&#x27;ve been buying it locally since it first came out. I noticed they changed it to Medium-Tan (this is what this is and what I got even though it says Medium in the description).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, the only thing that has changed is the scent. It is a little lighter. That may be because this is Med.-Tan instead of Dark so there is less scent required to cover the DHA smell. I still get the same great results, and this deal allowed me to stock up on a product I&#x27;m going to be using a lot this spring/summer. I use it on my face and neck as those don&#x27;t tan as well as the rest of me (which tans dark and quickly), and I want to protect those areas with high SPF, anyway.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I was excited to finally use a product that didn&#x27;t look artifical.  Within 2 weeks my family was making comments that my legs (the area I was using it) looked yellow like I had liver disease.  Needless to say, I stopped using the product and threw the 3 bottles that came in my order away.</li>
    <li> The picture clearly shows this is the &amp;#34;no odor&amp;#34; tanner/lotion (sticker on tube, top left corner).  I have purchased this product in the past before the &amp;#34;no odor&amp;#34; formula came out.  After applying the old formula, I attended a concert and a friend said to our group, &amp;#34;Who smells like bug spray?&amp;#34;  LOL.  Not so funny at the time as it was me with the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; Jergens on!  I was thrilled when Jergen&#x27;s started making the &amp;#34;no odor&amp;#34; formula.  This is a great no streak self tanner without an orange color.  Loved that I could get three tubes for less than $20.00 but I did NOT order the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; type (based on the picture I viewed.  The product description did not specify either formula, so wouldn&#x27;t a common sense view be that what you see is what you get?  Apparently NOT.  I would have NEVER ordered the product if it was the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; version.  Don&#x27;t know if it was a packaging/shipping goof or the seller is actually selling the wrong product, but in either case, NOT GOOD.  Now the hassle of having to return, etc., buy more, but probably not from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love that everyone is coming out with self tanning lotions now as opposed to those god awful streaky mousses or faulty sprays. This lotion does not streak at all and I love it&#x27;s subtle glow. It doesn&#x27;t suddenly turn bronze in a couple hours, and then orange the next day, and it certainly does not stain my clothes or sheets! However, I make sure to sleep in pants &amp; long sleeves because I don&#x27;t like the smell and I don&#x27;t want the smell to rub off on my bed sheets--yuck! So far, the smell is my only complaint. You can&#x27;t tell by smelling the lotion itself, but a few minutes after you apply the lotion, there&#x27;s that nasty typical self-tanner odor lingering on everything you touch. Blech. I&#x27;m going to try Dove Energy Glow instead because I hear it smells magnificent! I hope they&#x27;re right.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local supermarket, to help myself tan. I have never used any products like this, but I doubt I will use any like it again. The smell of this product is so horrible that it made me nauseous, and consequently it made me sick. I had to shower again to get smell off me! The product is also greasy, and does not dry well.</li>
    <li> I love this product but unfortunately when I received it, there was lotion all inside of the box because one of them broke. What can you do to make me happy as a customer?</li>
    <li> I love this and use it on my legs every day.  The downside is it is not waterproof and, while it does not streak, one pool dip or shower and the color is gone.  Evenly gone, but gone.  There is a smell that I wouldn&#x27;t say is suntan lotion, but definitely a lotion-y smell.  My boyfriend compared it to brown sugar, but I think it just smells uniquely like Jergens Tanning Lotion.  The firming agent is definitely there (my calves look amazing) but definitely doesn&#x27;t work for every body part/type, I&#x27;ve been using it on my arms now as well and two bottles later no difference that anyone can tell.  Still, it&#x27;s one of the best subtle tanning lotions I&#x27;ve come across, and it works great.  I just remind you to wash/wipe your hands after applying it, often I forget and between my fingers turns brownish-orange.  Not noticeable until you go to shake your boss&#x27;s hand!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Walmart, of course with some skepticism, because years ago I tried a few tanning creams and they were wiping on my clothes, that&#x27;s how bad they were...&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I was surprised to see that this cream works, is not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t wipe off... in a word \\&quot;great\\&quot;.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell, and that the smell of this cream doesn&#x27;t alter the scent of my perfumes.  My skin is pale now because I am not out on the beach (living in Florida)... I am a nurse, in a dermatology office and assist with skin cancer removals every day... it is scary...  I think this cream is the perfect option to avoid the skin cancer and to have a pretty tanned looking skin.</li>
    <li> I try to use this lotion daily because it really makes a difference in my otherwise pale complection. The smell is not strong and fades quickly, the lotion is non-greasy, and the color appears natural. The only annoying thing is that the self-tanner rubs off on the white towels or light clothing, but that is the case with any self-tanner.</li>
    <li> Best stuff winter skin, great moisture with tint.....Use once a week to keep a healthly glow</li>
    <li> The gradual color that you build with this tanning lotion does not look orange and fake. Make sure to apply it to your skin only after you have shaved anywhere you plan to do so and exfoliate really well. Also, do not under estimate putting a layer or regular lotion on rough spots like knees and elbows and ankles because I have learned the hard way that after 2-3 days dark spots will of a sudden seem to pop up. There is hardly a smell at all which I love because strongly scented self tanners kill it for me right away. I am of Nordic descent and rather fair skinned so I need all the help I can get in the are of tanning. Plus I love that it helps to firm your skin! Very addicting product especially in summer time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color for me was noticeable in 2-3 days</li>
    <li> Provides a natural tan look, does not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is not so desire-able&lt;br /&gt;Like the consistency of the product which makes it easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping Jergens will make a paraben, triethlamine free product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Mild/medium smell. Great color. Must wash your hands VERY WELL after application.</li>
    <li> im fairly cautious about sun damage to my face and body but i do enjoy having a nice tan without the costs of tanning booths. so i gave this product a try. not only do i see results within the first application after only a couple of hours but it also lasts through showering. im not a fan of the smell so what i do is i apply it at night. go to bed and in the morning i go workout and take a shower and i have the tan without the smell. or i take a shower at night (i have an unpredictable schedule) and then put the lotion on. run around naked for a a couple of minutes then hop in bed with barely any clothes on and the smell evaporates over night. its extremely cheap. lasts quite a while and it has incredible results. an amazing product. and it also allows me to be tan without damaging my skin.</li>
    <li> Alway does the job.  Will continue to use. Makes for nice tan without the sun. The new version has no scent making it a nice after shower lotion.</li>
    <li> So this is my first time trying this lotion and I&#x27;m not impressed. I have had it on my body for thirty minutes and I am STILL NOT DRY!! WTH?!</li>
    <li> This product works well and is easy to apply.  Color turned out natural looking.  HOWEVER, the smell is not so great, and my fiance was disgusted by the smell so I had to stop using it.  I also tried Nivea tanning lotion, and the smell was less offensive, but still not tolerable for daily use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pale girl, and after doing the irresponsible tanning thing in my younger years I decided something had to change. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of gradual tanning lotions (Aveeno, Olay, Nivea etc) so far this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers said they didn&#x27;t like the smell, I just bought this the other day and maybe they&#x27;ve changed the scent because I found it to be quite pleasant (definitely better than Aveeno).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always buy the Medium-Tan version even though I&#x27;m pale just so I can get a better tan. I applied this for the first time last night and am already feeling less like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST part? This  lotion doesn&#x27;t make me sweaty. I know, gross. But every other tanning lotion seems to have something in it that clogs my pores and I end up sweating in places that I never have before (i.e. my shins, weird right?). Plus Jergens dries a lot faster than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait till I&#x27;m fully &#x27;tanned&#x27;!</li>
    <li> This is the only self-tanning product that I have found that really works; and I have tried a lot!  I have very fair skin, and I don&#x27;t like my white legs in the Spring when I wear capri pants.  This looks very natural.  You do have to remember to exfoliate before using it to work its&#x27; best!  I use the sugar scrub from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I started using it with absolutely no base color. After a few applications it did give me a decent amount of color. The gradual level of color does reach a plateau so you won&#x27;t get that &#x27;just got back from the beach&#x27; tan but if you can&#x27;t or haven&#x27;t been able to get out in the sun this is a good option but definitely not a replacement for a real tan or other tanners like St. Tropez. My thinking with this lotion is that if I&#x27;m putting on lotion every day anyway I might as well use one that gives an added bonus of some color. As for the firming aspect of the lotion I really haven&#x27;t noticed anything and I&#x27;ve been using it now pretty consistently for 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have very pale skin I would recommend that most people should probably get the medium/deep color because I couldn&#x27;t imagine the lighter lotion having any effect after seeing the amount of color I&#x27;ve gotten from the medium/deep.</li>
    <li> This is false advertising!!! It clearly says it&#x27;s the new version with no odor and I just got 3 bottles of the older smelly version!!  Now I am stuck with bottles I can&#x27;t use. Very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> Got a noticeable, natural-looking tan within 2 days of using this product.  In fact, I had to stop using it daily because I was getting too dark.  Perfect for self-tanning without going over the top.  I think the smell is also less offensive than it had been in the past, and certainly less offensive than normal self-tanning products normally are.</li>
    <li> Jergens makes the best sunless tanners, and the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; is my favorite of all. Gives a gradual, natural-looking color, and it actually smells GOOD! I&#x27;m not sure if it firms, but the smell and color are worth it. Best price anywhere by far!</li>
    <li> I really like the revitalizing jergens natural glow, it takes 7 days for the full color instead of 3 like it says, but it costs a lot less than airbrush tanning.  So when I saw the firming jergens natural glow with an extra 3.5 ounces (some s\promotion), I bought it.  After 4 days of use its getting patchy which never happens with the revitalizing.  I did not need firming but it really did not have any effect with that either.  Bottom line, buy the revitalizing and skip the hassle of having to exfoliate it all off and start again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite so far. I wish there was a darker colour than this though! I tan once a week in a bed &amp; this lotion helps keep my colour up. I&#x27;m not orange at all &amp; I believe I am nice sepia colour. There is a hint of smell but it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as it used to be or compared to other self-tanners. My favorite part of this lotion is it dries quickly &amp; I&#x27;m not sticky at all. I&#x27;m able to slather myself down &amp; put on my clothes without feeling oily, sticky, &amp; nasty. I have never noticed an tanning streaks at all on dry spots or any place. Not sure if that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m going to a tanning bed or if this lotion is just pure awesome. The +firmness is pretty cool too. I&#x27;ve noticed the cellulite on the back of my thighs have almost vanished, but I&#x27;m also am on a hardcore exercise &amp; diet regime. Anyways, I love this self tanner &amp; I think I will be buying it off of Amazon for awhile. Let&#x27;s hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a tip for reducing cellulite: Take your coffee grounds from the morning (fresh is nice) &amp; mix it in with some olive oil. While you&#x27;re in the shower, take the coffee mixture &amp; massage it into the cellulite-ed area for about 5 minutes. Do this once a week. It&#x27;s coffee grounds so it&#x27;s going to get everywhere. We have strong pipes so the grounds don&#x27;t damage our plumbing. Make sure it&#x27;s safe to do that where you live or you can do it outside. Or you can you put something over the drain to collect the grounds. The caffeine helps break cellulite down while the olive oil helps penetrate your skin. It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle, but it will help reduce cellulite along with the tanning lotion. &amp; for better results, do cardio such as a spinning class. Once the excess fat is burnt, the cellulite will emerge &amp; then start melting. &amp; using these three tips will help!! (:</li>
    <li> it leaves a beautiful tan without any streaking. I love it!!! it would compliment any skin tone and looks beautiful</li>
    <li> Perfect for some color for summer</li>
    <li> I am having problems around my elbows and areas that don&#x27;t usually see the sun, but otherwise a good product.</li>
    <li> Very natural colour. I am Armenian but very pale, and yet I feel confident enough with the application of this product to buy the dark version. Highly recommend - I use it every day. Makes the booty and thighs look sleek and toned!</li>
    <li> This is the beginning of my third year using this product and up until my most recent purchase I was Jergens&#x27; biggest advocate.  I still am but now I check with Jergens to make sure the product has not expired.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Jergens Natural Glow Firming &amp; Daily Moisturizer Medimum to Tan (3 pack).  I was already tan this summer from using the product.  Upon arrival of my order from Amazon I started using the Jergens daily. But instead of maintaining my tan I was becoming more pale in color, each day. After 2 weeks I had absolutely no color at all. I called Jergens (1-800-742-8798) &amp; asked if they had changed their formula because it was no longer working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was asked for the UPC code on the tube &amp; the code at the very top of the tube, where the tube is sealed. As it turned out, the product I purchased was packaged in 2010!  Jergens recommends that the product be used within one year of packaging. However, the toner will continue to work for up to 2 years after packaging and the moisturizer does not expire.&lt;br /&gt;This means when I purchased my Jergens 3 pack in June of 2015 the Toner portion had already been expired for 3 years! Thankfully Amazon sent me a postage free return label and refunded my money immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Jergens for not having a &#x27;Use By&#x27; date on their product! Bread displays an expiration date.....it is not that difficult.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t have someplace to go where I wanted to be tan because my expectation was not met.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and have recommended it to my friends who also like it. But if it doesn&#x27;t work for you call the 800 number on the tube (or above in this review) and ask them if your tube has expired.  (The new tubes will display a Julian date at the top of the tube followed by an additional number and that last number is the year the product was packaged). Or just call Jergens and complain their product doesn&#x27;t display a &#x27;Use By&#x27; date!</li>
    <li> Super easy and fool proof.  Not really completely unscented, but so much easier to use than other self tanners.  Really great for people wanting a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> My favorite! I have been able to keep some color into the chilly weather. It smells wonderful, isn&#x27;t oily, it does help with firming if firming isn&#x27;t needed much. A++++</li>
    <li> Best gradual tan ever! The more you use it the deeper the tab gets and lasts so long! I will even combine it with the St. tropez self tanner that I bought of Amazon and use it alternating days until I get my desired tan. It&#x27;s really fabulous! You cannot go wrong with this self tanner as it fades if not repeated , but does not leave streakyness. Leaves my skin looking way more moisturized and supple</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion on and off for the past couple years..mostly during the Winter season to prevent myself from breaking down and going to a tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 days you do have a nice healthy looking glow...but it&#x27;s better to use this if you only need some color for something short term (such as a wedding or family photos?) if you use it too long your skin WILL get blotchy..especially in the creases of your arms and knees.&lt;br /&gt;The newer look says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;without the smell&amp;#34;..which when you first apply it&#x27;s not very strong but as the day wears on you can definitely smell it. It&#x27;s not terrible but it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;All in all..it gets the job done is you temporarily need some color..but don&#x27;t exceed 10 days.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I ordered 3 of them so I wouldn&#x27;t run out. Have been using for past few years when I can&#x27;t get outside to tan or in a tanning bed</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  The package of 3 bottles is an excellent value using my prime account. I plan to order this again if the price stays the same.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have tried several tanners. Xen tan -great but expensive and drastic results and its very thick and does not spread on easy. St. Tropez also very expensive but I bought the mousse and I was allergic to it plus spreads on very thick and you have to use a ton of it to cover whole body. If you mess up or miss a spot it is very obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jergens Natural Glow goes on like a normal lotion. It is not super thick and its much easier to put on just put it on like normal lotion. It does not give an orange tint and it smells pleasant. I am slightly tan so I do use the medium to tan shade and have been very happy using this in between laying out. It does show results gradually so you will have to use it for a couple days before you really notice anything but it looks totally natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also by far the cheapest, good quality self tanner I have used. I think I paid $9 for my last large bottle, there is also a facial tint you can get but I just use the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother works for a drugstore and she said this stuff flies off the shelves and it&#x27;s not hard to see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer spending a fortune on self tanners and will stick to this one.</li>
    <li> Best tanning product on the market.  highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product at a descent price.</li>
    <li> I work full time and do not have time to get enough summer sun for a tan...I am going on vacation in a few weeks and decided to try some tanning lotion on my legs so that I would not look so pale.  I noticed a difference after only 2 applications, very nice natural looking.  I did not notice any bad smell (as I have been reading from previous consumers). Yes, make sure you do your feet! and also, be careful around your knees, the lotion seems to darken there more (I&#x27;ve been working around my knees)...and yes, make sure you wash (scrub) your hands when you are finished. I am very pleased with this product, and in comparison to other brands on the shelf, this was priced nicely. You can buy a small tube for $2-$3 before purchasing the larger one for $7-$8. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Although most of you like this product. I still don&#x27;t fancy it. I used jergens natural glow for a year &amp; it never turned out right. The smell is quite lovely. &amp; its easy, but once you take a shower &amp; shave it starts to fade off. In all honestly. Don&#x27;t waste your money, go to a tanning salon &amp; get a real tan. Yeah, people complain about you having a greater risk of cancer. But tanning is so relaxing. You can lay in a nice warm bed &amp; listen to relaxing music. You can even use tanning stickers to have cute lil tatttoos to show how white you were before. You don&#x27;t get cancer from tanning. It only effects you if you go everyday for 6 months straight. Its okay to go everyday for a month. Take a break for a month &amp; go again. I always get compliments on my sexy beach like tan. &amp; how it infact hides stretch marks. Jergans isn&#x27;t the same. I wasted 300 bucks all together. When i could&#x27;ve just spent 150 a year on tanning...</li>
    <li> Great value - although I preferred the previous scented version...</li>
    <li> This is not what is pictured. I was sent old expired lotion. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Love this self tanner, as I&#x27;d like to stress how much I usually mess up all other self tanners. I&#x27;m naturally very fair skinned, but the fair to medium didn&#x27;t have enough of a noticeable color change for me. Using this twice a week keeps me from looking vampire pale. Like all tanners, it will come off in the ocean or a pool pretty easily, but otherwise it stays on well. They sell another one for your face specifically, but I&#x27;ve always just used this on my face at night too and it works great, without needing to buy another one for $7. It just comes off your face faster, since we use so many products on our face a day. Just remember to wash your hands well after you&#x27;ve applied, and otherwise you can&#x27;t really mess it up. I get a lot of compliments on the scent too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t firm, but tans well with little odor now.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have used Jergen&#x27;s on and off for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale, olive skin when I stay out of the sun. But as soon as I spend a few ours outside in Summer- my face, shoulders, upper arms and feet seem to get very dark.&lt;br /&gt;I like Jergens Glow because I can use it all over and it blends my uneven tan. (The medium is more orange then I&#x27;d like.)&lt;br /&gt;Since I often wear jeans and trousers, once Summer does roll around I have pasty legs. And generally, my legs take a while to tan compared to the rest of me. (Rather annoying) But with Jergens, (if I apply a large amount and blend well) I develop a light tan in a few hours! And If I use it daily the colour deepens evenly. Of course as soon as I exfoliate, the colour washes off and I have to start over. I don&#x27;t mind that, I just find having to use this every day in Winter and early Summer does get a bit tedious.I think that is just me being lazy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while this may take a while to work for some, for me, I notice colour with in 24 hours and if I use it all summer it blends with the rest of my tan very nicely!&lt;br /&gt;As far as firming the skin- Deep MASSAGE is well known for making dimples appear smaller and making skin appear more firm and toned. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what cream you choose to massage into your skin. (And colour also makes muscles look more defined.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :-)</li>
    <li> Yesterday was my first time using and I got up this morning and already noticed a difference. I love the color it gives you, it&#x27;s very natural and doesn&#x27;t look orange like some of the others do. It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands orange or clothes orange. I personally like the smell. I will definitely be using this over the summer.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I haven&#x27;t worn shorts in um... about 2 years so my legs are the definition of pasty!  Due to the 100 degree weather I decided that now would probably be a good time to bust out the shorts.  I actually work outside so there was no need to put any of this on the rest of my body, just my legs.  It&#x27;s day 2 and they are definitely darker (I actually really like the color) but it&#x27;s streaky.  I applied it more like a lotion and less like a self tanner, so I&#x27;m going to wait about a week so hopefully it will wear off and I can try it again, this time being a little more careful to apply *perfectly* evenly and I think it will be fine.  I am kinda sad though because now I have to wait another week to wear shorts... I would have been better off looking pale than a partially baked zebra.</li>
    <li> I cant take the lingering smell this leaves on my skin. I tried to get over it b/c I like the way the product gradually tans me but ugh no I cant take the smell.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about three weeks and I liked the results at first.  Used it everyday and by the third week, it was looking for orange-ish and a little streaked.  Discontinued using it and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product, not only gives your skin a nice &#x27;tan&#x27; but also moisturizes.  Smell good and my hands don&#x27;t turn orange.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Such a better deal then in the store! I actually expected three of the smaller bottles. So the big ones were a nice surprise!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a 9 different self tanning creams and I think this one might be Number 1... It&#x27;s easy to use, it works over time, it really looks natural and most importantly It does NOT stain my clothes.  That alone makes this product number 1 in my book</li>
    <li> Odd color and defiantly NOT fragrance free.</li>
    <li> It works to create a color on my skin, but the smell could still be improved. I didn&#x27;t really notice a firming effect and I did use it for a few months. I switched to Suave&#x27;s brand, it smells a bit better, it is less expensive and I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten more color.</li>
    <li> Best bang fot the buck. Inexpensive amd gives natural looking color.</li>
    <li> have used this product before and like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it looks natural if, IF you really rub it in, don&#x27;t just rub it on, rub it IN.  And avoid the krinkly skin along the bottom edge of your feet.  It works well on your face too!</li>
    <li> I really like Jergens products.  I have been using their lotion since I was a teen.  I like this product because it does not streak, it leaves my skin soft, it looks natural and although there is a scent, it tends to go away after I apply lotion.</li>
    <li> This product does work and it is cheaper on Amazon than at the drug store or even Wal-Mart!  Try the \\&quot;express\\&quot; version, it worked overnight on me and this product helps to keep the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self-tanners and this is one of my favorite. I&#x27;m a fair-skin Asian and in summer I usually avoid wearing shorts because of my pale legs. As I&#x27;m in my late 20s, I start to concern about aging and skin cancer so I do not want to lay in the sun. I&#x27;m so happy that I tried this product. It gives me a nice golden tan, not orange or dirty, and does not stain my clothes. The first week, I apply twice a day or 3 times in 2 days to speed up the tan. After that I apply once a day or every other day to maintain the color until I need to exfoliate myself. After using it I wash my hands twice, once with bar soap and once with apricot scrub. It really keep my palms from becoming discolored. Now I&#x27;m much more confident when I&#x27;m at the beach :)</li>
    <li> I did not like the final color. Too orange.</li>
    <li> At first loved it, smell wasn&#x27;t as bad but once it starts to fade it gets extremely blotchy!! Once again disappointed..</li>
    <li> Like the product as a moisturizer, love that Jergens is cruelty free (doesn&#x27;t do animal testing) but perhaps because I&#x27;m not using it daily, no real tanning is going on .</li>
    <li> I decided to use this on my legs for an upcoming wedding. I can only be thankful I didn&#x27;t try it on my whole body. What a disaster - not only was there streaking and splotchiness, but apparently, there are whole huge swaths of my legs it&#x27;s just not effective on - even when I reapplied it specifically to those spots. Now I&#x27;m trying to figure out if there&#x27;s anything I can do to repair it. The parts of my leg that are \\&quot;tan\\&quot; just look dirty.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in 2 days! I am pretty fair skinned but never notice a big difference when I purchase the lighter shade so I thought I would give the medium a try and so glad I did. It gives a nice golden color but you really need to make sure you blend really well. I only do my feet, knees and elbows every other day because they get too dark and can start to get that ugly orange look.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but what I do is apply it at night before bed then shower in the morning and the smell is gone. I also would recommend the jergens face tanner in medium, gives a great glow! I love not having to wear makeup  and feeling like I have a natural sun tan look!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the exact product as shown on the picture. Instead I was sent an older version (formulation) of this that doesn&#x27;t have the blue strip on the packaging nor the little red circle on the top with the words &amp;#34;NOW WITH NO ODOR&amp;#34; on it...which is very important.  The older version stinks badly.</li>
    <li> My mom loves the stuff and her reviews were even the reason why I tried it in the first place. I have never tried self tanner in my life but after seeing my mom&#x27;s pure white legs go to a nice dark tan after a few weeks I had to try it. Even before my mom told me she was using a self tanner I noticed her arms were getting tanner. She never ever lays out or is in the sun so I was surprised at how nice of a tan she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried it I looked up how it works. Apparently it has a chemical in it that reacts with your dead skin cells; changing their color to an orangish brown color. So I knew that this probably wouldn&#x27;t turn my clothes orange because it didn&#x27;t have dyes in it, which was good; so I went out to Walmart and bought it. The next morning, after reading the directions I took a shower and applied it to my body everywhere I could and washed my hands after (just like the directions say). Immediately I noticed the smell. I don&#x27;t believe its as bad as someone people&#x27;s comments say. It doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous but that might be just me. I assumed the smell would go away after the lotion soaked into my skin. I waited as long as possible before putting my clothes back on, even standing in front of the fan. But this stuff doesn&#x27;t ever feel dry. I put my clothes on and the entire day I felt like a wet dog. The first day was the worst. Not only did my boyfriend think I smelled horrible, even opening all the windows in the car while we rode together, but on the first day it felt like my skin couldn&#x27;t breath. It was cold out and I was taking off all my clothes and laying in front of the fan trying to cool off. It just wasn&#x27;t allowing my skin to breath. But since by the end of the day I did look tanner and even had a tan line from where I washed my hands I wanted to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day wasn&#x27;t as bad but my skin still felt like it couldn&#x27;t breath and my boyfriends comments were kind of making it hard to like this stuff. I noticed even more that I was getting tanner and I loved it. We went fishing with some friends and it wasn&#x27;t until then I noticed that the lotion turned any calluses on my body this gross orange brown color that looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered and was a dirty person. I have a tiny little bit of eczema on my elbows and this lotion really made it stand out, even making me look diseased. I felt very self conscious being in shorts and a tank top. But since that day I got a pretty bad sun burn I decided to wait until my sun burn was gone to try Jergens Natural Glow again. I didn&#x27;t want the lotion to react to the dead skin on my sun burn and make it looks darker then other places that weren&#x27;t sun burnt. It took a few days for the gross wet dog feeling to go away from not using the lotion. My tan from the lotion faded after a few days too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yesterday had been two weeks since I put it on and I tried it again. I followed the directions exactly again and got the same result as I did the first day. Its been exactly 24 hours since I put it on yesterday and I still feel like it hasn&#x27;t dried. It isn&#x27;t letting my skin breath and my clothes feel like they cling to my body even though my skin is dry. I feel like a wet dog again. In areas that aren&#x27;t getting as much air flow (but felt dry to the touch before putting my clothes on), such as between my legs and under my breasts and armpits; still feel wet and actually feel slightly wet to the touch, as if the lotion is just coming out of my skin in areas where I would normally only sweat a little, but making me sweat like crazy. My boyfriend didn&#x27;t even want to lay next to me at night, he can&#x27;t stand the smell of the lotion. I know it smells bad, but I can stand it. But it makes me hope that other people I interact with during the day don&#x27;t notice the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope that not all self tanners are like this product. I know Jergens is a good brand and I have other Jergen&#x27;s lotions, but this stuff just isn&#x27;t&#x27; for me. My mom still loves it and I never noticed that she smelled or anything so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for some people? I&#x27;m hoping to try another brand after my skin stops feeling gross. If anyone has any suggestions, please comment!ves it and I never noticed that she smelled or anything so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for some people? I&#x27;m hoping to try another brand after my skin stops feeling gross. If anyone has any suggestions, please comment!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It works beautifully and does not streak - sometimes, I add another body lotion if it is extremely dry.</li>
    <li> been using for years great subtle self tanner and dont look orange.  has a nice smell too! love this stuff</li>
    <li> Not sure about the firming but this cream gives a more natural tint than a spray tan or other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Make sure you exfoliate when you shower before using this the first time and maybe 2 times a week so your tan looks nice and lasts.</li>
    <li> Love using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good now and gives a natural, gradual tan. Great for the start of spring</li>
    <li> The best is not always the most expensive.  I&#x27;ve tried them all, this one doesn&#x27;t make me orange or streaky looking, and as long as I was the underside of my hands immediately, it won&#x27;t leave them tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more pasty-face in the winter.  The light to medium I found doesn&#x27;t do much, but the medium to dark, lovely without being over-much.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It does have a distinct &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; smell so if you don&#x27;t like that, it may be a problem. I have ordered my second pack of 3 and I use the lotion every 2-3 days. I find applying it every couple of days instead of everyday keeps the color longer and avoids any streaking or uneven patches. I highly recommend this to everyone. I get compliments on my legs and overall tan regularly and always credit Jergens.</li>
    <li> This lotion does not streak, it does leave a hint of glitter on though.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I use it almost every day.  No orange streaks and it just gives you a great glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 different Fake Bale products religiously, Norvell, Nivea, Olay, Banana Boat self tanner, SevenNine, Kardashians tanner, the list goes on. I used to use this in high school when it smelled bad. I decided to try it again a few years later and I have been using it for 2 weeks. By far the best yet. As long as you EXFOLIATE every other day and MOISTURIZE underneath this lotion, it truly is most natural looking. No joke, I use Eucerine with Alpha Hydroxy Acid before I apply Natural Glow, exfoliate especially areas that get alot of color build up and you can&#x27;t go wrong. The key is to keep your skin extra hydrated and smooth with any self tanner. It smells a little as its working with your skin so I apply it at night and shower in the morning. I read a review that it made someone nauseous? Okay it&#x27;s really not that bad, no need to go that far. if you don&#x27;t maintenance your skin, no tanner is going to look nice. Period.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I was glad to be able to get it a little cheaper online, and in bulk. The smell is great, and it works really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this lotion.  I&#x27;m 34 and really try to stay out of the sun (aside from vacations, anyway - I&#x27;m not a total buzz kill ;)  I&#x27;ve used it daily for about six months.  I wish I had taken before pictures, as I&#x27;m not totally sure about the effects it has on the appearance of cellulite - though tan fat is always better than NOT tan fat, so there is for sure at least that.  BUT, what I find this to be really effective for - aside from the subtle bronzing - is stretch marks.  Though not overweight, I got my curves early and have had stretch marks on the inside of my upper thighs since seventh grade.  Since using this lotion, their appearance has drastically lessened.  I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s listed on the bottle as a perk, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that - one day I just looked down and had to do a double take on how unnoticeable they were.  I don&#x27;t know if I can ever stop using this, now having seen the difference.  The only downside is that though I do like the way it smells (it&#x27;s like coconut and reminds me of vacations) I wish it were scentless because though no one has ever said anything, I feel like it has to effect the way my perfume smells - how could it not?  But it&#x27;s nothing I dwell on.  Another thing worth mentioning is it leaves your skin sooo soft and people always comment on that to me.  People are also continuously surprised when I say it&#x27;s a Jergens product.  The likelihood of you getting through a bottle and wanting to continue, in my opinion, is highly likely so since they&#x27;re not exactly cheap - I&#x27;d def recommend getting the 3 packs.</li>
