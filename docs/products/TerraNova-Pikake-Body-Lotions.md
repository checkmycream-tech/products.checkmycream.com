      <li>The scent makes you feel as though you are on a tropical island even if you&#x27;re stuck in the world&#x27;s greatest traffic jam!</li>
      <li>Wonderful to use after a bath or shower.</li>

      <li>I have yet to try the pikaka shea and cocoa butter body cream that TerraNova also makes, but I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
      <li>Nice product!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful scent although spreading it as a body lotion is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with a wonderful light floral fragrance with a hint of jasmine.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is lovely!  </li>
      <li>I discovered this on a cruise ship in Hawaii and was thrilled when I saw that they sell it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Mmmm... nice.</li>

      <li>The texture of the lotion isn&#x27;t overly oily and still moisturizes nicely.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>Since pikake is my favorite fragrance of all time, I had to try this product.  </li>
      <li>If you like jasmine, you will love this.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I ordered the perfume too</li>
      <li>texture of the lotion is noticeably silkier than most formulas.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light, sweet scent which you can wear the lotion on it&#x27;s own and the scent lingers throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It smells so good and the lotion really does soften your skin.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is easily absorbed and softens skin nicely.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this in Hawaii and was so pleased that I ordered many more.</li>
      <li>Product arrived VERY quickly.  </li>
      <li>However, it is fine used as a hand</li>
      <li>The scent is soft and pleasant.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;d like silky smooth skin with the heavenly scent of pikake, then this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>They go on smooth, and melt into your skin.  </li>
      <li>Terra Nova products are great and this scent definitely pleases.  </li>
      <li>Deliciously creamy and perfectly thick without clotting, I love this lotion and use it every day.  </li>
      <li>Any jasmine I have smelled before was too strong, sweet &amp; cloying.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite!  </li>
      <li>and of course, that wonderful anti-oxidant green tea!  </li>
      <li>I found it to be a great product and have used it for several years, after first buying it in Hawaii on vacation.  </li>
      <li>The scent is mild, not too cloying.  </li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly and when they said it would.</li>
      <li>Pikake is the most natural, clean and fresh scent I have ever had.</li>
      <li>but I have to say they were well worth the risk.</li>
      <li>It smells so pretty without being overly sweet.  </li>
      <li>The scent does not last for more than three minutes.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Since then I ordered this same brand over the internet and am never disappointed.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Pikake to anyone who wants something that isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
      <li>Unlike more big commercial brands like lotions from Bath and Body Works or the Body Shop, the TerraNova brand lotions are GREASELESS.  </li>
      <li>It is soft, sexy, complex &amp; compelling.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and not strong on nose like most of the fragrances out today.</li>
      <li>The product, Terra Nova Pikake Lotion came earlier than stated and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>One woman claimed that it reduced the appearance of her stretch marks and fixed her husband&#x27;s toe fungus problem (?).  </li>
      <li>I find the scent soft and relaxing.</li>
      <li>The major botanical component in this lotion is an infusion of fragrant flowers like peonies and hibiscus, along with gingko and lotus...</li>

    <li> I discovered this on a cruise ship in Hawaii and was thrilled when I saw that they sell it on amazon. It smells so pretty without being overly sweet.  I find the scent soft and relaxing.</li>
    <li> I use Amazon because I have found I can trust their vendor selections. I never used BUYSALON before but I have to say they were well worth the risk. The product, Terra Nova Pikake Lotion came earlier than stated and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent although spreading it as a body lotion is overwhelming. I usually add an unscented body lotion to dilute the fragrance. However, it is fine used as a hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the lotion is noticeably silkier than most formulas. Mmmm... nice.</li>

    <li> Since I can&#x27;t go to Hawaii, I thought to bring it to me by choosing a pikake scented body lotion.  Terra Nova products are great and this scent definitely pleases.  Creamy lotion with the lovely pikake scent (think of the flowers in a traditional Hawaiian lei).  Slather on, breathe in deeply, and think Hawaii.  Aaahhh...  Side note:  prompt delivery too.  No leaks in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I like to rub this on my body while watching that moron Rachel Maddow make an ass of himself. The great smell of this lotion takes away the pain of the fact that Obama is an Idiot and destroying this country. I like to also use it to make the Illegal Aliens I am deporting smell better. It sucks driving them back to the border and having to smell them.</li>
    <li> We found this lotion in Hawaii 18 years ago and we could&#x27;nt find it in the states after that until now. Thank you for making it easier.</li>
    <li> Product arrived VERY quickly.  I intended it for my daughter-in-law who loves Hawaiian scents.  I sneaked a sniff, and it smelled like pikake.  I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  It smells so good and the lotion really does soften your skin.  It was delivered quickly and when they said it would.</li>
    <li> Nice - love the scent but it is so diluted, it does not last very long.</li>
    <li> Pikake is the most natural, clean and fresh scent I have ever had. It&#x27;s very soft and not strong on nose like most of the fragrances out today. I highly recommend Pikake to anyone who wants something that isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time for Christmas and my wife loves the stuff. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This lotion is lovely!  The scent is mild, not too cloying.  The lotion is easily absorbed and softens skin nicely.  Nice product!</li>
    <li> What convinced me to buy this product initially was the all-natural ingredients.  The major botanical component in this lotion is an infusion of fragrant flowers like peonies and hibiscus, along with gingko and lotus... and of course, that wonderful anti-oxidant green tea!  One whiff of that heavenly pikake scent (unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before!) and I was hooked.  Unlike more big commercial brands like lotions from Bath and Body Works or the Body Shop, the TerraNova brand lotions are GREASELESS.  They go on smooth, and melt into your skin.  The scent lasts a very long time.  I have yet to try the pikaka shea and cocoa butter body cream that TerraNova also makes, but I&#x27;ve heard great things about it.  One woman claimed that it reduced the appearance of her stretch marks and fixed her husband&#x27;s toe fungus problem (?).  In any case, she also mentioned it was greaseless, which was always my big complaint about the Body Shop body butters. That one is next on my list for purchase.  Terranova has made a beleiver out of me!</li>
    <li> Since pikake is my favorite fragrance of all time, I had to try this product.  I found it to be a great product and have used it for several years, after first buying it in Hawaii on vacation.  Since then I ordered this same brand over the internet and am never disappointed. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with a wonderful light floral fragrance with a hint of jasmine.  If you like jasmine, you will love this.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and ordered the Pikake.  After learning Pikake is jasmine I was almost regretting ordering the fragrance.  Any jasmine I have smelled before was too strong, sweet &amp; cloying.  This has none of those qualities.  It is soft, sexy, complex &amp; compelling.  I am so glad I ordered the perfume too, can&#x27;t wait to wear the two together.  My new favorite!  Terranova...well done!!</li>
    <li> Deliciously creamy and perfectly thick without clotting, I love this lotion and use it every day.  Should probably buy stock in the company.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in Hawaii and was so pleased that I ordered many more.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I feel like I&#x27;m back in Hawaii when I put it on.  It&#x27;s a light, sweet scent which you can wear the lotion on it&#x27;s own and the scent lingers throughout the day. Goes onto skin nicely as well....non sticky and non oily.</li>
