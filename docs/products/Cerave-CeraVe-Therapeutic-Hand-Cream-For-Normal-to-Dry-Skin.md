      <li>the skin nice and smooth, and not dry.  </li>
      <li>I assume this is another mildly allergic reaction to something in this cream.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t buy again...not worth the price.</li>
      <li>Eucerin makes a nice Eczema Relief cream which also comes in smaller tubes now.</li>
      <li>I have also found this a great product for my elbows, which I had neglected in recent months, and after about a couple of weeks are almost completely restored.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
      <li>Soaks right into the skin.</li>
      <li>Nice to keep in my purse when my hands feel dry</li>
      <li>effective, even on my dry cracked ashy knuckles</li>
      <li>I have this hand cream and like it very much - it&#x27;s a product that is sold at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>In fact, I was able to discontinue the medication and only use the hand cream now.  </li>
      <li>but then the effect is as if I hadn&#x27;t used anything in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Local stores were selling it for a price of as much as 58% more.</li>
      <li>This product was much easier.</li>
      <li>I used this so much during the winter months,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>Thanks cerave my skin loves you so much</li>
      <li>I am not always ready to make that commitment.  </li>
      <li>I expected more.  </li>
      <li>The price is so reasonable.</li>
      <li>read about the Cerave line in WebMD magazine, and because of the fairly reasonable price, decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>It has kind of a hospital lotion smell but not a huge thing for me.</li>
      <li>I love other CeraVe products</li>
      <li>Love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs completely, no perfumed odor and does the job completely.</li>
      <li>This seems to not be sufficient for my very dry hands, thus the less than great</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m loving this.</li>
      <li>we highly recommend this product  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this</li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This cream truly makes my hands feel good again without any greasy feel - quite necessary for me - and there is very little fragrance to it...</li>
      <li>This cream has a similar soothing effect, but is quickly absorbed.</li>
      <li>OK but very runny and after using one tube not sure about benefits over other equally priced creams - Gold Bond equivalent better for me</li>
      <li>While products like Aquaphor are very soothing and healing, they are also very greasy and can only be used for times when you can wear cotton gloves over your hands.</li>
      <li>The way people raved about this hand cream, I expected something special.</li>
      <li>I had been successfully using CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (in tubes; I do not know whether the product in the jars is the exact same thing) for the contact allergy-related eczema on my hands which makes my hands extremely dry, with thick, callused patches along my fingers.</li>
      <li>Keeps his hand soft andhelp with the cracking since he has eczema.</li>
      <li>I work as a nurse so handwashing is frequent.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my hands from  splitting around my finger nails and keeps my hands soft.</li>
      <li>It does not absorb as well as the old CeraVe did</li>
      <li>Makes skin soft.</li>
      <li>After I ordered this from Amazon, I did find it available in some local stores for less.</li>
      <li>truly therapeutic cream....fast to absorb....healing....and gives fast relief to dry, cracking skin</li>
      <li>My hands are dry from frequent washing and my regular lotion didnt help much.</li>
      <li>Was completely taken back as a couple of months ago</li>
      <li>Then apparently CeraVe changed things around - updated their logo and did away with the practical 2 oz.</li>
      <li>According to the packaging, this hand cream is for &#x27;Normal to Dry Skin&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, dry skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hand cream is not very moisturizing. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything &amp;#34;therapeutic&amp;#34; about it. Won&#x27;t buy again...not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Ordered the hand cream for my husband as requested by our Dermatoligist. My husband&#x27;s hands get terribly dry &amp; crack during winter. He likes it &amp; so do I. Cannot find it at any local stores.</li>
    <li> This keeps moisture locked in without the greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make my skin feel moisturized like the cerave body cream.  Went on more like a lotion.  Wasn&#x27;t thick and creamy as I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream! It keeps my hands from  splitting around my finger nails and keeps my hands soft.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and thinks its the best.  Not greasy, nice and light with good coverage.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so terrible that I threw the entire bottle away. Talk about a waste!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love.  Definitely is one of the best hand creams that I have ever used.  Does the job of&lt;br /&gt;keeping the skin nice and smooth, and not dry.  I used this so much during the winter months,&lt;br /&gt;and I still do, even in the nice weather.  No fragrance...which I like. I highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> keeps hands moisturized</li>
    <li> I have tried so very many hand creams, including those that cost over $50 a tube. I think this one is better. While products like Aquaphor are very soothing and healing, they are also very greasy and can only be used for times when you can wear cotton gloves over your hands. I am not always ready to make that commitment.  This cream has a similar soothing effect, but is quickly absorbed. If I use it before bedtime, my hands still feel softer after washing several times the next morning. I have also found this a great product for my elbows, which I had neglected in recent months, and after about a couple of weeks are almost completely restored. My other attempt to heal my elbows involved Aquaphor and plastic wrap. This product was much easier. No plastic wrap required.&lt;br /&gt;I read about the Cerave line in WebMD magazine, and because of the fairly reasonable price, decided to give it a try. After I ordered this from Amazon, I did find it available in some local stores for less. So now I have multiples, by my bed, in my handbag, in the cupholder of my car.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the moisturizing lotion, which I use as my body lotion. [[ASIN:B000YJ2SLG CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion, 12-Ounce Bottle]] It has the same advantages of leaving my skin feel moisturized, without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Our 4 reorder of this</li>
    <li> Everything came as described and worked great!</li>
    <li> Not greasy and moist. I have in every floor in my house.</li>
    <li> The way people raved about this hand cream, I expected something special. Instead, it just glided over my rough spots, making them temporarily greasy but not really softening the skin. Hoping to find something less expensive than Kiehl&#x27;s that works, but this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> truly therapeutic cream....fast to absorb....healing....and gives fast relief to dry, cracking skin</li>
    <li> Disappointed....I expected more.  The Foot SA Foot Creame is a marvel/miracle.  Arrived quickly.  Price is average.</li>
    <li> effective, even on my dry cracked ashy knuckles</li>
    <li> Great lotion for ,my grandson.  Keeps his hand soft andhelp with the cracking since he has eczema.</li>
    <li> The very best hand cream that I have found (and I have tried many!).</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I start using this, not only on my hands but my face also.  I have lost over 40 pounds over the past 8 months &amp; wrinkles are beginning to show in my face, not only to aging but loosing weight.  I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> Best product for dry hands. Use very little when applying,and it is not sticky.</li>
    <li> I work as a nurse so handwashing is frequent.  This cream truly makes my hands feel good again without any greasy feel - quite necessary for me - and there is very little fragrance to it... also a plus for me.  I carry it in my purse and can&#x27;t imagine being without it.</li>
    <li> Excellent protective hand cream. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Great hand lotion. My hands are dry from frequent washing and my regular lotion didnt help much. This cream does keep my hands more hydrated.</li>
    <li> I work outside and hands are very dry and cracked.  My Dermatologist recommended hand cream and I love it.  Works great!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I&#x27;ve been using for over a year now.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  Was completely taken back as a couple of months ago the TODAY show had this brand as a top recommended lotion/series.  I was very pleased with my dermatologist.  Hard to find in stores so just get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to do a great job taking care of my family&#x27;s skin problems, especially on the fingers. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had been successfully using CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (in tubes; I do not know whether the product in the jars is the exact same thing) for the contact allergy-related eczema on my hands which makes my hands extremely dry, with thick, callused patches along my fingers. I loved the product and kept the 2 oz. tubes everywhere - on my desk, in my purse, in the kitchen, you name it. Then apparently CeraVe changed things around - updated their logo and did away with the practical 2 oz. tubes altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While desperately looking for a replacement product, I saw the Therapeutic Hand Cream and - based on my favorable experience with the Cerave Moisturizing Cream - ordered it. Regrettably this product does next to nothing for my skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- According to the packaging, this hand cream is for &#x27;Normal to Dry Skin&#x27;. This seems to not be sufficient for my very dry hands, thus the less than great results.&lt;br /&gt;- It takes longer to absorb. Eventually it disappears into my skin but then the effect is as if I hadn&#x27;t used anything in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;- After application, my skin is slightly itchy. I assume this is another mildly allergic reaction to something in this cream. I never had this with their other product.&lt;br /&gt;- Lastly, the smoothing properties of this hand cream leave a lot to be desired when compared to their Moisturizing Cream. The rough, callused spots on my hands are completely unaffected and not better at all. The skin on my hands simply does not feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;This might be a perfectly good product for people with normal skin. But for me this did not work at all. As it stands, I will continue to use the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser as a hand soap and shower gel but other than that not use this brand&#x27;s products anymore. Eucerin makes a nice Eczema Relief cream which also comes in smaller tubes now. It does not absorb as well as the old CeraVe did but at least it soothes and improves my skin. Something the CeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream simply does not achieve for me.Hand Cream simply does not achieve for me.</li>
    <li> this is the finest cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Have spent thousands of dollars on creams for extremely dry skin. Love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs completely, no perfumed odor and does the job completely.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, my hands are always in water, I was told to try this lotion, it&#x27;s good but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the price...I need to re apply all day...so one tube doesn&#x27;t last me too long.</li>
    <li> I love this s***. My hands cry for this in the winter. Thanks cerave my skin loves you so much</li>
    <li> Nice -- this is a lighter cream, so it&#x27;s great for frequent use on hands (not greasy/slippery).</li>
    <li> Works as indicated on package.  Does help if hands are in water alot.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Use it at least twice a day - keeps my hands moist.  I garden a lot and I use before I put on gardening gloves.  Helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I love other CeraVe products but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m loving this. I don&#x27;t see a big difference in my skin from using this hand cream and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands.  Not sure I&#x27;ll buy again.  Sorry CeraVe!</li>
    <li> OK but very runny and after using one tube not sure about benefits over other equally priced creams - Gold Bond equivalent better for me</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for daily use for my dry hands.  I have eczema on my hands and along with the medication I use, this hand cream has been a healing miracle for me.  In fact, I was able to discontinue the medication and only use the hand cream now.  I will continue to purchase this cream from Amazon as the cost is less than in the local pharmacies.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. Makes skin soft.</li>
    <li> I love it because it is not greasy. Soaks right into the skin.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist to use to keep my hands moist. I have severe hand eczema and constantly have breakouts. It appears to help and seals well. I do go through a lot of it.</li>
    <li> This is the very best hand cream on the market!!  Try it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have this hand cream and like it very much - it&#x27;s a product that is sold at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. When my son and daughter in law visited us, my son had dry chapped hands that were irritated by the winter weather,heat,washing... and used my hand cream. His wife, a chemical engineer, read the ingredient list and was impressed. I think she said that it has some of the same ingredients used in diaper cream to protect a baby&#x27;s bottom. So, I ordered this cream and had it sent to him and he&#x27;s using it. It hasn&#x27;t eliminated his problem, but it helps.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  Not greasy.  I use this every night before going to sleep.</li>
    <li> If your dermatologist told you to buy this, don&#x27;t get it. It initially was a prescription medication and then turned into over the counter. It is not the same as the old prescription medication.&lt;br /&gt;Causes a burning sensation and makes my eczema worse.</li>
    <li> I have to use sanitizer all day long at work. This makes my hands silky smooth. Best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Recommended by my derm.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Cerave products I have tried.  I have sensitive, dry skin and this is the best moisturizer I have found.</li>
    <li> awesome cream  we highly recommend this product  in fact all crave products are good</li>
    <li> I thought this would be comparable to the moisturizing cream in the big tub but it&#x27;s not. Nice to keep in my purse when my hands feel dry but I prefer the comfort of the moisturizing cream over the hand cream.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist swears by this product as a face cream, and after using it, I have to agree. It just sinks into your skin with no greasiness. The price is so reasonable. I have had a problem at times finding this in stores,as it is often sold out,  so others must feel the same way. Highly recommend, much better than those overpriced face creams!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It does not feel sticky after being applied, does not leave oily spots on clothes and sheets, and most important, it has cured the dryness of my skin. Best skin product I have ever used. And the Amazon price is most attractive. Local stores were selling it for a price of as much as 58% more.</li>
    <li> I buy other products by this brand so thought I would try the hand cream as well. It is a very nice rich cream and I would recommend. It has kind of a hospital lotion smell but not a huge thing for me.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Wish I had discovered this product long ago.  I heard of it when a Dermatologist recommended it to a relative.</li>
