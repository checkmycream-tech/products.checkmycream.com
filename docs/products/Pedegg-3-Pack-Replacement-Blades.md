### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it was, indeed, incredible.  </li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>Amazon did a great job getting my order to me even sooner than I</li>
      <li>I have found the ped egg very effective at helping me control it - moreso than any product except maybe elta tar - which I put on after using the ped egg.(then go to the suntan for 7 minutes)</li>
      <li>the blades snap on with a perfect fit.</li>
      <li>These replacement PedEgg blades are as good quality as the ones that come with the PedEgg.</li>
      <li>I loved the Pedegg when I bought it in the store, but the refill blades did not work well.  </li>
      <li>We have tried many, many tools and creams, but this works the best.  </li>
      <li>FREE SHIPPING ON ANYTHING IS ALWAYS GREAT TO ME.</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s too easy to run the blade over your heels!  </li>
      <li>I really like the ped egg and was happy to be able to buy the replacement blades as I have not found them in the stores.  </li>
      <li>If you show any more than one star, your employee&#x27;s must be giving their&lt;br /&gt;review, because your business doesn&#x27;t deserve more than one star.</li>
      <li>Item exactly as stated and offered for a fair price.</li>
      <li>The emery finishing pad does a really great job of smoothing the skin surface when you&#x27;ve gone as far as you can with the blade surface.</li>
      <li>And it really works...but works so good you must not overdue it  </li>
      <li>:) ONE MORE THING, MY PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED AT AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TIME.</li>
      <li>This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  </li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
      <li>The blades are as good as the original blade on the pedegg and a lot better deal than going out and buying a whole new pedegg.</li>
      <li>My original Ped Egg was great, but these replacement blades were dull and not every effective at removing skin.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good enough for 5 stars for me!</li>
      <li>The replacement blades arrived quickly and met all of my expectations.  </li>
      <li>If you own a PedEgg, chances are good that your blade is already dull, or will be very soon.</li>
      <li>The Ped Egg is a fabulously simple invention that puts you in control of your own feet.  </li>
      <li>I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  </li>
      <li>Arrived very fast and packed well.</li>
      <li>My husbands feet callous very fast and then split.  </li>
      <li>When I first used it on him, I said, \\&quot;this thing isn&#x27;t working at all.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>OFFERED TO SHIP BACK TO SELLER GOT A REFUND HONEST SELLER PRODUCT TOO BIG FOR ORIGINAL PED EGG</li>
      <li>Whether you get regular pedicures or not, you can keep your feet smooth and healthy looking with regular use of the Ped Egg.  </li>
      <li>Not only are these blades replacements for the original ped egg, but they are sharper than the original!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>This is the first time I can really feel how soft my feet should be.  </li>
      <li>It doesnt take as long as a regular file and very clean.  </li>
      <li>THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY ONLY, IF YOU HAVE SCALLY FEET FILLED WITH DEAD SKIN</li>
      <li>His feet have never been so soft.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know just how dull my original blade was until I popped one of these babies on my PedEgg.  </li>

<li> JUST BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE SHARP BLADES, JUST LIKE SCISSORS, KNIVES ETC.</li>
<li> For some reason, this last refill went dull a lot sooner.  </li>
<li> only problem I had, was shipping was a bit slow, but no so slow that it was worrisome.</li>
<li> They take off very little skin and even after working at it for a while, my heels are still rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually go through one ped-egg file every 2 weeks.  </li>
<li> After having the Pedegg for over a year it became dull.  </li>
<li> My psoriasis has been much much improved in the past two months (winter) which is usually the worst time of year for me.</li>
<li> it aint that serious</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it was something I did differently or just a bad lot.</li>
<li> I am sorry I bought from you.</li>
<li> Or this was a bad lot?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a big fan of the Ped Egg products.  I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  My only warning is that I would recommend to use it over a towel or tub because not 100% of the filings get caught by the case.</li>
    <li> I loved the Pedegg when I bought it in the store, but the refill blades did not work well.  They take off very little skin and even after working at it for a while, my heels are still rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a different company makes the refills? Or this was a bad lot?</li>
    <li> I really like the ped egg and was happy to be able to buy the replacement blades as I have not found them in the stores.  Amazon did a great job getting my order to me even sooner than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as stated and offered for a fair price. Arrived very fast and packed well.</li>
    <li> Don;t understand the BIG Deal why you have to review every little thing you buy on Amazon...it aint that serious</li>
    <li> I have had psoriasis for 25 years+. The problem is that with this disease, skin cells grow uncontrolled and scales build up. The salves don&#x27;t work unless you get the excess skin off. I have found the ped egg very effective at helping me control it - moreso than any product except maybe elta tar - which I put on after using the ped egg.(then go to the suntan for 7 minutes) My psoriasis has been much much improved in the past two months (winter) which is usually the worst time of year for me.</li>
    <li> After having the Pedegg for over a year it became dull.  Ordered the replacement blades and it&#x27;s working well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know just how dull my original blade was until I popped one of these babies on my PedEgg.  If you own a PedEgg, chances are good that your blade is already dull, or will be very soon.</li>
    <li> My feet have always been rough and calloused and I have used a variety of files, pumus stones and lotions.  This is the first time I can really feel how soft my feet should be.  It doesnt take as long as a regular file and very clean.  The emery board that attaches doesn&#x27;t last long so I advice buying extra but it works.</li>
    <li> The blades are as good as the original blade on the pedegg and a lot better deal than going out and buying a whole new pedegg. the blades snap on with a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> FREE SHIPPING ON ANYTHING IS ALWAYS GREAT TO ME. THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY ONLY, IF YOU HAVE SCALLY FEET FILLED WITH DEAD SKIN THAT IS UNATTRACTIVE AND YOU CAN NOT GET YOUR MAN TO KISS AND RUB YOUR FEET, THIS IS YOUR SIGN YOU NEED TO GET THIS PRODUCT/PEDICURE. THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS!!! JUST BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE SHARP BLADES, JUST LIKE SCISSORS, KNIVES ETC. IT WILL CUT YOU. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALLLLLL, EVEN TO THE MEN. THE SAME THING WITH YOU, IF YOU WANT TO GET THE SAME AFFECT OF THAT TOUCH FROM YOUR WOMAN, FIX YOUR FEET!!! LOL  :) ONE MORE THING, MY PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED AT AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TIME. THANK YOU TV GUYS.</li>
    <li> If you show any more than one star, your employee&#x27;s must be giving their&lt;br /&gt;review, because your business doesn&#x27;t deserve more than one star. I am sorry I bought from you. What you charge for shipping, I placed my order on 6/4/08, your site says 2-3 day processing. Here it is the 13th and I&lt;br /&gt;STILL don&#x27;t have my order. You misrepresented yourselves.</li>
    <li> Not only are these blades replacements for the original ped egg, but they are sharper than the original!&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had, was shipping was a bit slow, but no so slow that it was worrisome.</li>
    <li> These replacement PedEgg blades are as good quality as the ones that come with the PedEgg. That&#x27;s good enough for 5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but since creams weren&#x27;t working at ALL on my heels ...I did try this.  And it really works...but works so good you must not overdue it  I will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> My husbands feet callous very fast and then split.  We have tried many, many tools and creams, but this works the best.  When I first used it on him, I said, \\&quot;this thing isn&#x27;t working at all.\\&quot;  Then I opened the egg and found that it had worked extremely well.  I kept using it and it was, indeed, incredible.  His feet have never been so soft.</li>
    <li> I usually go through one ped-egg file every 2 weeks.  For some reason, this last refill went dull a lot sooner.  I don&#x27;t know if it was something I did differently or just a bad lot.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades arrived quickly and met all of my expectations.  The product works well.</li>
    <li> My original Ped Egg was great, but these replacement blades were dull and not every effective at removing skin.</li>
    <li> OFFERED TO SHIP BACK TO SELLER GOT A REFUND HONEST SELLER PRODUCT TOO BIG FOR ORIGINAL PED EGG</li>
    <li> No one likes rough, cracked heels.  The Ped Egg is a fabulously simple invention that puts you in control of your own feet.  Whether you get regular pedicures or not, you can keep your feet smooth and healthy looking with regular use of the Ped Egg.  You know how tough the skin on your heels is, and the blades on the Ped Egg only last so long.  How do you know when to replace the blade?  When it&#x27;s too easy to run the blade over your heels!  Keep a supply of replacement blades on hand.  The emery finishing pad does a really great job of smoothing the skin surface when you&#x27;ve gone as far as you can with the blade surface.</li>
