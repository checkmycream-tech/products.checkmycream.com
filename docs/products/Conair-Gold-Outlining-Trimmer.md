      <li>The Conair trimmer works great.</li>
      <li>great.</li>
      <li>so for those saying they weren&#x27;t great you might want to learn how to adjust the blade</li>
      <li>But over all great product.</li>
      <li>In fact they might be for experienced barbers looking for a backup trimmer.</li>
      <li>I have to say that this was a great purchase for me.</li>
      <li>Great trimmer.</li>
      <li>This is a good pair of trimmers, I purchased this trimmer because I heard this would be the sharpest pair of trimmers on the market.</li>
      <li>this trimmer is just as good as the andis T Outliner.</li>
      <li>Good trimmer for the price</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>the clipper is junk, i think people who write good reviews about this product got paid to do so, unless someone can tell me how to adjust this product</li>
      <li>Very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>However, the blade on them is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used and is almost worth the price of the trimmer all on its own.</li>
      <li>Thanks forfex awesome trimmer.</li>
      <li>when I tried using the trimmer out of the box, instead of giving be a nice line up, it was pulling my hair.  </li>
      <li>As good or even better than the andis outliners.</li>
      <li>Great trimmer conair has risen to the top with this trimmer, actually better than andis t outliners bc</li>
      <li>It just stays warm at most.</li>
      <li>A PROFESSIONAL TRIMMER, ALSO AN ATTRACTIVE TRIMMER!  </li>
      <li>And I have to say once I lightly oiled the blades they were good to go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and by far it&#x27;s the best liner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>YOUR TRIMMER TO CUT PROFESSIONALLY DON&#x27;T SEEM TO LIKE THESE, BUT THOSE WHO DO KNOW THAT THESE CLIPPERS AND FLAWLESS AND STAYS</li>
      <li>its not so close but will do a better job with it</li>
      <li>USED THESE TO CUT MANY HEAD</li>
      <li>I am preparing to buy a couple more.</li>
      <li>but it is ok</li>
      <li>great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
      <li>Gave me an ok line up.  </li>
      <li>so i just screwed the bottom blade back on and the blades set themselves perfectly.</li>
      <li>Out of the three liners that I already have, this is the one I use the most.</li>
      <li>The top and bottom blade should almost be flush.</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>At this point they were right out of the box because I like to see how good equipment is without any modifications.</li>
      <li>i use it a home and so far so good!</li>
      <li>So far they work great</li>
      <li>so I put the other blade on and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>It does not snag hair and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know if they were going to need any fine tuning</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re just as good as the 76ers if not better, so buy both if you&#x27;re looking for great clippers/  </li>
      <li>What I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t get overly hot while in use for more than 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>luckily I have a hex screw driver and was able to take one screw out.  </li>
      <li>Great trimmers I use daily.</li>
      <li>Love them so much about to purchase more Babyliss products</li>
      <li>Although the blade is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever seen this trimmer has very little power.</li>
      <li>I was actually excited to use them once I started because of how well they perform.  </li>
      <li>I am excited to try them out with designs, Alex Campbell (atlanta&#x27;s number one barber) has a youtube video</li>
      <li>Very solid and powerful, use them as my work horses pair and every cut comes out great.</li>
      <li>One of those shape ups was on a 4 year old and he had no complaints or issue at all, but a nice shape up in the end.  </li>
      <li>COOL</li>
      <li>but this goes back to if you know anything about good trimmers.</li>
      <li>Pro mates are what I currently use and the way these trimmers came out of the box are just as good.</li>
      <li>And it has Allen Screw to hold the blades in, I&#x27;m sure I can find new screw to replace them if they&#x27;re stripped.</li>
      <li>Then I took the screw off the blades and zero gap them fast and fairly easy.</li>
      <li>(doesn&#x27;t overheat like the Andi&#x27;s t outliner I have both) but fresh out of the box</li>
      <li>Product is Great really sharp very maintainable..</li>
      <li>I would SOOOO recommend these to anyone looking to get a super crisp line...</li>
      <li>They key to the best trimmers are super thin bottom blades, and how you adjust the top and bottom blade.</li>
      <li>so I took the blade off and brought it right up to the edge...</li>
      <li>when I got these trimmers right out the box I tested them before adjusting them...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you want  a light trim.</li>
      <li>Love this thing, only worry is that it has a Gold Titanium Coating, even though it says will it eventually wear off??</li>
      <li>Quite strong motor , and they stay cool during long use.</li>
      <li>I have the andis styliner 2, wahl detailer, I have used the andis t-outliner, and these are just as good if not better than all of them.  </li>
      <li>Would not recommend for personal use because they really are sharp, but as a professional, I love these and love the price!</li>
      <li>What kind of mess is this???  </li>
      <li>I think the andis is a bit stronger but not by much.</li>
      <li>The t blade on this trimmer performs really well, and it did not bite, cut or nick.  </li>
      <li>I would pick this over the Andis t linners they don&#x27;t heat up as fast as those trimmers.</li>
      <li>Very clean edge sharp blade.</li>
      <li>Just make sure u pull the skin when u zero out the bottom of ur cut very sharp out the box.</li>
      <li>First of all, arrived fast almost too fast and solid packaging.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t get hot like those and gives crisp sharp lineups as well, great buy planning on buying a couple more bc at this price it want last long, I also put a modified andis shallow tooth blade on mine and it cuts even crisper bt the blade that comes with</li>
      <li>( I dont know it better yet, will know after using it a for a few days)Though I did remove the blade at an attempt to re-set them</li>
      <li>Usually, the andis trimmers are the key to a good edge-up, but I tell you these are even sharper.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, the machine itself sucks.</li>
      <li>Lined myself up on one side of my head as I always do before putting new equipment on someone&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>This trimmer is half the price of Andis t-outliners and is just as strong and sharpe.</li>
      <li>Now, first of all the screws are not the regular phillips, they are hex screws.  </li>
      <li>IS MY SECOND SET AND WILL PURCHASE SEVERAL MORE TO STORE IN MY STORAGE FOR FUTURE USE!!!</li>
      <li>It has little to no power and will easily bog as you shave your neck or beard.</li>
      <li>and I was extremely surprised how it gave me an extra crisp line up.</li>
      <li>I did three haircuts and shape ups last night and the outliners did not get hot at all, which can be a major issue with the andis t-outliners.  </li>
      <li>The effectiveness of these trimmers really come from the blade as the machine is just above junk status.</li>
      <li>I am a professional, licensed barber.</li>
      <li>Surprised with the quality of these trimmers.</li>
      <li>I am a professional barber here in Indiana.</li>
      <li>But overall highly recommend buying.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that the teeth of the blade are deeper than your normal trimmer blade, almost exactly as deep as the pro mate blade.</li>
      <li>If you want a crisp, sharp line-up, these are it.  </li>
      <li>If you know anything about giving a crisp line up then you know that you need sharp trimmers.</li>
      <li>If Alex Campbell supports this product then you know these are certified for &amp;#34;crispy sharp edge ups&amp;#34; NOT FOR SHAVING YOUR WHOLE FACE &amp;#34;There sharp&amp;#34;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Although the blade is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever seen this trimmer has very little power. And that becomes a problem when trying to cut through thick hair such as beard or mustace hair.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this was a great purchase for me. Forfex Babybliss Trimmers (GT) were great coming out of the box. I am a professional barber here in Indiana. I was looking for a backup trimmer besides a Andis or Wahl brand trimmer. And I have to say once I lightly oiled the blades they were good to go. I would have given five stars but due to the allen/hex screws that were on the blade I have to rate four stars. I didn&#x27;t know if they were going to need any fine tuning but they didn&#x27;t. Also to note the vibration was minimum being that it has 8 watts pumping through it instead of the 10 watts that Andis has. If this product receives anything less then four stars it&#x27;s because of your technique and the misuse of this tool.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the machine itself sucks. It has little to no power and will easily bog as you shave your neck or beard. However, the blade on them is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used and is almost worth the price of the trimmer all on its own. The effectiveness of these trimmers really come from the blade as the machine is just above junk status. If you&#x27;re simply curious or need a trimmer strictly for lining, order these. As for myself, I kept the blade, slapped them on an Andis T-Outliner, and tossed the machine.</li>
    <li> Just put in my order!! If Alex Campbell supports this product then you know these are certified for &amp;#34;crispy sharp edge ups&amp;#34; NOT FOR SHAVING YOUR WHOLE FACE &amp;#34;There sharp&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am a professional, licensed barber. If you know anything about giving a crisp line up then you know that you need sharp trimmers. They key to the best trimmers are super thin bottom blades, and how you adjust the top and bottom blade. The top and bottom blade should almost be flush. The manual says to leave 1/16th of an inch to 1/32nd of an inch between the two but this goes back to if you know anything about good trimmers. So I took them out of the box, and immediately realized the similarity to the andis t-outliner trimmer, in both size and weight, in fact the two are one the same besides the housing and only one other minor thing I noticed, the wall hanger is different. I also noticed that the teeth of the blade are deeper than your normal trimmer blade, almost exactly as deep as the pro mate blade. Pro mates are what I currently use and the way these trimmers came out of the box are just as good. ( I dont know it better yet, will know after using it a for a few days)Though I did remove the blade at an attempt to re-set them but there was alot of give in the cutter blade already so i just screwed the bottom blade back on and the blades set themselves perfectly. tested them out after oiling(which they need badly) and those babys cut CLEAN. I am excited to try them out with designs, Alex Campbell (atlanta&#x27;s number one barber) has a youtube video and he cuts the Georgia \\&quot;G\\&quot; design with these same trimmers. DO NOT WASTE TIME WITH ANY OTHER TRIMMERS, THESE ARE THE ONES TO BUY!!!</li>
    <li> USED THESE TO CUT MANY HEAD AND IT CUTS AWESOME!  TRULY A PROFESSIONAL TRIMMER, ALSO AN ATTRACTIVE TRIMMER!  THOSE WHO DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW TO SET (ADJUST) YOUR TRIMMER TO CUT PROFESSIONALLY DON&#x27;T SEEM TO LIKE THESE, BUT THOSE WHO DO KNOW THAT THESE CLIPPERS AND FLAWLESS AND STAYS COOL ALWAYS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS MY SECOND SET AND WILL PURCHASE SEVERAL MORE TO STORE IN MY STORAGE FOR FUTURE USE!!!</li>
    <li> Great trimmers I use daily. Check my work out on Instagram @Nick_Da_barber I recommend these to everyone in my shop</li>
    <li> Product is Great really sharp very maintainable..great. I would pick this over the Andis t linners they don&#x27;t heat up as fast as those trimmers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber just wanted to give comments on these trimmers. They work very good at fades tapering and line ups. Just make sure u pull the skin when u zero out the bottom of ur cut very sharp out the box. Thanks forfex awesome trimmer.</li>
    <li> Once they are zero gapped, they give the cleanest line up this side of the GTXs and Detailers.  Great trimmer.</li>
    <li> I just bought these and a few other pairs of outliners, and so far these have surprised me.  I have the andis styliner 2, wahl detailer, I have used the andis t-outliner, and these are just as good if not better than all of them.  They cut extremely well and give sharp lines out of the box.  I was actually excited to use them once I started because of how well they perform.  I did three haircuts and shape ups last night and the outliners did not get hot at all, which can be a major issue with the andis t-outliners.  The t blade on this trimmer performs really well, and it did not bite, cut or nick.  One of those shape ups was on a 4 year old and he had no complaints or issue at all, but a nice shape up in the end.  I am preparing to buy a couple more.</li>
    <li> This is a good pair of trimmers, I purchased this trimmer because I heard this would be the sharpest pair of trimmers on the market. They are sharp but not the sharpest I have purchased, &amp; ready for use. I do like this tool and think is of good quality for a very good price. You won&#x27;t go wrong with a pair of Conair.</li>
    <li> First of all, arrived fast almost too fast and solid packaging. This trimmer is half the price of Andis t-outliners and is just as strong and sharpe. I think the andis is a bit stronger but not by much. If you don&#x27;t adjust them they work alright I did an edge up it pulled my hair a bit when I tilted it cut smoother but when you zero gap them they hit close and are even better.&lt;br /&gt;I took the cushion out when I adjusted them. Then I took the screw off the blades and zero gap them fast and fairly easy. 15 mins is all it took. Comparing to Andis they are equal but edge to the Babyliss for being cheaper. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Very clean edge sharp blade. It will not scratch or bite your client . Quite strong motor , and they stay cool during long use. For the price I brought a second pair, no need to adjust blade(0-gap). Only thing they should change is the color</li>
    <li> the clipper is junk, i think people who write good reviews about this product got paid to do so, unless someone can tell me how to adjust this product its junk don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It did not cut like I imagined it would but it is ok</li>
    <li> If you want a crisp, sharp line-up, these are it.  Great price and the quality is excellent.  Usually, the andis trimmers are the key to a good edge-up, but I tell you these are even sharper.  Would not recommend for personal use because they really are sharp, but as a professional, I love these and love the price!</li>
    <li> great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
    <li> Surprised with the quality of these trimmers. Lined myself up on one side of my head as I always do before putting new equipment on someone&#x27;s head. At this point they were right out of the box because I like to see how good equipment is without any modifications. Gave me an ok line up.  I zero gapped it and tried it on the other side and I was extremely surprised how it gave me an extra crisp line up. I definitely recommend these to any beginner looking for starting equipment. In fact they might be for experienced barbers looking for a backup trimmer. As for me, I think my T-outliners will be resting for a while and use these instead.</li>
    <li> They hit hard! I love them</li>
    <li> Great trimmer conair has risen to the top with this trimmer, actually better than andis t outliners bc it doesn&#x27;t get hot like those and gives crisp sharp lineups as well, great buy planning on buying a couple more bc at this price it want last long, I also put a modified andis shallow tooth blade on mine and it cuts even crisper bt the blade that comes with it is great too. I also hv the conair/forfex babyliss pro 690bx detachable blade clippers like the oster 76ers and they&#x27;re just as good as the 76ers if not better, so buy both if you&#x27;re looking for great clippers/  trimmers thumbs up to conair for these products!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a female barber who has been cutting haor for 12 years now...when I got these trimmers right out the box I tested them before adjusting them...the line wasn&#x27;t that sharp but it was visible...so I took the blade off and brought it right up to the edge...once I tightened the screws I got the cleanest line EVER...so for those saying they weren&#x27;t great you might want to learn how to adjust the blade then give it another go...I would SOOOO recommend these to anyone looking to get a super crisp line...</li>
    <li> I like this alot.  the gold color adds to it alot.  you will need to adjust the trimmers to your likings.  But mine worked perfect out the box.  its not so close but will do a better job with it adjusted to a sharper setting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and by far it&#x27;s the best liner I&#x27;ve ever used. The blades are sharp but not dangerously sharp. Out of the three liners that I already have, this is the one I use the most. What I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t get overly hot while in use for more than 5 minutes. It just stays warm at most. Which helps when keeping my lines tight.  I&#x27;ll keep using this one until it wears down. And even if that does happen, I can see myself buying this trimmer again.</li>
    <li> Good product. As good or even better than the andis outliners. Only bad thing about this trimmers had make some adjustments. But overall highly recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I was extremely dissapointed when I recieved this trimmer.  when I tried using the trimmer out of the box, instead of giving be a nice line up, it was pulling my hair.  Maybe I got a defected one because a lot of people claim that these trimmers are a bargain.  So since it wasn&#x27;t doing the job for me I decided to try to adjust the blades.  Now, first of all the screws are not the regular phillips, they are hex screws.  luckily I have a hex screw driver and was able to take one screw out.  the second screw was in so tight that I stripped the screw.  What kind of mess is this???  This is a dissapointment upon dissapointment.  I don&#x27;t even want to look at them anymore, I&#x27;m throwing them away because they&#x27;re TRASH!!!!  I gave them 2 stars just because I like the gold color.  Hex screws? Who uses hex screw??</li>
    <li> this trimmer is just as good as the andis T Outliner. you can use the same blades as the andis T outliner also.&lt;br /&gt;this trimmer is very good.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase.  Been using these instead of my wahl detailers just to get use to them.  So far they work great, these may be my go to trimmer from now on.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer for the price I bought it along with a promate plasma blade, (doesn&#x27;t overheat like the Andi&#x27;s t outliner I have both) but fresh out of the box it wasn&#x27;t zero gapped. I zero gapped it multiple times watched several YouTube videos on zero gapping blades HOWEVER the stock cutting blade was rough, it pulled a little so I put the other blade on and it works perfectly. 5  stars with the blade changed but 4 stock.</li>
    <li> The Conair trimmer works great. It does not snag hair and is easy to use. Highly recommend if you want  a light trim.</li>
    <li> i use it a home and so far so good!</li>
    <li> Been working with these trimmers for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had no problems with them. Very solid and powerful, use them as my work horses pair and every cut comes out great. I use them for about 2 weeks before adjusting the blade. Love them so much about to purchase more Babyliss products</li>
    <li> Love this thing, only worry is that it has a Gold Titanium Coating, even though it says will it eventually wear off?? And it has Allen Screw to hold the blades in, I&#x27;m sure I can find new screw to replace them if they&#x27;re stripped. But over all great product.</li>
