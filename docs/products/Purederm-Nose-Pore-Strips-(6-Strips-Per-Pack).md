      <li>i think i like them better than the biore kind</li>
      <li>and they leave the surface of the nose very smooth.</li>

      <li>I love that the strips contain charcoal and NO parabens.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I WILL be buying more of these and recommending them to everyone I know.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and these worked great for me.</li>
      <li>i was good though out the whole week.</li>
      <li>Then the strips do not come easily off your skin</li>
      <li>I really think these strips are effective that way</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t see much difference between these and biore.</li>
      <li>But, thank goodness because now my nose looks super clean and blackhead free!</li>
      <li>This made it super easy for me to see all of the blackheads that were removed from my nose and boy...</li>
      <li>Did a fantastic job the first time, simply okay after that.</li>
      <li>Nothing special, but it does work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never used pore strips before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but these are magical.</li>
      <li>These smell super.</li>
      <li>It is important that you first use warm water to wash your face to let your pores open.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the right pore strips for a while, none I&#x27;ve found have worked.</li>
      <li>just so it could sit right on the curves of  my nose.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re good if your blackheads are not totally massive, but I&#x27;ve turned to other brands like Biore for more helpful results.</li>
      <li>Only took 15 minutes and my nose was clean and blackhead free :) Will definitely keep purchasing!</li>
      <li>First time I used them I saw a difference .</li>
      <li>First time to try.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be that much!</li>
      <li>Lastly, make sure to close your pores using toner or an iced bottle of water to compress your nose against it.</li>
      <li>The smell would&#x27;nt bother me as much if it would work right ifit</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel they did anything very much.</li>
      <li>I pretty much had to hold the sheet on my nose</li>
      <li>These strips work really well if you know the correct way to use them.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have super-intense blackheads, but I just wanted a strip to remove some of them.</li>
      <li>I have used all of them in my pack every  3-4 days, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>I really like these.</li>
      <li>These do kind of smell and harden making it painful to remove, which kind of makes me dread the process.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these pore strips.</li>
      <li>But i used it twice so far because i have build up on my nose .</li>
      <li>They do not irrirate my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The cool part is that since they&#x27;re made of charcoal, the strips are black.</li>
      <li>, I was shocked how great they worked.</li>
      <li>This is a general nose strip.</li>
      <li>Apparently, some people in the reviews say that this is instant, which it&#x27;s totally not.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t really have super-intense blackheads, but I just wanted a strip to remove some of them. I have used all of them in my pack every  3-4 days, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. Apparently, some people in the reviews say that this is instant, which it&#x27;s totally not. If it does work, it seems to be over the course of all the strips. These do kind of smell and harden making it painful to remove, which kind of makes me dread the process. They&#x27;re good if your blackheads are not totally massive, but I&#x27;ve turned to other brands like Biore for more helpful results.</li>
    <li> Did a fantastic job the first time, simply okay after that. I use them about once each week. Compared to other nose strips, these are about the same.</li>
    <li> Came a little early. Box was kinda beat up. They work okay but not awesome. Took some blackheads off but not all. ive only used one so I might buy them again if the rest work better.</li>
    <li> Was suppose to have 6 only receive four in the box</li>
    <li> Works alright, I didn&#x27;t think it was great, but it did get rid of quite a number of blackheads.</li>
    <li> I would give it 0 stars if I could. I bought it to remove some blackheads from my nose. I followed the directions precisely but the result was just disappointing. Also the strips stink and you have to tolerate that for 15 mins. Then the strips do not come easily off your skin and you have to wash it away.</li>
    <li> My nose has a lot of black heads on it and these strips only rip out about a third of them, i follow all of the steps. They do not irrirate my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see much difference between these and biore.</li>
    <li> First time to try. Probably will need to try more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used pore strips before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but these are magical. Only took 15 minutes and my nose was clean and blackhead free :) Will definitely keep purchasing!</li>
    <li> This product works as one would expect from pore strips. I gave it 3 stars bc it was not more then normal quality.</li>
    <li> very good product for the price</li>
    <li> This is a general nose strip. You could probably buy the same thing from your dollar store. This isn&#x27;t the holy grail of nose strips, but it does get the usual amount of blackheads off. Nothing special, but it does work. I would say about 40-60% of your blackheads will be removed.</li>
    <li> These strips work really well if you know the correct way to use them. It is important that you first use warm water to wash your face to let your pores open. After you apply the strip, wait till it dries and tear it out from the roots of the blackheads, which means to remove it from the bottom. Lastly, make sure to close your pores using toner or an iced bottle of water to compress your nose against it. I really think these strips are effective that way and they leave the surface of the nose very smooth.</li>
    <li> The charcoal aspect of this product is what got me. I love charcoal products after trying Origins charcoal mask and seeing how bright it makes my skin look. These nose strips were no different! Initially, there&#x27;s a subtle scent of charcoal which can linger on the nose even after use, but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. What impressed me was how nicely these nose strips worked! The cool part is that since they&#x27;re made of charcoal, the strips are black. This made it super easy for me to see all of the blackheads that were removed from my nose and boy...I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be that much! But, thank goodness because now my nose looks super clean and blackhead free! I definitely recommend this to anyone even if they don&#x27;t have obvious blackheads because they&#x27;re definitely in/on there.</li>
    <li> These smell super. Chemically and only work as well as the biore. However THESE will leave marks on your nose if you don&#x27;t scrub it afterwards</li>
    <li> YES YES YES!! I COULD FEEL AND SEE A DIFFERENCE, even though i only bought 5 when I ran out i was good though out the whole week. Im soo buying more!</li>
    <li> These strips are great. First time I used them I saw a difference .</li>
    <li> they work great! i think i like them better than the biore kind</li>
    <li> these work great. not messy like other masks. great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Um, no! This is crap-stick with Biore. They don&#x27;t stick well nor do they remove blackheads as advertised. The odor is also offensive to me...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel they did anything very much. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like these. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I hate that it smells. But i used it twice so far because i have build up on my nose . I cant really tell if it worked because i used it wrong the 2nd time but other than that i guess it okay .</li>
    <li> The sheet is too stiff and does not curve to the shape of your nose, and it has a smell to it. The smell would&#x27;nt bother me as much if it would work right ifit was more flexible it would work. It did take black heads out but I had to fight the stiffnes of the sheet. I pretty much had to hold the sheet on my nose the 10-15mins just so it could sit right on the curves of  my nose.</li>
    <li> It is cheap and does a great job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the right pore strips for a while, none I&#x27;ve found have worked. I&#x27;m SO glad I found these, I was shocked how great they worked. I WILL be buying more of these and recommending them to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Yeah, they don&#x27;t do anything. They don&#x27;t even stick to the nose properly. Terrible product, do not buy it.</li>
    <li> Always loved these strips and the quality is the same online: superb.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love that the strips contain charcoal and NO parabens. I have sensitive skin and these worked great for me. Definitely cleared out my pores. Highly recommend these pore strips.</li>
