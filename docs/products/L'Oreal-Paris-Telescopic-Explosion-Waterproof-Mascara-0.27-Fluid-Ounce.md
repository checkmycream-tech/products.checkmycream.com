      <li>I love this mascara wand.</li>
      <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>love the brush and the product.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Wish I could order more of these, have not found them.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I love L&#x27;Oreal mascara</li>
      <li>I chose this product because I had purchased it in a store and found the applicator was so much better than any</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I found this particular mascara at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This wand works great for a natural look, doesn&#x27;t clump and leaves my lashes curled all day.</li>
      <li>I makes it easy to cover all your lashes for all angles.</li>
      <li>It is great for the outer edges of my upper lashes, and the lower lashes too.  </li>
      <li>Great for people who do makeup daily and need a quick tool instead of a huge brush for lower lashes</li>
      <li>Yup this mascara is worth it !</li>
      <li>but if you like bold lashes don&#x27;t use this alone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 6 other mascaras, including clinique, volume express, lancome, mac, great lash, colossal, etc.</li>
      <li>Just right.  </li>
      <li>Does not cover very much.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>and it looked new and unique.  </li>
      <li>and she absolutely appreciated it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different, but good different.</li>
      <li>I ordered a total of 4 mascaras and the first two were fine.  </li>
      <li>It does, however, make it really easy to get all those tiny lashes in the corner or under your eyes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The round wand is the best type to get at small lashes in the corners.  </li>
      <li>I happened to look on the back of the package and it said that a special eye make-up remover should be used to remove it.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular item again, although I will stick with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>The actual mascara seems to be as good as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s usual</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re willing to carry around two separate mascaras, one for the main job and one for the tiny lashes, this may be the product for you.</li>
      <li>For all of those that said it&#x27;s clumpy - try sliding it in and out the the tube a few times and it will smooth out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wand is so small and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend if you like the natural look</li>
      <li>make lashes look fuller but natural, not like those ridiculous heavy things so popular now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping. Does not cover very much.</li>
    <li> Wish I could order more of these, have not found them.  I love them.</li>
    <li> She asked me to look for this in retail stores, and when I didn&#x27;t find it, I searched and found it here. She was delighted because she said nothing else works this well and she absolutely appreciated it!</li>
    <li> Another product taken off the market???  It is a great brush for separating and lashes look great.  Had to give 5 stars...</li>
    <li> I ordered a total of 4 mascaras and the first two were fine.  My second order I was very disappointed because one of the mascara packages was broken open and the other mascara had beige makeup all over the back of the packaging.  I ordered these to use as stocking stuffers and cannot use them as is.</li>
    <li> this mascara makes my lashes look amazing. I like that I can do a few lashes at a time. This is definately the best mascara I have tried. Makes my lashes look longer and more seperated. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. The wand is perfect to reach into close to the corners.</li>
    <li> good product.  Can&#x27;t find locally.  Good to know that I can find almost anything I want at Amazaon.com.</li>
    <li> Great for people who do makeup daily and need a quick tool instead of a huge brush for lower lashes</li>
    <li> I love this mascara &amp; the wand in it is especially great...I makes it easy to cover all your lashes for all angles.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this in the store anywhere. I love this mascara wand. I have thin, little eyelashes and this wand makes it easier to coat my lashes.</li>
    <li> Yup this mascara is worth it ! I only use waterproof and it last all day even the next day too ! Love it !</li>
    <li> Wand was not included with my order, only the tube of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to return it, I learned it wasn&#x27;t possible because of the &amp;#34;flammable&amp;#34; contents.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have an unusable tube of mascara that I cannot return with no wand.&lt;br /&gt;Money wasted.</li>
    <li> The ball tip applies the mascara in a way that lengthens and separates the lashes. It&#x27;s different, but good different.</li>
    <li> I have lashes that once curled and put mascara on they instantly fall no matter what. But not with this mascara. The ONLY one that keeps em up until I take it off with remover.</li>
    <li> The round wand is the best type to get at small lashes in the corners.  It actually helps them curl too without clumping..  Just right.  Discontinued from stores...so I am happy to find online.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I love L&#x27;Oreal mascara and it looked new and unique.  The problem is the wand.  It feels very fragile and like it is going to snap off every time you pull it out of the tube. It does, however, make it really easy to get all those tiny lashes in the corner or under your eyes. If you&#x27;re willing to carry around two separate mascaras, one for the main job and one for the tiny lashes, this may be the product for you. I don&#x27;t want to have to do that. The actual mascara seems to be as good as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s usual but I just can&#x27;t get used to the tiny wand.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this particular item again, although I will stick with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I found this particular mascara at Amazon.  I like the small brush head.  It is great for the outer edges of my upper lashes, and the lower lashes too.  I don&#x27;t get mascara all over me and it lasts a good while.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter. Everything went perfect with the order. I encountered no problems. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I started using this mascara about 4 years ago and haven&#x27;t found a better mascara since. I&#x27;ve tried about 6 other mascaras, including clinique, volume express, lancome, mac, great lash, colossal, etc. and all of them straightened out my lashed. I&#x27;m Native American and have very straight lashes that, when curled, have a tough time remaining curled. This wand works great for a natural look, doesn&#x27;t clump and leaves my lashes curled all day. I love this! I&#x27;d definitely recommend if you like the natural look but if you like bold lashes don&#x27;t use this alone. When I want a dramatic look I use this as a base coat so my lashes remain curled and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara for the bottom lashes and you can get all of them .and Al&#x27;s for the top will be ordering again</li>
    <li> so happy to find these as they are no longer available in stores.  love the brush and the product. wears well and is truly waterproof.  make lashes look fuller but natural, not like those ridiculous heavy things so popular now.</li>
    <li> I have used a wand type mascara in the past by Cover Girl &amp; it wasn&#x27;t nearly as difficult to apply.  It seems like the mascara is weak &amp; you have to apply several times to even see it.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. The wand is so small and easy to use. For all of those that said it&#x27;s clumpy - try sliding it in and out the the tube a few times and it will smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job lengthening and separating. I don&#x27;t understand why all mascara doesn&#x27;t come with little wand tips like this.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I used Cover Girl Marathon mascara. I teach aerobics both on land and water, and so I needed something that would not smudge when I sweat or when I&#x27;m in the pool. Cover Girl must have changed their formula because the last time I bought a Marathon mascara, it smeared and got into my eyes during class. I tried other \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; mascara but none seemed to work. I stopped using mascara altogether until I ran into L&#x27;Oreal Telescope Explosion Waterproof mascara. I happened to look on the back of the package and it said that a special eye make-up remover should be used to remove it. All the other brands said that you can wash it off with soap and water. I gave it a try, and it works! It does not smudge off in the pool or when I sweat. The best thing about it is Amazon has the best price on it!</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I had purchased it in a store and found the applicator was so much better than any I have ever used.  I was not able to find it in the store (I am limited to availability of stores).  Even if I did not like the mascara (which I do) I wanted the applicator.</li>
