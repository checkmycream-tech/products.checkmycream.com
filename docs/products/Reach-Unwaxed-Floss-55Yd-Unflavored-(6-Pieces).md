      <li>Ideally, use Glide first and then Reach</li>
      <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but I think it&#x27;s important to give this floss a great review!</li>
      <li>This arrived quickly which is always a good thing.  </li>
      <li>Cleans better than waxed floss</li>
      <li>So glad I can still get this online.</li>
      <li>After reading that unwaxed floss cleans better than waxed floss, I purchased the Reach Unwaxed Floss 6 pack.</li>
      <li>The upside is that it works so much better in cleaning than a product like Glide.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been flossing for many years and have always had a problem finding a floss that wouldn&#x27;t tear apart as you used it.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it on line.</li>
      <li>People who love this must have visible gaps between their teeth.</li>
      <li>In my experience, unwaxed floss does a better job of cleaning.</li>
      <li>It feels like it works better than waxed floss to me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t slip too easily through my teeth.  </li>
      <li>it hurt my teeth to use this floss, and I don&#x27;t think it got them any more clean than milder stuff.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this floss because it&#x27;s unwaxed and unflavored.  </li>
      <li>After using one piece its now pain free.</li>
      <li>J&amp;J&#x27;s Reach Unwaxed floss does a great job and doesn&#x27;t easily break or shred, as just about every other floss on the market I&#x27;ve tried has done.</li>
      <li>Having no coating on the floss enables a lot of friction that gets your teeth really clean.</li>
      <li>I could keep my teeth clean and avoid plaque, so wonderful!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some folk might prefer those types, but if you want to make sure your teeth are really and truly clean in between</li>
      <li>If your teeth are close together, don&#x27;t bother with this, although others, presumably with decent spaces between their teeth, seem to love it.</li>
      <li>I love this simple product so much, that I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and cheap price.</li>
      <li>Thanks for keeping it available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a whole box, and my teeth feel so clean.</li>
      <li>Which I find hard to understand since it cleans so much better than the waxed kind.</li>
      <li>I only use unwaxed dental floss because I think it cleans better than waxed and since retail stores have basically stopped carrying it, I decided to order a bunch from amazon.</li>
      <li>four score and seven years ago our forefather brought forth to this country some hot dogs, beer and whiskey and pasta</li>
      <li>(That should last a while:)</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!</li>
      <li>and this is exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>Just had to give up, it caused so much pain in my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
      <li>Has not broken so far&lt;</li>
      <li>literally scraping (gently) between teeth to keep plaque and staining to an absolute minimum.</li>
      <li>I always get compliments from my dentist about my &#x27;at home maintenance&#x27; once I switched floss - who knew it would make that much of a difference.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be very surprised at how much you pull off your teeth when first using this.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it broke repeatedly and I had to keep getting a new strand.</li>
      <li>My teeth simply don&#x27;t feel clean without it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands of unwaxed/unflavored floss because the stores do not carry this particular product anymore.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m sure this is fine if you&#x27;re looking for something really intense, but i found it extremely difficult to use.</li>
      <li>This floss grabs stuff better and it is strong, yet still thin enough to work.</li>
      <li>Normal floss slips past stuff on your teeth as easily as it slips over your teeth.</li>
      <li>Love this brand of unwaxed floss and hard to find.</li>
      <li>I love ordering  from Amazon for hard to find items.</li>
      <li>Untaxed dental floss is so hard to find, it&#x27;s the only kind my husband will use.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find unwaxed floss in stores near me, so I order it.  </li>
      <li>to your good health!!&lt;br /&gt;SHOP AMAZON.COM where seriously savvy, shoppers shop!!</li>
      <li>Nice quality - does not easily catch between teeth and break as other floss does.</li>
      <li>Unwaxed floss seems to REALLY get your teeth clean while the waxed just slides across everything (which seems so pointless!).</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>And why not make flossing as easy as possible, since it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s not much fun to do but so necessary?</li>
      <li>well, I&#x27;ve completely gotten away from waxed floss for several years now and will only use this particular brand of unwaxed.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shred between my teeth like some other flosses, but I&#x27;m also recently out of braces, so I don&#x27;t  have many tight spots.</li>
      <li>This floss is extremely thin, and shreds easily.</li>

<li> This floss is extremely thin, and shreds easily.</li>
<li> using waxed for years, and while my teeth are tight, they are not what dentists would call super tight.  </li>
<li> Long story short, after trying multiple brands of toothpaste and floss, I had to stop using those products and just brush with water.</li>
<li> so is long lasting.</li>
<li> individual packs are sealed for long term storage.</li>
<li> Have been using it for years, but has become harder to find in local stores.</li>
<li> My only comment is that this floss is pretty thin -</li>
<li> The unwaxed floss will hurt your gums at first but thats because your gums are weak.</li>
<li> However, to reduce plastic waste, I would prefer the same total yardage in one or two dispensers instead of six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days, but my teeth already feels cleaner with less plaque build-up.&lt;br</li>
<li> Item works as expected.  </li>
<li> I prefer unwaxed floss which is harder to find that one might think</li>
<li> Came when expected</li>
<li> I have been having a very hard (ok, impossible) time finding unwaxed floss in stores where I live.  </li>
<li> Floss was harder to solve until I tried this!</li>
<li> The downside is that the lack of &amp;#34;slipperyness&amp;#34; to the floss makes it difficult to get between certain very tightly contacted teeth.</li>
<li> This floss is a little thicker</li>
<li> With the force I have to apply, I end up cutting off the circulation to my fingers, and even cutting through my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a strong, tough guy, and I really pushed myself to give this another go, night after night.  </li>
<li> Although it&#x27;s unwaxed, it&#x27;s thin and slippery enough to get into the tight spots.</li>
<li> Yet it&#x27;s thin enough to get between teeth.</li>
<li> /&gt;- Plastic waste</li>
<li> My teeth are very tight, so this may not be a problem for others.</li>
<li> I like this dental floss because it isn&#x27;t as thin as some of the other brands of unwaxed floss I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

    <li> i&#x27;m sure this is fine if you&#x27;re looking for something really intense, but i found it extremely difficult to use. it hurt my teeth to use this floss, and I don&#x27;t think it got them any more clean than milder stuff.</li>
    <li> Unwaxes, unflavored, just what Grandma wanted.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of unwaxed floss and hard to find.</li>
    <li> Great floss.  I don&#x27;t experience any shredding.  I think partly its the flossing technique that can cause shredding, but what do I know.  Works for me anyhow.</li>
    <li> arrived as advertised.  six pack of individual floss packs, with 55 yards of unwaxed floss each.  individual packs are sealed for long term storage.</li>
    <li> I prefer an unwaxed, non flavored floss and this is perfect. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously hard to get between teeth.  With the force I have to apply, I end up cutting off the circulation to my fingers, and even cutting through my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a strong, tough guy, and I really pushed myself to give this another go, night after night.  Just had to give up, it caused so much pain in my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using waxed for years, and while my teeth are tight, they are not what dentists would call super tight.  People who love this must have visible gaps between their teeth.</li>
    <li> I like this dental floss a lot. I was glad to find it on line. It is very difficult to find unwaxed dental floss in stores. Which I find hard to understand since it cleans so much better than the waxed kind. Thanks for keeping it available.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find unwaxed floss in stores near me, so I order it.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t slip too easily through my teeth.  It feels like it works better than waxed floss to me.</li>
    <li> Waxed dental floss does not scrape my teeth. It feels like it just slips over them. With unwaxed floss, I can feel it working and scraping. I was beginning to think I would never find any uwaxed floss again until I went to Amazon and found what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy, I did my &amp;#34;Happy Dance!&amp;#34; Again, Amazon made my day: I could keep my teeth clean and avoid plaque, so wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I bought a pack of 6 containers of unwaxed floss. (That should last a while:) Remember brushing and flossing are both&lt;br /&gt;advantageous to your good health!!&lt;br /&gt;SHOP AMAZON.COM where seriously savvy, shoppers shop!! (Great pricing, too!)</li>
    <li> I only use unwaxed dental floss because I think it cleans better than waxed and since retail stores have basically stopped carrying it, I decided to order a bunch from amazon. I like this dental floss because it isn&#x27;t as thin as some of the other brands of unwaxed floss I&#x27;ve tried.  If the floss is too thin it has a tendency to break if it gets caught on a filling between the teeth.  This floss is a little thicker so it&#x27;s sturdier but still fits between the teeth.  It is my go to dental floss.</li>
    <li> If you like waxless and flavorless floss, then this is perfect for you.  My only comment is that this floss is pretty thin - I prefer a bit thicker, but it still works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth well. No wax or flavoring. Just good floss.</li>
    <li> four score and seven years ago our forefather brought forth to this country some hot dogs, beer and whiskey and pasta</li>
    <li> We prefer the unwaxed and unflavored over the waxed and flavored floss.  This works best for our family.  Have been using it for years, but has become harder to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> I prefer unwaxed dental floss, but the generic brands are awful.  The Johnson and Johnson brand cannot be found in my city.  I found it on Amazon  and ordered it.  It came just as I ran out of my last bit.</li>
    <li> Probably the best available on-line.</li>
    <li> Good price. Came when expected</li>
    <li> For those of you who have a severe problem getting floss between your teeth, the Reach unwaxed floss is probably not for you. But for me ... well, I&#x27;ve completely gotten away from waxed floss for several years now and will only use this particular brand of unwaxed. The thing I like about it is that you can develop some friction between tooth and floss ... literally scraping (gently) between teeth to keep plaque and staining to an absolute minimum. The Reach unwaxed floss is also fairly tough and seldom breaks off between teeth. Yet it&#x27;s thin enough to get between teeth. My teeth simply don&#x27;t feel clean without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard to find, at least in my area. So thank goodness for Amazon ...</li>
    <li> Normal floss slips past stuff on your teeth as easily as it slips over your teeth. This floss grabs stuff better and it is strong, yet still thin enough to work.</li>
    <li> I used to think that floss was floss.  But since I am now a flossing expert after having to wear invisalign braces which are removable, I know there is definitely a difference.  This unwaxed floss definitely catches particles that the waxed and glide types do not catch.  Some folk might prefer those types, but if you want to make sure your teeth are really and truly clean in between then you need this brand (strength) and unwaxed (effectiveness).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing for many years and have always had a problem finding a floss that wouldn&#x27;t tear apart as you used it. J&amp;J&#x27;s Reach Unwaxed floss does a great job and doesn&#x27;t easily break or shred, as just about every other floss on the market I&#x27;ve tried has done. And, finding such a floss that&#x27;s unwaxed just adds to my satisfaction with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this floss! I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands of unwaxed/unflavored floss because the stores do not carry this particular product anymore. Unwaxed floss seems to REALLY get your teeth clean while the waxed just slides across everything (which seems so pointless!). You&#x27;ll be very surprised at how much you pull off your teeth when first using this. I always get compliments from my dentist about my &#x27;at home maintenance&#x27; once I switched floss - who knew it would make that much of a difference. So glad I can still get this online. Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Item works as expected.  Un-waxed floss is sometimes hard to find.  Purchasing multipack saves time and aggravation of searching.</li>
    <li> Excellent floss.  Drugstore and grocery stores no longer seem to carry unwaxed floss.  Thank you Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Having no coating on the floss enables a lot of friction that gets your teeth really clean. The downside is that the lack of &amp;#34;slipperyness&amp;#34; to the floss makes it difficult to get between certain very tightly contacted teeth. The upside is that it works so much better in cleaning than a product like Glide.  Ideally, use Glide first and then Reach and you have the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> This floss is not as good as it use to be, but stlll probably the best for unwaxed unflavored floss.</li>
    <li> I like an unflavored, unwaxed floss, this one works well for me and each dispenser holds a lot of floss so is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Unwaxed dental floss is so very hard to find.  Did all the dentist get together to ban unwaxed floss? If you like it buy it anywhere you can find it.  I found mine here.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected.  And in this day and age, that is often not the case.&lt;br /&gt;Great service too.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this floss because it&#x27;s unwaxed and unflavored.  It doesn&#x27;t shred between my teeth like some other flosses, but I&#x27;m also recently out of braces, so I don&#x27;t  have many tight spots.</li>
    <li> Untaxed dental floss is so hard to find, it&#x27;s the only kind my husband will use.  I love ordering  from Amazon for hard to find items.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and cheap price.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to find unwaxed floss in local stores.  It works the best for me and now I can get it automatically with Amazon &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34;...  I always get good dental hygiene reports from my dentist when I use unwaxed floss.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This floss is extremely thin, and shreds easily. The first time I used it, it broke repeatedly and I had to keep getting a new strand. It finally broke off and stuck in my teeth and I had to stop for 30 minutes and figure out how to get it out. I though I might have to go to the dentist to get it extracted, but I finally succeeded in clearing the stuck piece out from between my teeth. If your teeth are close together, don&#x27;t bother with this, although others, presumably with decent spaces between their teeth, seem to love it.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but I think it&#x27;s important to give this floss a great review! I began to have sensitivity to toothpaste, mouth rinses and floss after having a baby. I don&#x27;t know if it was the baby or just my body just developing another sensitivity. I would get red, flaky patches all around my lips that would go away after using cortizone cream, but would always come back. Long story short, after trying multiple brands of toothpaste and floss, I had to stop using those products and just brush with water. Floss was harder to solve until I tried this! This is just floss.. That&#x27;s it. No flavors, no waxes. I&#x27;ve gone through a whole box, and my teeth feel so clean. I love this simple product so much, that I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly which is always a good thing.  I prefer unwaxed floss which is harder to find that one might think and this is exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This floss is resistant to breaking and very effective at removing particles and tartar. Although it&#x27;s unwaxed, it&#x27;s thin and slippery enough to get into the tight spots. In my experience, unwaxed floss does a better job of cleaning. If you floss once per day, a 6-pack of these should last one person about 2 years. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thicker than I was expecting, and too thick to work on my molars. I prefer the unscented unwaxed from CVS because it&#x27;s thinner, but J&amp;J Reach has sturdier packaging.</li>
    <li> Just what my dentist recommended. Nice quality - does not easily catch between teeth and break as other floss does.</li>
    <li> The unwaxed floss will hurt your gums at first but thats because your gums are weak. After using one piece its now pain free.</li>
    <li> After reading that unwaxed floss cleans better than waxed floss, I purchased the Reach Unwaxed Floss 6 pack. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days, but my teeth already feels cleaner with less plaque build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that it tends to shred. My teeth are very tight, so this may not be a problem for others. However, even if it shreds, it has not broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price for the 6 pack is good. However, to reduce plastic waste, I would prefer the same total yardage in one or two dispensers instead of six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans better than waxed floss&lt;br /&gt;- Has not broken so far&lt;br /&gt;- Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Tends to shred a little&lt;br /&gt;- Plastic waste</li>
    <li> I have been having a very hard (ok, impossible) time finding unwaxed floss in stores where I live.  I don&#x27;t like waxed floss because it&#x27;s so slippery when it gets in contact with saliva.  And why not make flossing as easy as possible, since it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s not much fun to do but so necessary? This floss is perfect and thus the 5 stars. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it.</li>
