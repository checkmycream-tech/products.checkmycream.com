<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the Brain-Aid blend! All of Plant Therapy&#x27;s products are great.  They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  I love doing business with this company.</li>
    <li> Smells great and stimulates the brain waves</li>
    <li> This was supposed come with my diffuser I bought. It did not. However the company refunded me the cost of this product to make up for not getting it. It would have been nice if they sent me a bottle, but oh well. I see now the diffuser comes with germ fighter. Make sure if you&#x27;re buying the diffuser you get your oil that comes with. Still upset I haven&#x27;t been able to try this product and it has been six months since purchase. I do however have many plant therapy oils, including synergies I have never been disappointed with their oils. One of, if not my favorite essential oil company.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Very pleasant fragrance and works for focus.  I let my kids breathe it in on the way to school sometimes.  They love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago.  I made a few sachets that I have hanging in my office.  They smell great, but not overly scented or cloying.  It does help to clear the mind, I have been taking a big sniff of the sachet when I get stuck and the pleasant scent helps me to get going again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works well in my Salt Lamp Diffuser.</li>
    <li> I found the Bergamot scent overpowering. I gave it to my sister since she loves Bergamot so its still a happy ending!</li>
    <li> I thought the oils smelled great.  Tried them in a yoga class.  I bought a diffuser to go with them.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the benefit in this oil</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I actually feel like it does wake my brain up when I take a sniff of it at work.</li>
    <li> This product smells a bit off but and I haven&#x27;t felt a difference. Fun to use though. three more words</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping my brain but it smells nice. Citrus is the prominent scent.</li>
    <li> the oil good but leaked</li>
    <li> This smells quite good. Try it on the bottom of your feet or your big toes.</li>
    <li> I liked the fragrance of this oil, but don&#x27;t know if it helped my brain. I used it in my diffuser, so it didn&#x27;t really go very far. Will know better than to order the 10ml size next time, period.</li>
    <li> The aroma is good, not overpowering. I really like it, I don&#x27;t really know how it&#x27;s helping my brain, but it&#x27;s therapeutic and soothing.</li>
    <li> This really helped me concentrate while writing my thesis. Not sure if it was all in my head or not, but either way I don&#x27;t think that really matters.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this.  I finally got a diffuser so used that way for the first time today.  I think it helped as I was able to work all day even though I only got 5 hrs sleep last night!</li>
    <li> This works! I was skeptical at first, but no more. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> wonderful scent.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to determine if it improves my mental focus.</li>
    <li> We are enjoying the oil diffusing it in the house.  It smells very pleasant.</li>
    <li> the smell of it is a bit distracting to be quiet truthful, but i still use it and like it.</li>
    <li> only used once, seem to stay focused a little more. Will have to use longer before I can say if I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> wonderful scent.  It is also great for sinus infections.  Ha.  Not sure if I am any smarter but I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;Way cheaper than my health food store too.&lt;br /&gt;try it, you will love it.  Use the Casa Aroma Genie Ultrasonic Diffuser too.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells. I love bergamot, but I can&#x27;t be for certain if it actually improves focus and clarity. I&#x27;ve tried it several times, but it&#x27;s not a great deal of difference.</li>
    <li> I use this in the diffuser when the kids are doing home work</li>
    <li> good service. product didn&#x27;t help me focus.</li>
    <li> We like to use this blend when we need a little extra help concentrating. My husband is a teacher and writer and uses this when he has his office time to help wake him up and clear his mind. I like the smell of it too. It&#x27;s very similar to the Clarity blend from Young Living.</li>
    <li> I teach piano privately and tried this product to help my students focus on their lessons at the end of a long school day.  I really believe it helps after some experimentation.  I was worried that someone may have an allergic reaction to it, but have had no problems so far.</li>
    <li> As a stay at home mom I was looking for an oil to add to my collection to help me focus more so I can get more done through the day. We homeschool and a lot of times I find myself wandering around saying &amp;#34;now what was I going to do&amp;#34; haven&#x27;t used it yet. Really hope it helps. I did purchase the a+ attention for kids and this smells very similar and it truly does help my 7 year old to sit down and stay focused. I can definitely tell when I don&#x27;t use it on him. One drop on his shirt collar and it keeps him more calm and focused.</li>
    <li> I do not care very much for this product. I am sensitive to many smells, and this one bothers me. Probably a good product, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Essential oils are amazing.  The are natural and pure.  No more medicaitons for me or my family.&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage everyone to try them.</li>
    <li> Pleasant odor, invigorating.  Not sure how effective it actually is, but it&#x27;s pleasant to use.  I would buy it again.  The oils from this manufacturer, all seem to be of good quality so far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, but I do think I feel more alert and focused on the few occasions when I feel I need extra help staying focused and alert.</li>
    <li> The liquid runs out HEAVILY from under/around the stopper seal instead of from the tiny dropper when tipped to dispense thus WASTING TONS of the liquid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...that being said ... the fragrance is wonderful ... I may just transfer the liquid to a 1oz bottle with dropper that I have instead of returning it as defective; I haven&#x27;t decided yet ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star for defective bottle ... 5 stars for the fragrance</li>
    <li> My hubby has a slight forgetfulness so I got this for him...he likes it and thinks it is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it worked for him.</li>
    <li> I really liked the smell.. got it for my mother, but I wound up keeping it, since she&#x27;s not going to use it.  I&#x27;ve bought 5 other of Plant Therapy&#x27;s mixes and am very happy with them!  One, the Germ one, I put into a spray bottle to use on my pillow, or at various hotels we&#x27;ve stayed at.. Kill them germs!! and smells great!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite oils!</li>
    <li> This is awesome oil. I work full time and full time student as well. I definitely recommend this to all student.:) as I passed my ARDMS board. Physics board was really hard and it helped me out.</li>
    <li> I use this at work. Love the scent. It has that pick me up aroma to help me end my shift on time.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby for work. Unfortunately, it puts him to sleep! Maybe because his brain is focused on one thing he gets sleepy? I HATE the smell but my husband doesn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> I bought a Quooz diffuser and two types of essential oils.  The 1st one was ok, the 2nd (the Brain-Aid Synergy) we didn&#x27;t like at all.  I only used 2 drops in the diffuser and my husband immediately started complaining about the smell.  My son complained that his eyes were burning.  I ended up having to wash out the diffuser and threw the Brain-Aid Synergy out.  It was very strong and harsh, not a pleasant smell at all.  Guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying something scented on the internet...</li>
    <li> Order is ok. I diffuse. Not too fond of smell.</li>
    <li> Not bad, kind of a strange combination that I was hoping I&#x27;d like.  I think the basil and bergamot are a little overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, there&#x27;s something (maybe fennel) that lingers and makes me just want to eat my own arms up. The scent is refreshing and I might add some to some plain body wash or shampoo for a yummy yummy shower thing. I don&#x27;t know that it is helping me concentrate but it does help me to wake up and feel invigorated in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this blend! I put a few drops in a small bottle of lotion and put it on when I need a pick me up. Works like a charm and smells so good!</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, this really does work. Aromatherapy! And no drugs involved. That is a plus in itself. It smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> These oils hold up to the more expensive brands. I was not disappointed with this buy. I will try their others. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Really like it. Add it to my epsom salt baths.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is just the power of suggestion or what, but this stuff really seems to help me concentrate.  It smells good too!</li>
    <li> It does smell citrusy, but I also smell licorice as well.  It seems to pep me up when I use it in the late afternoon in my office.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it much, I am not sure if I enjoy the scent - I prefer a more citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I have had some lingering Lyme disease issues such as brain fog and forgetfullness. This oil helps me to think clearer and get on with the tasks at hand. I use this almost everyday!!</li>
    <li> this natural oil is better than awesome. this oil is totally great for the brain since it have make me really mentally active. Thanks</li>
    <li> using with humidifer works great, smells nice - need more words need more words need more words need more words</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the combination of eo&#x27;s in Brain Aid Synergy before.  This is a good mix.  Too soon to tell of its impact but certainly the properties of the oils have uplifting and stimulating attributes.  Like that it&#x27;s therapeutic grade.</li>
    <li> Trying this item first time and I like it an I think it is working and worth money thst I paid !!! Will order more thanks</li>
    <li> When I add a few drops to the diffuser, I do feel more energized.  The smell alone picks me up.</li>
    <li> Love it and it smells good!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything different and the smell is really terrible.</li>
