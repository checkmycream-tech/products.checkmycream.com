      <li>Isn&#x27;t the best but is cheaper than others.</li>
      <li>The item is very good.</li>
      <li>It is very good against acne process.</li>
      <li>I was really happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It works great to keep my semi zit prone skin under control.</li>
      <li>This toner is excellent, leaves skin clean, and smells great.</li>
      <li>Besides being good for that I wouldn&#x27;t say it does anything for my acne.</li>
      <li>so I thought this would be a good try.</li>
      <li>This was perfect - it&#x27;s a nice mild toner.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that Acne will vanish forever!</li>
      <li>is the absolute perfect combination!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s caused a bit of itching along my jaw and it does kind of make my skin feel a bit...sticky?</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s not a kit, you can just buy what you need and when so that is nice too.</li>
      <li>Its a good toner however it has a strong smell and alcohol in</li>
      <li>Neutrogena oil free acne stress toner is a good toner for the price.  </li>
      <li>At first it worked great.</li>
      <li>toner has a pleasant smell, not that it matters since I put something else on right after it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind this toner, but it is not my favorite either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
      <li>Whenever I have a blackheads attack I rub it generously on them and it makes them fade, mostly on my chin (my nose blackheads are too stubborn).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and hope I can keep buying it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>This does the trick for the most part, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits whatsoever, aside from cleaning the skin.</li>
      <li>I got more acne after using it</li>
      <li>It works great on me, it really eliminate oil and shine.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my all-time favorite toners.</li>
      <li>so when I saw that Neutrogena had an acne formula for about $6.50 at the grocery store, I was very excited.</li>
      <li>Keeps face feeling refreshed and very clean.</li>
      <li>It feels great, and my new regimen (all drug store products) is a lot cheaper than buying the likes of Proactive.</li>
      <li>It might have took a couple weeks for my skin to completely clear up, but so happy with it</li>
      <li>It helps clean my skin more after using cleanser.</li>
      <li>it is so strong of the alcohol smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good combo and decent price.</li>
      <li>Before that I used Murad toner for awhile, but this product is much more soothing on my skin, and far more effective.</li>
      <li>It works fine.</li>
      <li>The price is better than the drug stores and is delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>I use it morning and nights, and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in the amount of outbreaks in my skin.</li>
      <li>Looks like the blackheads on my nose have started to fade and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
      <li>Neutrogenia Oil free acne stress toner</li>
      <li>Even my sister commented on how smooth it looked.</li>
      <li>such as on and around the nose, and for men - folliculitis barbae - this is a great preventative treatment.  </li>
      <li>It really cleans your face!!!</li>
      <li>In short a pretty good product!</li>
      <li>It feels so fresh afterwards!</li>
      <li>It does cut through the oil to help keep your face clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;Basically I just use toners and astringents for quick clean ups when I don&#x27;t feel like messing with a wash rag, water and cleanser.</li>
      <li>I am 33 with fairly oily skin and occasional acne.</li>
      <li>My skin seems more oily much quicker when I use this.</li>
      <li>This oil free line from Neutrogena is great and costs less than the olay kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>And so far it&#x27;s been pretty effective.</li>
      <li>My pores became instantly smaller, and my skin felt amazing.</li>
      <li>, I also use a drop of the Clean and Clear moisturizer that is oil free</li>
      <li>It contains cucumber extract, which not only works wonders for your complexion, but offers a pleasant aroma as well.</li>
      <li>At best, I&#x27;d end up with about 5 bucks back about an hour&#x27;s worth of trouble - a number below the minimum wage.</li>
      <li>This does not dry out my skin like many pother products.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>I &#x27;ve been using toners for my oily face for more than 15 years, and definitely this is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>I am only using it once a day, so I am not drying my skin out, so it should not be overcompensating by producing more oil.</li>
      <li>Now I rarely get any blackheads thanks to this baby.</li>
      <li>At first, I do not like the smell at all</li>
      <li>It could be a little more strong though, maybe 4% salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>Now, anti-aging is not the purpose for using this product, but combining this product with others certainly erases those pesky signs of looking older!  </li>
      <li>I use a gentle salicylic cleanser along with a stronger spot treatment if needed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and leaves your skin so soft...</li>
      <li>but the seller had fast shipping item</li>
      <li>I am really liking this toner.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>Works really well for acne and keeping it under control.</li>
      <li>Dont notice much of a difference in my skin after using this for over a month now.</li>
      <li>but no to much.</li>
      <li>but now I know no matter how much I trust Amazon</li>
      <li>This cleared up my skin very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to have gone almost 40 years without any acne issues and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it for acne as most buyers of this product would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have KP too, and are curious about my regime:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with breakouts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I have used toners before, this one has really done to trick in heightening my skin regime for maintaining my KP.</li>
      <li>and this creates my own personalized lightweight, nearly sheer makeup that does just enough to even out my skin.</li>
      <li>Also it seems to work relatively well at both keeping your face clear and making it look more evenly toned</li>
      <li>The more I used the toner the more and worse</li>
      <li>I have discovered that washing my face with Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control cream cleanser followed with a swipe of this toner</li>
      <li>When your pores are clean they look smaller.</li>
      <li>Wipe your face with this and your skin feels instantly refreshed and clean.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and products with a high alcohol content</li>
      <li>I have mild adult acne and sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Realize that this is a Salicylic Acid treatment and therefore expect some results in being free of the dead cells on the face surface - similar to the treatment available in spas!  </li>
      <li>I like this product because it goes on lightly and won&#x27;t over dry your skin.</li>
      <li>Previously used this product and love amazon</li>
      <li>My job is SUPER stressful and my skin definitely pays the price.</li>
      <li>I must say, my skin is very clear now, and I&#x27;m not wearing as much make-up to hide my zits.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this toner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not allergic on the whole, but maybe my eyes are sensitive - in any case unusable.</li>
      <li>Though the company suggests applying it with a cotton ball, a better means of application will be by using the round compressed pledgets (readily available and inexpensive): the results are more controlled and the pledget can then be use for little touchups on other areas of the body.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It can dry out your skin a lot, but it does work.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Keeps face feeling refreshed and very clean. Works really well for acne and keeping it under control.</li>
    <li> Its a good toner however it has a strong smell and alcohol in it irritates sometimes. It did reduce my breakouts. In short a pretty good product!</li>
    <li> Dont notice much of a difference in my skin after using this for over a month now. Feels like putting alcohol on my face but cleans up some of the dirt left behind on my skin after washing it. Besides being good for that I wouldn&#x27;t say it does anything for my acne.</li>
    <li> It really cleans your face!!! Great fragrance! It&#x27;s fresh and leaves your skin so soft...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! Awesome product! I&#x27;m sure that Acne will vanish forever!</li>
    <li> I have mild adult acne and sensitive skin.  I used Proactive for more than 15 years, then over the last few years I&#x27;ve tried various other formulations of expensive salicylic acid/benzoyl peroxide skin care lines for acne.  Recently I decided to try this product, based on a review in a magazine.  I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for the last few weeks(after using a 2% salicylic acid face wash with a battery operated face cleansing brush) and occasionally dab on a little benzoyl peroxide cream (10%).  Sometimes I slap on a little oil-free moisturizer after applying this toner, but I don&#x27;t find this product to be very drying overall.  I must say, my skin is very clear now, and I&#x27;m not wearing as much make-up to hide my zits.  It feels great, and my new regimen (all drug store products) is a lot cheaper than buying the likes of Proactive.</li>
    <li> My skin was super clear, but my pores were looking a bit big so I decided it was time for a toner. At first it worked great. My pores became instantly smaller, and my skin felt amazing. I was really happy with my purchase. I used it for a week and half and suddenly I began to notice breakouts. At first I though it was from something else or just a random blemish, so I continued use. The more I used the toner the more and worse the breakouts got before my whole face was seriously broken out. I immediately stopped use and within a week my skin was starting to get clear again. I suggest trying a different product. It will save you a lot of time and frustration.</li>
    <li> I tried the Olay kit and did not like that at all. This oil free line from Neutrogena is great and costs less than the olay kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the wash daily (scrub once a week), toner daily and the hydrating cream daily. It&#x27;s a good combo and decent price. Since it&#x27;s not a kit, you can just buy what you need and when so that is nice too.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. Whenever I have a blackheads attack I rub it generously on them and it makes them fade, mostly on my chin (my nose blackheads are too stubborn). It could be a little more strong though, maybe 4% salicylic acid. I&#x27;m planning to buy a 30% salicylic acid peel soon and maybe a higher concentration that I could mix with other stuff so I can leave it on the skin like this toner (a concentration of 30% or higher needs to be washed after a few mins in contact with the skin). Also I found that when I use it on my whole face one or two days later it has a smoother texture and is shinier. A moisturizer immediately after the use of this product is a must.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my skin. Wipe your face with this and your skin feels instantly refreshed and clean. Would recommend to anybody!</li>
    <li> Two years ago my dermatologist prescribed me his \\&quot;secret formula\\&quot; toner, which had to be mixed at a compounding pharmacy and cost about $30 for 6 oz (insurance wouldnt pay for it). It worked miracles for my skin -- whenever I ran out and didn&#x27;t immediately spring for a refill, my forehead immediately broke out in blackheads. Well, I recently ran out, but I noticed some of the same ingredients on the label of this product, so I gave it a try. IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you are struggling with hormonal cystic acne, ask your dermatologist about a prescription for aldactone -- the other medicine that worked wonders for me!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this toner very long; only a few days. But I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin already. I&#x27;ve had a recent flare up along my jaw line because of a new birth control and have been trying to find products to ease it. I use a gentle salicylic cleanser along with a stronger spot treatment if needed so I thought this would be a good try. And so far it&#x27;s been pretty effective. Looks like the blackheads on my nose have started to fade and my skin feels so smooth. Even my sister commented on how smooth it looked. It does have a strong alcohol smell if you use too much so really just a thin layer should be applied as is directed. It&#x27;s caused a bit of itching along my jaw and it does kind of make my skin feel a bit...sticky? I&#x27;m not sure what the word is but using a moisturizer after helps with that.</li>
    <li> In my thirties and still get the occasional breakout. This toner is excellent, leaves skin clean, and smells great. It contains cucumber extract, which not only works wonders for your complexion, but offers a pleasant aroma as well. Unlike a lot of toners this doesn&#x27;t burn at all. If you suffer from pimples caused by stress and/or anxiety, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> after using this for about two weeks it started burning my skin so bad I couldn&#x27;t touch parts of my face because of how raw they were</li>
    <li> I wish I could post before and after pictures because after using this product to reduce blackheads on my nose, I developed acne over my entire face.  I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to have gone almost 40 years without any acne issues and since I started using this toner I went from 3-4 small pimples to 38 of them at my last count. Needless to say, I have stopped using and hope this is just some weird reaction and truly not a bad product on shelves.</li>
    <li> I give the product one star because it did nothing for me I got more acne after using it and I followed the instructions so this was not for me but the seller had fast shipping item came as described not 5 stars for seller just not the product itself.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well with regular moisturizer and the acne stress control power wash. I really like this product and I recommend it</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve been using toners for my oily face for more than 15 years, and definitely this is one of my favorites. It works great on me, it really eliminate oil and shine.  It dries a bit my face but no to much. I&#x27;ve  tried other Neutrogena toners and alwAys I get back to this one,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old with combination to oily skin. This product made me break out so bad. Will never use again!</li>
    <li> I have keratosis psoriasis which causes little white bumps to appear on the backs of my arms and front of my legs. They don&#x27;t itch, just aesthetically unappealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have used toners before, this one has really done to trick in heightening my skin regime for maintaining my KP. I don&#x27;t use it for acne as most buyers of this product would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have KP too, and are curious about my regime:&lt;br /&gt;1. DERMAdoctor KP Duty body scrub&lt;br /&gt;2. Neutrogenia Oil free acne stress toner&lt;br /&gt;3. Amlactin lotion</li>
    <li> Neutrogena oil free acne stress toner is a good toner for the price.  I have purchased it several times before and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t go a morning and night without using this stuff I will break out. Ive had red oily skin from acne and this stuff does help.</li>
    <li> This is one of my holy grail product. This is part of my skin care regimen. This is one of my all-time favorite toners. This does not burn your face like other toners do. It helps with my acne. I don’t use this every day. I use this maybe three times a week or when my skin is starting to act up such as when it is the time of the month or if I’m stressed out because of school. This helps get rid of my acne, help make it go away faster, and heal faster if I any of them pop open. This also helped me with my blackheads as well. I would get black heads around my chin area and mouth area. Now I rarely get any blackheads thanks to this baby. Highly recommend this toner.</li>
    <li> It does cut through the oil to help keep your face clean but I can&#x27;t say it helps in keeping acne under control.  It is a little drying but my skin is so oily I like it that way.</li>
    <li> Paying attention to the daily care of the face helps deter the sings of aging. Now, anti-aging is not the purpose for using this product, but combining this product with others certainly erases those pesky signs of looking older!  Given the long name of Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Triple Action Toner may seem daunting, but the uses of this product certainly has its place.  For those areas on the face where little spots of acne can occur (even well past the teenage years!) such as on and around the nose, and for men - folliculitis barbae - this is a great preventative treatment.  Cleanse the face (and neck) first, then apply the alcohol free toner by Neutrogena, wait a moment, and then apply this product in small amounts tot he affected areas.  If there is a general breakout of those incriminating signs of stress - tiny red bumps just suggesting that acne is imminent - then application over the entire face and neck is advisable.  Though the company suggests applying it with a cotton ball, a better means of application will be by using the round compressed pledgets (readily available and inexpensive): the results are more controlled and the pledget can then be use for little touchups on other areas of the body.  Realize that this is a Salicylic Acid treatment and therefore expect some results in being free of the dead cells on the face surface - similar to the treatment available in spas!  Another Amazon step in the direction of health!  Grady Harp, November 11</li>
    <li> I have slightly oily skin(T-zone area only), but haven&#x27;t had a break-out in a very long time.  So I bought this Stress Control Triple Action Toner thinking it will improve my skin. I used it all over my face and after a week of using, my chin broke out.  This toner did remove the oil from the skin but it also irritates it is someway.  I had two cysts on my chin that were very painful.  I had to use a 20% salicylic peel to shrink them.  They&#x27;re finally gone but I know this toner was the cause.  I will not buy Neutrogena again, especially after finding out that this company does animal testing.</li>
    <li> Previously used this product and love amazon so I thought why not just have it waiting on my door step for me? And it was on my doorstep. But the package was soaking wet. I couldn&#x27;t return it cause of the liquid policy which I totally understand but now I know no matter how much I trust Amazon I will not be ordering anything like this from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, at least I now know.</li>
    <li> The item is very good. Isn&#x27;t the best but is cheaper than others. It is very good against acne process.</li>
    <li> My stand by toner is very expensive, and not easy to find so when I saw that Neutrogena had an acne formula for about $6.50 at the grocery store, I was very excited. Because of the packaging I did not realize the alcohol content on this product (Alcohol Denat)  Is 40%. I also expected salicylic acid or another acne fighting ingredient in the formula, but cetyl lactate and akyl lactate are the only borderline acne fighters. I have very oily skin and products with a high alcohol content only increases oil production after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things I like about this product. It does seem to remove a lot of excess makeup and dirt even after washing my face. Despite the high alcohol content my face feels refreshed and not too tight right after use. finally it does not irritate or over dry skin like many toners I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: 20 something, acne prone, oily, semi sensitive, semi pigmented</li>
    <li> This cleared up my skin very well. I had used multiple products over the past 16 months. Proactiv worked for a while but it seemed like my skin built up an immunity or something. Then I switched to Neutrogena body clear body wash, which I used in addition to this product, and the 3-in-1 acne treatment, and the Neutrogena rapid clear pads. Finally, after combining all those products, I had fixed a lifelong problem! I highly recommend this product. After using it, you can see the dirt from your skin on the cotton balls, so you know it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
    <li> Best toner I&#x27;ve ever used! Cleans residual dirt and makeup left behind by cleanser. Not harsh on my sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea skin no monthly pimples since integrating into my routine. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for as long as I can remember. I use it to keep clear skin and remove my foundation at the end of the day. It works great to keep my semi zit prone skin under control. I&#x27;m 30 years old and it&#x27;s part of my anti aging regimen. It makes my skin feel clean and fresh. My job is SUPER stressful and my skin definitely pays the price. When I&#x27;m getting a little blotchy, I use this at night and it&#x27;s gone! The price is better than the drug stores and is delivered quickly. I&#x27;m sold! I&#x27;ll continue to use this and order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for a month and can see a big improvement on my skin. At first, I do not like the smell at all becausee it is so strong of the alcohol smell. Everytime I used it, I have to breath by my mouth or wet my cotton pad with water to dilute the alcohol. However, I just didn&#x27;t want to throw it away, and kept using it. It helps clean my skin more after using cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, it helps prevent future acnes, even my skin tone out and fade out my acne scars. I am using twice a day now. If you think it is too harsh for you, pour the toner on the wet cotton pad. It will help.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Doesn&#x27;t dry me out and removes additional gunk from me face! It feels so fresh afterwards! It doesn&#x27;t sting and it restores my face&#x27;s PH Balance. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts.</li>
    <li> I am 33 with fairly oily skin and occasional acne. I have discovered that washing my face with Neutrogena Deep Clean Shine Control cream cleanser followed with a swipe of this toner is the absolute perfect combination! I do this twice a day and my skin has never been clearer. It might have took a couple weeks for my skin to completely clear up, but so happy with it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I also use a drop of the Clean and Clear moisturizer that is oil free that has salicylic acid mixed with a drop of the Almay acne fighting makeup (sorry, forgot the exact name!) as my daily makeup.  I cannot stand the feel or look of makeup and this creates my own personalized lightweight, nearly sheer makeup that does just enough to even out my skin. My skin has never been smoother, clearer, and any little fine lines that have started to develop on my face are now nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this combination of products for about 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> Despite being in my 40s I continue to have a problem with acne.  This seems to control all my outbreaks.  I notice an increase in acne outbreaks when I don&#x27;t use this for several days.</li>
    <li> I am using this product along with several other products, so it is hard to single out one of the products, but I can say my acne is getting a little better. What seems to happen to me though is whenever I try a new product, my face breaks out really, really bad. So give it a few weeks for your face to get used to it before you throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner has a pleasant smell, not that it matters since I put something else on right after it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this product is that it burns! It gets borderline painful sometimes. It might just be the alcohol getting into my recently popped pimples. Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in the future with long-term results!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about a month ago. Before that I used Murad toner for awhile, but this product is much more soothing on my skin, and far more effective. I use it morning and nights, and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in the amount of outbreaks in my skin. Outbreaks also used to last much longer, now if I start to have an outbreak, I&#x27;ll use this and it will be gone in the morning. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it goes on lightly and won&#x27;t over dry your skin. Also it seems to work relatively well at both keeping your face clear and making it look more evenly toned</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new toner to replace what I had been using.  This was perfect - it&#x27;s a nice mild toner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It gets rid of dead skin and sucks dirt out of your pores even when you thought you were already clean. If you have blackheads, bumps on upper arms, dead skin, or just want to remove that last bit of makeup that is building up on your pores, this does the job. When your pores are clean they look smaller. This does not dry out my skin like many pother products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter to try a new product as some seem to become ineffective on her skin over time.  So far, this one is working out well for her.</li>
    <li> I like this toner for acne prone skin. It&#x27;s not too harsh and works well after cleansing and before moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, but I do get breakouts when I drink sodas and around menstrual cycle. I don&#x27;t mind this toner, but it is not my favorite either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with breakouts. My skin seems more oily much quicker when I use this. I am not prone to oily skin either, so this was odd. I am only using it once a day, so I am not drying my skin out, so it should not be overcompensating by producing more oil. I have used much harsher astringents in the past and never had an issue with oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin tends to be picky with what it likes me to use, but I had no irritation, dryness, or redness while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight medicinal smell (as with any toner/astringent) but it also has a honeysuckle scent to it as well, so keep that in mind if you do not like the smell of honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I just use toners and astringents for quick clean ups when I don&#x27;t feel like messing with a wash rag, water and cleanser. This does the trick for the most part, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits whatsoever, aside from cleaning the skin. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since it makes my skin oily for whatever strange reason and because it didn&#x27;t seem to help at all for random pimples or breakouts.</li>
    <li> I wrote the following email to Pharmapacks - the vender, and I think it about sums it up:&lt;br /&gt;What is the point of returning a 10 buck item that you are going to refuse because it&#x27;s been opened. It&#x27;s a liquid for the face - how else but opening it to try it could I know that the 40% alcohol content makes my eyes water and sting so badly that I can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m not allergic on the whole, but maybe my eyes are sensitive - in any case unusable. Plus, if you do decide to take it, I have to pay shipping and a 15% restocking fee. Does something seem wrong with this picture? I think so. At best, I&#x27;d end up with about 5 bucks back about an hour&#x27;s worth of trouble - a number below the minimum wage. I am very disappointed in Neutrogena - which is usually great - and you.</li>
    <li> It works fine. But few pimples popped up after first few days. And I am not sure whether its because of this ptoduct. It smells good but little harsh on skin.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this toner.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different ones, even from Neutrogena and this one feels and smells refreshing.  My skin is staying clear.  I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and hope I can keep buying it through Amazon.</li>
