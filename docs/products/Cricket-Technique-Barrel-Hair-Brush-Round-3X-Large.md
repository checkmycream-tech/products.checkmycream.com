      <li>Good size, easy to use</li>
      <li>This is the best brush I have bought so far.</li>

      <li>Would for sure recommend it.</li>
      <li>and this works like magic.</li>
      <li>Make sure to warm the brush first to help with smoothing control.</li>
      <li>Great brush, not heavy, flows through hair  without a snag</li>
      <li>Easily grasps your hair but doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get the #400 Cricket Technique.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this brush has so many positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>It came in perfect condition and much sooner than I expected!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a 10 &amp;#34;miracle styling potion&amp;#34; and Bed Heads &amp;#34;small talk&amp;#34;, which makes it smell extraordinary.</li>
      <li>Hurts my head and makes my hair SUPER frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I have super frizzy hair</li>
      <li>I like a brush that&#x27;ll &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; big chunks of my hair more easily.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>Well worth the $$</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the $.</li>
      <li>Just the right size.</li>
      <li>, I quickly grew to love it and finally asked them what brand they use.</li>
      <li>(I did love the size and round brushing my long hair does make it look great.  </li>
      <li>Although I actually laughed out loud when I saw the large barreled brush at the salon for the first time (such a departure from my 1/2&amp;#34; barrel!)</li>
      <li>This brush really dries my hair quickly and I don&#x27;t need to use my flat iron most of the time.  </li>
      <li>My son grew out his hair this year and loves this brush, funny thing, so does his friends.  </li>
      <li>glad it is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>Great brush, it&#x27;s lightweight, but rolls through my thick locks with ease.</li>
      <li>I was worried about split ends when I first started using it, but I have not noticed any change.</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of round brushes and this is a good one.  </li>
      <li>Very light with extra large barrel.</li>
      <li>I have long hair and no prior skill with blowouts, yet it took only 20 minutes to achieve beautiful results!  </li>
      <li>It is exactly like the one I purchased in a salon for twice as much.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this brush a few years ago through my hair stylist, and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>The best for thick long hair.</li>
      <li>The large barrel picks up more hair at once, making it easier and quicker to blow dry.</li>
      <li>So I have only had this brush for a couple of hours and have only used it once, but it is amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if I got the real thing or an amazon rip off.  </li>
      <li>I high recommend the Cricket 400!</li>
      <li>I have thin hair which tends to lay flat, so this brush is a perfect product for me.  </li>
      <li>I have super fine hair, so this made it a little staticky.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>This brush is worth every penny and is simple and intuitive to use.  </li>
      <li>Since my daughter is a hair dresser, I still hit my hair VERY fast with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>I know we are supposed to change it all the time, but my original alma lasted me 3 years everyday use.</li>
      <li>It is a larger brush than I am used to but definitely covers more area due to its size, which is helpful!</li>
      <li>Goes through my thick hair easily.</li>
      <li>In recent years, I have purchased brushes from local stores with no success--the brushes did not grip the hair long enough and it took too much effort and time to utilize.  </li>
      <li>and I have fine, thin hair...about shoulder length.  </li>
      <li>It takes half the time to dry my hair now and the brush does not get &amp;#34;stuck.&amp;#34;  I also believe the brush has reduced static and the halo of fuzz that usually crowns my head.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No problem at all with tangling my hair and I have fine, thin hair...about shoulder length.  This brush really dries my hair quickly and I don&#x27;t need to use my flat iron most of the time.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Any woman who loves to blow their hair out deserves a brush as good as this. Since my daughter is a hair dresser, I still hit my hair VERY fast with a flat iron. I use the It&#x27;s a 10 &amp;#34;miracle styling potion&amp;#34; and Bed Heads &amp;#34;small talk&amp;#34;, which makes it smell extraordinary. I attached a picture, so you make your own mind up. FYI: I was worried about split ends when I first started using it, but I have not noticed any change.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too short for me. I like a brush that&#x27;ll &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; big chunks of my hair more easily.</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair, so this made it a little staticky. But it&#x27;s fixable with some mousse before I blowdry.</li>
    <li> You know when you go to the salon, and you walk out with perfectly bouncy and styled hair? I never could recreate that at home, but with this I&#x27;m getting close. Although I actually laughed out loud when I saw the large barreled brush at the salon for the first time (such a departure from my 1/2&amp;#34; barrel!), I quickly grew to love it and finally asked them what brand they use. Well, this is it. The large barrel picks up more hair at once, making it easier and quicker to blow dry. I have totally set aside my 1/2&amp;#34; and 1&amp;#34; barrel brushes in favor of this, and I definitely don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of the product.  I would recommend it for anyone.  Easily grasps your hair but doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
    <li> My son grew out his hair this year and loves this brush, funny thing, so does his friends.  Just the right size.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!  Definitely worth the $.</li>
    <li> Great brush, not heavy, flows through hair  without a snag</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for straightening your hair with body. And waaaay less than the salon price! Very light with extra large barrel.</li>
    <li> Great brush, it&#x27;s lightweight, but rolls through my thick locks with ease.</li>
    <li> LOOOVEEEE this brush and size! Keeps my semi curly hair in check perfectly. Well worth the $$</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> The bristles are short, so it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair well.  Tried it for a few days and ended up getting rid of it because it didn&#x27;t work for my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail today. It is a larger brush than I am used to but definitely covers more area due to its size, which is helpful! I also bought the Remington AC9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic hairdryer with it, and my hair is as closest to a salon blowout that I have ever gotten it. I would say go for this brush if you are in need of a new round brush like I was, it definitely does the job and well. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of round brushes and this is a good one.  I can&#x27;t complain, I would give it 5 stars if it could blow out my hair like my hairstylist.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised. Goes through my thick hair easily. Nicely smoothes and straightens.</li>
    <li> I know we are supposed to change it all the time, but my original alma lasted me 3 years everyday use. It still works well but I thought I needed an update</li>
    <li> This is not a real cricket brush. False advertisement!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!! Ordering more of them!</li>
    <li> This brush is &amp;#34;all that and a bag of chips.&amp;#34;  I have medium-length, curly hair and it has finally met its match in the Cricket 400.  It takes half the time to dry my hair now and the brush does not get &amp;#34;stuck.&amp;#34;  I also believe the brush has reduced static and the halo of fuzz that usually crowns my head.  I high recommend the Cricket 400!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this brush a few years ago through my hair stylist, and fell in love.  I have thin hair which tends to lay flat, so this brush is a perfect product for me.  It gives me the volume I need, without pulling my hair, or damaging it. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brush!! ☺</li>
    <li> The best for thick long hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved my #280 Cricket Technique. I was so excited to get the #400 Cricket Technique. It came in perfect condition and much sooner than I expected!</li>
    <li> So I have only had this brush for a couple of hours and have only used it once, but it is amazing. Not really sure how I survived without it. Would for sure recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good size, easy to use</li>
    <li> Hurts my head and makes my hair SUPER frizzy.  I am sending it back!</li>
    <li> Worst brush ever!  I don&#x27;t know how this brush has so many positive reviews.  It totally destroyed my hair--splitting it to pieces.  Took me months to figure out the problem!  I&#x27;m wondering if I got the real thing or an amazon rip off.  Do not buy!!!  (I did love the size and round brushing my long hair does make it look great.  If only it didn&#x27;t damage your hair in the process!)</li>
    <li> Great brush for blow outs</li>
    <li> The bristles get better with use. Make sure to warm the brush first to help with smoothing control. Would highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
    <li> This brush works great.  It is exactly like the one I purchased in a salon for twice as much.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have bought so far. Totally worth the price. I have super frizzy hair and this works like magic.</li>
    <li> A &amp;#34;tomboy&amp;#34; growing up, I never learned the art of blowing out my hair with a brush.  In recent years, I have purchased brushes from local stores with no success--the brushes did not grip the hair long enough and it took too much effort and time to utilize.  In contrast, I am beyond thrilled with the Cricket Technique 400 brush.  I have long hair and no prior skill with blowouts, yet it took only 20 minutes to achieve beautiful results!  This brush is worth every penny and is simple and intuitive to use.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed by this brush! I get the perfect hair every morning after blow drying my hair using this brush. The big round curl and volume lasts all day long as long as you use the right volumizing product with it.</li>
    <li> Cuts my blow drying time</li>
    <li> Great brush! I get a smooth blowout with this brush!</li>
    <li> It is perfect. I wanted the  replacement for the one I had... glad it is exactly the same.</li>
