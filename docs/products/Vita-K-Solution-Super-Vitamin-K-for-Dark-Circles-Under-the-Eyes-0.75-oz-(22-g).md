      <li>As for me... I have packaged the remainder of the Vita-K and am returning the product for a full refund.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve found the best results, though, when I combine daily use of Vita-K gel, with nightly application of Hemorrhoid CREAM (not ointment - too messy).  </li>

      <li>Also, if you have the same problem as I, it&#x27;s good to get enough B vitamins and eat</li>
      <li>I also started drinking more water, and taking a lot more vitamin B complex</li>
      <li>very important: it tends to dry the skin under the eyes</li>
      <li>You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day.</li>
      <li>As complained about in reviews I have read, I ALSO experienced some mild to moderate stinging at times during the first couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>I use a generic brand that does not have as strong a smell as the brand-name product.  </li>
      <li>Less is usually more, and fine with most eye creams, but this is like putting cucumber essence into your skin or something.. it needs to sink in deeply, into the deep levels under the skin.</li>
      <li>Less is usually more, and fine with most eye creams, but this is like putting cucumber essence into your skin or something.. it needs to sink in deeply, into the deep levels under the skin.</li>
      <li>I would suggest to be cautious with just how much u apply each time.</li>
      <li>Vita K does work and it works fast IF you use as directed.</li>
      <li>It really works and I am hooked.</li>
      <li>From what I recall it wasn&#x27;t that much either.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I will continue using this bottle to see if it really works on me.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll shine fast, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
      <li>Maybe it really takes time to see the result??</li>
      <li>but if i&#x27;ve had a really tiring week</li>
      <li>You can get the product in your eyes by using too much in the application.  </li>
      <li>I try to almost never eat white sugar and to eat organic, healthy food as much as I can now, and have stopped eating dairy completely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read some pretty bad reviews for this product, while my friend gave it excellent reviews.  </li>
      <li>This particular product works very well.  </li>
      <li>and it turned my bluish purplish dark circles to a far more noticeable hot pink/reddish color.  </li>
      <li>My problem with the dark circles has almost completely gone away on its own now naturally.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It just became normal looking.</li>
      <li>i cannot live without it, this is a keeper.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, one bottle could last for months.</li>
      <li>If I was cautious in my approach with the gel on my pinkie, I had very little problem; standing in front of a fan also helped with the stining/watering:)</li>
      <li>This reasonably priced product worked quickly and has deminished the dark color under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It definetely stung the first couple of times I used it, but subsequent applications didn&#x27;t seem to irritate or bother my udereye area.</li>
      <li>So dark circles are basically a signal that something is off with your health, so to get rid of them for good, you&#x27;ll need to do a little research and figure out what that might be for you.</li>

      <li>This product is so amazing that I can hardly believe it!  </li>
      <li>I think I prefer just trying to conceal the original dark circles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it two weeks, but I definitely am not one of the lucky ones that can say I see any immediate changes at all.  </li>
      <li>If you remember the old TV ads, the cream \\&quot;shrinks swollen blood</li>
      <li>and I can say that the darkness under my eyes has changed; however, it changed to a bright pink that is not easy to conceal and the skin is very irritated and patchy with very dry areas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Vita-K Super Vitamin K Eye gel for a few years now.  </li>
      <li>I was interested in minimizing the appearance of dark circles under my eyes and the eye creams and moisturizers</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased--if I had seen those &amp;quot;dramatic&amp;quot; results I would have given 5 stars, but this product is well worth a try if you want to rid yourself of dark circles.  </li>
      <li>As with many other reviewers, I have \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; eyes due to lifelong allergies.  </li>
      <li>But the dark circles are really my concern</li>
      <li>Less is better,  a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Keep applying a few times within the next half hour every 10 mins or so, and they are pretty much gone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product to help me heal from cosmetic procedures.  This particular product works very well.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it as much as other vitamin k creams. it left a plastic film under my eyes</li>
    <li> i tried all the possible creams on the market, cheap and expensive, for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately. i cannot live without it, this is a keeper. it stings a little bit, not all the time but it does. it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i&#x27;ve had a really tiring week and i&#x27;m in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day, just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them. i guarantee that in three days you&#x27;ll not recognize yourself(in a good way). very important: it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream( i use pure chamomile cream)and leave it over night. well, follow my recipe and you&#x27;ll shine fast, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this item due to serious stingy and a burning sensation upon application.</li>
    <li> Have been using as directed for several weeks now with no significant results.  Does practically nothing for hereditary dark circles.  You&#x27;re better off sticking to cucumber slices and ice and saving money.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff out a few months ago. I still have the remaining supply. I came across a lot of reviews prior to purchasing this product off Amazon. Quite a few people complained about a \\&quot;burning\\&quot; or \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; upon application. Others had no complaints &amp; raved about VitaK &amp; said that it worked &amp; worked well. My review would fall into the latter. I did experience a slight tingling but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s normal &amp; a sign that it&#x27;s working &amp; doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. &amp; in my experience with this product, it wasn&#x27;t an uncomfortable burning or whatever. A slight tingling. Nothing more. I would suggest to be cautious with just how much u apply each time. You always wanna start out small &amp; gauge the results. Look for results with regular daily small applications &amp; not one GIANT application. That&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s intended to be used. You put on a ridiculously big application &amp; you&#x27;re not gonna be happy, Lol :D I&#x27;m a guy &amp; the dark circles I have are allergy &amp; congestion related &amp; tend to stick out more in the winter months when I lose my tan. Dark circles aren&#x27;t attractive on anyone, regardless of gender or whatever... I tried this stuff for a few weeks &amp; it definitely seemed to make a difference. From what I recall it wasn&#x27;t that much either. &amp; if you put it on the way you&#x27;re supposed to the little jar will last for quite some time. There&#x27;s a good amount in there. All u need is a tiny dot on your fingertip each time you wanna put some on. I, for one, would recommend this product. It&#x27;s like $20 or something... Just try it out if you&#x27;re in the market for some under eye dark circle diminisher. I have used several other similar products in the past. IMO this one actually did something whereas the others, eh...</li>
    <li> i made a purchase a few months ago but i wanted to wait and see if any results came of it. This stuff worked for me. my family noticed a difference a couple of weeks after. i&#x27;m not saying it works for everyone since we are all different but i would suggest try it at least. for the price you have nothing to lose. as for me,i will continue to use this product and definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t actually remove dark circles,it just tightens the skin around your eyes.It also stings.Not worth it!</li>
    <li> As with many other reviewers, I have \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; eyes due to lifelong allergies.  I&#x27;ve used Vita-K Super Vitamin K Eye gel for a few years now.  It made a dramatic difference within a few weeks, firming up the under-eye area (due to the gel base), and lightening the skin, since the Vitamin K helps to prevent \\&quot;bleeding\\&quot; into the area.    I&#x27;ve found the best results, though, when I combine daily use of Vita-K gel, with nightly application of Hemorrhoid CREAM (not ointment - too messy).  If you remember the old TV ads, the cream \\&quot;shrinks swollen blood vessels\\&quot;.  It works the same way on raccoon eyes.  I use a generic brand that does not have as strong a smell as the brand-name product.  I use it only at night because the cream leaves a white residue.  I suppose women could probably use it in the day if they use makeup - just put it on before anything else, but as a man I don&#x27;t have that option.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after doing some research...and then talking with a friend who had started using it.  I&#x27;ve read some pretty bad reviews for this product, while my friend gave it excellent reviews.  She vouched that she&#x27;d seen significant results in a little over a week, and I could tell it had worked for her, so I bought it despite a few reservations. For me, this product IS working, though it&#x27;s taken a few weeks for my citical eyes to see definite results--I think I will continue to see results with further use.  As complained about in reviews I have read, I ALSO experienced some mild to moderate stinging at times during the first couple of weeks.  I have very sensitive, allergy-prone eyes, so I did expect it, but it was never as bad as some made it out to be:)  Part of the problem seemed to be getting too close to my eyelashes, which then picked up the gel and it went into my eyes while blinking.  If I was cautious in my approach with the gel on my pinkie, I had very little problem; standing in front of a fan also helped with the stining/watering:) Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased--if I had seen those &amp;quot;dramatic&amp;quot; results I would have given 5 stars, but this product is well worth a try if you want to rid yourself of dark circles.  Just give it a little time since everyone reacts differently to medicine/products.</li>
    <li> I was interested in minimizing the appearance of dark circles under my eyes and the eye creams and moisturizers I used over the years had no effect. I read an article about the effects of vitamin K on under-eye darkness, and decided to give this product a try. It really works and I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for like 3 weeks already. It does improve my dark circles but only to a SMALL extent. The result isn&#x27;t obvious at all. My boyfriend even said there is no difference at all. Anyway, I will continue using this bottle to see if it really works on me. Maybe it really takes time to see the result??</li>
    <li> Okay, I have used this stuff for about 3-days now.. I didn&#x27;t expect any results for at least a week -but I got them. I also started drinking more water, and taking a lot more vitamin B complex -but I saw a difference overnight. I felt no burning, the stuff actually feels \\&quot;cool\\&quot; to me. You don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, one bottle could last for months. I don&#x27;t know what to say.. I felt silly buying it, but this stuff is like a freaking wonder drug. Maybe people not getting dramatic results have other medical issues? Or very deep dark circles? I found it for $10.99 so I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than that.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product! Once you start using it, there&#x27;s no stopping. Even having a morning or a night without it, I can notice its wonderous effects wearing off. One thing&#x27;s for sure, this product is SO good, you won&#x27;t be able to stop using it. It makes your eyes tight and firm, and it takes away poofy-ness! It&#x27;s really amazing; just keep using it, morning and night. I can&#x27;t even fathom the effects it might have if you were to use it more than that. You&#x27;d probably end up with eyes like those pop singers. Ohh, also, make sure you put this on BEFORE you put on ANYTHING else. I just recently found that out, and the results are so much better. I used to put on my face cream before I put this stuff on. Forget that. If you want eyes like movie stars, this product is what you want. Hands down.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing that I can hardly believe it!  Within days of using it, my dark circles started going away and I could even tell where I missed areas because there was purple only where I missed putting the gel!!!!  I barely even need concealer any more.  Truly amazing!</li>
    <li> Vita K does work and it works fast IF you use as directed. It only stings if you put the product in your eyes.  The label warns against this. You can get the product in your eyes by using too much in the application.  Less is better,  a little goes a long way.  It is the only product that worked for me. My under eye skin did not turn pink or irritated.  It just became normal looking. The dark circles completely disappeared. One thing though, you need to continue to use the product after the discoloration leaves from under your eyes.  I now, only use at bedtime, and this works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. (Twice a day). It has definitely lightened the dark circles and inner eye darkness. I think it may take 4 to 6 weeks to comepletely lighten, but I am satisfied with the results so far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with this problem.</li>
    <li> Product did not clear up dark circles.  It did help to firm.  But the dark circles are really my concern and I can not afford expensive remedies</li>
    <li> It doesnt quit dark circles, but helps against wrinkles while it is on your face.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin K actually reduced the puffiness under my eyes. I had puffiness for  years and tried everything to try to reduce the puffiness, and then my boyfriend  suggested the Vitamin K and miraculously the puffiness has vanished.</li>
    <li> This works excellent! And almost instantaneously! I&#x27;ve been getting horrible dark circles under my eyes all my life, since I was 2. I always had problems with them and little worked before. I notice an instant difference with this. I&#x27;ll usually just put a bunch on after I wake up in the morning if they are bad and let it sink in. Keep applying a few times within the next half hour every 10 mins or so, and they are pretty much gone. Don&#x27;t even need to use it all the time. If I use it at least every few days, no problems. At the very worst, the circles are gone in 2 days. It works amazing. Makes me wonder what is in it actually that it works so well. It also gets rid of puffiness and feels a nice refreshing tingle after putting on. I was surprised, as I am always let down by these beauty products never really doing what they claim to do. Also, if you have the same problem as I, it&#x27;s good to get enough B vitamins and eat/sleep well. Hope this helps! I hope more people start using this section of Amazon and rating. It&#x27;s wonderful not to always have to go by trial and error!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------Update. April 2005.-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to add an update to help other people who have problems with dark circles. I also have allergies, which I have found out is part of what is causing them. These are pet allergies, dust, and food allergies (allergies to food toxins and especially dairy.. my immune system attacks the animal proteins in dairy and give me cold-like symptoms). I try to almost never eat white sugar and to eat organic, healthy food as much as I can now, and have stopped eating dairy completely. My problem with the dark circles has almost completely gone away on its own now naturally. This has plaqued me all my life and I never knew how poisonous regular sugar, dairy and some other foods were! My health has improved in other ways, too. I wish someone would have clued me in long ago, so I thought I would share! I&#x27;m sure anyone with the same problem would be glad to be rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark circles can also signify kidney or liver problems I have found. So make sure your body is properly filtering toxins and do a kidney cleanse, and drink lots of pure water, and get lots of vitamins and vitamin C! If you have dark circles, that basically signals something to do with your health. Maybe our immune systems are more sensitive to the poisons and toxins in our environment than other&#x27;s, and we need to take better care of ourselves. I ended up just turning vegan (in part for vanity&#x27;s sake, in part in the spirit of compassion) and just cut out all the garbage I possibly can, and it&#x27;s done wonders for my health!! After I quit eating dairy, most my allergies pretty much went away. So dark circles are basically a signal that something is off with your health, so to get rid of them for good, you&#x27;ll need to do a little research and figure out what that might be for you. Sure can make a difference in one&#x27;s appearance to be done with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, this product Will sting a little if you get it in your eyes, so don&#x27;t get it in your eyes! But that&#x27;s really nothing for how good it works. Most things sting if you get them in your eyes. Also, it&#x27;s a gel, not a cream, so it doesn&#x27;t moisturize. You need to make sure u use something else to do that. It can even dry a little if you use a lot like me. But nothing that a separate moisturizer can&#x27;t cure. The trick I think with this product which determines how well it works is to use a lot. Less is usually more, and fine with most eye creams, but this is like putting cucumber essence into your skin or something.. it needs to sink in deeply, into the deep levels under the skin. So use a lot, but avoid getting it on your lashes or in your eyes! ;)ld be glad to be rid of it.    Dark circles can also signify kidney or liver problems I have found.

    <li> I found that this product produced little results and it mainly just stung the undereye area.</li>
    <li> As a graduate student I have not gotten enough rest for years and have developed very dark circles under my eyes.  With my fair skin, the dark cirles were very pronounced.  This reasonably priced product worked quickly and has deminished the dark color under my eyes.  I&#x27;m buying a two pack next!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the slightest change with the dark circles under my eyes yet. Grant it I&#x27;ve only been using it two weeks, but I definitely am not one of the lucky ones that can say I see any immediate changes at all.  Unlike others who don&#x27;t like this product underneath their makeup, I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.  I put it on, then some eye hydrate and then my concealor that I so badly need. Doctors said for yeeeeeeeeeears my problem was allergy related, then last year they said it was birth control related, and now they say it appears  my blood vessels seem to be damaged.  Whatever the case, NOTHING is helping, not Hylexin, no Hydroxatone, not Lemon Eye gel, not hydroquinone a bleaching cream and NOT VITA-K SOLUTION SUPER VITAMIN K.  Just isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully for 2 weeks and it turned my bluish purplish dark circles to a far more noticeable hot pink/reddish color.  It occasionally burned, and caused my eyes to water like crazy.  Too bad...</li>
    <li> I used this cream for three weeks, two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink. But I skipped one day and it all went back. You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this product and used it faithfully for several weeks. It definetely stung the first couple of times I used it, but subsequent applications didn&#x27;t seem to irritate or bother my udereye area. This product did tighten and pull the undereye area so I used Bobbi Brown Undereye Balm at night over the Vita-K to help moisturize. Well... here I am several weeks later and I can say that the darkness under my eyes has changed; however, it changed to a bright pink that is not easy to conceal and the skin is very irritated and patchy with very dry areas. I have discontinued using this product and am just waiting for all of the side effects to heal themselves so I don&#x27;t look like I have scaly skin anymore. I think I prefer just trying to conceal the original dark circles.  Glad it has worked for so many. As for me... I have packaged the remainder of the Vita-K and am returning the product for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for 4 weeks.  I have seen no difference now then when I started and it stings like the devil when I use it!  It makes my eyes burn terribly.  I&#x27;m glad to see it has worked for some but it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my dark circles.</li>
