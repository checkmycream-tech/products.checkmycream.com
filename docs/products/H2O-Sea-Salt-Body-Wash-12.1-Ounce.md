      <li>THEY ARE AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I did have to use kind of a lot of it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works up a nice lather but not overly foamy.</li>
      <li>Love this body wash.</li>
      <li>We just hope that H2O doesn&#x27;t drop it from their line, as they have done with many of our favorite products.</li>
      <li>absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>Its fragrance and refreshing qualities are wondrous and make me feel like I have taken a dip in the ocean--I discovered it at the Grand California Hotel at Disneyland and every time I use it it brings back the happiest memories of a wonderful vacation.</li>
      <li>I love getting a whiff of this lovely scent throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I feel very clean with no soap residue.</li>
      <li>I think the best way to describe the scent is &amp;#34;fresh and clean.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a fairly strong scent but isn&#x27;t irritating, and it&#x27;s nice and invigorating for the morning.  </li>
      <li>It smells great - light and fresh, not heavy at all - and cleans your skin well without overdrying.  </li>
      <li>Really light fragrance.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and clean, but it smells like paint.</li>
      <li>originally tried H2O products while vacationing in Orlando, Florida at Disneyworld.</li>
      <li>felt that this helped me to get clean after a workout.  </li>
      <li>If you like a clean citrus scent.</li>
      <li>It makes you feel so clean and refreshed when you get out of the tub.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>But once I got it to lather up, it does its job beautifully as I have sensitive dry skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m staying at a 4.7 star resort right now</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, not heavy enough to send a man away from using it.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>Upon returning home to Texas from Disneyland I quickly got online and went straight to H2O&#x27;s website</li>
      <li>Although expensive, I love love love this product and to me its worth the cost.</li>
      <li>It has a really fresh, clean and natural smell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with the entire product line.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of our Disney trips as this is standard at The Grand Floridian Resort at WDW.</li>
      <li>Totally recommend.  :)</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m pretty bummed and won&#x27;t be buying from this company again.</li>
      <li>A local spa had samples available for customers to use after their massages</li>
      <li>soo smooth, just wish I could buy a bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh, lasting, and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Such a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>product is clear and has no artificial dyes, which is really nice and hard to find in a shower gel.  </li>
      <li>Although the scent wasn&#x27;t labeled on the wrappers of the toiletries of the Disney Resort, I made sure to copy down the company that made the soap products.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and it lathers really well.  </li>
      <li>My first experience was in 2012 when we stayed at the Disneyworld Saratoga Springs Resort where we stayed an entire week.</li>
      <li>(It does rinse off cleanly -- leaves no residue -- and doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other fragrances you were planning to wear.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t my first time ordering this product - it&#x27;s actually for my husband, and he&#x27;s very particular about textures and scents, and H2O is the only brand he will use.  </li>
      <li>Not harsh.</li>
      <li>The sea salt really helps dry winter skin.</li>

<li> However, it is some what hard to lather up, probably I want to believe perhaps its due to our local hard water which affects the performance of any shampoo and soaps.</li>
<li> I used this at a hotel a few years ago and have been purchasing periodically ever since.  </li>
<li> I  wasted $$$ on this stuff - no difference</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this scent!  A local spa had samples available for customers to use after their massages and I fell in love!  I have been purchasing it since then.  It has a really fresh, clean and natural smell.  Best of all, the scent stays on your skin for hours after you wash with it.  I love getting a whiff of this lovely scent throughout the day.  It lathers really well and a little goes a long way too.  Totally recommend.  :)</li>
    <li> It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My only issue with it is that the company tests on animals. When I was searching vegan body washes this one came up but I found out after I bought it that it does test on animals so I&#x27;m pretty bummed and won&#x27;t be buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product because it appears to have healing and healthful qualities. Excellent product with an ocean feel to it… from my experience.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and clean, but it smells like paint. However it does last a long time.</li>
    <li> I used this at a hotel a few years ago and have been purchasing periodically ever since.  It smells soooo  good.  Not super moisturizing but that&#x27;s ok.  I think I need to order the lotion that smells the same next!</li>
    <li> Love this wash!  Reminds me of our Disney trips as this is standard at The Grand Floridian Resort at WDW. Have used it since then.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash. Smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Just about the best product H2O+ makes!  We&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade.  Fresh scent, wonderful lather, invigorating.  We just hope that H2O doesn&#x27;t drop it from their line, as they have done with many of our favorite products.</li>
    <li> Smells like vacation!</li>
    <li> absolutely love it. It makes you feel so clean and refreshed when you get out of the tub. Plus it smells great. Have used it now for over year it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Works up a nice lather but not overly foamy. Really light fragrance. Makes my skin nice and soft. The sea salt really helps dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> originally tried H2O products while vacationing in Orlando, Florida at Disneyworld. Another reviewer mentioned they discovered it to but at Disney&#x27;s Anaheim location Disneyland. From that I take it that they provide exclusively to the Disney Resorts the same way Neutrogena does for the Hilton Hotel corporation. My first experience was in 2012 when we stayed at the Disneyworld Saratoga Springs Resort where we stayed an entire week. Rather than trying the bodywash which wasn&#x27;t provided we had the shampoo, conditioner, and bars of soap. Although the scent wasn&#x27;t labeled on the wrappers of the toiletries of the Disney Resort, I made sure to copy down the company that made the soap products. Upon returning home to Texas from Disneyland I quickly got online and went straight to H2O&#x27;s website and there they have what was dubbed &amp;#34;Disney Resort Collection&amp;#34;.......this wasn&#x27;t the case. I bought 4 bars of soap that were listed as part of the Disney Resort collection at $2 a pop, the scent was called French vanilla scent I believe. The bar of soap was good and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin but was disappointed that this wasn&#x27;t the scent that wasn&#x27;t the same as the Disney Resorts. It wasn&#x27;t until 3 weeks ago while shopping with my girlfriend at Bed Bath and Beyond, that I found some H2O body washes for sale for about $20 for the 12oz bottles, they had the Sea Moss and the Sea Salt. Upon picking up the Sea Salt to sniff the fragrance, immediately I recognized the scent. Had the scent been labeled on the bar of Soap at the Saratoga Springs Resort 2 years ago while vacationing I would of bought this scent long ago regularly. The scent is fresh, lasting, and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. However, it is some what hard to lather up, probably I want to believe perhaps its due to our local hard water which affects the performance of any shampoo and soaps. But once I got it to lather up, it does its job beautifully as I have sensitive dry skin and I&#x27;m prone to allergies. Although expensive, I love love love this product and to me its worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Best aroma ,cleanse,wash ever</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t my first time ordering this product - it&#x27;s actually for my husband, and he&#x27;s very particular about textures and scents, and H2O is the only brand he will use.

    <li> Great smell and works great</li>
    <li> Its fragrance and refreshing qualities are wondrous and make me feel like I have taken a dip in the ocean--I discovered it at the Grand California Hotel at Disneyland and every time I use it it brings back the happiest memories of a wonderful vacation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good lather, good rinse. Deep cleaning. I feel very clean with no soap residue. Pleasant smell, not heavy enough to send a man away from using it.</li>
    <li> I  wasted $$$ on this stuff - no difference bt BBw and this ate ll- smell is good but not 4times as good for the price</li>
    <li> soo smooth, just wish I could buy a bigger bottle.</li>

It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and it lathers really well.  I did have to use kind of a lot of it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I didn&#x27;t see them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Fragrance, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, PEG-175 Diisostearate, Polysorbate 20, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzophenone-4, Aloe Leaf Juice, Sea Salt, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol,Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, bladder wrack Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, tea Leaf Extract, yerba mate Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that this helped me to get clean after a workout.  I&#x27;m definitely going to order this again at some point and also try some of the other H20 Plus body washes.  I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with the entire product line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m staying at a 4.7 star resort right now that has these products in travel size. THEY ARE AMAZING. If you like a clean citrus scent. Such a clean feeling. Not harsh.</li>
    <li> Best body wash on the market. Disney uses it in their hotels...</li>
    <li> This is a must have product and it smells so.o.o good and leaves you smelling that way.</li>
