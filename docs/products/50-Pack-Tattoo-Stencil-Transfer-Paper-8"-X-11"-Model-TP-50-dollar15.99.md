    <li> It works, for the price. It is carbon paper, and it does work as a transfer paper. The only problems I had were that you have to press down pretty hard to get a good transfer. But for the price and quantity, worth the buy.</li>
    <li> stencil paper is great product. i would truly rersons wanting a great tattoo.commend it for use by anyone wanting a great tattoo stencil</li>
    <li> This transfer paper is worth every penny and you don&#x27;t have to use a whole sheet for a tat. You can cut out what you need so your 50 pack will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works. But I&#x27;ve had way better stencil paper.</li>
    <li> I liked them very much,my ideas came out clean without  mistakes,im glad i choose this product cause it was what i expected..thnx</li>
    <li> Great paper that transfer well.  Inexpensive so accommodates people who are working on or haven&#x27;t chosen a design.</li>
    <li> Nice clear sharp lines when transferred to the skin. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I would buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and it came on time. I would recommend this product and this carrier to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I love this paper its the best ive tried so far it you like drawing your own stencils this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> well done well done thank you</li>
    <li> This product is great. It was exactly what I was needing.  Even tho it took longer than I thought it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be packaged in a box, not an envelope. The sheets were wrinkled and the onion sheet in the middle was stuck to the ink paper. Only half of each sheet is usable. When you apply the stencil the transfer is very light and hard to see. Also wipes away easy.</li>
    <li> good deal and worked well</li>
    <li> PROS: transfers images perfectly,good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: none at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: just FYI ballpoint pens are recommended anything else may tear the paper</li>
    <li> U can trace on either side, and get a mirrored image if u want.&lt;br /&gt;U can use a fine line pen, and get a pretty fine line stencil.</li>
    <li> Just picked them up. Alls well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to send to Colombia. My brother us an tattoo artist so I will tell you when he recived and use . Hope is good. I can&#x27;t rate until my brother use. He will tell me.</li>
    <li> i bought a pack of tis brand stencils before and had no problems with this product ,i&#x27;ve trid spirit and this brand and they are both good products lol crazy rick</li>
