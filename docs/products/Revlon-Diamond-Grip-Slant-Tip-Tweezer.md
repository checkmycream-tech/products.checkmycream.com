      <li>/&gt;They come with a snazzy case, a nice touch.</li>
      <li>when it comes to tweezers and having owned these kind before, I bought 3 of them.  </li>
      <li>These work great and are a very useful tool if you need to tweeze your eyebrows or remove a splinter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used $30-50 twizzers and they have more &amp;#34;finer&amp;#34; tips, but this works great and will be fine for 99% of people.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to grip the hairs with these.</li>
      <li>Good price compared to th elocal drug store and free shipping.</li>
      <li>My second pair; best for grasping very fine hairs or splinters.  </li>
      <li>These are diamond cut, not diamond encrusted, but you wear they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have the best grip of all tweezers I&#x27;ve used, proven by ordering 2 more, for my overnight bag, and the second bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gets most of the finer hairs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this tweezer.</li>
      <li>Works better than most...</li>
      <li>These are okay tweezers.  </li>
      <li>so it grabs the hair better.</li>
      <li>I wish there were more than 5 stars for this one.</li>
      <li>cuts the hair off before being able to pull it out.</li>
      <li>I was hoping they would be better.</li>
      <li>I have had many brands of Tweezers including Tweezerman and these are preforming better than them.</li>
      <li>And I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something better than what i received.</li>
      <li>I never dreamed of switching and finding anything better.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better product.</li>
      <li>Pay more and get the Tweezerman brand one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had them for more than a year now.  </li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>It is one of the better tweezers and does not cost upwards of 20 dollars like others.  </li>
      <li>These are my favorite tweezers.</li>
      <li>I went to CVS and Wallgreens to purchase more, but they did not carry them, so I turned to Amazon.com</li>
      <li>The grip is perfect and it simply works!</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a more diverse and quality product from a brand name like revlon.</li>
      <li>I am SO glad I listened to her.  </li>
      <li>Cannot get better than these tweezers.</li>
      <li>I will purchase again, for sure.</li>
      <li>No need to pay more.</li>
      <li>The grip is so good that I can tweeze hairs on the first attempt.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for something more precise.</li>
      <li>I figured out the problem with tweezers I had purchased are smooth metal on the inside causing them to slip off the hair more than it grabs the hair.</li>
      <li>My old Revlon tweezers stopped grabbing the hair, but this replacement is great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll wear down with use, but as of now I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>so I can protect them and find them in my bag easily.  </li>
      <li>They are ergonomic, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>, it makes them easy to find in my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>just how micro fine it is in my images here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She was having a problem getting the fine baby hair that bothered her.  </li>
      <li>am so happy with the purchase and can&#x27;t reccomend enough!</li>
      <li>The ends meet together nicely and really grip the hair.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy a cheap pair...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Packaging of tweezers were all smashed up and the whole thing looked real old. Soppost to be part of a gift and it looks like I grabbed it from my purse with it sitting in there for months. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I would not buy again, grit smoothed out immediately.</li>
    <li> These are the best frickin hair tweezers!  They grab the hair and it doesn&#x27;t slip out of the tweezer when you pull it.</li>
    <li> Love this tweezers I have think hair so there perfect for me</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to pay the higher cost for these tweezers but I was so frustrated by cheaper tweezers that just let the hairs slip through that I went ahead. And I am so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using this brand and style tweezer now for several years; eventually the diamond dust wears off and I have to buy another pair, but for ease of use and its ability to capture very short hairs, it can&#x27;t be beat. Well worth the extra investment. I have not had the problem other users report of breaking hairs. You have to tweeze slowly and in the direction of the hair&#x27;s growth and it works great.</li>
    <li> that is for my wife who use it</li>
    <li> Found these to not grip small hairs as I thought they would.</li>
    <li> These things have amazing grip, and they come with a protective case that&#x27;s very cute!  Love them! They were an awesome price too.</li>
    <li> ...cause there&#x27;s nothing to see here.  These tweezers are (yet again, in the world of tweezers) a waste of time and money.  I tried (with great frustration) for about a 1/2 hour with these, and found that about 1 hair out of 30, remained in the tweezers to be pulled out.  The rest absolutely slipped out with astonishing ease.  SO aggrevating - my advise is to keep searching, and don&#x27;t fall for the other reviewer&#x27;s shining review.</li>
    <li> Who knew I&#x27;d ever be so excited about a tweezer? I hope they never stop making this product - I have had this pair for over four years! The \\&quot;diamond grip\\&quot; isn&#x27;t real diamond (obviously) - but the tips of the tweezers are finely textured and this makes all the difference when gripping hairs. After a few nights at my boyfriend&#x27;s house using his three sets of terrible, what were probably army-issued tweezers, I brought these over. Even he was amazed and I ended up having to buy him his own pair to avoid having my own permanently \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, hairs do sometimes \\&quot;break\\&quot;, but in my opinion that is due entirely to improper or rushed tweezing technique, and not at all due to the product itself. I will never, ever purchase any other tweezer. This is the only pair you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> I ordered two pairs from Quality 1 HBA which was fulfilled by Amazon and these were the worse tweezers I have ever bought! The coating on the tips chipped off before it was even out of the package! The tips are poorly aligned and slip off of hairs. Terrible!! I bought this product from my local drug store many years ago and fell in love with them but it seems like the quality on more recent purchases is just awful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this tweezer. I had no idea such amazing tweezers existed and I&#x27;m happy I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Cannot get better than these tweezers. By far the best set I have ever owned and will last forever with the diamond tip.</li>
    <li> These are okay tweezers.  I really don&#x27;t find them significantly different than my old pair of Revlon tweezers.  I was hoping they would be better.</li>
    <li> I would never go back to metal surface tweezer.  The grip is surely fantastic.</li>
    <li> Delivered fast and the product really works except the flat tips are too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the tweezer.</li>
    <li> I use this for a hobby tool.  It is one of the better tweezers and does not cost upwards of 20 dollars like others.  The grip is perfect and it simply works!</li>
    <li> These grip hairs very well, and have a very fine point which makes it easy to pluck the individual hairs you want. These also have very sharp points, so if you&#x27;re not careful it&#x27;s easy to grab a bit of skin, particularly with your less dominant hand.</li>
    <li> Gets most of the finer hairs. It does very well on thicker hair but the very baby fine ones still take some doing.</li>
    <li> These tweezers will grip anything well. The part inside the tip that you tweeze with is rough not smooth. I had a tiny splinter in my finger and got it out first try. Great for eyebrows or any thing else. Good price compared to th elocal drug store and free shipping. These are the tweezers I will stick with.</li>
    <li> excellent grip, and works as advertised. this is the second pair I have had, and I am well satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> The tweezer I received was look different from the picture, My $5 tweezer bought at Target work better then this.</li>
    <li> It seems to be good quality and is definitely better than my last and really old set of tweezers. Yay.</li>
    <li> This product does not work well for very fine and short hair.  I wanted to use this product to remove eyebrow hair as soon as it is visible.  It does not grab short hairs at all, rather it breaks them off leaving a little visible.  If you need to grab long hairs it holds very well.  I bought tweezerman after being disappointed with this product and have found that it works much better.  I was hoping for a more diverse and quality product from a brand name like revlon.</li>
    <li> Although it has a good grip, if you don&#x27;t pull slowly the hair sometimes breaks off. Other than that, I do love them much more than my old tweezers.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the bomb. I can&#x27;t imagine ever using regular tweezers again. So much easier to grip with the textured tip.</li>
    <li> These are diamond cut, not diamond encrusted, but you wear they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have the best grip of all tweezers I&#x27;ve used, proven by ordering 2 more, for my overnight bag, and the second bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near perfection.</li>
    <li> this comes in its own case so I can keep it in my purse and not scratch my sunglasses. Its a strong tweezer but fine enough to actully get the hairs destined to be removed.</li>
    <li> Works better than most... This is my 2nd one so I find it worth a 2nd purchase.  First one lasted 2 years until the diamond granules wore off then would not grab a hair, so these tweezers do have an effectiveness curve over time.</li>
    <li> These tweezers can grasp the smallest hair, they work really well. And, no problem accidentally grabbing &amp; pinching some skin.</li>
    <li> cuts the hair off before being able to pull it out. Very sharp too. The sharpness allows accuracy but it cuts the hair.</li>
    <li> Sent it back and waiting for a replacement.  I expect a tweezer to tweeze.  This one definitely didn&#x27;t come close.</li>
    <li> These get the job done on even the shortest of hairs. I have had many brands of Tweezers including Tweezerman and these are preforming better than them. The price is reasonable as cheap ones usually don&#x27;t come together well and you keep pulling away at that same stray hair over and over again. Not with these...one tweeze and gone!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are not a cheap pair at all. I got my money&#x27;s worth and they definitely work amazingly well.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do no want to clamp onto the hairs, especially the thinner ones.  My old pair that I picked up from a drugstore for about $5 are infinitely better than these, and that leaves me feeling incredibly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had this tweezer for at least five years and it is still amazing. I do not go anywhere without it. It pulls the hair out from its root and almost painlessly. I was actually tweezing a few minutes ago and thinking about how amazing this product is and said, &amp;#34;You need to write a review&amp;#34; because it works so well.</li>
    <li> Three year update: my wife still uses these. They are her preferred tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review (2014): At a bit over ten bucks they seemed kind of expensive but when they arrived I realized they&#x27;re very well made. I&#x27;ve used them for a couple ingrown hairs in my beard, they worked. The lady thanked me, said they&#x27;ve worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come with a snazzy case, a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I was expecting some really good grip considering this is the selling point of this tweezer. Instead, the grip is bellow average. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought these to pull out ingrown hairs from my face and these tweezers suck.  I tried multiple hairs and it failed over and over again.</li>
    <li> These work great and are a very useful tool if you need to tweeze your eyebrows or remove a splinter.</li>
    <li> These work like the expensive tweezers. Not much more to say except . . . I like this product. No need to pay more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used $30-50 twizzers and they have more &amp;#34;finer&amp;#34; tips, but this works great and will be fine for 99% of people.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad. But i want perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied than expected precision.&lt;br /&gt;This one is heavier than other tweezer.</li>
    <li> This is a very poor quality item.  I hoped it would work well, because it was much cheaper than the Tweezerman brand ones, but it doesn&#x27;t.  You get what you pay for.  It doesn&#x27;t remove the fine hairs or the short ones.  And often when you do get hold of a hair it just slips out of the grip.  Do not waste your money on this.  Pay more and get the Tweezerman brand one.</li>
    <li> I bought these as replacement tweezers when I lost mine last week. These are by far my favorite pair of tweezers, ever. I&#x27;ve been using this brand and model for over three years and I&#x27;ll keep buying them. I haven&#x27;t found a better product.</li>
    <li> I was sent a different pair of tweezers than shown in the picture. The tweezers they sent were quality, but not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother.  She was having a problem getting the fine baby hair that bothered her.  Other tweezers would just slip right off.  I got this as an add on item, so the price was really low.  Boy, she is so happy with it.  The diamond grip is rough and grips the hairs that normally would slip through.  Before this I thought a tweezer was a tweezer.  Not so.  Great product.  I wish there were more than 5 stars for this one.</li>
    <li> Nice tweezers. Stay sharp for a good long time. They have a nice grip. I will purchase again, for sure.</li>
    <li> Used this product to help with medical reasons for changing bandages, etc.  Used alcohol wipes on the tips and had no discoloration.  I appreciate the little case that it came with too...which helps keep the product clean.  I would definitely order these again in the event I needed a second pair.</li>
    <li> They function perfectly and are worth the cost.  Don&#x27;t buy a cheap pair... they won&#x27;t work but these work great!</li>
    <li> Excelente Producto . Lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> I bought 2 pair several years ago of this same tweezer and somehow lost them both.  I went to CVS and Wallgreens to purchase more, but they did not carry them, so I turned to Amazon.com and there they were.  I ordered 3.    These tweezers are the best ever and are economical.  I bought a more expensive pair (not Revlon) at Sally&#x27;s and had to return them.  They barely worked at all.  I have also tried other brands but none can compare to these Revlon Diamond Grip Slant Tip Tweezers. [[ASIN:B001ET72CK Revlon Diamond Grip Tweezer, Slant Tip ]] They work all the time, stay sharp and I highly recommend them.  Stop wasting your money on others, when you can have the best at 1/2 the cost!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need a mirror - just feel &amp; tweeze! I&#x27;ve had them for more than a year now.  Still new!</li>
    <li> These only had the diamond coating on one side of the tweezers; the other side most of the coating was missing with white paint covering most of the inside of the tip.  These are obvious seconds and not the regular product as I have had the regular product before.. Won&#x27;t be ordering these again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something better than what i received. its a cute little tweezer. it pulls some hairs which is great. some slip thru it. And it cuts some in half as well. Im gonna keep trying until i buy another one.</li>
    <li> Can be used on thicker hair, useless for thinner hair. Sometimes the diamond particles snap the hair being pulled rather than simply grip it.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezer itself looks cool and is pleasant to hold, but I&#x27;ve found that actually using it is so hard due to the thick tips and aforementioned problems that now it rests in the drawer and never sees the light of day.&lt;br /&gt;Bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IOTXKWO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36 as a replacement and very much satisfied with those.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do not grip eyebrow hairs or splinters. The &amp;#34;diamond dust&amp;#34; on the tips does absolutely nothing to maximize grip. I will go back to spending more on Tweezerman brand.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad pair, but these tweezers grabbed nothing and were waaaaay expensive.  I do not recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> If you have to pluck hair or pull out splinters where there is enough to grab on to, these tweezers are fantastic. The diamond grip makes all the difference. If it slips out from between the tweezers, you didn&#x27;t grab a millimeter&#x27;s worth, or you didn&#x27;t squeeze hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our second pair since we misplaced/lost the last ones.</li>
    <li> Very good for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many different kinds and types of tweezers.  These are the best.  They grab the hair without letting it slip.  They are ergonomic, easy to use.  I like that the tweezers are white, it makes them easy to find in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product!! Right out of the box they do not work. They grab maybe 1 hair out of 10. Even if you do get it to grab a hair it will not actually pull it out because it isn&#x27;t strong enough, it just slips out. I usually buy tweezerman tweezer but decided to try something different and now I know to NEVER do that again. I would return but its not even worth it. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this tweezer would be much finer and have a sharper point.  The name was misleading.  The best tweezer I have found is Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip.  The Platinum has such a finer tip than anything else out there and I have uploaded just how micro fine it is in my images here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D/ref&#x3D;cm_aya_bb_lists&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t uploaded a picture of the this tweezer, it is similar to the Tweezerman tip in width.  The Platinum really is much finer and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Years ago I switched to Revlons traditional Slant tip tweezers and couldn&#x27;t believe how much better they were!  I never dreamed of switching and finding anything better. My pair finally starting to go after about 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;I came on Amazon and saw these were a little cheaper than the black revlon I normally get and decided to give them a try after reading reviews! Holy Cow am I glad I did!!&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with the purchase and can&#x27;t reccomend enough!</li>
    <li> Have tried many different tweezers over the years.  This is one of the better ones because it is precision and had a very good grip on the ends.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish is was a little more fine/sharp tip, but it gets the job done nearly all the time.</li>
    <li> Love my new tweezers!</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great at gripping hairs and getting them out. The only con is that because it&#x27;s so good at gripping, the hairs sometimes get stuck on there and if you try to wipe it on toilet paper or tissue it rips the tissue, but not a huge deal for a good working pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> DIFFERENT PRODUCT ALTOGETHER~  I have been ordering these tweezers for years. But this time i received ones that were nothing like they were surpposed to be.  Instead of the white enamel coating on the outside...they are just plain silver.  No diamond tips at all.  No small carrying case for them, which is very important when traveling!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed with this supplier and this order.  Such a small thing to be messed up so bad.&lt;br /&gt;T. Windmiller</li>
    <li> Nothing better out there, I have ingrowing eye lashes, you hardly can see them but  tweezers gets them out</li>
    <li> I ordered them because a friend has what I thought was this product and they work amazingly! I don&#x27;t know where I went wrong but these are not them.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in these tweezers because they do not grip very well.  I used them to pluck errant facial hair, but they didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
    <li> It is different than the one I ordered. Be aware of the seller!!</li>
    <li> Im VERY picky when it comes to tweezers and having owned these kind before, I bought 3 of them.  I love them!!!!</li>
    <li> This tweezer gripped hair well to pull them out. I have very thick eyebrows with a combination of thick and fine hairs that need to be pulled, which are a constant annoyance, I have to pluck fairly often. I&#x27;ve had some tweezers that don&#x27;t work as well. the surface at the end that pulls the hair out has a slightly rough texture and it meets evenly and is larger than other tweezers, all of which help in gripping hair. I also like the little case it comes with bexause I always lose my tweezers, which is why I had to buy these ones anyway, I&#x27;m hoping maybe this will help to not lose them. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have a pair I bought from a drugstore for like $2 that works almost as well (although I&#x27;ve also bought such tweezers that are aligned enough to work even close to as well, so I guess it&#x27;s a bigger risk), I don&#x27;t know if the slight improvement of quality was worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I bought the Diamond Grip from a drugstore a few years ago and loved it. This was supposed to replace it but it&#x27;s nowhere near as sharp or precise</li>
    <li> The only tweezers that can grab my hair and hang onto it.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller...All very good!!</li>
    <li> These get the job done and work like they are supposed to! They also feel really durable and heavy duty for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have used these tweezers for years.  They are the best at grabbing the annoying chin hairs I get sometimes.</li>
    <li> They are fine to use but there is only a small area of the edge which grabs well, so it takes a bit of manipulation and repeat action to get out what you want plucked.&lt;br /&gt;They come with a nice case for carrying and are definitely good in a pinch, on the go, or travelling.&lt;br /&gt;A pretty average set of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Great product. easy to use. well worth the money spent on it. really grips well and pulls painlessly. love it.</li>
    <li> After my girlfriend started getting on my case I decided to break down and buy a pair of tweezers to get rid of a few eyebrow hairs here and there.  I must say, even as a guy I&#x27;m impressed by the quality of these tweezers.  They seem to work really well and can grab even the smallest hairs.  I&#x27;ve only had them for a few days and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll wear down with use, but as of now I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These tweezers were worse than the cheaper ones I&#x27;ve gotten ~ they have no grip on my stubborn eyebrows. A disappointment, especially since there were so many good reviews on here!</li>
    <li> These guys are super cheap in quality. I was expecting something nice from the description and price. The way the tweezers are slanted, they can&#x27;t pluck eyebrow hair AT ALL. They can&#x27;t grab hairs and hold onto them while plucking. It just doesn&#x27;t even have the grip to do it</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers! I first saw them in Walmart and I bought a few from there over the years, but suddenly they quit selling them and I had to stock up before having to switch to a new pair later on down the road.</li>
    <li> Not too bad, not too good. Same quality as the grocery store brands that you can get for $4. I was hoping for something more precise. It is sharp so it cuts some hairs instead of pulling them, especially it you grab with the tip.</li>
    <li> Probably some of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought. Bought some for my mom and my aunties too. Can&#x27;t find a better tweezer for the price!</li>
    <li> consider these disposable or buy something else. worked great for about 2 months, then started to loose its grip. average tweezers.</li>
    <li> This is a great Tweezer that works well and is ascetically pleasing! I recommend this product completely and believe that it will last for a long time!</li>
    <li> I normally do not like slant tipped tweezers becuase most tend not ot grab tightly enough; however, these diamond tipped tweezers are not only lightweight and not bulky, but they have a great grip.  I use them when applying nail shields to my fingernails and i never have to worry that they are going to loose their grip and have the heated nail shield fall out.  The little case that comes with it is nice too so I can protect them and find them in my bag easily.  The price can&#x27;t be beat!  I&#x27;ve seen these in discount stores for nearly $12 each!</li>
    <li> The ends meet together nicely and really grip the hair.  My old Revlon tweezers stopped grabbing the hair, but this replacement is great.</li>
    <li> The inside of the tweezer is rigid so when you go to pull the hairs they don&#x27;t slip. They even come with a really nice case to keep them in so they aren&#x27;t just thrown inside your purse. I would definitely recommend these! I&#x27;ll probably be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> Good job the material the delivery date meet my expectation</li>
    <li> These are my favorite tweezers for a good price. I bought the first pair over 6 years ago, and lost them recently....so I bought another pair! I have to hide these from my husband, he&#x27;s always asking about them and they are MINE.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers -- they changed the design a bit, but they still work well on even the shortest, thinnest hairs!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite tweezers. It&#x27;s very easy to grip the hairs with these. I bought two just in case I lost one. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on anything else.</li>
    <li> My second pair; best for grasping very fine hairs or splinters.  Diamond grip improves control.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! I use them for my eyebrows and they grip the hair perfectly to pull of the whole peice. They dont break the hair at all. Would highly reccommend.</li>
    <li> After several discouraging purchases of tweezers, even expensive supposedly the best, I am so glad I found these! I figured out the problem with tweezers I had purchased are smooth metal on the inside causing them to slip off the hair more than it grabs the hair. These tweezers have Revlon&#x27;s &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; coating on the inside which grabs the hair and doesn&#x27;t slip off. Aggravation gone! I am a happy camper!!</li>
    <li> Much better than the normal tweezers that have slick tips, like the other Revlon ones. The diamond grip feature really works.</li>
    <li> I have one hair that grows out of my face above where I shave that drives me nuts. Used a pair of cruddy&lt;br /&gt;tweezers for years to pluck it and finally bought these. Very happy with them. Tips are kind of grippy so it grabs the hair better.</li>
    <li> Totally useless, just a waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a good quality pair of tweezers, but it doesn&#x27;t work when i try to tweeze the very fine eyebrow hairs.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are Awesome. They really grip well. Watch out for plucking hairs in sensitive area&#x27;s. These babies do damage!</li>
    <li> I bought these on the recommendation of a friend. She raved about them, and I couldn&#x27;t resist.  The price was very high, I thought.  But she said to try, so I did.  I am SO glad I listened to her.  Its a little thing, but these tweezers make my life easier and save me time.  The grip is so good that I can tweeze hairs on the first attempt.  No more grabbing, pulling, hurting and having no results.  They are SO worth it!</li>
    <li> Perfect angle for me.</li>
