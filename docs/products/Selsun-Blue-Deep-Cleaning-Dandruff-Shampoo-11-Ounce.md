      <li>great scalp exfoliate and stimulate.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>Great shampoo at a great price.</li>
      <li>It is also good for skin problems and itchy skin.</li>
      <li>This can&#x27;t be good for the ocean environment or the fish.  </li>
      <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>Even store brands of t gel are good</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very good and easy to use.</li>
      <li>To each their own.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will not spend this kind of money for this product.</li>
      <li>Good product but not my Selsun favorite.  </li>
      <li>and since then, I have had NO dandruff of any kind, or flaking, or itching.</li>
      <li>Smells great, works great, no residue or strange smell.</li>
      <li>Some companies have agreed not to manufacture any more of these products but are not removing existing products from the shelves.</li>
      <li>But the very best I have ever used was recently prescribed by my dermatologist (60 days ago)</li>
      <li>I love this product for more than the fact that it helps with dandruff.</li>
      <li>Love that it was a gel.</li>
      <li>I would not use it daiky, unless maybe you had an outstanding conditioner.</li>
      <li>but it surely did for me..</li>
      <li>My favorite anti-dandruff product</li>
      <li>It smells great, kinda citrusy, and leaves my hair feeling much softer than the Dermarest could have ever provided.  </li>
      <li>Having worked in the consumer beauty industry, most companies were moving away from using plastic bubbles as an ingredient.  </li>
      <li>and I must say that this shampoo is even better.  </li>
      <li>I like neurogenic t gel better.  </li>
      <li>and I wish it didn&#x27;t - we don&#x27;t need more plastic in the ocean.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipper</li>
      <li>It gave me more dandruff.</li>
      <li>I think this is one of the most advanced shampoos for scalp itch.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s most important.  </li>
      <li>if you need 3% sacylic acid for your dandruff, its a great product and possibly cheaper than at the store most times.</li>
      <li>Packaging fine.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, and safely packaged for delivery.</li>
      <li>This brand is very useful for remove dandruff.</li>
      <li>Love it -- really helps -- gentle although effective</li>
      <li>Just get the original.  </li>
      <li>I hoped that the cleansing beads in the shampoo would get my scalp really clean and keep it cleaner between every-other-day shampooings.</li>
      <li>I have used several different dandruff shampoos ( as recommended by my doctor), but the best non prescription product is a Grandpa&#x27;s  Pine Tar based shampoo available from Amazon.</li>
      <li>This particular Selsun Blue helps with body acne, and dandruff with a pleasant light scent.</li>
      <li>This Shampoo has helped calm my scalp until I figured out how to solve the root problem.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh, and strips hair products out well.</li>
      <li>Once I started using this product (and using it the right way)</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping</li>
      <li>Iam going to go to my local store tonight to pick up some more if they don&#x27;t have it I am coming back to amazon immediately to get more.</li>
      <li>I love it because now I only use two things in a shower, this and a conditioner, instead of 3-4 things a shampoo, conditioner, acne face wash, and acne body wash.</li>
      <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t work any better than the regular stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any reason to spend more for the Selsun dandruff shampoo w/cleansing beads when the standard Selsun shampoo works just as well.  </li>
      <li>He has tried every major brand and they all have a very noxious strong smell that permeates the house.</li>
      <li>&quot; over the other one, and the beads are too soft anyway to do a good job at exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - Works so well for me and itchy scalp or dry scalp in the winter.</li>
      <li>It seems from the comments that it costs more than the others, but when I bought it at the store it was pretty much the same price, maybe a few cents more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more gentle if it accidentally gets in the eyes, but its better to avoid eye contact whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
      <li>and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>but you will have to wash your hair every three days for it to work really really well for</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job really well</li>
      <li>and its cheaper on here than anywhere else really.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>I have learned that the water is the main problem.</li>
      <li>I prefer the standard Selsun Blue significantly better than the &#x27;bubbles&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Another concern I have is that the bubbles are made out of plastic and are causing issues in sewage systems.  </li>
      <li>Thi stuff is great, maybe some of you guys are using it wrong</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m finding Selsun Blue may not be too effective for me in general, but I will compare this version to the other one.</li>
      <li>Great product, works as well as described, hard to go back to regular shampoo after using this!  </li>
      <li>The other selsun blue products did an okay job though.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>i like the clear color as if i forget to wash it off my ears.</li>
      <li>This shampoo fixed my dandruff overnight.</li>
      <li>my scalp blemishes are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft, which makes the hairstyle.</li>
      <li>but if you actually know how to use dandruff shampoo, which requires a lot of scrubbing and really scratching it into your scalp to get at the essence of the flakes, you will immediately feel these scrubbing beads working.</li>
      <li>After applying, add some extra water, than gently scrub into scalp.</li>
      <li>This prescription COMPLETELY STOPPED the irritation and any scaling.</li>
      <li>I like the little microbeads and clean scent.</li>
      <li>My 12yr old has had dandruff, especially winter-time dandruff, since she was 6.</li>
      <li>I ended up throwing it away and buying a bottle of the old Selsun Blue that I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
      <li>If Selsun Blue works normally for you, go with the regular version and save yourself a dollar or two.</li>
      <li>I normally use a selsun blue salicylic acid shampoo (they generally come in translucent bottles, unlike the solid bottles for regular selsun blue).  </li>
      <li>You use very little, about a quarter&#x27;s diameter worth, once or twice a week.</li>

<li> If it is difficult to lather, add a little more water.</li>
<li> It keeps the dandruff away and doesn&#x27;t make your scalp dry.</li>
<li> Only thing I question is... are the little beads plastic that ends up in our lakes, rivers and oceans?</li>
<li> Has those tiny little ball things.</li>
<li> When I saw the blue little balls, I thought it will work</li>
<li> Selsun Bue does a great job of eliminating dandruff without the horrible odor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or smell bad in the sunlight. It doesn&#x27;t tingle or feel cold/burn when you wash your hair. It keeps the dandruff away and doesn&#x27;t make your scalp dry. The bottle doesn&#x27;t open when its in your bag/luggage. My favorite anti-dandruff product</li>
    <li> Helps out great with my dandruff</li>
    <li> I normally use a selsun blue salicylic acid shampoo (they generally come in translucent bottles, unlike the solid bottles for regular selsun blue).  It&#x27;s all I use and it works very well.  I tried this product one time and hated it.  In order to get the little beads to stay in suspension, they had to make the medium that carries it really thick and gooey (or the beads would fall to the bottom).  I don&#x27;t notice any benefit from the beads, but now the stuff is hard to get out, hard to work to a lather, and hard to rinse - so I stopped using it after a few tries and went back to the regular.  Avoid this product, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good and easy to use. Leaves hair soft, which makes the hairstyle. I tried it and I feel that I have been totally removed from dandruff and scalp problems.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this shampoo, it has given me very good results.</li>
    <li> I hoped that the cleansing beads in the shampoo would get my scalp really clean and keep it cleaner between every-other-day shampooings. The results with this Selsun were the same as other Selsun dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  Does keep the dandruff away though and that&#x27;s most important.  I don&#x27;t see any reason to spend more for the Selsun dandruff shampoo w/cleansing beads when the standard Selsun shampoo works just as well.  Addendum:  It been reported that the cleansing beads used in shampoos, body scrubs and facial scrubs are made of plastic.  The plastic beads end up in the ocean.  Fish eat them and they&#x27;ve been found in all kinds of fish when being cleaned and gutted for the marketplace.  This can&#x27;t be good for the ocean environment or the fish.  I will never again buy a product containing plastic beads.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work any better than the regular stuff. Those beads, although they look numerous, don&#x27;t do anything at all! Stuff is even harder to get out of your hair rinsing out. I ended up throwing it away and buying a bottle of the old Selsun Blue that I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised. Packaging fine.</li>
    <li> When I saw the blue little balls, I thought it will work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is ....it ...doesn&#x27;t .....work...at ...all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not spend this kind of money for this product.</li>
    <li> But after 1st time use this cleared my head of about 80% dandruff. I&#x27;ve had it so bad I would just stare at the mirror looking at my entirely dandruff covered head but today I&#x27;m now seeing minor flakes and I can actually see the skin of my scalp! I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you but it surely did for me.. I went ham on my head trying to scrub away everything away for 8 minutes. Maybe the trick is to be really rough</li>
    <li> excellent service and product</li>
    <li> PLEASE stay away from anything with &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34;- shampoos, face scrubs, body washes etc. They are tiny plastic balls that eventually end up in bodies of water- lakes and oceans. Fish and other water creatures eat the little balls thinking they are tiny fish and insect eggs. Except these beads do not digest and simply fill the creatures stomach with inedible plastic until it dies of starvation. Some companies have agreed not to manufacture any more of these products but are not removing existing products from the shelves.</li>
    <li> This shampoo fixed my dandruff overnight. I was using an expensive Redken before, and one night with this cured my problem. If I switch back and forth, the dandruff comes back. It smells fresh, and strips hair products out well.</li>
    <li> our doctor reccomended us to use this for dermatitus . i like the clear color as if i forget to wash it off my ears. i will not go out with blue on me, i hope this product sticks around it is great for our needs over 60</li>
    <li> i dint like this shampoo as its texture is like gel and makes my hair as dry grass after wash waste of money</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.  Just get the original.  The beads they advertise is a joke, doesn&#x27;t clean deep like the original, and my hair and scalp feel like crap after using this.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as well as described, hard to go back to regular shampoo after using this!  Arrived quickly, and safely packaged for delivery.</li>
    <li> BUEN DIA ME ENCUENTRO EN COLOMBIA Y ME PARECIO UN PRODUCTO EXCELENTE SOLUCIONE MI PROBLEMA DE CASPA Y COSTRAS DEL CUERO CABELLUDO MIL GRACIAS</li>
    <li> Just what the Dr. Ordered</li>
    <li> if you need 3% sacylic acid for your dandruff, its a great product and possibly cheaper than at the store most times.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. It gave me more dandruff.</li>
    <li> This brand is very useful for remove dandruff. The price is acceptable.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipper</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, no residue or strange smell.</li>
    <li> This worked great! Love that it was a gel. The other ones we bought were like water and hard to poor in one spot.</li>
    <li> great scalp exfoliate and stimulate.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;a little drying on the hair but kills that dandruff!</li>
    <li> On a brand like &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders&amp;#34; just never worked with me, even with additional conditioner.  But just with one use of this one from &amp;#34;Selsun Blue&amp;#34;, the itch just stopped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding Selsun Blue may not be too effective for me in general, but I will compare this version to the other one. There isn&#x27;t enough \\&quot;microcleansing beads\\&quot; to make this \\&quot;deep cleansing\\&quot; over the other one, and the beads are too soft anyway to do a good job at exfoliation. They look numerous enough in the bottle, but a normal dollop of shampoo only has a few beads in it. If Selsun Blue works normally for you, go with the regular version and save yourself a dollar or two.</li>
    <li> Keeps my scalp from breaking out.</li>
    <li> Works Well For Me! It is highly concentrated, so only use a small amount. After applying, add some extra water, than gently scrub into scalp. Lather it up for about 5-minutes, and rinse. If it is difficult to rinse, you probably used too much. If it is difficult to lather, add a little more water. This product works great and I have no complaints at all, not sure what is going on with the rest of the reviews. Some people don&#x27;t like it. To each their own. I like it, its great, it works very well, and doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell and weird color like the Blue version. It&#x27;s a little more gentle if it accidentally gets in the eyes, but its better to avoid eye contact whenever possible. It is also good for skin problems and itchy skin. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  To those will poor results, Salicylic Acid must remain in contact with your scalp for a number of minutes for any effectiveness at all.  Lather up your hair as soon as you get in the shower, and let it remain on your scalp as you wash your body and face.  Rinsing your hair should be the final step in this process.  If you&#x27;re like me, that means it will be on your scalp for 5-10 minutes.  If you do this, you&#x27;ll see that it does in fact work.  If you lather up and rinse immediately, you might as well use VO5 or the cheapest shampoo you can find.  No medicated shampoo should be used in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t specifically have dandruff, but have scalp acne and painful zits along my hairline.  Once I started using this product (and using it the right way) my scalp blemishes are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Love it -- really helps -- gentle although effective</li>
    <li> I have used several different dandruff shampoos ( as recommended by my doctor), but the best non prescription product is a Grandpa&#x27;s  Pine Tar based shampoo available from Amazon. But the very best I have ever used was recently prescribed by my dermatologist (60 days ago) and since then, I have had NO dandruff of any kind, or flaking, or itching. This prescription COMPLETELY STOPPED the irritation and any scaling. The product is :  KETOCONAZOLE SHAMPOO 2%. It must be 2%, 1% is not adequate. You use very little, about a quarter&#x27;s diameter worth, once or twice a week. After suffering for 50 plus years, this product actually did what it promised.  No more dandruff !!</li>
    <li> Has those tiny little ball things. Gross.</li>
    <li> If you have dandruff, this is a great product. I would not use it daiky, unless maybe you had an outstanding conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product for more than the fact that it helps with dandruff. It seems from the comments that it costs more than the others, but when I bought it at the store it was pretty much the same price, maybe a few cents more. The key thing about this one though is the ingredients. It has salicylic acid at 3% and because of this, not only do I use it as a shampoo but a body wash as well. That stuff is the same as what is in expensive acne body washes. This particular Selsun Blue helps with body acne, and dandruff with a pleasant light scent. I love it because now I only use two things in a shower, this and a conditioner, instead of 3-4 things a shampoo, conditioner, acne face wash, and acne body wash. This is a multi-tasker.</li>
    <li> Best dandruff shampoo my husband has ever used. He has tried every major brand and they all have a very noxious strong smell that permeates the house. Selsun Bue does a great job of eliminating dandruff without the horrible odor.</li>
    <li> I switched over from Dermarest Psoriasis Medicated Shampoo Plus Conditioner to this and I must say that this shampoo is even better.  It smells great, kinda citrusy, and leaves my hair feeling much softer than the Dermarest could have ever provided.  I use this to descale my psoriatic plaques and the salicylic acid 3% work without fail.  I just leave it in my hair and massage it into my scalp for several minutes (longer than it feels) then rinse it out without any issue.  This is probably one of the best medicated shampoos I&#x27;ve used for the condition and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  If you have scalp psoriasis, or even heavy dandruff, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Good quality for the price. Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> We have bad water. I have learned that the water is the main problem. This Shampoo has helped calm my scalp until I figured out how to solve the root problem. I like the little microbeads and clean scent. I think this is one of the most advanced shampoos for scalp itch. I am not a huge fan of the &amp;#34;Gel-Like&amp;#34; consistency though, I had to re-wet my head so that I could distribute it.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that I won&#x27;t need to use scalp relief shampoo after I start using my shower filter.</li>
    <li> Thi stuff is great, maybe some of you guys are using it wrong but if you actually know how to use dandruff shampoo, which requires a lot of scrubbing and really scratching it into your scalp to get at the essence of the flakes, you will immediately feel these scrubbing beads working. It feels like a scalp massage for me, and I use regular shampoo its so boring now, I can&#x27;t even feel it I just want to be done.  Iam going to go to my local store tonight to pick up some more if they don&#x27;t have it I am coming back to amazon immediately to get more. I ran out, tried to buy Suave for mens dandruff shampoo because they didn&#x27;t have this and now I really am hurting bad for some deep cleaning</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a big bank like really fake it does it&#x27;s job really well but you will have to wash your hair every three days for it to work really really well for you get the antrum not to come back</li>
    <li> Great shampoo at a great price. Works well, no flakes, but had to upgrade to medical shampoo because this wasn&#x27;t getting the job done well enough.</li>
    <li> My 12yr old has had dandruff, especially winter-time dandruff, since she was 6. This is the only thing that works for her. The 4-star is because it has microbeads and I wish it didn&#x27;t - we don&#x27;t need more plastic in the ocean. Dilemma.</li>
    <li> After trying all the usual products, along with higher priced brands, nothing seemed to work for my teen&#x27;s scalp. This is the ONLY product that works! He uses it daily and can now go back to wearing dark shirts.</li>
    <li> I like neurogenic t gel better.  Even store brands of t gel are good</li>
    <li> Great product and my doctor told me to use as a body wash which helps with any itch issues.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - Works so well for me and itchy scalp or dry scalp in the winter. Only thing I question is... are the little beads plastic that ends up in our lakes, rivers and oceans? Or a material that fully dissolves?</li>
    <li> I prefer the standard Selsun Blue significantly better than the &#x27;bubbles&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Another concern I have is that the bubbles are made out of plastic and are causing issues in sewage systems.  Having worked in the consumer beauty industry, most companies were moving away from using plastic bubbles as an ingredient.  Hopefully Chattem follows suit soon.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately you cant find this stuff on California shelves, dont know why.  But after years of trying Tar, Selenium, and other toxic combination to get my runaway flakes under control this seems to have defied all odds and done just that.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good product but not my Selsun favorite.  Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying i have tried EVERYTHING to combat my flaky scalp. Head &amp; Shoulders, selsun blue ( every other version they have), and countless other dandruff controllers.&lt;br /&gt;None of them worked. The other selsun blue products did an okay job though.&lt;br /&gt;But this one WORKS! and its cheaper on here than anywhere else really.</li>
