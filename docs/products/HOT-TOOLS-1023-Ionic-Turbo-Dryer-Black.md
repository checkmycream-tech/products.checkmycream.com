      <li>But I would like a more ergonomic handle and a little bit of better weight balance.</li>
      <li>Up front though this seems to be a good one, light for it&#x27;s size, high airflow and quite a few settings.</li>

      <li>It is identical to the first one that died after a couple years.  </li>
      <li>Does not get hot enough but for the price, it works ok.</li>
      <li>However, it broke exactly 9 days after I bought it.</li>
      <li>but it still smells funny.</li>
      <li>and I like it pretty well.</li>
      <li>I ordered it because I want one I can run on hot with my difuser.  </li>
      <li>Would I recommend this product not unless you are willing to take a risk.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Light weight, varied heat settings; works well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect blow drying for years now, and I thought, when I ordered this baby, that it would be it. Well, it&#x27;s not. I have only been using it for a week now, but I hate that the buttons are on the side. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense. When you are holding the dryer, your hand naturally grips right where the buttons are and tends to change the settings on the dryer. I hate that! Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair any faster than my previous dryer. I am still on the fence on whether I want to return the dryer or not....will use it a few more times and see how it goes....</li>
    <li> Really like everything except for the placement of the switches.  They are right where the palm of you had lies and tend to switch settings when you are using it.  Overall, great dryer at a great price and would buy again.  Seller (Outlet) shipped in one day.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer bit the dust and I decided one with attachments would be nice instead of having a hair iron and a curler, I wanted to have smooth silky looking hair.  If that is what you are looking for then my advise is to....&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS HAIR DRYER!  It drys in less time and your hair shines from the comb attachment looking just as it does when you use a flat iron.  I ordered this item and 3 days later it was in my bathroom.  It was a great buy and works magnificantly.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer has been a major disappointment for me. I normally love hot tools products and rarely ever write a bad review but each time I use this dryer I get so angry that it&#x27;s led me to complain. It worked okay for maybe a month and then out of nowhere the hot air would switch to cold for a 30 seconds at a time (without me pressing the cool shot). This is extremely infuriating when you&#x27;re trying to blow dry your hair in a hurry. Today was the day it finally just stopped working altogether on me. I&#x27;ll probably go back to purchasing a revlon dryer since it has served me much better than this.</li>
    <li> Heating element went out in about 4 months, not impressed.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair but when I dry it at my gym I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t as frizzy so I ordered the exact hairdryer that my gym has and now my hair looks great everyday!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She asked for light weight and quick drying.  She loved my hair dryer and I was unable to purchase it due to how old it was.  I have a friend who recommended this one.  Her daughter is a hairdresser and she had recommended it to her.</li>
    <li> This dryer blew hot air for a few minutes, and then only blew cool air, and would cut on and off between hot and cool air.  When I sent it back to the Company, they said they tested it and it was fine.  Cannot believe what bad business they represent by saying that.  It absolutely was an inadequate product, and it is my guess they put it back in stock for someone else to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  Best dryer money can buy in my opinion.  Nothing bad to say about this hair dryer.  A must have!</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer died and I loved that hair dryer, so I bought this one which is exactly like my old one just a different model.  It&#x27;s not as powerful as my last one, but it still gets the job done.  My package arrived on time and in good condition.    Update 12/15/14:  I bought this hair dryer a little over a year ago.  In the past few months, it started switching from hot to cold while in use, so I cleaned out the filter.  That prevented the switch in temperature, but now it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to and takes forever to dry my hair. I have short hair that is fine, so it shouldn&#x27;t take very long.  A little disappointed that this dryer only held up for about a year.</li>
    <li> Dries hair good. Button in the middle gets in the way when drying.  Bad place for it,should be on side.</li>
    <li> This is my second Hot Tools hair dryer.  It is identical to the first one that died after a couple years.  My first one&#x27;s handle cracked, but it didn&#x27;t affect the operation at all.  And, I&#x27;m hoping this one holds up better.  I love the grip.  And, it works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> Product works great, and does exactly what it says it will do for your hair. I would recommend this highly!</li>
    <li> This dryer dried my hair fast, and is lightweight. However, it broke exactly 9 days after I bought it. I invested in a more expensive Hot Tools dryer, hopefully it doesn&#x27;t have the same issues!</li>
    <li> I am going to update this review in nine months, I have bought many hairdryers that don&#x27;t make it that long. Up front though this seems to be a good one, light for it&#x27;s size, high airflow and quite a few settings. The switches are in a bad place. However I&#x27;m not sure where else they might put them, on the top? In a rise that contains a heat shield? With a cover? I&#x27;m just not sure but where they are is not so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good so far I hope it will continue to be and I like it pretty well.</li>
    <li> I did a LOT of research before purchasing, since I want a product that will last a long time and do a great job.  While I have only owned this for about a month, I&#x27;m thrilled with it so far - and I&#x27;ve purchased other Hot Tools items in the past that are still going strong after years!  Love the cool/warm/hot setting, as well as high/low.  It doesn&#x27;t slide off the counter when you put it down for a second, and has a great hook to hang and get out of the way when finished.  I have thick, heavy, hair that tends to be dry and flyaway but I&#x27;m extremely pleased!</li>
    <li> this has been a great tool for my business ! It gets the job done in no time, and the price was great too ! Well worth the purchase !</li>
    <li> Have been using this for over 2 years, and just bought my second one because it&#x27;s lightweight, balanced, and the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It is light weight but it really doesn&#x27;t dry my hair very quickly, certainly not like my last hair dryer. It last 6 years and I use the hair dryer everyday sometimes twice a day.</li>
    <li> Does not get as hot as expected while on the highest settings.  Okay for thin/short hair types.  I would not recommend for thick or long hair.</li>
    <li> But it gets HOT .. I ordered it because I want one I can run on hot with my difuser.  I run it on medium heat for normal blow drying.  Great product.  Been using since Feb 2013 with no issues.</li>
    <li> I am waiting for my pack slip so that I can get my warranty.</li>
    <li> Dries hair well without a lot of heat. Comb attachment comes off so if you have thick hair, take hair in small section when blow drying.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dryer! When my other finally quit, I without hesitation bought another. It&#x27;s has amazing frizz control which is awesome for this Alabama heat!</li>
    <li> Purchased in Nov 2012. Worked great for a couple years, but the motor died after about 2.5 years. I&#x27;ve had hair dryers for much longer than that, so I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough but for the price, it works ok. Received item very fast. I would recommend this for home usage</li>
    <li> Hot tools sets the gold standard for hair products.  This one is no different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, not as loud as my other dryer that was 1875 watt, and somehow lessens flyaways (I don&#x27;t know how!)</li>
    <li> I bought this item after using my Mother-in-law&#x27;s and I love it.  The cord is long and doesn&#x27;t get tangled and the the multiple heat settings prevent me from overheating/burning my hand (like my old dryer did).  It is very affordable as well - would certainly recommend for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have afro, tightly coiled hair(the size of a pen tip), thick, natural, 5 inch hair and since my hair has gotten longer, I need to use heat to dry it faster.  I decided after researching, that this was the best dryer for my money. I wanted a dryer with these attachments and of ionic or titanium technology. This dryer dries very quickly. I did a blow out on towel dried hair on medium heat, high speed in 10 min! My hair was also shiny afterwards. It may sound weird, but whenever I used this dryer, my hair is much softer than it usually is with out it or airdried. I don&#x27;t ever use the high setting, and the medium setting does just fine.  My only complaints are the side switches, as one reviewer noted, can be easily changed during use. I try to place my thumb between the switches to avoid this. Also, it can get a bit heavy if you have extended use, so luckily it only took 10 min to dry my entire head.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair so quickly, it&#x27;s pretty quiet (for a hair dryer), it&#x27;s light weight, the settings are perfect and it leaves my hair shiny and virtually undamaged. I&#x27;m so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I would give this dryer 4 stars however I only had the dryer for 3 months and it stopped blowing hot air so basically it is no good for my needs because I cannot dry my hair with cold air. I will say for the first few months the dryer worked well. I&#x27;m biracial black and white so my hair tends to be frizzy and bushy and needs a lot of heat to get it to the point were it is manageable to straighten the drier  dried my hair fast, evenly and my hair didn&#x27;t feel really dry or burnt my hair felt soft and conditioned, but after 3 months it stopped working. I&#x27;m really frustrated because now I have to spend another $30.00 to buy another dryer this becomes expensive. My last dryer which was not a Hot Tools dryer lasted 3 plus years. Would I buy another dryer from Hot Tools probably NOT. Would I recommend this product not unless you are willing to take a risk.</li>
    <li> Works great and on high it blows way harder the my other hairdryer</li>
    <li> The combination of heat and speed helps get the right setting when I am drying my hair. But I would like a more ergonomic handle and a little bit of better weight balance. Other than that, no compliants</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer it has become my best friend in terms of I just started working out and afterwards I use this blowdryer and my hair is dry in seconds and is straight and shiny and silky. I have naturally curly hair so I am loving this blowdryer. I love the pic attachment also it&#x27;s like going to the salon and getting a blow out</li>
    <li> I have a friend who has a similar one she got from Sally&#x27;s for $60. I loved it and it dried my hair in like 10 minuets. I have a lot of hair and my hair is very fine so drying my hair on high would kill my ends. I use high on this hair drier and it doesn&#x27;t bother my ends. I only gave it 4 stars because when I&#x27;m using it it smells like melting plastic. I thought it would go away but it still smells funny. After almost 2 months the smell is still there. I read the other people had the same funny smell. I love it still and I never use it more then 10 minuets so I don&#x27;t worry.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and usually use Solano brand blow dryers (Super Solano and the like) and when my last Solano burned out after 5 years I ordered another from Amazon and picked up this Hot Tools dryer at my local beauty supply to get me through until my nice one arrives.&lt;br /&gt;As a non-professional &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; blow dryer, I think it&#x27;s fine. Very light weight, a good price, and does actually leave the hair quite smooth and shiny. But for use in-salon use, it&#x27;s absolute crap. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot at all, or have much motor power to it. It take forever to dry a medium thickness head of hair. Glad Amazon carries my go-to dryer for cheaper than I can get it at the beauty supply!</li>
    <li> I was hoping the high heat setting would be hot.  It isn&#x27;t.  It is light weight.  I do tend to bump the control switches while I&#x27;m using the dryer, though.  Also, the attchments are difficult to take off &amp; put on.  Seems to work okay, it dries hair.</li>
    <li> I have had this blow dryer for 4 months and love it! It dries my hair faster than my previous Revlon dryer and I use it every day and have not had any problems. I also like the temperature setting that are available, good buy for the money!</li>
    <li> Very light weight and drys my hair fast. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the controls on the side get hit accidentally.</li>
    <li> love the feel of this hair dryer but when you hold it you turn the control buttons constantly.  Not good.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer has a ton of power which is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I have long thick hair and hate spending up to 30 minutes drying it in the morning. I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks, but it&#x27;s been really great so far!</li>
    <li> purchased this item late August 2011, stopped working in October 2012.  Seems there is a short in the wiring and you can&#x27;t take it apart to fix it without breaking it.  My last blow dryer was a Conair and lasted 6 years! and only had to be replaced because plastic was breaking off but dryer still worked.  This one lasted little more than a year..........gets too expensive to have to buy a new one every year.  Probably not a lot of quality control in the assembly line.</li>
    <li> It just had &#x27;Hot Tools&amp;#34; on  it, and &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34; where the vent is at.  Nothing like what is shown in the picture as advertised. Blow dryer was sent back.  A second attempt was made thinking there may have been a simple mistake on my part, but apparently the company advertising these blow dryers were showing one dryer and sending out another. So, it was sent back a second time as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have the original blow dryer like the one that is shown in the picture, unfortunately it just served it&#x27;s time and I would like another one just like it, not like the one that has &amp;#34;Gold&amp;#34; all over it like the two I received.  I cannot remember the name of the company that sold those.  I don&#x27;t blame Amazon, I know it was a company working through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Pamela Gates</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer around.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Multiple heat and speed settings.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this blow dryer! I have a lot of hair and this feels like it does a salon quality job for a fraction of the price. Love it and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> absolutely wonderful blowdryer but didn&#x27;t last all that long.  Had to replace it already.  I have always loved Hot Tools.</li>
    <li> I received the blow dryer quickly !&lt;br /&gt;I love the product- I have hard to manage hair and I can easily give myself a sleek blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought it because of the claims of low noise. Found out that it may be slightly quieter because there is very little air that blows out. Doesn&#x27;t get the job done for me so I returned it.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer!!  It is great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Amazing hairdryer! I love it and I recommend it to everyone Great price and does a great job! Thank you</li>
    <li> I bout this dryer because I had &amp;!loved the real hot tools 1. This 1 is a fake, it burned out &amp; started sparking. It also starts to cool down on it&#x27;s own. I love the original. This is a huge waist of money &amp;!your expectations</li>
    <li> Got it in a good amount of time! Works great and got a good deal on it! Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> This dryer is the lightest one I have ever held in my hands. My wife is a hairdresser and loves this dryer, it dries quickly and does not end up killing her arm.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and uniform airflow.  The switches are a pro.  The grip is rubber so it&#x27;s easy to hold.  Dries hair quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the second blow dryer I&#x27;ve owned exact same dryer. I dropped my other one a few to many times and replaced it w. the better hot tools dryer...no go back to this gem.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer is excellent. Drys hair fast &amp; not burning hot like others. My only issue is where the control switches are on the handle. When you hold it your hands are on the switches &amp; tend to shut them off. I&#x27;ve just adjusted how I hold it.</li>
    <li> I needed a new dryer for my first salon job but didn&#x27;t have a lot to spend.  I know Hot Tools is a good reliable brand but I was worried for the amazing price it wouldn&#x27;t be a good dryer. I was pleasantly surprised by how quick hair drys and it wasn&#x27;t frizzy!!!!  It wasn&#x27;t the quietest dryer I&#x27;ve seen but it isn&#x27;t loud either, I guess it&#x27;s right in the middle lol!  I love this dryer and it makes me look prof at work! I may buy another for myself at home!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is only warm on high heat.  when you turn the blowing down is is cool and is not for drying.  I thought all speeds would work but they dont really.  Hot high is hot.  Hot meduim and low are cold.  Cold is cold on all speeds.  Would not recommend this product thought it would be good by the brand name but was wrong.</li>
    <li> This dry was super until it died after 6 months. I noticed at 5 months it started \\&quot;cycling\\&quot; from hot to cool throughout the drying of my hair. I bought it from my salon and paid near twice the amount listed on Amazon. I thought it would last longer since it came from and was recommended by my Salon.  Didn&#x27;t save receipt or box.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Loved this brand in the gym locker room but when I got my own it didn&#x27;t work out so well.  As another buyer noted the buttons are in the way and my hand bumps them.  Then, after a few uses I started actually getting burned!!  The handle is getting do hot I can&#x27;t hold it.  Not sure how to return this now that I used it and tossed the box so unfortunately I have to take it as a loss.  Hopefully my review will save someone else&#x27;s money.</li>
    <li> not as high a quality as I had expected</li>
    <li> Had this hair dryer a little over a month now and love it. I have long, thick hair and the drying time has cut by 1/3 to 1/2 depending on how wet my hair is.  I like having the buttons on the side of the dryer, allows for ease in changing settings quickly.  While not whisper quite, this is definitely not as loud as the cheap discount store dryers I have been buying.</li>
