      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>As a moisturizer I love it and for it being SPF 50, it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I use Physicians Formula powders with sunscreen for heavier coverage and love them.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I still wear some sort of moistuzirer underneath it and then apply this on top of that followed by powder.</li>
      <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t lay this claim, it has a lovely dewy effect that so many products tout</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s tinted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Happy so far.</li>
      <li>Last note the shipping and everything was awesome and quick.</li>
      <li>Very good product, specially if you are allergic to regular cosmetics</li>
      <li>I saw a very good review of this moisturizer in my local news paper, so thought it worth trying.</li>
      <li>This tinted moisturizer is a great product if you just want a hint of color without actually having to do your make up.</li>
      <li>It went on smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>Light feeling on the skin.</li>
      <li>I mix it with a bit of my facial moisturizer and it covers perfectly and looks natural.</li>
      <li>I applied some of my own liquid foundation on top of the problem areas and this is my final result.</li>
      <li>I love that it has the high spf</li>
      <li>This is perfect for when your running late add lip gloss and mascara and out the door you go!</li>
      <li>It has a strong scent, most likely from the sunscreen, but aside from that</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>right it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little strong for me also but wouldnt stop me from using it if I liked it.</li>
      <li>I can only wear this if I have a bunch of powder on top.</li>
      <li>Also this stuff has to be washed off several times and feels more like foundation than a moustrizer.</li>
      <li>OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS BETTER FOR YOUR SKIN,</li>
      <li>The Natural to Tan works well on my very fair skin, but is sheer enough that it would probably be good for someone not so pale as I.</li>
      <li>It covers pretty well for a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, not only is the price</li>
      <li>Not sure how good it is for oily skin.</li>
      <li>.I will certainly contiune to use and just go for a lighter shade and use even in winter.</li>
      <li>is very valuable to me.</li>
      <li>The product is even better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Phy Form.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very moisturizing yet lightweight.</li>
      <li>I actually like the feel of this one much better so far.</li>
      <li>The spf in most moisturizers is usually 15 and since I spend a lot of time outdoors they aren&#x27;t adequate.</li>
      <li>I have had a good relationship with Physicians Formula and was hoping they would come out with a tinted moisturizer product that did not have the perfumes like their other tinted moisturizers - low and behold: here it is!!!</li>
      <li>Nice natural look, evens out skin tone while providing a slight glow and sun protection.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without this foundation!</li>
      <li>is 50 SPF instead of the typical 15 that is in most tinted moisturizers and makeups.</li>
      <li>light&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is decent</li>
      <li>Decent price.</li>
      <li>I am of Mexican decent with light brown skin, I bought natural to tan.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A HIGH SPF TINTED MOISTERIZER</li>
      <li>I have to wash my hands several times before leaving the house and it still wipes right off on to my clothes.</li>
      <li>I usually wear this when I plan to be out and about most of the day, or a workout.</li>
      <li>I frequently receive compliments on my skin when I wear it!</li>
      <li>Product does not provide the coverage that I was looking for, but probably would work fine for those that need less coverage.</li>
      <li>Nice sheer coverage yet makes small scars seem to disappear.</li>
      <li>To be clear, I don&#x27;t use this as my moisturizer, but as a form of foundation.</li>
      <li>if 50 and not heavy coverage.</li>
      <li>I love how moisturizing it is without being too thick of coverage.</li>
      <li>Most moisturizers leave a noticeably thick feeling on your skin.</li>
      <li>So the tone is natural but for me a pale white its still good to smooth into but a little too dark for me personally.</li>
      <li>Little small for the price but its great alternative to a heavy foundation in the summer.</li>
      <li>My skin is relatively dry and my sense of smell is very sensitive, so to have a moisturizer that can double as makeup and not give me a migraine from the smell</li>
      <li>The other brands didn&#x27;t have such a high spf.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this. I mix it with a bit of my facial moisturizer and it covers perfectly and looks natural.</li>
    <li> Very good product, specially if you are allergic to regular cosmetics</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The only negative is that I wish it would come in a larger size.  That being said just a small amount will do.  I use it when I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;wear make-up&amp;#34;, but want the little things on my face smoothed out by a little color plus moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used that has a high SPF .It has a non matt finish so looks like dewy healthy skin in summer sunshine while giving you protection from the sun .I will certainly contiune to use and just go for a lighter shade and use even in winter.</li>
    <li> I saw a very good review of this moisturizer in my local news paper, so thought it worth trying. It is affordable. It turns out to be just what I&#x27;ve needed! The spf in most moisturizers is usually 15 and since I spend a lot of time outdoors they aren&#x27;t adequate. The regular sunblocks with 50 spf are so drying. This is actually moisturizing while providing the sunblock I needed. I ordered two more for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> simple way to protect and moisturize and even skin tone.</li>
    <li> Product does not provide the coverage that I was looking for, but probably would work fine for those that need less coverage.</li>
    <li> I think it did it&#x27;s job as an SPF, but the consistency left something to be desired. It was watery. When I got sweaty, it ran quite a bit &amp; stung my eyes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used  this in the sun BUT...I usually break out with any new product and I did not with this. I applied it with a foundation brush. It went on great and did not get oily at all. It covers pretty well for a moisturizer. Happy so far.</li>
    <li> Great product. Especially considering the price.  It&#x27;s like a pre-wedding glow type tinted SPF. Great for protecting face without having to use makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, not only is the price right it doesn&#x27;t break me out. It has a strong scent, most likely from the sunscreen, but aside from that it&#x27;s very moisturizing yet lightweight. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer I love it and for it being SPF 50, it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. It went on smoothly and evenly. Dried well and felt as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything. Most moisturizers leave a noticeably thick feeling on your skin. As a foundation, you&#x27;ll need more than just this alone. Unless you have perfect skin, which I do not! Lol. I have spots that are darker than others, and brown acne scars on my temples. I applied some of my own liquid foundation on top of the problem areas and this is my final result. I am of Mexican decent with light brown skin, I bought natural to tan. Overall, would recommend!</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this foundation! Stays on. Light feeling on the skin. Great moisture. Good spf. Love!</li>
    <li> Great daytime moisturizer and gluten-free</li>
    <li> Nice sheer coverage yet makes small scars seem to disappear. I need sunscreen and moisture before I leave the house and this does the trick. I use Physicians Formula powders with sunscreen for heavier coverage and love them. The one with sponge applicator gets handed to my granddaughter because she can protect her face and is &amp;#34;doing it herself&amp;#34;! I was afraid this was not available anymore and was glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million moisturizers, from $10 to $100, and this one does it all. It moisturizes, acts as a foundation/tint and best of all has an amazing sunscreen. And I can trust the brand not to add a bunch of chemicals. Even though it doesn&#x27;t lay this claim, it has a lovely dewy effect that so many products tout but that do not actually do.  I no longer need three expensive items--tinted moisturizer, foundation and SPF.  Just this. I am blond and somewhat fair but got the tan and it is not too dark.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCTION . THIS IS A HIGH SPF TINTED MOISTERIZER THAT APPLIES AS IF YOU&lt;br /&gt;HAD PUT REGULAR FOUNDATION.MAKEUP ON, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS BETTER FOR YOUR SKIN,</li>
    <li> Not easy to apply without leaving some visible streaks of color on the face. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This tinted moisturizer is a great product if you just want a hint of color without actually having to do your make up. I thought it was a little small for the money but other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not supposed to get sun and was looking for a tinted sunscreen to also act as a foundation. This product works well for what it does. Be careful, because until it dries on your skin, it can stain clothes. It also has a scent to it that I&#x27;m not fond of - a bit chemical. I don&#x27;t wear it every day, but when I want to hide my age :-) it fits the bill. Decent price.</li>
    <li> Little small for the price but its great alternative to a heavy foundation in the summer. The beauty is that it has an spf of 50!</li>
    <li> I like the way the formula is not too greasy and glides on my skin. However I need to blend it with another moisturizer because the color is too dark for my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s MFG w/ protective ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Its affordable&lt;br /&gt;looks fabulous&lt;br /&gt;Feels light&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is decent</li>
    <li> This product is light-weight, goes on smoothly and has a very good SPF (50 SPF).  It can be used under  foundation makeup or under a very light powder.</li>
    <li> Nice color and good coverage.  I have been trying different tinted moisturizer&#x27;s to find one I like and some have been too thick/heavy with less SPF.  I actually like the feel of this one much better so far.</li>
    <li> So the tone is natural but for me a pale white its still good to smooth into but a little too dark for me personally. Also this stuff has to be washed off several times and feels more like foundation than a moustrizer. I have to wash my hands several times before leaving the house and it still wipes right off on to my clothes. I haven&#x27;t noticed any patches where it was wiped but I worry about it still blotting up my clothes.  I also wear glasses and this makes my face kinda oily for glasses so they are constantly slipping down my face. While not the worst there are way better out there. Last note the shipping and everything was awesome and quick.</li>
    <li> To be clear, I don&#x27;t use this as my moisturizer, but as a form of foundation. I still wear some sort of moistuzirer underneath it and then apply this on top of that followed by powder. I love this stuff. I blends beautifully, it&#x27;s light but has good coverage. Try it!</li>
    <li> Love this product...I hate wearing a thick cover of makeup/foundation. This is perfect for when your running late add lip gloss and mascara and out the door you go! Not oily or dry just right.</li>
    <li> It is the only makeup my daughter will wear.</li>
    <li> Good coverage. Color is a little dark for me and it has a super dewy finish which just looks greasy on me. I can only wear this if I have a bunch of powder on top. The smell is a little strong for me also but wouldnt stop me from using it if I liked it. It&#x27;s also a little sticky feeling on the skin.</li>
    <li> Nice natural look, evens out skin tone while providing a slight glow and sun protection. Not sure how good it is for oily skin. I usually wear non-comedogenic products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very hard to find the combination of foundation, moisturizer and serious sunscreen. This is it. The Natural to Tan works well on my very fair skin, but is sheer enough that it would probably be good for someone not so pale as I. Still need under-eye and spot corrector, but not much.  Thanks, Phy Form.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I love it! It is a great light-to-medium coverage that feel light-weight and gives excellent moisture. I love that is is 50 SPF instead of the typical 15 that is in most tinted moisturizers and makeups. It does have a sunscreen-like smell, but it is not very strong. My skin is relatively dry and my sense of smell is very sensitive, so to have a moisturizer that can double as makeup and not give me a migraine from the smell is very valuable to me. I also have very fair skin with many facial freckles which are not covered, but accentuated by this product in a great way. I cannot recommend it enough! I have had a good relationship with Physicians Formula and was hoping they would come out with a tinted moisturizer product that did not have the perfumes like their other tinted moisturizers - low and behold: here it is!!!</li>
    <li> I was unable to find in any retail stores.  I&#x27;am glad I was able to find thru amazon.  I love that it has the high spf if 50 and not heavy coverage.</li>
    <li> The product is even better than I expected. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and  the tint was a perfect match with my skin color.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years now. I love how moisturizing it is without being too thick of coverage. It leaves my skin with a dewy finish. I usually wear this when I plan to be out and about most of the day, or a workout. It&#x27;s very long lasting. I frequently receive compliments on my skin when I wear it! I&#x27;m olive/ tan and the natural/ tan works great through out the seasons because the color is translucent.</li>
    <li> Like the tiny bit of color it provides along with moisture. I do hope it will continue to be sold.</li>
    <li> Works so well and is the perfect coverage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands and never had the even coverage this gives.  The other brands didn&#x27;t have such a high spf.  I also like this because even if I exercise and sweat it doesn&#x27;t come off.  I wear this with powder over the top every day.  I will say that you need a moisturizer applied first because this is not very good at hydrating the skin.</li>
    <li> I like tinted moisturizer rather than foundation makeup</li>
    <li> I only tried it for a couple times and I returned it.  The color just did not blend in well with my skin tone. I also did not like the feel of it on my skin so I returned it.</li>
    <li> wonderful - no problems</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s best for dry skin. This will not work for oily or acne prone skin as it has an oil texture. I love that it&#x27;s tinted. On my</li>
