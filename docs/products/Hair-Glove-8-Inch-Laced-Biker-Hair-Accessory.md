<li> so it is a little short</li>
<li> Keeps my hair from going into a knotted mess after riding all day.</li>

<li> (Like learning how to tie your shoes but a little easier.)</li>
<li> it did take a little getting used to the weight when wrapped around my braided hair.</li>
<li> I have hair down past my butt.</li>
<li> not very good quality</li>
<li> This product arrived with one of its fasteners broken.  </li>
<li> I always had tangled hair after riding and there isn&#x27;t much worse than trying to brush thru hair that acts like it hasn&#x27;t seen a brush in years.</li>
<li> It would still work without one snap, but it was just too difficult to put in my hair, and I gave up.</li>
<li> and not to mention, it was painful.</li>

    <li> Bought this for my wife, for our motorcycle trips.  it has been great.  Easy to snap on and cinch up.</li>
    <li> This product arrived with one of its fasteners broken.  It would still work without one snap, but it was just too difficult to put in my hair, and I gave up.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife who very long hair.  We ride motorcycles so this helps a lot in keeping hair in place and hair damage from wind under control.  All this and also looks great!</li>
    <li> I have the &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; version (by another company) of this but I never use it.  I REALLY like the Hair Glove because it is very easy to put on, looks great and really works! I highly recommend it..!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair accessory that adjusts to the thickness of your hair with the adjustable lacing. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Works great and after a using it for a week I could put it on like a pro. (Like learning how to tie your shoes but a little easier.) Keeps my hair from going into a knotted mess after riding all day. As good as braiding but I can put this on myself - I can&#x27;t braid my own hair...  Last year I had the 4&amp;#34; version and this year went for the 8&amp;#34;. Might have to go with 12&amp;#34; next summer depending on hair length by then.</li>
    <li> once you figure out how to do this (not that hard, really) this is awesome. I always had tangled hair after riding and there isn&#x27;t much worse than trying to brush thru hair that acts like it hasn&#x27;t seen a brush in years. and not to mention, it was painful. this was the BEST option I have found.</li>

It is super easy to use and for those of us with thick hair it expands to fit perfectly. I get so many compliments and people are always asking where they can purchase one!!! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to put in and take out.</li>
    <li> Works great, stays in my hair it did take a little getting used to the weight when wrapped around my braided hair.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t have these in all Harley dealerships. I have hair down past my butt. Even though I put 20 small elastics all the way from top to bottom my hair still blew around like a whip in the wind when I rode. This thing gives the weight I need to keep my hair from flopping around in the wind. I&#x27;ve had many people asking me where I bought this because they want one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and so satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I liked the look of this hair glove but it was hard for me to get it snapped properly over my braid. It does have a hook you can try to hook onto our hairband, but it still required a good deal of messing with to get it snapped. Tip: loosen the straps quite a bit, more then you need to and then cinch it up once you have it snapped.</li>
    <li> I love the functionality of this item. I have received numerous questions from strangers asking where I got something so unique and attractive. It is made unique from other similar items by its adjustability.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and this is the only wrap I have bought that fits the thickness of my hair in a braid or ponytail.  I still have a good 4-5 inches hanging out but keeping it in a braid prevents damaging knotting from occurring.  I get so many compliments on this product, I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for me a couple of weeks ago and it works great! I have very long hair so it is a little short but this is the longest one that we could find. It prevents tangles and is comfortable I definitely reccomend it!!!</li>
    <li> not what you see in the picture. its like the one the blondie is using. not bad its easy to use, not very good quality but it does the job</li>
    <li> It looks exactly as the picture and it fits perfectly over my long thick hair. Putting it on is not very hard (easier than braiding your own hair). I think it looks very stylish.</li>
