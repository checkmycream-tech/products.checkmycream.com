<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received a sample of this through BzzAgent. I love the handle on this razor, it&#x27;s extremely comfortable and easy to use. The Bic Soleil Glow definitely provided me with a close shave. The blades didn&#x27;t cut my skin or provide irritation of any sort. I would definitely recommend the razor to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I received these as I am used to using razors with 5 blades. After trying these razors they are awesome. Most three bladed razors I&#x27;ve tried I have to go back over my legs several times to remove all the hair. Not with these one swipe and all the hair is gone. I would definitely recommend giving this razor a try.I also love that they come in pretty colors. I received these free from Bzzagent to test and review. I will definitely be purchasing these in the future.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free because i am a bzzzagent. In return i give my homest opinion and here it goes...i loved these! The moisture strip felt amazing and even once out of the shower and dry i still felt all nice and smooth like i had just put lotion on. The razor blades where sharp and cut close but being the head moved i did not get cut around my ankles and knees which was a big plus. I would for sure recommend these and buy myself some.</li>
    <li> For being a disposable razor I was happily surprised by the smooth shave it offered. The three blades are great and I love the moisturizing strip. The cute colors are an added bonus. I received these razors as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing razor.  The soft flex shield was a great way to add a protectant  layer of lotion type to my legs before the blades hit the skin</li>
    <li> I got to try these for free thanks to BIC and Bzzagent. They&#x27;re really great razors. The blades are sharp. Also, these razors will leave your skin feeling really silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I received these for free from BuzzAgent and I loved them. I have sensitive skin and these razors left me with a nick free smooth shave. They didn&#x27;t cause any irritation on my skin. The design on the razor is very nice and the handle has a good grip.</li>
    <li> I have never had a razor like the BIC Soleil Glow Razor. It gives me the smoothest feeling after and I feel like I can go days without having to shave again because the blades are so sharp and get so close of a shave. I love the design and color, it&#x27;s definitely the icing on the cake. I got it free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I finally get to try this thanks to BIC for free. I loved it. Very precise. Cut my shaving down too 30 minutes</li>
    <li> Wow these razors are the answer to my legs prayers. I have sensitive legs that breakout after I shave. No matter what type of razor I use or what type of shaving gel it makes no matter my legs always look red and bumpy. But I was so surprised that these razors worked. They glided on my legs with no irritation at all. Using only a bar of soap. That was a first. And I got a nice clean shave. Another first. no more razor burn! I have finally found The razorrazor for me. I&#x27;m hooked. I did receive them for free thanks to Bic. But this review is from my personal experience using this razor. Not something I had to say. Or was made to say. I really do love this razor. Thanks Bic!!!</li>
    <li> Im trying the product for free thanks to BIC and I absolutely LOVE it! I used this morning and Im soooo smooth!! Definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I like the razors, the comfort shield helps me with irritation, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Summer time means shorts, and swimming, and those breezy little skirts that look so amazing in the catalog but never quite puff out the same way in real life. Temperamental clothing aside, it also means making sure my legs are silky smooth and ready to soak up the summer sun, and you can&#x27;t do that without spending quality time with your razor. Thankfully I&#x27;ve been testing out a pack of BIC® Soleil® Glow® razors for free, courtesy of BzzAgent.com and the folks over at BIC, who seem to know a thing or two about pointed sticks. It&#x27;s hard to talk up a razor without sounding like you&#x27;ve got something to sell, so I&#x27;ll just hit you with the nitty gritty: I&#x27;ve managed to shave my legs nice and smooth (and the sides of my head, as I have a rockin&#x27; mohawk) without nicking myself, drying out my skin, or otherwise looking like I ran through a bramble patch. Although they&#x27;re disposable I&#x27;ve gotten a few good shaves out of the first one, and the price isn&#x27;t so high that I&#x27;ll try and drag each one out until the blades are dull – if you think cutting your legs with a dull razor sucks, man, you do not want to clip that spot right behind your ear. No ouches here so far, and that makes me happy gal!</li>
    <li> I tried this razor free from BIC. Awesome razor! I barely put any pressure onto my leg while I shaved.... and it did a great job. Usually I have to go over my leg a few times... not with this razor!</li>
    <li> This is the best disposable shaver I have ever used, and I believe I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This shaver leaves my legs glass smooth every time.  It never has nicked or cut me.  The head contours perfectly to your legs and under arms, and the handle feels good and solid in your hands. These shavers also last a decent amount of time, longer than other disposable shavers that I have used.  I will continue to purchase these Bic Soleil Razors.</li>
    <li> These Bic Soliel Glow razors work quite well. They do glide smoothly without knicks and cuts, though I advise slowing down around knees and ankles. The built-in moisturizing gel starts off excessive and fades away to nothing before the blades get dull, but I have found that to be true for all razors. These are pretty long-lasting. My 3 daughters and myself have been sharing one razor for 3 weeks, and it still works without needing to double-shave areas. Plain Bic razors need to be tossed after 2 weeks of shared use in our house. Definitely a couple steps up from a simple disposable bic razor.</li>
    <li> I have small hands and sometime I come across a razor with bulky handles (even women&#x27;s razors) and then I am more likely to cut myself. These are small handles that are textured, easy to hold and control.  The blades are sharp and even giving a close, safe shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*small, easy to hold razor&lt;br /&gt;*color variety in package handy if you share a bath with other users&lt;br /&gt;*clean, close, nick free shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*has the gel type strip but you still need shaving cream, lotion, or soap as the strip isn&#x27;t really all that helpful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only received one three pack, not a pack of 72. I&#x27;m not saying this to complain but people have asked about packaging and I can&#x27;t answer that for the 72 pack. Mine arrived as a prepacked three pack like I see in the store. I don&#x27;t know if the 72 is 24 packs of three (which would make sense to me) or, as another reviewer posted, she had 72 packages-as if packaged for dorms or a gym say.  I am sorry to not be able to answer this question about the product and hope you will find the answer in a review that received 72 or maybe they will add it to the product description. I will emailed amazon to suggest they do that.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Nice close shave with no irritation.  Lasts through several shaves well.  Highly recommended.  Can be pricey, so shop around for best deals!</li>
    <li> I found these rather irritating to use -- you had to press down fairly hard to get a good close shave, and the plastic frame seemed bulky and tended to get in the way. I&#x27;ll stick to my favorite, the Soleil Twilight.</li>
    <li> I have been using  [[ASIN:B000TCW0IO Schick Intuition Plus Moisturizing Care Pack, Variety Pack, 1 Pack]] for several years, and I love them.  The Bic Soleil Glow is a nice razor, but when you are already in love with one razor, it&#x27;s difficult for a new razor to measure up.  Both types of razor do a nice job of shaving, but I prefer the Schick Intuition because it has a large, chunky handle.  The handle on the Bic Soleil feels small, and harder to hold on to.</li>
    <li> I Love this Razor not only it have&#x27;s 3 blade&#x27;s but it also Glow&#x27;s in the dark as well who can ask for more? I had also received this product for FREE from BzzAgent.com</li>
    <li> I got to try these for free thanks to BIC and Bzzagent. They&#x27;re really great razors. The blades are sharp. Also, these razors will leave your skin feeling really silky and smooth. Great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I got the razors in the mail yesterday and had to immediately try them.  The shave with them was so smooth and the area that I shaved had no irritation or anything.  I would definitely buy these razors!  Loved getting to try the product for free thanks to BIC</li>
    <li> I got this bic soleil as a free trail sample to try. I would definitely recommend this products to my family and friends. Its an amazing product and I love the way it gives a smooth touch and finish to my skin. The lubricating stip helps to glide down smokthly and also the handle is broad enough to hold comfortably compared to other razors. I have tried many disposable razors but found this to be the best.</li>
    <li> I received a free package of BIC Soleil Glow razors as part of a BzzAgent Campaign. When first receiving these razors they seem cheaply made, but after using them for the first time I was surprised at how close of a shave I got with a three blade razor. The pivoting head did a great job around my knees. I was able to shave without cutting myself which usually happens with a new razor. Overall I think they did a decent job.</li>
    <li> I honestly have to say, this is an AWESOME razor! It glides well, it&#x27;s smooth, and not to mention it looks great! I think that this is the best one on the market so I definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor, it&#x27;s flexible, the handle is comfortable, the head fits into odd-shaped spots, the three blades do the job (though 4 or 5 is always better!). If I get it for free, it&#x27;s a good deal!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine anyone buying the &amp;#34;(Pack of 72)&amp;#34; for 575+ bucks, though...</li>
    <li> I got these razors from bzzagent.com as a free offer from Bic to try and review. All I can say is that I&#x27;m hooked! For the first time my husband noticed my smooth legs! I never get comments like that! Lol these are great!</li>
    <li> I’ve tried Bic Soleil razors in the past, and no matter how careful I was, I inevitably ended up nicking myself. The Bic Soleil Glow razor is definitely a new and improved razor from the previous ones I’ve tried. I got a nice, smooth shave with no nicks or cuts. I’m not sure under what circumstances someone would want to shell out the money for 72 3-packs of razors (almost a lifetime supply), but for the purposes of this review, I received one 3-pack of pretty pastels (pink, lavender, and mint green) free from being a bzzagent and promotion for BIC. The Bic Soleil Glow razor has a lubricating strip, which I consider a must. It also has a secure plastic guard over the razor for when it’s not in use. Unlike most covers that pop right off (often unintentionally), this one slides off and on and almost locks in place, making it great for travel. If you were going to make a long term commitment with a single brand and style of razor by purchasing 216 of them in one go, the Bic Soleil Glow is a good choice; it will keep you happy and satisfied for years to come.</li>
    <li> I think if you are looking for a razor to hug your legs when you save this is the razor for you!! I could never use bic razors due to being a redhead but these work very well for sensitive skin!! I love these and cant wait to go get more of them!! If it wasn&#x27;t for bzzagent I would have never known about these!</li>
    <li> Nothing stood out to me as extra special but I got a pretty good shave.  I just prefer my usual razor better and will not be switching to this one.  I did not find the shave to be quite as smooth as my current favorite but this Bic works fine.  The razor head did not pop off which is something I find really annoying about others I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> The only issue I have with these razors is the large plastic head that surrounds the blade on all sides. I feel like it prevents you from getting the closest shave possible. These razors are okay in a pinch - if I was completely out, had to run to the store and these were available I would buy them, but not if they had a better option available. They stay sharp for a couple weeks of use as a standard razor would, so no great improvement in that area for this blade.&lt;br /&gt;These are good razors, they&#x27;re just not great razors.</li>
    <li> I got my FREE Bic Soleil Glow razors yesterday from bzzagent. I tried them last night and I was pleasantly surprised at how close of a shave i got. Normally, I prefer a man&#x27;s razor like the Mac 5 with 5 blades but this little guy comes in girlie colors for under $6 for a 3 pack and does an amazing job! I love the curve of the handle it makes it easy to grip and I&#x27;m not constantly dropping my razor. Im very  happy with the quality .</li>
    <li> I got these as a sample to try out. The first thing I noticed was the quality and sturdiness of the razors. Very strong, very large head and a wide grip. I was so excited to try this product and felt confident it wouldn&#x27;t slip when using it. The three razors gave a smooth shave and did not irritate my KP, which most razors do.</li>
    <li> I received these BIC Soleil Glow Disposable Razors for free thanks to BzzAgents &amp; BIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the invite to partake in this campaign I didn&#x27;t shave until I got these razors in order to get the full effect. While shaving it felt almost as though I wasn&#x27;t. With normal razors I&#x27;m always knicking my skin and other such pains of typical shaving. Using the Soleil Glow it was such a smooth shaving experience, thanks to the blade guard. No knicks no cuts. Just smooth legs. The only negative I have with these razors is that because of the blade guard getting to the sensitive areas along the bikini area because of the size of the blade guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures included are of my overly white legs BEFORE &amp; AFTER using the BIC Soleil Glow</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife to try. Most disposable razors are unpredictable. They often aren&#x27;t sharp enough for more than a few passes on your legs before they start to dull and you risk nicks and cuts. These seem to be high quality. They&#x27;re sharp and the cutting surface is large, The downside is that you pay for the convenience. These definitely are cheap. But sometimes quality is worth paying for.</li>
    <li> I received a sample three-pack of these razors for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor feels comfortable in my small hand thanks to the shape of the handle and addition of the rubber grip. It&#x27;s easy to get a smooth, comfortable shave with the 3 blades and lubricating strip. I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any issues with irritation after shaving. The pivoting head in combination with the comfort shield made for a nick-free shave even on my knees and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With cleaning, this disposable razor has lasted a month while still providing a clean shave. It&#x27;s definitely a higher end disposable razor. The cover for the razor head makes it easy to take this razor on the go.</li>
    <li> Yeah I know maybe I&#x27;m not the most coordinated person in the world but I managed to cut myself seriously with this razor. SHARP BLADES!!!!!  Feels good in the hand, easy to hold onto even in the slippery shower. Great shave, extremely close, and no razor burn/irritation.</li>
    <li> I used to use disposable razors all the time, and would always nick or scrape myself.  Then my husband gave me the greatest tip of all:  use a regular MAN&#x27;S razor.  I bought [[ASIN:B0039LMTHE Gillette Mach3 Base Cartridges 15 Count]] and can honestly say I have never cut myself in 20 years of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the above in mind, it was with great trepidation that I tried these disposable razors.  To my surprise, the razor glided smoothly over my skin, gave a close shave, and best of all, no nicks or irritation.  I really like them!</li>
    <li> I loved this product. Nice color and the handle is comfortable. The most important part. It provided a nice smooth leg shave with no remaining cuts or nasty razor bumps. Awesome product for a great price!</li>
    <li> just got my BIC Soleil Glow bzzagent package, with 3 BIC Soleil Glow razors and a whole stack of coupons for me to share with friends, and after finally getting to use them, I have to say I think these are the best razors out of the BIC Soleil line. They kept the comfort grip, making them easy to hold and transfer from hand to hand under running water, which decreases the chance you&#x27;ll cut yourself. They have a comfort shield around the blades to ensure smoother skin as you shave, and my previous experience with this brand tells me that these blades will stay sharp for a while! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these. I got to test these for FREE thanks to bzzagent and BIC!</li>
    <li> These are some pretty solid razors! Although, admittedly, there is one fault in the design. This product does as a razor should and makes your legs super smooth! While using this razor with a shaving cream/lotion, it works perfectly! The razor glides right across the skin and leaves your legs flawless! The fact that this razor has three blades really helps you to get a close shave. I’ve actually been purchasing male razors recently since some female razors have not been doing that great, but this product put some faith back into female razors for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comfort shield is where this razor ever so slightly falters. Unfortunately, if you do not use a shaving cream/lotion with this product, I have found that the razor doesn’t exactly glide easily. Even with just water, the comfort shield keeps the razor from gliding easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while this means I won’t be able to simply use this in the shower for a quick touch up without shaving cream, this by no means makes the razor unusable! This is a very solid razor and I don’t mind spending the extra few seconds to slather on some shaving cream! I’d definitely recommend giving this product a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got this item for free as a promotion for the product. Even though I got this for free, my review is honest and unbiased</li>
    <li> I think the Bic Soleil Glow razors are great! My skin is easily irritated after shaving but the Box Soleil Glow razors left my skin feeling smooth and soft. The razor glided over my skin and I didn&#x27;t worry about potential razor burn.  The flexible blades are a great feature as well as the pivoting head, it really assists in getting the closet shave. I love the fact that the Box Soleil Glow Razors also have the vitamin E and aloe lubricating strips, leaving my legs feeling baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;**I was able to try the BIC Soleil Glow Razors for free thanks to BIC!</li>
    <li> I have tried BIC razors in the past and have always ended up with a good amount of razor burn and several nicks. I was given a pack of the new and improved Soliel razors and I must say I was pleasantly impressed. After using the 3 blade razor my skin was really smooth and bump free! I was also impressed with the amount of time the blades stayed sharp, at least 3 uses! I would absolutely reccomended these razors to friends and family. As a faithful Venus user I must say the new Soliel razor has a great price point and I&#x27;m glad I have BIC another chance.</li>
    <li> I get to share my experience with you today, thanks to BIC. They sent me a pack of razors for free to try.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t use the 2.00$ bag that has 10 razors in it with just one blade. My legs will burn and have razor burn and I&#x27;ll be miserable. I usually buy razors with 5 blades and spend a little more for the comfort. I&#x27;ll say I was a bit skeptical when I heard this has 3 blades.  When I took my shower this morning I could feel the blades, and was afraid in the end I would be miserable. When I stepped out and lotioned up as usual, my legs were silky smooth and there was no razor burn. Considering when shaving it felt like my legs were being &amp;#34;torn&amp;#34; by the razor blades and the results I did get, I&#x27;m happy to say I will reuse and repurchase.</li>
    <li> The Bic Soleil Glow Razors are nice and sharp but not too sharp that it will cut you. I love that these razors provide me with a close shave without irritating me skin or leaving any bumps on my skin. The nice and smooth blades give you a perfect shave that lasts much longer that many of my other razors. Great razors that are easy to handle in the shower and great because you will not have to shave every single day and that not only saves time but will save you money as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razors that are perfect because it will save you time and money.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BIC,  I received a free sample of the Soleil Glow Disposable razors to test out. I have to say, I was very impressed. The handle fit nicely in my hand and was easy to hold on to unlike my previous razor. The shave is  also very nice! At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t doing a great job because it just felt like I was running a blade free razor over my legs, but I was wrong! My legs feel silky smooth! They have my business now!!</li>
    <li> I receive Bic Glow to probe them. I was suprised. This razors are so good, the skin is so smoth and really glow. Buy them</li>
    <li> I recently received BIC Soleil Glow Razors free through a BzzAgent Campaign. #gotitfree I have always been a fan of BIC when it comes to pens and even lighters for emergency usage so of course I expected these razors to be wonderful as well. Not only did they give me the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve felt in a long time, but they exceeded my expectations by a long shot! Thanks BIC for partnering up with BzzAgent so I could gain this wonderful experience! :) Soleil Glow is the razor Gotham deserves.</li>
    <li> I received a 3pack from Bzz Agent for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a 5 blade so this is somewhat down grading but I love Bic Soleil Razors so I had no complaints about this one either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades get a close clean shave leaving no stubble behind and my legs feeling silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I love the rubbery grip on them so no slipping while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices are great to, they last alot longer than normal disposables so you wont have to buy as frequently.</li>
    <li> These razors work well. They are comfortable to hold &amp; get a nice close shave. Nothing different or special from most razors I have tried. They do the job &amp; that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> These provide a thorough, close, and gentle shave.  In hot weather, I shave a lot more frequently, and these have become my preferred  razors.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my free sample of BIC Soleil Glow razors from bzzagent.  I will say that the blades on these razors are very sharp.  I ended up nicking myself bad shaving but I will continue using this amazing razor.  I stopped using razors all together but after using Bic Soleil Glow razors, I will start again.  This razor does a great job of removing annoying hair without leaving stubble behind. I love that it has three blades, which allows me to shave quicker and get the hair that is sometimes left behind.  Thanks to this wonderful razor, my legs feel incredibly smooth without any stubble bumps and without any razor bumps or rashes.  I used this razor this morning after I decided to wear a dress at the last minute and it took me less time than before to have smooth legs to show while wearing my dress.</li>
    <li> The Bic Soleil Glow glided along my legs nice and smooth. It even shaved very nicely around my knee which is usually a problem for other razors. I didn&#x27;t experience any knicks when using the razor either which is pretty typical when using my usual brand Gillette Venus. The only con was that it took me a minute fumbling around with soapy hands to figure out the blade guard slides off not pops off.</li>
    <li> I have really been ejoying using this razor, and that&#x27;s saying something. I am the kind of person who keeps a disposable razor forever, and this one still works well after about a month of use, still gliding over my skin nicely and shaving well. It has not irritated my skin at all! The moisturizing strip has also not gotten weird like some tend to after a while. No nicks, either! I would not hesitate to buy these again.</li>
    <li> While the Bic Soleil Glow Razors are a fun and vibrant color, I was rather disappointed in the performance of this razor.  The plastic head surrounding the blades seemed to take away from a close shaving experience and while the plastic was smooth, did not seem to cut very close.  My daughter also tried these and disliked them greatly.  While these razors did not leave behind any cuts or nicks, the resulting shave just did not seem as smooth as other razors.  I did like the design of the handle and the easy grip of it, however the performance and design of the blades and heads just did not appeal to me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and found that even with my usual shaving lotion, I got a ton of nicks and way too much irritation.  I couldn&#x27;t wear shorts after using these.  :(</li>
    <li> I ordered these razors for my spouse through Amazon&#x27;s Vine program, and here&#x27;s what she had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Whether you use soap, shaving cream or nothing (I tried all three), I couldn&#x27;t feel the blade and I got a very smooth shave. It&#x27;s easy to handle, it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair, I&#x27;ve been using the same razor every day for 30 days and I haven&#x27;t had to switch to another razor yet. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like? It&#x27;s a little on the bulky side, I&#x27;m used to using the [[ASIN:B00289BSRK Bic Soleil Shimmer Razors]] which have a slighty slimmer design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. The first time I used the razor, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working until after I stepped out of the shower - a definite plus!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there you have it. Tested and approved!</li>
    <li> These razors are everything they are so smooth and flexible!!</li>
    <li> I have tried the BIC Soleil Glow razors for free thanks to BIC because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent. The first time I tried them I was pleasantly surprised as to how fast I finished shaving. The comfort shield on the razor protected my legs from being cut up and irritated, which usually happens with disposable razors, but not BIC Soleil Glow razors. The razors were very sharp which helped get the closest shave ever, a day later I still have no hair growing back! The lubriacted strip added to the silky smooth shave. Also this disposable razor actually has a pivoting head which contours to your legs as you shave, creating the closest possible shave. If you are in the market to try a new disposable razor I would go with the BIC Soleil Glow, it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I love these razors. You can feel how smooth the blades are on your skin while you are shaving. You also don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot to get the hair off your legs, which I hate doing! One swipe of the razor and the hair is off! My legs are so smooth and I have no shaving nicks which I usually do after shaving. The colors are so cute as well! I was able to try these razors for free thanks to BIC and I say to definitely give them a try!</li>
    <li> I really love these razors. I love the fact that I dont need shaving cream! Time saver! It has a nice grip on the handle. And they have a bunch of pretty colors vto choose from. With definitely be buying again! Also got to try the product for FREE thanks to bic and #bzzagent And its a great deal! Can&#x27;t go wrong! :)</li>
    <li> I got to test these razors for free thanks to Bic! They are amazing! The comfort guard kept my skin from getting dried out and irritated, while the multiple blades left no hair behind. These razors are amazing! I will definitely be buying them again!</li>
    <li> I think these are great disposable razors! I don&#x27;t typically use disposable razors but thanks to Bzzagent and BIC I got to try them out for free!  I was not disappointed at all and really like the comfort shield! No redness or nicks here! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally not someone who gets nicks, and the Bic Soleil Glow razor was no exception ... It&#x27;s a really nice razor and the lubricating strip is nice and doesn&#x27;t get slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this razor is that it&#x27;s sturdy and the top doesn&#x27;t pop off the way it does with some other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s got everything going for it as a great razor, and there&#x27;s no area that stands out as needing to be improved.</li>
    <li> This is a fair razor, but really pretty mediocre. The head is bulky and does not give a very smooth shave. For the price, there are far better options out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same razors for years and years, but I think I am ready to officially switch to BIC Soleil Glow razors. I was lucky enough to try these razors for free courtesy of BIC. Using the razor was effortless and glided so easily as I shaved. There was not one cut or bit of irritation even after a handful of uses. My legs never felt so smooth! Even shaving my knees was easy and we all know how tricky that can be. I am so excited to have found such a great razor!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Absolutely! I just got it, but have used it many times and love the close shave every time. The rubber grip handle helps me focus on where to shave, and not worrying about it falling out of my hand. The pivoting head gets those tough areas, around your knees, so it really helps! Your legs will stay smooth for at least 3-4 days before any stubble comes back in! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product to review as part of a promotion to the brand</li>
    <li> I Like this product, I would love it but my normal blade is a 5 blade this is a 3 blade... so its somewhat of a down grade. I really like these because they offer a quick and close shave, they fit nicely in your hard, smooth, and a great price for a disposable razor, these would be great to take on vacation or a trip and need a toss me. It has a lot of protection so it offers no razor burn, great in my book!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing! I can use them for quite awhile with them still being sharp! I received a pack complementary from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! Perfect for me and my daughter to use.... shes just starting to shave. Big safety area and it didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving! I had to keep checking lol I tried the product for free thanks to BIC!!&lt;br /&gt;Super sharp blades!</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing and gave me the most smooth shave that I have had in a long time!! I recommend them 100x!!! I got them as a part of a promotion from BZZagent, and I am definitely going to be a regular buyer of them!</li>
    <li> I received these razors from BzzAgent to try out and review. First of all, I really like the pretty colors of the handles. It gives them a little something extra. The design of the handle is nice because it has a nice grip to it. I find that the extra bulk of the head is a little unnecessary. I don&#x27;t think it really makes a difference. I also wish that it had five blades instead of 3. I don&#x27;t think these are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used but they are still pretty good and would probably repurchase them because they are a good price and give a nice shave.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect razor for us women.. the moisture strip is fabulous and helps leave ur skin smooth after shaving. It glides so easily and pivots to the shape of the area ur shaving. If u want a really close shave without those $12 + prices go with Bic soleil Glow.. I was able to try these for free thanks to BIC from bzzagent..</li>
    <li> The BIC Soleil Glow disposable razors are THE razors to get if you want smooth beautiful legs! I use them on my legs and underarms and they definitely do the job! They come in the cutest of colors!  I like the shape of the razor. It allows you to get a good grip. No more slips and cuts!! The moisture strip definitely helps keep my legs moisturized and avoid razor burn! My legs are pretty sensitive and always prove to razor burn but not with this razor! When shaving the razor glides smoothly and cuts hair with ease. There is no tugging or pulling. You get a great close shave! I honestly like the razor a lot more than the one I am currently using. I typically use a men&#x27;s razor because I feel so much stubble after using a women&#x27;s razor. However BIC has changed my mind. I highly recommend the razor to anyone! I&#x27;m definitely running to the store to get more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to BIC, I was able to try out their Soleil Glow disposable razors for testing purposes! However, my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the Bic Soleil Twilight razors so when given the opportunity to try the Bic Soleil Glow razors I had high expectations, needless to say I was not let down. At first I was skeptical about the large size of the razors head however the Comfort Shield combined with the pivoting head really does help it to glide effortlessly over all areas of the skin as advertised (really great for those of us that are a little too heavy handed when pressing down!) so no more nicks or irritation and the 3 blades ensure a super smooth shave with every stroke. I&#x27;ve used one razor several times now and it&#x27;s still going strong so that&#x27;s good news for all my fellow frugal gals and guys out there (yeah we know you &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; our razors when we ain&#x27;t lookin 😉). So give the Bic Soleil Glow a try I know you&#x27;ll love &#x27;em too! #BicSoleilGlow #GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> Terrible!!  I have never had razors do so much damage.  I get cut every time I use the damned things.  The plastic around the blades does not allow for a close shave, it doesn&#x27;t glide over my skin at all and I end up bleeding at the end.  I&#x27;d rather use a dull razor than this thing.</li>
    <li> Just tried these razors out, I usually purchase Bic brand for my arms and Schick intuition aloe refills for my legs since I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep my routine! These razors definitely give a close shave and give you a smooth feeling, at least on my under arms. My legs felt a tad irritated and had small spots of razor burn coming out of the shower. But like I said, I have sensitive legs.</li>
    <li> Got it free thanks to BzzAgent!!! This is an awesome product it&#x27;s pivoting head gives you a close shave with little or new effort I love the fact that I got no razor bumps &amp; how it left my legs feeling soft &amp; moisturized plus for My Husband too 😉😉😉</li>
    <li> Was so excited when I got this for free from BzzAgent. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand I now love; These BIC Soleil Glow razors. They glide along smooth and clean. No razor burns and no cuts. Also love how smooth it is for my armpits. Other razors I&#x27;ve tried seems to always give me razor burn and leaves me hurting for hours. These are wonderful. Now I gotta wear shorts today. loving the feel of my legs.</li>
    <li> I love these #BicSoleilGlowRazors. As soon as I got my package I ran upstairs and tried em out, I am most satisfied. Silky smooth touchable legs,, needless to say my husband is satisfied too.lol. no razor burn and no prickly legs the next day. #bzzagent @bzzagent #BIC #soleil @BICSoleil NOT to mention I got $3 coupons to pass the word around to friends and families! #winning</li>
    <li> I love BIC soleil Glow razors! I got the opportunity to try them for free from Bzzagent!! They make my legs so soft and smooth.  Most comfortable shave ive ever had!!! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Thanks to BIC, I was offered the opportunity to try this razor out for free. I was nervous about trying it because it looks like your typical disposable razor but with a cute pastel (pink, purple and green) color. I have sensitive skin and was worried that it would aggravate it. Well ... I LOVED IT! I thought that the shave was effortless and clean, no skin irritation and left my legs feeling smooth for almost 4 days! The only difficulty I had was with the razor handle/grip because it did get slippery when using in the shower.</li>
    <li> Bic sent me these razors to try and they are great! I have been using Bic Soleil razors regularly for years, and among all the different styles - Original, Twilight, Bella - the Glow razors are the best. The larger head provides more even coverage and the comfort shield leaves my skin so soft - I can even use them without shaving gel. The flexible head also curves around my knees better than any other razor I have tried.</li>
    <li> This razor is a three blade razor with flexible blades, lubricating strips, pivoting head, easy rubber grip and by far my favorite the comfort shield so I can get a close shave without nicking or cutting myself. The BIC Soleil Glow razors really exceeded my expectations with the three blades it gave me a baby smooth finish which is what I look for in a shaving product and it removed all of the hair with the first swipe I didn&#x27;t have to keep repeating to get the results I wanted. I would definitely recommend this product!! Thanks to BIC for allowing me to be apart of their promotion and try their product.</li>
    <li> Just tried BIC Soleil Glow Razors and I am amazed. It works really well and even though it only has 2 blades it is really smooth and goes a great job. I highly recommend. Got a free trial of it</li>
    <li> I received a 3 pack of the Bic Soleil Glow razors  for free from Bic to test! I typically would just buy the cheapest razors I could find. However, after trying the Glow razors I&#x27;ll never go back! These left my legs so silky and with no stubble! Ladies, just because summer is almost over doesn&#x27;t mean you have to neglect your legs! Try these!! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I love these razors! They are very ergonomic and comfortable to shave with. These razors give me just a good of shave as my 5 blade razor does. I did get this product free thanks to BIC. Thank you BIC! Your razors rock!</li>
    <li> I got a free pack of these from BzzAgent/BIC and they are awesome! My legs are super smooth and I have yet to cut myself with them! I would definitely recommend trying these! So much better than the other disposable brands out there!</li>
    <li> Got these razors for free fr review. Even if I didn&#x27;t get them for free and bought them myself I&#x27;d still write this review. These razors are the best. So sharp, smooth shaving, keeps your skin smoother longer. Ps. The colors are too cute, love pastel colors</li>
    <li> Just received my BIC Soleil Glow disposable razors today from bzzagent and I am in love with this razor. I didn&#x27;t even need shave cream or body wash! No razor burn! The closeness of the shave was very satisfying and left my legs feeling nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was given the amazing opportunity to try these razors for free through BzzAgent. I am extremely impressed with the look, quality and usability of these razors considering they are by BIC. Most other BIC razors leave my legs with several nicks and cuts and these did not. My legs felt great afterwards.</li>
    <li> It comes with 3 razors. And it only has 3 blades on each shaver. The first thing I noticed about the shaver is the big razor head (Comfort Shield) it had. I&#x27;ve never seen a razor like that. The Comfort Shield did help with getting a nice shave without getting any cuts. I love how the razor has a lubricating strip for a smooth shaving experience. Another major plus is the rubber grips on the handle of the razor. I feel like I have total control of my razor and I have no fear of my razor falling out of my hand while shaving. I love how the razor comes with a clear case to cover the razor head, hat is a major plus for sanitary and safety purposes. The price is great! The only con I have about the razor is that it only has 3 razor blades. Since it only had 3 blades, I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave. I feel like four hours later I need to shave again.</li>
    <li> An improved version of the three blade razor with an altered design that tends to decrease the tendency to nick oneself. A good have but the blades get blunt pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed by these razors. I wanted to get a nice clean shave, but I didn&#x27;t get one with these razors. The guide on the bottom that is supposed to make the razor flow smoothly over your skin did nothing more than stop me from getting a good shave. I think this would be a great set for a young shaver, but for someone who is experienced with razors you may want to skip these.</li>
    <li> In love. Not only is it smooth shaving but also leaves your legs silky smooth. I will definitely be buying.more in my future. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received a 3 pack of Bic Soleil Razors for free to try from Bic and Buzzagent.com. I love how colorful they are as well as the rubber grip handles. I feel like I would have control over the razor and they wouldn&#x27;t  be slippery in the shower. I was on the fence regarding  the 3 flexible blades, as I usually use razors with more. I found that after continued use I really am starting to like the  Bic Soleil Razors. My legs and under arm area seem to be less irritated and smoother. I also seem to have to shave less, which is a bonus. I will continue to use the Bic Soleil razors and I am sure I will have great results.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free through BzzAgent and BIC (Thanks!) I have to say the &amp;#34;comfort shield&amp;#34; did make the blades glide ever so smooth over the skin on my legs and get a nice close shave. Works well with a little shave cream but not so well with just water (the plastic kind of grips). It took many swipes to get all the stubble in my underarms which is mostly why I only gave it 3 stars. It&#x27;s wide so accuracy is a little more difficult. I think the &amp;#34;comfort shield&amp;#34; is a bit unnecessary, but if you worry about cuts and nics this could be the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I usually stick to one brand or razors but when I was given a chance to try this product for free I was very excited. When I shaved with my old razors I always ended up cutting my self around my knees and ankles. I had no nicks using this BIC razor!! The shave is very close and it glides across your skin. It does not feel like you are using a razor. I am so happy I got to try this product.</li>
    <li> These BIC razors are the best thing ever! I tend to hate shaving but no longer do! The triple blade makes it seem like you&#x27;re not even shaving. Would def recommend this  product to everyone. Thank You BIC for providing me a free sample of this!</li>
    <li> One of the best razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best razors out there. It was easy to use, smooth, didn&#x27;t cut or leave shave bumps. It was a close shave without cutting the skin. By far this is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used in a long time. It came in several different colors all pretty colors. Nice grip with the handle. A+ for this razors. I got a free package of these through BzzAgent thanks to Bic I got to try it for free and I loved it!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these BIC Soleil Glow razors thanks to BuzzAgent. They are very good for a close smooth shave. The comfortshield makes it nearly impossible to cut yourself while using these razors, making them perfect for beginners or those prone to cutting themselves while shaving. Unfortunatly, it also makes it a little dificult to navigate &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; spaces that require more flexibility.</li>
    <li> Hello I&#x27;m a bzzagent ware I get to try out products and do reviews today I would like to talk to you about bic razor I absolutely love it bic soleil glow they have  a great comfort shield that keeps your skin really nice and also keeps your skin really nice and also keeps your skin silky as it glides over your skin this great razor has three blades for it can cut your hair short and glades over your betuful curves and of course the razor has a nice lubricant strip for smooth soft skin with a pivoting head and a nice rubber grip that doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand give it a go you will not be disappointed these razors gave me great silky skin thanks to the blades this razor had a really clean cut and the comfort shield safe my skin from hurting or from the razor cutting me thanks for letting me try it out for free bic</li>
    <li> I got a sample of these through Bzzagent which thanks to BIC I was able to recieve. At first I liked this razor nice smooth glide on the legs. It has a nice handle and a good grip. The way the blade is protected is great if you have little kids around. However the downfall is the cover around the blade for the smooth glide sometimes gets in the way when trying to shave rounder areas. Yes ladies I am talking about down below and your armpit. the blade is set back a little to were you would have to push a little harder than normal in order to get a close shave. I would recommend for your legs! Overall I thought the razor was nice!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product.  Normally, with our hard water and my cheap shaving cream, razors leave a lot to be desired.  The Soleil Glow left my legs soft and nick free which normally doesn&#x27;t happen with new razors.  The comfort shield worked wonders on my sensitive skin.  Without bzzagent, I wouldn&#x27;t have had the chance to try before I buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky about razors. Almost everything I try leaves me with small nicks and cuts, but these are just right. I use the same one for around two weeks without having to replace. Will definitely be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I would give the actual product a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product as shipped and communication from the vendor get a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I was supposed to review was a 72 pack of Bic Soleil razors. I received just 1 three pack. So I can&#x27;t comment on the packaging, how much storage space this will take, variety, etc. When I contacted Amazon to question the product, they said they couldn&#x27;t get a response from the vendor who shipped it. This would cause me to think twice about ordering the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor, it gives the smoothest shave EVER. I didn&#x27;t expect I would like the razor as well as the 5 blade razor I have been using -wrong. I prefer the Bic Soleil and will purchase more in the future. No drag, no stubble, no burn...just a smooth gliding razor that leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It can be very hard to find a razor that works well, yet is also easy on the skin. This one is great. It feels smooth on my skin and it definitely does the trick!</li>
    <li> I had great results from this razor. I got a sample in the mail from BzzAgent!!! No nicks or cuts, just smooth, clean, hairfree legs  :)</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing. So gentle the razor just glides on your skin and leaves your legs silky smooth. I had absolutely no skin irritation which is awesome because it&#x27;s hard to find a good razor that doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin. Thanks for letting me try them forf free bzzagent and Bic.</li>
    <li> I love, I used others but since I use them my skin remains moisturized and without allergies to the blades.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! It glides easily along the skin and is easily gripped in the water due to the rubber grip on top. The Bic Soleil Glow disposable razor gave me the closest, best shave I&#x27;ve had in a while! It didn&#x27;t leave any bumps or razor burn. I highly recommend this to any woman who loves a close shave, I got to experience this first hand as a free trial from Bzzagent.clm and curtosey of Bic!</li>
    <li> I love these razors! The grip is great, there&#x27;s rubber on the top where you&#x27;re finger goes, and rubber on the bottom as well so it doesn&#x27;t slip. It&#x27;s also comfortable in your hand. The triple blades provides a smooth shave, and I love that the cap slides on and off from the side and clicks into place so it won&#x27;t come off if you throw it in a bag and cut yourself. Definitely recommend!!! I got these for free from Bic! #GotItFree #SoleilGlow</li>
    <li> I love these razors! I got them as a mission on BzzAgent.com and these razors are hands down the best I have ever used! They glide smoothly and take away all of that pesky leg hair etc., etc. I highly recommend these razors. They are awesome!! -Megan</li>
    <li> I used these razors for the first time today and it didn&#x27;t even feel like you were shaving. My legs are super soft and NO razor burn!! I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> I received samples of BIC® Soleil® Glow® razors to try and they were great! The comfortable handle made handling easy. The blades slid over my skin perfectly. No nicks, no irritation. It&#x27;s been 3 days and my legs are still smooth.</li>
    <li> Love these razors silky smooth shave! I received these as a promotion and i Ann definitely going to keep using them.</li>
    <li> I received these from BzzAgent and absolutely love them!! They have an easy grip and don&#x27;t slip out of your hands!</li>
    <li> This razors have a VERY sharp blade and have left my legs hairless. I didnt miss a spot! I am delighted to be trying this product for free thanks to Bic. Afer hopping out of the bath while useing thees I was suprised to see the results. My legs were silky smooth and I could not stop rubbing them. I definitely recomend this product to anyone who wants extremely soft skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> seldomly do I get to jump out of the shower with perfect silky smooth legs until I tried the bic soleil glow razors. Unlike others it has a support sheild that help the razor glide across your legs and it leaves almost like a gel behind to keep your skin hydrated. I was a little skeptical at first since I always break out in razor burn when I shave with diffrent razors but not with this one! Im so glad i got to try it for free from #bzzagent because from now on these will definitely be on my shopping list!</li>
    <li> BIC Soleil Glow Disposable Razor&lt;br /&gt;This is my fav go to razor to have on hand. It glides so easily and never any little nicks or anything when using it and so sharp no little stuble issue&lt;br /&gt;It  has a nice handle that is easy to hold. The little protective cover is better than on others I have used that just pop off this one seems more to slide on and off almost locking in place and since I have little kids around I need the cover to stay on even though I keep this out of reach they are always keeping us on our toes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors then it is super easy for my dh to know they are mine and we will not have issues getting any mixed up when I leave them in his bathroom lol.</li>
