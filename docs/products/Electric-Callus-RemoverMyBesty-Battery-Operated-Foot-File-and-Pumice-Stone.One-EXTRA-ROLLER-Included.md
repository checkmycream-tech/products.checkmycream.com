      <li>Feet so smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>Thanks God, now his feet are callus less and he walks fine and can’t say enough how great is this product.</li>
      <li>First time using it</li>
      <li>I had to purchase the second one, because my sister fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Really smoothed my feet out without having to do any work.</li>
      <li>I really like this callus remover</li>
      <li>We really like this callus remover.</li>
      <li>I definitely think it works better when your feet are soft but in either case it defintiely works.</li>
      <li>They are so soft and smooth and it really gets the skin feeling like it is baby soft.  </li>
      <li>It removes foot callus quickly and leaves soft and smooth skin as expected.</li>
      <li>It took me just minutes to make my feet pretty and soft again.</li>
      <li>and I mainly bought it for him, now his feet are smother than mine.</li>

      <li>Not powerful enough, just good for buffing feet after roughness is removed by a different method</li>

<li> WHY THE HECK DID I WAIT SO LONG??</li>
<li> No big deal, but not a good sign of build quality, but so far its held up well enough.</li>
<li> I used both dry and after a bath.</li>
<li> My feet get really dry in the winter, no matter what I do it seems like too.</li>
<li> The first one I received did not work and I was pretty disappointed.  </li>
<li> My hubby has very dry feet</li>
<li> I have tried so many products in the past including dangerous scraper blades and scrubs and multiple lotions and nothing</li>
<li> After that, a little lotion and your feet are prim and proper for sandals and flip flops again.  </li>
<li> At 71, sometimes she has a harder time maintaining her grip than some people do.</li>
<li> I was tired of filing, and scraping, and having to have the pedicure when I really didn&#x27;t have time for the pedicure.  </li>
<li> , I would recommend following up with a pedicure cream or any heavy lotion or cream.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to other buyers.</li>
<li> but I still need a little extra help in the winter and this little battery operated wonder helps me out a lot.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews of other similar products that say that it doesn&#x27;t work well and that you can stop it if you press too hard.  </li>
<li> I know the roller is wearing down, and I will need them soon.</li>
<li> Just use a little lotion when you&#x27;re done and</li>
<li> Exercise a little patience and a take a few minutes for yourself</li>
<li> So I work on my feet all day everyday and calluses are an everyday problem for me.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t press so hard.  </li>
<li> She always complains that her feet are dry, cracked, and just plain ugly.</li>

    <li> We really like this callus remover. It does really good job. It removes foot callus quickly and leaves soft and smooth skin as expected. This device can tackle some really thick and tough callus, my husband had those and hurt him a lot even just walking. Thanks God, now his feet are callus less and he walks fine and can’t say enough how great is this product. Very easy to use and safe using in the bathroom. We recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough, just good for buffing feet after roughness is removed by a different method</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:79e4d32112ccc2a5c66109acd87029cd]]</li>
    <li> Product is okay.  I find the need to use it repeatedly to get cracked skin on heels off.</li>
    <li> Really smoothed my feet out without having to do any work. I have a pumice stone, file, and even a grater, This plus the grater work the best!</li>
    <li> I loved this product. My hubby has very dry feet and I mainly bought it for him, now his feet are smother than mine. I had to purchase the second one, because my sister fell in love with it.

    <li> I really like this callus remover, it is gentle on my feet but yet is very effective in removing my rough calluses.  I have tried so many products in the past including dangerous scraper blades and scrubs and multiple lotions and nothing has worked as well as this callus remover.  This also includes an extra roller and a cleaning brush.  I also really like the fact that this callus remover can be used wet or dry.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Love thisproduct.  Feet so smooth and soft.  Priced much lower than identical products in local stores.  Quickly delivered.  Just find the email begging for a review a bit annoying.</li>
    <li> I live in FL and nice feet in sandals and flip flops are almost a \\&quot;must\\&quot; here.  I was tired of filing, and scraping, and having to have the pedicure when I really didn&#x27;t have time for the pedicure.  THIS has solved those problems.  First time using it I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference that it made on tough scaly heels and sides of feet.    I&#x27;ve seen other reviews of other similar products that say that it doesn&#x27;t work well and that you can stop it if you press too hard.  Don&#x27;t press so hard.  No need to, just lightly use the roller and watch the skin fly off.  AMAZING.  After that, a little lotion and your feet are prim and proper for sandals and flip flops again.  This one is cute, feels good in your hand and you can decallous from any direction because the buffer is open on both sides where some are not and you&#x27;d get in a twist trying to come in at a different angle.    If you&#x27;ve been thinking about getting a callous remover, like I had been, do it!  The only thing I have to say after having thought about it for so long and finally ordering is   WHY THE HECK DID I WAIT SO LONG??</li>
    <li> The MyBesty Electric callus remover is perfect for giving yourself an at home pedicure.  My mother in law took off with the last callus remover I had, but honestly, she needed us much more than I did, lol! This device is battery operated and works in both wet/dry situations so you can take it in the shower with you.  I have one of those volcano pumice stones and though it works well it takes so much effort and at the end of a long hard day the last thing I want to do is scrub on my feet.  This solves the problem and makes my feet look so much better.  They are so soft and smooth and it really gets the skin feeling like it is baby soft.  Just use a little lotion when you&#x27;re done and your feet will thank you for it.  I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review.</li>
    <li> So I work on my feet all day everyday and calluses are an everyday problem for me. I love this callus remover. Its got some power to it! It took me just minutes to make my feet pretty and soft again. I used both dry and after a bath. I definitely think it works better when your feet are soft but in either case it defintiely works. I like the little brush to clean it and that it came with an extra head. I did recieve this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed her are my own</li>
    <li> Does the job quickly and painlessly. What more can you ask for. Well. Maybe replacements, but I guess their are any. I know the roller is wearing down, and I will need them soon.</li>
    <li> Love this - bought one as a gift and all the girls love them! Easy to hols and dose a great job, use in the shower (before the water) or out side on the patio - takes off a lot of stuff!</li>
    <li> This does not have enough power to remove callused skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I used it on myself and my husband as soon as it arrived, and it worked perfectly. Best product I have come across to soften skin and keep my feet feeling and looking healthy.</li>
    <li> This MyBesty Callus Remover is great. My feet get really dry in the winter, no matter what I do it seems like too. I use lotion and oils sometimes with socks over the moisture treatment. I think it helps but I still need a little extra help in the winter and this little battery operated wonder helps me out a lot. My feet are nice and soft, and I don’t have to spend money going to a salon for a pedicure. I also love that I don’t have to do any manual labor to have soft feet! No scrubbing or pressure needed when using this compared to a pumice stone. That’s especially nice for me because I have some back/shoulder problems. I definitely recommend this callus remover.</li>
    <li> had to return it, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I love this callus remover and find it easy to use when my heals and toes begin to get a little rough around the edges.  Keeps my feet smooth between pedicures.  It comes with an extra file roller. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Electric Callus Remover by MyBesty for my mother-in-law. She always complains that her feet are dry, cracked, and just plain ugly. The packaged arrived very quickly and everything was well packed. She loves the bright pink color, and how easy it is to use. At 71, sometimes she has a harder time maintaining her grip than some people do. She was able to use this on both of her feet, and they look and feel great. My father-in-law  was so impressed, he used it on the calluses on his feet.Now, they both have feet that look and feel great. Definitely a happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> When it comes to removing calluses, although foot files work very well, I end up with a sore arm from having to file for so long. Kemei&#x27;s KM-2500 Callus Remover is the perfect solution! It works like a foot file, but it does all the work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kemei Callus Remover is very easy to use. You press the button to the on position and place it on your callus. In seconds it smoothes the callus. I would recommend the Kemei Callus Remover to anyone looking for an effective callus remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would recommend following up with a pedicure cream or any heavy lotion or cream. Your feet will look amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I received this as a birthday gift and I couldn&#x27;t beany happier. Being a stay at home mom and needing to make a trip to the spa is no need anymore! I can have the same beautiful look and feel at the convenience of being home . Last minute night out? This is the perfect tool to achieve that beautiful spa look in such a short amount of time and works great!</li>
    <li> The first one I received did not work and I was pretty disappointed.  The seller was extremely helpful and refunded my money as well as immediately sending me a replacement free of charge.  I was skeptical but have found it to be an effective tool to smooth out calluses and such on my feet.  Exercise a little patience and a take a few minutes for yourself when you can, and roll away!  (Be careful not to apply too much pressure, it will temporarily stop - a gentle pressure is all you need) I massage some foot cream or coconut oil into my feet afterwards and after three &amp;#34;sessions&amp;#34; my feet are looking pretty darn good!</li>
    <li> Great little machine! I use on my feet once a week after my shower, follow with a little lotion and they seem to be staying pretty smooth all week. I would recommend this to other buyers. The product was packaged nicely and the service was fast.</li>
