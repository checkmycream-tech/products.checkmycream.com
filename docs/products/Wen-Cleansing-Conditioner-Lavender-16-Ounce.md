      <li>I love my hair since I started using the Wen conditioning shampoo.</li>

      <li>pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>love wen shampoo conditioner..</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>so most days I don&#x27;t bother with all that and just put it</li>
      <li>This is okay</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is much more manageable.</li>
      <li>I love WEN cleansing conditioner, but this variety did not work well for my hair.</li>
      <li>Now, it&#x27;s just healthy feeling.  </li>
      <li>I will order more for my course hair.</li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this shiny and healthy in years.  </li>
      <li>I still love WEN just prefer another formula.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using the WEN Tea Tree variety now, and it works much better for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I began using this product after noticing a beautiful shine in my daughter&#x27;s naturally wavy hair, and asked her its source.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d seen on the infomercial that it&#x27;s best for fine hair, and I know using lavender essential oil in my bathwater does ease the redness a bit.</li>
      <li>More importantly, I had significantly less flaking, maybe on part with the best medicated shampoos I&#x27;d ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More importantly, I had significantly less flaking, maybe on part with the best medicated shampoos I&#x27;d ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lavendar is true lavendar which aI love.  </li>
      <li>It was recommended by my hairdresser and she always points out to clients the fabulous condition of my hair.  </li>
      <li>just didn&#x27;t get it clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First day: my hair looked fluffier than ever, which I liked, and yet it still felt very soft.</li>
      <li>I prefer tea tree and sweet almond mint.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Second day: I probably could&#x27;ve skipped a wash on the second day because my hair looked good and not at all greasy (WEN does say you may not need to cleanse as often)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for blondes with delicate hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried quite a lot of product and this works best for my fine, thin, curly hair.</li>
      <li>Nor have I ever experienced the scalp &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; that other reviewers both admire and complain about.  </li>
      <li>and my roots get oily quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what my hair needs!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a blond with fine hair and it never had much body that changed when I started using Wen.</li>
      <li>lavender, for fine hair, has added volume at the same time it&#x27;s given my hair more moisture and shine.  </li>
      <li>That is absolutely amazing to me, and it would be enough for me to keep using WEN.</li>
      <li>That is absolutely amazing to me, and it would be enough for me to keep using WEN.</li>
      <li>It helps to retain the colors far more than over-the-counter shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite scent by WEN.  </li>
      <li>WEN products are worth gold to me&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve never left a review on amazon, but this one is worth spreading the good news.&lt;br /&gt;all round lovely product.</li>
      <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the reviews about Wen conditioning cleanser were spread pretty far apart: people either loved, loved, loved it, or absolutely hated it and warned others to stay away.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very satisfied: this product gives my hair more shine--something I&#x27;ve never found in than any other commercial shampoo that claims to provide shine.</li>
      <li>leaves hair soft and smooth</li>
      <li>It is the first time I have used it and it does just what the commercials say--good for my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d used as directed and my hair did nothing more than feel gross and smell like a peppermint patty.  </li>
      <li>I finally took the plunge and am so pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad to finally try kit.  </li>
      <li>I really love WEN products and plan on using them for a long time.</li>
      <li>As someone with short, fine hair and scalp psoriasis, I was certain this just wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
      <li>But neither did anything else: dandruff shampoo, tea tree shampoos and conditioner (even Paul Mitchell&#x27;s), salicylic acid shampoos, even coal tar shampoos did absolutely NOTHING to stop my scalp psoriasis.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel so much cleaner.</li>
      <li>I really did NOT for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Wen shampoo.</li>
      <li>I feel like it&#x27;s really making my scalp healhier-</li>
      <li>I do not think this is real Wen</li>
      <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>Still, since none of the other shampoos did much better (even those supposedly designed to stop psoriasis flakes)</li>
      <li>It is the ONLY product I use to clean and condition my hair.  </li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t seen this kind of shine to it in ages, and it was still fluffy and soft.</li>
      <li>The Wen products are more expensive than shampoos but they do more for your hair.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t seen this kind of shine to it in ages, and it was still fluffy and soft.</li>
      <li>Plus, they&#x27;d cause my hair color to fade quickly and left my hair feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes the color last longer and protects the hair from more damaging chemicals in a regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>It is merely adequate for that, and as such is overpriced.</li>
      <li>I like everything about this product except its high price (and one instance of a non-functioning dispenser).  </li>
      <li>My hair is soft and silky and much easier to brush/comb since I started using Wen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about WEN and, of course, I&#x27;ve caught a few minutes of the infomercials on TV.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, Wen&#x27;s  doesn&#x27;t decrease volume as long as I follow the cleansing with my usual mousse before blo-drying.  </li>
      <li>It seems to make my baby-fine hair more manageable, yet still feeling slightly greasy!  </li>
      <li>I have fine, slightly wavy hair that is prone to oiliness and the Lavender WEN</li>
      <li>,it offers volume,body,bounce and manageability!Love it!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant because I never use anything called &amp;#34;Conditioner,&amp;#34; as after-shampoo conditioners weigh down my hair, making my very fine hair flat, while I want volume.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This one you must add a little water to your hair even if you apply this when hair is soaking wet!  I do not like the smell of this one because it smells like medicine and not a lavender scent at all!!</li>
    <li> Not much impressed with it either as a shampoo or leave in conditioner, so I only use it as a conditioning rinse.  It is merely adequate for that, and as such is overpriced.</li>
    <li> Weighs my hair down! Will not purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love this product, this is really really good.  I will order more for my course hair.</li>
    <li> sold on Wen.......3rd bottle.....this one is the best for fine hair......</li>
    <li> I have been unhappy with my hair for a few years now.  It shows the typical signs of aging, and then last year I bleached it a few times (a few times because I was trying to fix the mess I made of it the first, second, and third time) and really damaged it.  I always use a leave-in conditioner and aragon oil every time I wash my hair but the only way to get rid of the frizz is to add serum, blow it out and then flat iron.  I&#x27;m a stay-at-home mom so most days I don&#x27;t bother with all that and just put it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the reviews about Wen conditioning cleanser were spread pretty far apart: people either loved, loved, loved it, or absolutely hated it and warned others to stay away.  I decided to cross my fingers and give it a shot and I am very fortunately in the love, love, love it camp!  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this shiny and healthy in years.  I still use my usual leave-in conditioner and the aragon oil after I cleanse, and the frizz is all but completely gone.  I am always running my fingers through my hair and brushing it and admiring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender, for fine hair, has added volume at the same time it&#x27;s given my hair more moisture and shine.  I keep thinking to myself, \\&quot;how?  How did they do this?\\&quot;  I can hardly wait to see how fabulous my hair is going to look and feel when I get the remaining damaged parts cut off.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen cleansing conditioner for 3 years now.  It is expensive but well worth it, if you color your hair, or swim frequently.  It makes the color last longer and protects the hair from more damaging chemicals in a regular shampoo. I guess I can say, I have not washed my hair in 3 years, and it never has been more healthy!!</li>
    <li> I do not think this is real Wen the label and list of ingredients is different from authentic Wen it doesn&#x27;t lather as well and leaves a buildup on my hair don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like Wen before. It&#x27;s exactly what my hair needs!</li>
    <li> This is not for me. It left my hair greasy. I have thick wavy hair and if you are like me, this is a too heavy product for our hair type:-)</li>
    <li> I love WEN cleansing conditioner, but this variety did not work well for my hair. I have fine, slightly wavy hair that is prone to oiliness and the Lavender WEN just didn&#x27;t get it clean. I&#x27;m using the WEN Tea Tree variety now, and it works much better for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about WEN and, of course, I&#x27;ve caught a few minutes of the infomercials on TV. As someone with short, fine hair and scalp psoriasis, I was certain this just wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. But neither did anything else: dandruff shampoo, tea tree shampoos and conditioner (even Paul Mitchell&#x27;s), salicylic acid shampoos, even coal tar shampoos did absolutely NOTHING to stop my scalp psoriasis. Most of them smelled horribly, too. Plus, they&#x27;d cause my hair color to fade quickly and left my hair feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one night after a few glasses of wine (I really do need to make my Amazon password more difficult to remember for just such occasions), I took the plunge and ordered WEN in the lavender scent. I&#x27;d seen on the infomercial that it&#x27;s best for fine hair, and I know using lavender essential oil in my bathwater does ease the redness a bit. So I ordered a bottle and then promptly forgot about it. (I did mention the wine, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My box contained both the bottle of lavender WEN and a pump, which I seem to recall another reviewer saying they didn&#x27;t receive. There weren&#x27;t any instructions aside from those on the bottle, so I followed them. Since my hair is basically a pixie in the early stages of growing out, I went with half the recommended pumps and, as the bottle directed for the first use, I divided those pumps into two applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day: my hair looked fluffier than ever, which I liked, and yet it still felt very soft. That night, however, I had the worst psoriasis flaking I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I brushed my hand through my hair at one point and it looked like snowflakes were falling. Oh no! Still, since none of the other shampoos did much better (even those supposedly designed to stop psoriasis flakes) I figured I&#x27;d keep trying the WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second day: I probably could&#x27;ve skipped a wash on the second day because my hair looked good and not at all greasy (WEN does say you may not need to cleanse as often), I know with my psoriasis that daily cleansing is a must to get rid of flakes and keep scales from building up. So after the second use, my hair was gleaming. I hadn&#x27;t seen this kind of shine to it in ages, and it was still fluffy and soft. More importantly, I had significantly less flaking, maybe on part with the best medicated shampoos I&#x27;d ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third day (and every day for the past week): I&#x27;ve had next to no flaking, and no itching at all! That is absolutely amazing to me, and it would be enough for me to keep using WEN. But there&#x27;s also my hair: it&#x27;s soft, it&#x27;s manageable, and shiny. I don&#x27;t need my volumizing spray anymore: my hair has volume and body... and no flakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so very happy with this purchase and I plan to keep using WEN as long as it keeps my flakes at bay.as often), I know with my psoriasis that daily cleansing is a must to get rid of flakes and keep scales from building up.

    <li> I love this product. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I have tried quite a lot of product and this works best for my fine, thin, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my hair feel; smells yummy.  BUT I do not use suggested &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34;- simply could not afford it that way.  I feel like it&#x27;s really making my scalp healhier- scalp doesn&#x27;t itch; I really broke out with blemishes on my scalp the first few weeks of use- like it was do a deep cleaning and getting rid of build up.  Now, it&#x27;s just healthy feeling.  Looking forward to trying another fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I have mixed reactions to it.  It seems to make my baby-fine hair more manageable, yet still feeling slightly greasy!  I like using it occasionally rather than daily.  The packaging is terrible.  The pump never works, I guess because the product is so thick.</li>
    <li> I discovered that Wen shampoo has helped immensely with scalp itching .  I had a brow lift  10 years ago and my scalp has itched really bad.  The worst was at night .  If I shampoo my hair every 2-3 days I have a lot of relief.  I hope and pray this continues and soon all of it will go away,.  Thanks to Wen shampoo.</li>
    <li> Lavendar doesn&#x27;t smell anything close to that.  Avoid it.  Product still works, but don&#x27;t get it because you think lavendar is going to envelop your shower stall.</li>
    <li> The greatest shampoo I have ever owned in 58 summers on this planet. You put it on and let it soak in. The smell alone is relaxing. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the first time I have used it and it does just what the commercials say--good for my hair.</li>
    <li> WEN products are worth gold to me&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair; and it&#x27;s never been&lt;br /&gt;so silky. Try it; you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I luv all the Wen products that I have tried on my hair. My hair is thin without much body and if I wash my hair on Monday morning then I will usually have to wash it again by Tuesday night. I find that my hair seems to be getting stronger with use of the Wen products and I like the fact that I am not using the detergents in regular shampoo which have stripped the essential oils from my hair. My hair is soft and silky and much easier to brush/comb since I started using Wen. I think you should really consider using the Wen six thirteen along with the other Wen products you choose.  Just follow the directions on the bottle and you will be very pleased with the results. The Wen products are more expensive than shampoos but they do more for your hair. I suggest you try the Wen products for a solid month before you decide how well it works for you. Using Wen once will not be enough to see the results. It takes a few weeks to see the difference.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try the Wen products for years but I didn&#x27;t feel I could justify the cost in my budget. I finally took the plunge and am so pleased with the results. I love the way my scalp tingles when using Wen cleanser. My hair looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> works AMAZING!!! EVEN ON ETHNIC HAIR!</li>
    <li> Works great!  My hair is much more manageable.</li>
    <li> The Lavender smells great and works great. It does kinda build up or it doesn&#x27;t remove my other leave in conditioner very well. After a few washing I switch to another shampoo and then go back to it. I think I&#x27;ll go back to using the Pomegranate.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. My hair looks soooo good.</li>
    <li> This was as described and also came with a pump, which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never left a review on amazon, but this one is worth spreading the good news.&lt;br /&gt;all round lovely product. lavender and tea tree is divine, cant wait to try the other products too.</li>
    <li> Love this. Makes my hair feel so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well.  But love the product.</li>
    <li> I love my hair since I started using the Wen conditioning shampoo. I&#x27;m a blond with fine hair and it never had much body that changed when I started using Wen.Now my hair feels fuller looks shiny and is definitely bouncy.</li>
    <li> I have used this particular Wen project for several years now.  It is the ONLY product I use to clean and condition my hair.  I color my hair with purples and magentas.  It helps to retain the colors far more than over-the-counter shampoos and conditioners.  It was recommended by my hairdresser and she always points out to clients the fabulous condition of my hair.  I found the Lavender scent the best of all the scents that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Hated it.. Hair seemed greasy.  Didn&#x27;t work not at all pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t ever go wrong with WEN... Lavender is one of my favorite fragrances and it takes care of my color treated hair!!</li>
    <li> This product never dissapoints. It&#x27;s perfect for blondes with delicate hair.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I thought it would be a wonder.  I was sorely disappointed.  I&#x27;d used as directed and my hair did nothing more than feel gross and smell like a peppermint patty.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sure if I had kept up with the regimen continuously (as directed) and spent what would have amounted to hundreds of dollars in product, my hair would probably be as advertised.  I am unable to do that.  I have a job that forbids me from spending tons of money on my hair so I will have split ends and dried bits for sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, try it.  If you have the money, do it.  See if it works for you.  I really did NOT for me.</li>
    <li> This is okay but, it doesn&#x27;t have the same ingredients as when you buy from the actually &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; site.  It is missing the word water (aqua).</li>
    <li> It made my hair feel very mated down and looked dirty to me, thinking about sending it back! The smell is great, really loved it, but will never buy again. With other shampoos I can skip a day of washing, but not with this one, looked awful after brushing it next morning.</li>
    <li> love wen shampoo conditioner..it keeps my curly hair in great shape..now i don&#x27;t like using other shampoos..like the smell of the lavender</li>
    <li> I am an avid fan of the WEN lineup, but the Lavender cleanser did not live up to expectations. I read the reviews saying great for fine or oily hair that is colored. I am an every 7 weeks highlights gal and my roots get oily quickly. I used this for 3 days to give it a chance. I washed my hair in the shower before work, styled as usual and went bout my day. By 3 PM my hair looked greasy and dirty and I ended up going to Meijer to buy a dry powder shampoo to conquer the root greasy look. Not great for fine hair if you&#x27;d like to go an entire day without looking like a greasy mess.</li>
    <li> i am happy with this product, my hair is very fine so i chose this ingredient as apposed to all the rest ,it offers volume,body,bounce and manageability!Love it!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite scent by WEN.  Moisturizers well,not overly but enough so that I can blowdry and flat iron without any other product.  The lavendar is true lavendar which aI love.  My hair has lots of movement and body, and feels great.  I really love WEN products and plan on using them for a long time.</li>
    <li> This formulation made my hair greasy and lifeless.  It smelled great.  I prefer tea tree and sweet almond mint.  I still love WEN just prefer another formula.  It may work for you.</li>
    <li> I h a ve always wanted to try this product and I am so glad to finally try kit.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I began using this product after noticing a beautiful shine in my daughter&#x27;s naturally wavy hair, and asked her its source.  She credited Wen&#x27;s Lavender Cleansing Conditioner (I later learned that she had also discontinued coloring her hair, which I&#x27;d been unaware she&#x27;d done for years). I was interested because I&#x27;d let my highlights grow out only to discover the natural brunette hair of my younger years was now a dull, mousy brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But  I was hesitant because I never use anything called &amp;#34;Conditioner,&amp;#34; as after-shampoo conditioners weigh down my hair, making my very fine hair flat, while I want volume.  After watching Wen&#x27;s TV show I got idea (rightly or wrongly) that he&#x27;s calling it Cleansing Conditioner&amp;#34;  mainly to avoid the word &amp;#34;shampoo,&amp;#34; rather than to sell the conditioner aspect that I&#x27;ve always avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very satisfied: this product gives my hair more shine--something I&#x27;ve never found in than any other commercial shampoo that claims to provide shine. Most importantly, Wen&#x27;s  doesn&#x27;t decrease volume as long as I follow the cleansing with my usual mousse before blo-drying.  I&#x27;m not a fragrance fan, and actually have never detected a lavender scent. Nor have I ever experienced the scalp &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; that other reviewers both admire and complain about.  It just does the job for me, so I like everything about this product except its high price (and one instance of a non-functioning dispenser).  I use much less product than suggested (for my very short cut).</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this all the time and she loves it. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy 5 stars.</li>
