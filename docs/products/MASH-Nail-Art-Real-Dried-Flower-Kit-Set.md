      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it a 5 if there were more in there.</li>
      <li>Once these flowers are all used for nail art, I will be reordering more.</li>
      <li>The picture would indicate that there is more than one type of flower in the package, that is not the case.  </li>
      <li>I wish they were all more like those.</li>
      <li>These are okay</li>
      <li>It was just okay.</li>

      <li>but the color is awesome and just as expected.</li>
      <li>I found by putting them on a damp cloth to be a little more flexible worked best.</li>
      <li>Overall, these were great nail art pieces that Im glad I bought.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>so it kind of doesn&#x27;t look exactly like a flower when you put them on your nails.</li>
      <li>They offered to resend me another one free of charge.</li>
      <li>Some of the flowers are grouped on stems so you can cut them to fit the nail and use the fall offs too.</li>
      <li>I intend to purchase more, thanks a million</li>
      <li>but they looked too cool to pass up.</li>
      <li>I finally got them today and now am more pleased with this seller.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
      <li>the quantinty is ok and the colours are vibrant.</li>
      <li>por el precio super economicas.</li>
      <li>You pretty much get what&#x27;s on the pictures, except on the pictures it looks way better in my opinion.</li>
      <li>These are really pretty and are unique to add to a nail to decorate.</li>
      <li>These are so pretty!  </li>
      <li>Overall these are amazing</li>
      <li>I put a clear coat of polish on my nails, placed the flowers on that with tweezers and then immediately sealed that with a top coat.</li>
      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>All the others just look like flattened colorful stuff not like flowers.  </li>
      <li>Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
      <li>They also sat up high, which made them easy to krock off.</li>
      <li>The flowers look so real and are very colorful.</li>
      <li>It is a very easy way to spruce up a basic manicure.</li>
      <li>I got none of the big flowers and that&#x27;s mostly what I wanted it for.</li>
      <li>I match the nails to the flowers, but the ones I used the most only had maybe 6 or 7 in there.</li>
      <li>I was unsure how I would use these when I first ordered them</li>
      <li>They should be smaller and more defined in design.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to purchasing more different nail colors!</li>
      <li>The speed is so fast!</li>
      <li>It is exactly what you see on the picture.</li>
      <li>but they should advertise them as what they really are!</li>
      <li>After leaving my first review (in quotes below &amp; with one star), the seller contacted me with a solution to redeem themselves.</li>
      <li>these are cute but some are a little bigger than i thought, but some are usable on what i need but they are very cute</li>
      <li>Pretty much the only reason why it&#x27;s getting a 3 is because the packaging is really cute.</li>
      <li>I have ordered dried flowers from several companies and these by far are the best quality.  </li>
      <li>Old adage that is true.  </li>
      <li>They are flat and easy to use on fingernails, and don&#x27;t create a really bumpy nail surface when the nail is done.</li>
      <li>Thanks DGI Mart!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>too much money for what you get in the case.</li>
      <li>I really like them.</li>
      <li>The packing is very orderly.  </li>
      <li>I knew it would be a bunch of different colors of the same flower, but I would definitely order more if they came out with more variety.</li>
      <li>The seem like the same kind of flower that were soaked in different colored dye.</li>
      <li>Got the kit for my daughter and we excitedly opened it only to find</li>
      <li>The advertised picture is very misleading, although the flowers are as pictured, the quantity is no where near as advertised!!</li>
      <li>These were much better, came in little tubs and are all whole flowers.</li>
      <li>I only wished these came with more variety, instead of a bunch of colors of the same flower.</li>
      <li>The flowers with the biggest petals look adorable on nails, but I only had enough for two sets.</li>
      <li>While the idea was interesting to me, the execution of it did not impress me enough to keep buying similar products.  </li>
      <li>The 2 pots of bigger flowers are very pretty.  </li>
      <li>so I personally didn&#x27;t find this to be worth the money; it&#x27;s a shame I ordered three of them as I&#x27;ve already used up all of the two main flowers.</li>
      <li>I ordered the MASH Nail Art (dried flowers) they are adorable.</li>
      <li>They had opened and were all stuck together and crumbled, and had most of the petals missing.</li>
      <li>When you put them on they take up the entire nail and then get mushy, so it does not look right at all.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Long story short, I rather get these for free.</li>
      <li>The color assortment is beautiful, yet completely useless!</li>
      <li>If you try to apply the whole thing, it is too big to put on the nail.  </li>
      <li>The little flowers I like it, but no the big ones, well you need to put it in big nails, but its ok, you need to do acrylics nails encap.</li>
      <li>Flowers are too big for nails, and basically they are dried flowers, they break easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately you only get several of the whole flowers</li>
      <li>I only found two of the flowers to be usable; the larger whole flowers as seen in the picture.</li>
      <li>There are two sets of white and pink five petal flowers that are really pretty.  </li>
      <li>They look very pretty and are not the usual addition to a manicure.  </li>
      <li>As far as this particular prodcut goes, it mainly contains the tiny flowers, which are hard, if not impossible, to use in nail art, at least for me.</li>
      <li>I really like it especially the little flower</li>

    <li> The little flowers I like it, but no the big ones, well you need to put it in big nails, but its ok, you need to do acrylics nails encap.</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly and in great condition.  The collection has a good variety of colors and types of flowers - they make a really great addition to my nail art supplies.</li>
    <li> Pretty much the only reason why it&#x27;s getting a 3 is because the packaging is really cute. You pretty much get what&#x27;s on the pictures, except on the pictures it looks way better in my opinion. Whenever I touch one of the smaller flower bursts, it like...falls apart and I have no idea how to put these on my nails to make it look good. Long story short, I rather get these for free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great set. I match the nails to the flowers, but the ones I used the most only had maybe 6 or 7 in there. The flowers with the biggest petals look adorable on nails, but I only had enough for two sets. I&#x27;d give it a 5 if there were more in there. And I can&#x27;t seem to find replacements, either. I&#x27;m not going to purchase an entire box just for one or two types of flowers.</li>
    <li> What an awesome addition to your home nail salon!  They look very pretty and are not the usual addition to a manicure.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have previously ordered flowers that were less than I expected. They had opened and were all stuck together and crumbled, and had most of the petals missing. These were much better, came in little tubs and are all whole flowers. They are flat and easy to use on fingernails, and don&#x27;t create a really bumpy nail surface when the nail is done. I only wished these came with more variety, instead of a bunch of colors of the same flower. It is exactly what you see on the picture. I knew it would be a bunch of different colors of the same flower, but I would definitely order more if they came out with more variety. Overall, these were great nail art pieces that Im glad I bought.</li>
    <li> The packing is very orderly.  However, only 2 of these are flowers I would use on nails.  The other flowers are bursts of teeny tiny petals.  If you try to apply the whole thing, it is too big to put on the nail.  If you cut it down, it looks like nothing but a mess of colored gravel.  The 2 pots of bigger flowers are very pretty.  I wish they were all more like those.</li>
    <li> I received my package in less than 5 days. I ordered the MASH Nail Art (dried flowers) they are adorable. I really like them.</li>
    <li> Everything is good! The speed is so fast! And the quantity is great. I really like it especially the little flower</li>
    <li> These are really pretty and are unique to add to a nail to decorate. Perfect for resin jewelry making too!</li>
    <li> too much money for what you get in the case. I was not really impressed with this product at all</li>
    <li> I was happy with the flower kit but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them on anyone yet...I can&#x27;t wait until I do. The flowers look so real and are very colorful.</li>
    <li> After leaving my first review (in quotes below &amp; with one star), the seller contacted me with a solution to redeem themselves. They informed me that they had no idea that their supplier had changed the packaging style and cut the quantity. They offered to resend me another one free of charge. I finally got them today and now am more pleased with this seller. They proved to me that they care about the customer and will do what they need to make them happy...Thanks DGI Mart!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Not worth the money!! The pots contain 2 to 3 flowers in each, such a rip off! The advertised picture is very misleading, although the flowers are as pictured, the quantity is no where near as advertised!! In-fact the product isn&#x27;t even MASH, it&#x27;s labeled Chenxing.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and myself to do our nails with! They worked great and we had a lot of fun with them.</li>
    <li> These flowers are nothing like the picture.  There is hardly anything in the package, the containers barely contain any product.  The flowers arrived broken and crumbled, you can&#x27;t even tell they are flowers.  The ones pictured that look like whole flowers are not included, just extremely small, crumbled pieces.  You can&#x27;t tell they are flowers at all.  The color assortment is beautiful, yet completely useless!</li>
    <li> The picture would indicate that there is more than one type of flower in the package, that is not the case.  All twelve containers contained the same flower.  Also, they came on the very last day of the shipping time span.</li>
    <li> I have ordered dried flowers from several companies and these by far are the best quality.  All of the other companies I purchased from sent me flowers that were crushed and missing petals. Once these flowers are all used for nail art, I will be reordering more.</li>
    <li> Got the kit for my daughter and we excitedly opened it only to find a couple of compartments only had like two flowers in it.  I mean literally two!  Wow!  Old adage that is true.  You do pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty!  Tiny dried flowers to jazz up any craft or nail art project.  They arrived quickly and as advertised.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Flowers are too big for nails, and basically they are dried flowers, they break easily. Don&#x27;t waste your money with this junk.</li>
    <li> This set is a must have for your nail art collection :-). Some of the flowers are grouped on stems so you can cut them to fit the nail and use the fall offs too. the quantinty is ok and the colours are vibrant.</li>
    <li> perfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
    <li> Hermosas, buena cantidad y por el precio super economicas. Lo recomiendo que compren aqui , encuentran de todo y un buen precio</li>
    <li> these are cute but some are a little bigger than i thought, but some are usable on what i need but they are very cute</li>
    <li> I love it. I intend to purchase more, thanks a million I want more flowers. I was very pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed by the product I received. It is not cute at all. The flowers are tiny and cheap-looking. The seem like the same kind of flower that were soaked in different colored dye. I tried to return it and never heard anything back from the seller! A total rip off. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> I was bored with just painting my nails, so I wanted to try something new. While the idea was interesting to me, the execution of it did not impress me enough to keep buying similar products.  As far as this particular prodcut goes, it mainly contains the tiny flowers, which are hard, if not impossible, to use in nail art, at least for me. I&#x27;ve used the bigger ones to decorate my nails, but the flowers did not stay on as long as my shellac manicure did. They started pealing off ruining my manicure.  Thus, I won&#x27;t be purchasing anything like this in the future. I&#x27;ll stick to purchasing more different nail colors!</li>
    <li> Not as described at all. All the flowers are broken, same kind and very small. The picture is deceiving.</li>
    <li> If and when I get these on they don&#x27;t last very long, maybe an instructional manual or some designs to come with it?</li>
    <li> I was unsure how I would use these when I first ordered them but they looked too cool to pass up. It was pleased at how easy they were to apply. I put a clear coat of polish on my nails, placed the flowers on that with tweezers and then immediately sealed that with a top coat. I got many compliments on my nails. I definitely recommend this product to any with a nail art interest. It is a very easy way to spruce up a basic manicure.</li>
    <li> The little flowers were hard to manage, they are real, so they would tear or flake off. They also sat up high, which made them easy to krock off.</li>
    <li> I got none of the big flowers and that&#x27;s mostly what I wanted it for. I also got different colors than in the picture. I wish I would&#x27;ve got what I thought I was ordering. If you order, expect a surprise.</li>
    <li> Pretty but small and difficult to work with.</li>
    <li> i havent used these yet but the color is awesome and just as expected. cant wait to use them! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought the MASH nail art dried flowers but i didn&#x27;t get what the picture shows i only got the little flowers not the other whole flowers. Bit of a disappointment but at least i got the 12 containers of flowers. :)</li>
    <li> i love the colors of the flowers and the size of the flowers are much better than the pictures, great quality; would recommend the product to any one who would like a different design on their nails, very sophisticated look</li>
    <li> These are nothing like the picture! There are no large whole flower petals, they are all small clumps of tiny flowers on stems. I like having these but they should advertise them as what they really are!</li>
    <li> These are natural dried flowers.  There are two sets of white and pink five petal flowers that are really pretty.  All the others just look like flattened colorful stuff not like flowers.  I am not really sure how I would use them and I probably never will. I haven&#x27;t used any of them on my nails yet, but I am sure the five petal flowers will work just fine.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition, great size and colors. A little dry for my taste. I recommend boiling some water and holding them over the steam to soften them before use</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
    <li> I received 2 small containers of bigger flowers and there was only 3 or 4 in each container so that&#x27;s a bit disappointing. The small flowers are pretty but very fragile and they don&#x27;t have a center or anything they just look like petals so it kind of doesn&#x27;t look exactly like a flower when you put them on your nails. Plus a lot of them were slightly damaged. These are okay I would use them on my toenails but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy dried flowers again. Though I think I did get a nice assortment of colors and shipping wasn&#x27;t too bad either. It was just okay.</li>
    <li> I love the bright colors and they add a touch of realism to my nails. But they are fragile so one have to be careful when trying to get a small piece for the whole flower.</li>
    <li> I only found two of the flowers to be usable; the larger whole flowers as seen in the picture. I found the remainder of them to be rather flaky and difficult to incorporate into any nail art. I used tweezers and a small pair of cuticle scissors to cut and shape the stems of the tiny flowers but I still found they they were difficult to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately you only get several of the whole flowers so I personally didn&#x27;t find this to be worth the money; it&#x27;s a shame I ordered three of them as I&#x27;ve already used up all of the two main flowers.</li>
    <li> At first these little guys were difficult to work with, but you will find ways to work with it easier. I found by putting them on a damp cloth to be a little more flexible worked best. Overall these are amazing and I might just order more because I&#x27;ve gone through them so quickly &amp;#60;3 !!! GREAT DEAL !!!</li>
    <li> These dried flowers are to big for nail art use.  They should be smaller and more defined in design.  When you put them on they take up the entire nail and then get mushy, so it does not look right at all. I say it is not a good use of your money.</li>
