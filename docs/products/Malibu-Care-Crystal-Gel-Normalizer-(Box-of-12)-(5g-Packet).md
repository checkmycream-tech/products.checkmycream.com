      <li>My hair had a lightness, fluffiness (in a good way, mostly at the scalp), and shininess that I had not seen in quite some time.</li>
      <li>but I liked it after the one use.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I tried the treatment by itself and it is just okay</li>

      <li>I am very very pleased and highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>It made a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Heat is really important as a catalyst in the chelation process.</li>
      <li>My hair is about 20% gray and then a mixture of light browns.  </li>
      <li>The Malibu Crystal Gel treatment removes all deposits in one treatment and leaves your color, natural or enhanced, bright and shiney.  </li>
      <li>was really bright again and really soft too.  </li>
      <li>and this is definitely more economical and convenient than using bottled water.</li>
      <li>use this product monthly and it does a great job keeping my color as close as possible to the original.</li>
      <li>Used the correct way it will leave your hair very soft, silky, shiny, and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!</li>
      <li>but then I bought a heating cap and used that with the treatment and wow!  Love it!  </li>
      <li>Hair feels squeaky clean and is pretty fine and fly away the next day</li>
      <li>(I frost my own hair with a cap and this is great for removing the hard water sediment from my hair before I lighten!)</li>
      <li>This made a huge difference with the first use.</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant at all.</li>
      <li>In fact after using this the first time, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for four days!</li>
      <li>My hair has been deteriorating over time, becoming more and more dull, lifeless, and tangly.</li>
      <li>&amp; I can do it right at home.</li>
      <li>I warped my hair in a hot towel fresh from the drier.  </li>
      <li>Great product for hard water areas.</li>
      <li>Great clarifying for buildup from hard water or chlorine.</li>
      <li>the Garnier Damage Eraser does work the same, maybe even better</li>
      <li>Same item that salons will not sell to you and then charge you $25 or more for one application.  </li>
      <li>It looked freshly washed and not greasy at all the whole time.</li>
      <li>Glad I can now skip the salon and do this same treatment at home and save $45.</li>
      <li>My hair feels squeaky clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>but this is much cheaper</li>
      <li>Hair feels so much cleaner after I use this.</li>
      <li>Hair dresser tells me to use it the day before highlights as the color will take better but not sure how true that is.  </li>
      <li>My trademark, beautiful, bouncey, long, blonde hair is back!</li>
      <li>This is the best produce on the market to clean residue of hard water, medications, and other stuff left in your hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel any more luxurious than any other conditioning hair mask.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without these Malibu crystal gels !</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>If you have highlighted hair and have well water your highlights get dull and kind of orange.</li>
      <li>I normally get this done at my hairdresser</li>
      <li>Sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and rinse the blue right out of my hair.</li>
      <li>Sat in the recliner and watched a couple episodes of New Girl.</li>
      <li>grow out with gray/brown roots and she applied this before doing my new color and POP my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since I tend to live in places with well water.  </li>
      <li>so well that it looks like I&#x27;ve just received a new highlight.  </li>
      <li>Water softeners only remove so much of the discoloration, so this has always been a problem with maintaining my (blond) highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It turns green from my well water, but after using this treatment my gray is shiny silver and my light browns are gleaming.  </li>
      <li>My hair was becoming unmanageable and dull and no longer felt soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels clean, my highlights are blonde again and I can comb through my wet hair with zero tangles!  </li>
      <li>Great product, but packing is bad.</li>
      <li>Hair is soft, color far less iron-coated</li>

<li> Great product, but packing is bad.</li>
<li> Hair is soft, color far less iron-coated</li>
<li> Well water can be very hard on hair, particularly if the iron content is high.  </li>
<li> so doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long.  </li>
<li> I was a bit afraid to actually try this product, but, in reading the other reviews, I felt it was safe to try.  </li>
<li> so I use this in my hair after a shower, covered with cap for an hour and then use the blow dryer to heat it dry.  </li>
<li> I am a blonde and yet my hair had turned green from the well water... turns out it is the blue from the minerals/pipes</li>
<li> once,5 days ago, so I&#x27;m not sure how frequently I&#x27;ll need to use it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m used to washing every other day, with the second day looking just slightly greasy enough to wear it up instead of down.</li>
<li> Brightens up dull color on my natural uncolored hair.</li>
<li> It tends to get expensive at local stores so it was much cheaper to buy it in bulk on Amazon.  </li>
<li> I have bleached blonde hair and within a few weeks of washing my hair an orange tint starts.  </li>
<li> Sometimes my blonde highlighted hair gets a dull cast over it.  </li>
<li> One day I saw my reflection in a mirror (surrounded by other blondes) and was horror-stricken by the color contrast of my haircolor compared to theirs!</li>
<li> Less work for him when I get there.</li>
<li> I squeeze out my hair after having the product sit for 45 minutes &amp; the gel squeezes out GREEN like gel toothpaste as it strips all the minerals out of the hair shaft.</li>
<li> A few weeks out now,</li>
<li> The only disappointment was that the box contained the packets, but the rest of the box was empty.  </li>
<li> only bummer is this means a regular routine to keep those ugly minerals off my hair.</li>
<li> It really depends on how bad your build up is.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the water that is causing the build up</li>
<li> The hard plastic box is difficult to open.  </li>
<li> We have very hard well water which has turned my hair green.</li>
<li> but this hair treatment gets the dull cast off my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product works so well I have been using it for 15 years. If you have highlighted hair and have well water your highlights get dull and kind of orange. This Malibu treatment takes care of that!  I works best when heat is applied, or leave it on for longer.  Your hair is visibly brightened, seriously, you can see an immediated difference.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My hair is about 20% gray and then a mixture of light browns.  It turns green from my well water, but after using this treatment my gray is shiny silver and my light browns are gleaming.  My hair feels squeaky clean and soft.  I followed up with the Malibu Conditioner.  I have only used it once,5 days ago, so I&#x27;m not sure how frequently I&#x27;ll need to use it.  But I do wash my hair daily and this is definitely more economical and convenient than using bottled water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since I tend to live in places with well water.  Works GREAT on removing discoloration. Your hair may even looked like it just got colored again.  Brightens up highlights.  It really depends on how bad your build up is.  It tends to get expensive at local stores so it was much cheaper to buy it in bulk on Amazon.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I started using Malibu in the &#x27;90&#x27;s. My hairdresser back East in the Hamptons would use it on me regularly. I have blonde hair, had horrible well-water, and was a triathlete/swimmer (&#x3D; hair disaster). He would give me a treatment once a month before hilighting. He also gave me a bunch of packets to use at home. I put a disposable shower cap on (I use the ones hotels give me), then put on the metallic shower cap, then a heating cap. Heat is really important as a catalyst in the chelation process. You must use a heating cap (beauty supply store) or sit under a dryer. At minimum, wrap your hair in a towel to keep the warmth in, per my amazing hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just moved into a building in San Diego where the pipes are ancient! My hair is suffering the wrathe. I could feel the heaviness and see the dullness in my hair almost immediately after moving in. One day I saw my reflection in a mirror (surrounded by other blondes) and was horror-stricken by the color contrast of my haircolor compared to theirs! I yanked out all my Malibu paraphenalia and got to work. My trademark, beautiful, bouncey, long, blonde hair is back! Oh, my hairdresser is going to be SO happy when he sees me! Less work for him when I get there. :) Thank you Malibu! I&#x27;m thrilled to see the product is still around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bummer is this means a regular routine to keep those ugly minerals off my hair. The view may be amazing at my home, but the price for beachfront property just went up in my book!</li>
    <li> having hard water is difficult on ones hair!!  I was a bit afraid to actually try this product, but, in reading the other reviews, I felt it was safe to try.  Great!  Hair is soft, color far less iron-coated and I will be a regular user of Malibu products.  I did pay attention to using plastic wrap and adding the heat of my blow dryer.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of this one!</li>
    <li> Used the correct way it will leave your hair very soft, silky, shiny, and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Hair feels so much cleaner after I use this. Monthly application with a heating cap helps keep my hair bright and healthy. Brightens up dull color on my natural uncolored hair. Glad I can now skip the salon and do this same treatment at home and save $45.</li>
    <li> This is the best produce on the market to clean residue of hard water, medications, and other stuff left in your hair. I always use it before a perm and anytime in-between when my hair needs it.</li>
    <li> great to get rust/iron out of your hair. might want to try protein after to &amp;#34;fill up holes&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I just think this product was too expensive for the amount I received.</li>
    <li> Sometimes my blonde highlighted hair gets a dull cast over it.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the water that is causing the build up but this hair treatment gets the dull cast off my hair.  I use this teatment once a week for great hair results.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing stuff ever!!!  It works wonders on my well water hair. I would 100% recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I normally get this done at my hairdresser but this is much cheaper &amp; I can do it right at home.</li>
    <li> Have only used this once but I&#x27;ve decided to get away from the chemical process but I liked it after the one use.&lt;br /&gt;Will alternate weeks as I work to strengthen my hair. Love the way my hair felt after use.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  She heard about it at a hair show.  I had three months of blonde highlight grow out with gray/brown roots and she applied this before doing my new color and POP my hair was really bright again and really soft too.  She applied alot of heat with mine.  I have a filtered shower head and still had alot of build up on my hair.  Will definitely purchase this product.</li>
    <li> great product and super fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great product for hard water areas. My hair has been deteriorating over time, becoming more and more dull, lifeless, and tangly. This made a huge difference with the first use. My hair had a lightness, fluffiness (in a good way, mostly at the scalp), and shininess that I had not seen in quite some time. In fact after using this the first time, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for four days! It looked freshly washed and not greasy at all the whole time. I&#x27;m used to washing every other day, with the second day looking just slightly greasy enough to wear it up instead of down. A few weeks out now, and I&#x27;m washing it every third day. I&#x27;m using the Malibu Hard Water Wellness shampoo alternated with some cheaper clarifying shampoo. I&#x27;ll probably use this product once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the Malibu Miracle Repair Treatment afterward. It didn&#x27;t feel any more luxurious than any other conditioning hair mask. Next time I will try a Garnier one I already had and see if there&#x27;s any difference and report back here. (ETA: the Garnier Damage Eraser does work the same, maybe even better but I have a twelve pack of the Malibu conditioner to get through, so I will use that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I almost felt the need to purchase a heated head wrap when seeing it as a \\&quot;suggested product\\&quot;. I settled on wrapping my hair in a smaller (i.e. floor size) bath towel, wrapping a heating pad around that, and securing with a cord from a pair of earplugs. Hey, it worked. Next time maybe a belt from a bathrobe/jacket. Sat in the recliner and watched a couple episodes of New Girl. Not unpleasant at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 years. I am a blonde and yet my hair had turned green from the well water... turns out it is the blue from the minerals/pipes whatever. Thank goodness for the hair dresser that turned me on to this. Every 2-3 weeks, I follow the simple instructions, cap my hair with a shower cap (dollar store - 8 for a buck!) Sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and rinse the blue right out of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is great for rust in hair.  BUT the packaging is horrible!  The hard plastic box is difficult to open.  Great product, but packing is bad.</li>
    <li> I am on well water so I use this in my hair after a shower, covered with cap for an hour and then use the blow dryer to heat it dry.  Highlights come back so well that it looks like I&#x27;ve just received a new highlight.  Downside is 2/3 days later of well water the highlights look dull again so doesn&#x27;t seem to last all that long.  Hair feels squeaky clean and is pretty fine and fly away the next day but that&#x27;s because all the weight of the minerals is out.  Hair dresser tells me to use it the day before highlights as the color will take better but not sure how true that is.  Over all, a good product.</li>
    <li> I have been going to my hair stylist to have my hair treated with the Malibu treatment for a couple of years.  It works great!  Takes the orange out of my hair from my well water. I decided to try doing it at home to save money.  The only disappointment was that the box contained the packets, but the rest of the box was empty.  The directions say to use the mixing bottle and shower cap.  They were not included.</li>
    <li> Awesomely amazing product!!!!! My blonde hair is brighter and softer than ever...won&#x27;t ever be without it. For hard wster users</li>
    <li> This product worked great!!! My hair was not taking color well, I am on a lot of different supplements and several prescription meds. My hair color came out great and is still  holding very well. I am very very pleased and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I live in an area that has horrible, really bad hard water.  My hair gets to the point where it feels weighed down and dirty, my highlights turn orangey and dull and my hair is hard to manage; lots of tangles.  I tried the treatment by itself and it is just okay but then I bought a heating cap and used that with the treatment and wow!  Love it!  My hair feels clean, my highlights are blonde again and I can comb through my wet hair with zero tangles!  Yay!!!!  Recommend using with a heating cap or dryer.</li>
    <li> We have very hard well water which has turned my hair green. I now use this once a week and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my hair. When I use it I squeeze out my hair after having the product sit for 45 minutes &amp; the gel squeezes out GREEN like gel toothpaste as it strips all the minerals out of the hair shaft. Great product! BTW, I just apply, wrap my head with plastic wrap and exercise for 45 minutes rather than sit under a dryer.</li>
    <li> this products is great, works well for those who have well water and the water softner does not quite do the job</li>
    <li> Worked well to get rid of the redness from our well water but will need a second treatment to finish the job.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without these Malibu crystal gels !</li>
    <li> Same item that salons will not sell to you and then charge you $25 or more for one application.  LOVE IT!  (I frost my own hair with a cap and this is great for removing the hard water sediment from my hair before I lighten!)</li>
    <li> I have well water that leaves a rust-colored residue. Water softeners only remove so much of the discoloration, so this has always been a problem with maintaining my (blond) highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product monthly and it does a great job keeping my color as close as possible to the original.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me... Almost made the green look worse</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that removes the iron I have in my well water.  I have bleached blonde hair and within a few weeks of washing my hair an orange tint starts.  malibu crystal gel removes all the iron build up and my blonde returns.  I love love love this product</li>
    <li> Love these. Great clarifying for buildup from hard water or chlorine. A must.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I have used for years.  Well water can be very hard on hair, particularly if the iron content is high.  The Malibu Crystal Gel treatment removes all deposits in one treatment and leaves your color, natural or enhanced, bright and shiney.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!!</li>
    <li> My hair was becoming unmanageable and dull and no longer felt soft.  I think this was from build up from my shampoo.  Whatever was causing the problems they were cured by this treatment.  I will be repeating treatments often.  It made a huge difference.  Also, after I applied the treatment to my hair I warped my hair in a hot towel fresh from the drier.  This worked better than using a hair drier</li>
