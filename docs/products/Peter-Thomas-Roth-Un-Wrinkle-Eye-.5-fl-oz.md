      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>But I do know that my wife is in love with it and is super happy, and I look like a king!</li>
      <li>The eye cream has got to be some kind of joke though.  </li>
      <li>The best thing is that even though I have extremely sensitive eyes it does not burn or cause tears.</li>
      <li>So far I love it!!!</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t too oily, goes on nicely and does not have any type of strong scent.  </li>
      <li>Absorption is very good, soft and comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Looking</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I love the texture.</li>
      <li>** cream works better.</li>
      <li>I have tried many wrinkle creams and this is one of the better ones.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve used better.  </li>
      <li>and I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Even though I did not apply to eyelids many lashes still fell out.</li>
      <li>I think it plumps up the skin around my eyes and helps them look better when they are worn out from no sleep.</li>
      <li>I love the pump packaging, it&#x27;s hygienically safe.</li>
      <li>I like this product, as it seems to lighten up the under eye area and smooth at out some of the fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Huge fan of this product.  </li>
      <li>but I have to say that my skin around my eyes does appear tighter and more fresh.</li>
      <li>Worth the investment :)</li>
      <li>Dr. Oz must like his because he gets it free, or profits from the promo.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>This is the first product Ibhave used where I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes getting softer!  </li>
      <li>I love this product very much.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and certainly the price and quick delivery is a bonus!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this line of products</li>
      <li>The cream itself is of medium texture, very fine and gentle on my skin around the eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving this stuff so far.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>liked it, big bottle !&lt;</li>
      <li>The price is worth it...</li>
      <li>My favorite Eye cream is by far unwrinkle.</li>
      <li>The texture of this cream is very fresh, good absorption, and around the eyes, not from the small granular things, will continue to use it</li>
      <li>But it did feel good, But not worth the money?</li>
      <li>I have used so many with no results and this one already has made the skin around my eyes so soft and the fine lines are starting to disappear.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 51, and when I was 49, moved to Nevada,&lt;br /&gt;very hot and dry climate, and then good old mother nature say&#x27;s, time for menopause !  </li>
      <li>Product works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
      <li>I have been using unwrinkle eye for several years now and love it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;would be eben better if can use on upper eyelid instead of just under eye area</li>
      <li>So much cheaper than in the stores</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think I see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>wonderful cream, too expensive in stores!</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would also recommend it to people who have sensitive skin--it doesn&#x27;t break me out!!  </li>
      <li>I ordered the travel size instead, a little more affordable.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, so far no irritation.</li>
      <li>I test using one cream on the left and another on the right.</li>
      <li>I just recently ordered more, but noticed the price has gone up, not just a little, it was over 50% higher than what I paid in&lt;br /&gt;Jan.  </li>
      <li>It is the first product I have used for my under eye area, where I can actually see a difference.  </li>
      <li>It is fragrance free and you only need a pin drop amount so a bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the store price, but the amazon price was worth it.</li>
      <li>but it is not for sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>My one complaint is that the way the bottle is made there is no way of telling when it is time to order more.</li>
      <li>but sure enough, it created dry flaky skin on my lids, especially in the crease of my upper eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I live in the desert and need a serious eye cream to not only reduce fine lines and prevent new wrinkles but to hydrate my eyes, including my eyelids.  </li>
      <li>I can find other ways of spending that much money.</li>

<li> forward to the effect after using for a long time</li>
<li> It has helped with softening my crow&#x27;s feet, and I have noticed that it has helped with tightening the area above my eyelids, which was starting to look a little droopy.  </li>
<li> It definitely diminishes the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
<li> Expensive but worth the money</li>
<li> Have noticed changes almost instantly; A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> and this may be due to the work of the neuropeptides found in the ingredients.</li>
<li> so I am curious to see what results I will see by the recommended day 28!</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s still a lot less than other other websites are asking.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Update: No way, not worth the $$.</li>
<li> I have to say that I feel that my skin moves less after I applied the cream</li>
<li> I use a few of Peter Thomas Roth products, and they have all worked well for me.</li>
<li> No strong smell.</li>
<li> I do like the unwrinkle serum though - not sure about results</li>
<li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s and noticed my eyelids getting that crepe texture where eyeshadow began to sit in the creases.</li>
<li> Are they serious???  </li>
<li> I used it anyway thinking it was some weird mistake</li>
<li> Very expensive product</li>
<li> Very expensive</li>
<li> Was very skeptical about an &amp;#34;unwrinkle&amp;#34; cream</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve been getting from using Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Eye. I have even been getting compliments from friends who have noticed a difference which confirms it is working!</li>
    <li> For me, this is the only eye cream I can see the difference before and after use. Woth to buy!</li>
    <li> Was very skeptical about an &amp;#34;unwrinkle&amp;#34; cream but I have to say that my skin around my eyes does appear tighter and more fresh. Granted, I just turned 31 yesterday so don&#x27;t have a lot of really deep wrinkles but like my niece says I DO have a lot of &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34;.  It has only been about 10 days since I started using it so I am curious to see what results I will see by the recommended day 28!</li>
    <li> I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
    <li> Excellent, would recommended to everybody. tightener skin younger looking skin, we spend so money on things we don&#x27;t need. Just try it. it works.</li>
    <li> Good product, I can see improvement.  I have tried many wrinkle creams and this is one of the better ones.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth the store price, but the amazon price was worth it.</li>
    <li> The texture of this cream is very fresh, good absorption, and around the eyes, not from the small granular things, will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B00136X3VS Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle® Eye .5 fl oz]] since Jan. 2012.  It has helped with softening my crow&#x27;s feet, and I have noticed that it has helped with tightening the area above my eyelids, which was starting to look a little droopy.  I&#x27;m 51, and when I was 49, moved to Nevada,&lt;br /&gt;very hot and dry climate, and then good old mother nature say&#x27;s, time for menopause !  Anyway, the combo of these two events has done a number on me in the aging department.  This has been the only product that I&#x27;ve tried for the eyes that has made a difference.  I use a few of Peter Thomas Roth products, and they have all worked well for me. I just recently ordered more, but noticed the price has gone up, not just a little, it was over 50% higher than what I paid in&lt;br /&gt;Jan.  I ordered the travel size instead, a little more affordable.  I&#x27;ll keep an eye on the .5 oz, to see if one of the sellers will reduce the price a bit, it&#x27;s still a lot less than other other websites are asking.  Worth every penny, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas because she begged me for it.  I found it here at Amazon the cheapest.  This same bottle sells at big name cosmetic stores for $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for myself how good it is because I don&#x27;t use it.  But I do know that my wife is in love with it and is super happy, and I look like a king!</li>
    <li> Great product. It does work!</li>
    <li> Very expensive product and it does not deliver results.  I would never purchase this again.  I can find other ways of spending that much money.</li>
    <li> liked it, big bottle !&lt;br /&gt;would be eben better if can use on upper eyelid instead of just under eye area</li>
    <li> BURNS! would not repurchase...unsure of results but it is not for sensitive eyes that&#x27;s for sure. Will update on results. I do like the unwrinkle serum though - not sure about results but im on my 3rd bottle of that. I love the texture.</li>
    <li> wonderful cream, too expensive in stores! Takes some time to work but it does....</li>
    <li> I received the item on time. I love the pump packaging, it&#x27;s hygienically safe. The cream itself is of medium texture, very fine and gentle on my skin around the eyes. No strong smell. I have pretty sensitive skin, so far no irritation. So far it seems to be working, I only used it for a couple of days, but I think my lines are less noticeable. I couldn&#x27;t help, but use some on my marionette lines and forehead. The question is if the results are temporary or if there is actual change in the skin texture. I have to say that I feel that my skin moves less after I applied the cream and this may be due to the work of the neuropeptides found in the ingredients. I never had botox, but the lines should diminish from muscles being immobilized. And I think that in part this is how this cream works... I hope there are no side effects to this great cream. So far I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Used this product in its entirety.  Did not work.  It made no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than in the stores and I love this product.  It definitely diminishes the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using unwrinkle eye for several years now and love it.  I am 68 and have almost no wrinkles around my eyes.  It is fragrance free and you only need a pin drop amount so a bottle lasts a long time.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like this product, as it seems to lighten up the under eye area and smooth at out some of the fine lines.  My one complaint is that the way the bottle is made there is no way of telling when it is time to order more.</li>
    <li> This works well but I am allergic to something in it for me.</li>
    <li> Totally Satisfied!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth the money</li>
    <li> Huge fan of this product.  Great moisturizing, not greasy and smells great...</li>
    <li> I felt that this product did not do anything for me? Maybe it kept me from any additional wrinkles in my eye area? But I DID NOT NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE  in my skin texture or lines? But it did feel good, But not worth the money?</li>
    <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this line of products and I have to admit the peel pads seem to work great.  The unwrinkle night cream is good but I&#x27;ve used better.  The eye cream has got to be some kind of joke though.  Instructions on the back say not to use it on your eyelids.  Are they serious???  So where do I use this EYE cream?  On my forehead?  I live in the desert and need a serious eye cream to not only reduce fine lines and prevent new wrinkles but to hydrate my eyes, including my eyelids.  How do you make an eye cream that you can&#x27;t use on your eyelids?  I used it anyway thinking it was some weird mistake but sure enough, it created dry flaky skin on my lids, especially in the crease of my upper eyelid.  I don&#x27;t understand it.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is wonderful! I have used so many with no results and this one already has made the skin around my eyes so soft and the fine lines are starting to disappear.  I would also recommend it to people who have sensitive skin--it doesn&#x27;t break me out!!  I am now a Peter Thomas Roth fan!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and certainly the price and quick delivery is a bonus!</li>
    <li> I try different beauty creams all the time.  My favorite Eye cream is by far unwrinkle. I test using one cream on the left and another on the right. I ask my coworkers &amp; friends for opinions.  THIS IS IT!!! What a difference😊</li>
    <li> Works well.  It seems to have smoothed some of the lines under my eyes.  It isn&#x27;t too oily, goes on nicely and does not have any type of strong scent.  I&#x27;d but again.</li>
    <li> Product works pretty well. Even though I did not apply to eyelids many lashes still fell out. The best thing is that even though I have extremely sensitive eyes it does not burn or cause tears. Undecided if I will purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: No way, not worth the $$. A** cream works better. Dr. Oz must like his because he gets it free, or profits from the promo.</li>
    <li> I like it I&#x27;ve been using it about 6-8 weeks now and I don&#x27;t think I see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> The price is worth it...I&#x27;m in my late 50s and noticed my eyelids getting that crepe texture where eyeshadow began to sit in the creases. Within days of using this, the dryness disappeared and my eyelids were noticeably smoother. It won&#x27;t take all the wrinkles away, so coupled with this I stopped using shimmery shadows and switched to matte.</li>
    <li> Absorption is very good, soft and comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to the effect after using for a long time</li>
    <li> This is the best.  Does not burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> very good results after 2 months of use!</li>
    <li> I love this product very much.  It is the first product I have used for my under eye area, where I can actually see a difference.  I don&#x27;t know if the product is actually doing any repair, but my under eyes don&#x27;t look as wrinkled as they did before.  I use this in the a.m. and p.m.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and thought I would give it a try after reading reviews. I was disappointed. Very expensive and I did not see any benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff so far. I think it plumps up the skin around my eyes and helps them look better when they are worn out from no sleep. I havn&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it eliminates the wrinkles, but I plan to keep on using it to see!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Have noticed changes almost instantly; A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the first product Ibhave used where I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes getting softer!  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> It does not work. It is not like what it describes at website. It does not reduce or remove wrinkles at all. Not recommended.</li>
