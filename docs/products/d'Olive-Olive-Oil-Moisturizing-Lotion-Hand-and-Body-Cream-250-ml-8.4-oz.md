      <li>I use it nightly right before bed and feel like it is helping the dry, chapped hands and elbows</li>
      <li>I needed a cream that absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel behind.</li>

    <li> The smell is too artificial, overpowering</li>
    <li> Unbelievably superb. Leaves my skin nourished, soft and supple with a beautiful refreshing smell that lasts for a while. I ordered 2 in 250ml. I am keeping 1 at home, 1 in the office, and I am definitely going to purchase 2 more for my purse and keep the other as spare, because I can’t just run out of it. I highly recommend this cream. You are going to love it, I am sure.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes skin soft and smells good too. I found it in Turkey and thought I&#x27;d never see it again. I was so happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the best Hand and Body cream. I love the way is makes my hands feel and it isn&#x27;t greasy. The smell is wonderful. So many lotions smell good, then you put them on and after a little while the smell becomes to strong and even makes me ill. Love everything about Dalan D\\&quot;olive.</li>
    <li> Bought this stuff in Turkey while on vacation and it&#x27;s the best ever!! I bought three tubes of it when I left but cannot find it anywhere here in the States. If you see it, BUY IT! Smells great, lasts a long time, not greasy, and very moisturizing!!</li>
    <li> I discovered Dalan D&#x27;Olive Moisturizing Cream when we were in Turkey last September.  At the time I was having difficulty with rashes, and I am quite certain this product helped improve the condition.  I have re-ordered the lotion twice since I used up what I brought back and continue to believe it is the best lotion I have ever used. It is non-greasy yet thoroughly moisturizing, and has a lovely hint of natural fragrance to boot.</li>
    <li> the smell is too strong...</li>
    <li> GREAT. I LIKE EVERYTHING ON THIS PRODUCT- THE SIZE, THE PRICE, THE MOISTURIZING, THE FRESH SCENT, THE FAST DELIVERY...</li>
    <li> Very good creme with nice smell.</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion in Turkey when visiting my college roommate for his wedding. Not being a Turkish-speaker, I tried to go to the pharmacy there to buy it to no avail. Luckily, Amazon sells it and it&#x27;s been my go-to lotion ever since. I don&#x27;t even bother with Vaseline or Jergens—Dalan D&#x27;Olive is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> My favorite body lotion.  The fragrance is enough, not too much and not too little.  My body loves it when I moisturize it with Dalan d&#x27;Olive cream</li>
    <li> Great product. Not too oily.</li>
    <li> This seems like great hand cream but there is some chemical ingredient that is an irritant to my lungs.  After using, my breathing worsens.  If you have lung issues, this may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> This lotion is GREAT!  It feels and smells so so good. A must have especially now&lt;br /&gt;During the winter months! Omg :)</li>
    <li> It smells great-not too strong; leaves hands smooth and soft. It is not greasy. Just as I remember when I bought it in Turkey!</li>
    <li> Discovered this in a corner shop in Istanbul, great feel and smell!</li>
    <li> Cracking, redness and chapping from this winter&#x27;s severe cold spells really took a toll on my hands. I am not crazy about using hand cream during the day and mostly just use creams when going to bed. I needed a cream that absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel behind. Then I tried &amp;#34;Dalan D&#x27;Olive Moisturizing Hand &amp; Body Cream&amp;#34; and found just what I was looking for in a hand cream. It absorbs quickly, has a wonderful clean scent and leaves my hands soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Great product, very moist, smells and feels so good on your body</li>
    <li> The best hand cream ever! And I tried many.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs instantaneously, makes your skin nice and smooth, and has very pleasant scent. I purchased it just by a chance when visiting Turkey last spring and I was very happy to find it on Amazon; since my husband discovered it a few weeks ago I am running out of it twice as fast :)</li>
    <li> GREAT product. Doesn&#x27;t have any strong, lingering odors and is very quick to penetrate into the skin. I use it nightly right before bed and feel like it is helping the dry, chapped hands and elbows I have. Good price to and you need very little......</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is a favorite of mine.  Is not greasy and has a subtle scent which can be worn at anytime.</li>
    <li> Yes, I discovered a (hand) lotion that provides my hands with smoothness without greasy-or stickiness. It absorbs well and leaves smooth hands and a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Best cream ever!!!! I found this in Turkey for the first time and loved it. When I came back home I searched for this stuff and luckily Amazon carried it. You will LOVE this cream.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT... NOT GREASY... GREAT FOR THE HANDS &amp; IT LASTS ALL DAY ... KEEP ONE AT HOME &amp; ONE AT THE OFFICE</li>
    <li> Good cream, nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I first bought this in Turkey at the pharmacy I shopped at, than again in one of the markets, I tried to take as much home with me, so when I was getting low, I decided to see if I could get it on line, and Amazon came thru for me , now I don&#x27;t have to run out, I just love it, and it has a wonderful sent as well as it makes your skin look and feel wonderful, very soothing, I don&#x27;t want to be out of it</li>
    <li> Wonderful body and hand creams.  Since finding it in Turkey several years ago, the only place I have been able to find it in the States in via Amazon.  order.  I usually order 5-6 at a time.  Wonderful for gifts as well.</li>
