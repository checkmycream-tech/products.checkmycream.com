      <li>this thing is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>for this product, the quality is very good.</li>
      <li>, I am going to try to contact company to see if they can send replacement, especially in light of how costly this unit is compared to others on the market.  </li>
      <li>looks great.</li>
      <li>Simply amazing!</li>
      <li>My wife loved it since day 1</li>
      <li>I had done quite a bit of research to reach my decision to purchase Quasar MD Plus, as it appeared to excel over others, of course, most costly of the units over competitors!</li>
      <li>after the FIRST week of using this at nighttime while watching TV - my skin is noticably lighter and almost perfect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results</li>
      <li>so I could see if it was effective or not.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best beauty tool i&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>This is very safe easy to used device</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would have been way more handy, and for  this price, if there was a select-able turn timer at the top, on the sides of the power button.</li>
      <li>I knew it would be effective because I own an original Baby Quasar</li>
      <li>I love this unit.  </li>
      <li>and i had to contact the company for more information)</li>
      <li>Also my most problem area are my eyes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to return it because I don&#x27;t want to be without this thing!!:)  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ve used many.</li>
      <li>love the product but doesn&#x27;t stay lit</li>
      <li>My skin is changing for sure.</li>
      <li>I am now noticing better elasticity and bounce to my skin now.</li>
      <li>I look better in photos.</li>
      <li>Love my Quasar MD</li>
      <li>The feel of this device is great, even the packaging and carry kit, cord is braided, case is padded with soft touch material etc.</li>
      <li>I have had many people tell me that I look fantastic.  </li>
      <li>have used this product for about two months and already notice diminished fine periorbital and periocular fine lines; skin looks brighter and more refreshed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 52 and it does make a difference in the my fine eye lines nasal labial folds.</li>
      <li>I use another cream called Vivite&#x27; and the combo is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Regardless - the company makes a great product that actually does what it says.</li>
      <li>I was using it primarily around my mouth area.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I had been using the Quasar MD (older model) and while i liked it, it did not drastically do anything for my wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if i stopped treating my lips altogether</li>
      <li>I love when something works and this really does work.  </li>
      <li>My wife got me this device to help with my redness and my lines and both have really gotten better.  </li>
      <li>Increased collagen isn&#x27;t going to happen quickly.</li>
      <li>I had called several times and spoke each time with representatives of the product and each time they explained &amp;#34;due to my current age, 60yrs+&amp;#34; it would not accomplish best results.  </li>
      <li>I am using it and it really works , it came exactly as it says and it work perfectly, I really love it.</li>
      <li>This product is worth every cent.</li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Clear Rayz and cheaper plastic ones without the handle are a better buy</li>
      <li>/&gt;anyway.....if you want to make your skin REMARKABLLY smoother and clearer this investment is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I have a botox and filler appointment next week which i honestly don&#x27;t think i need now and am probably going to cancel.</li>
      <li>Bigger and more powerful got my attention.</li>
      <li>If considering and you are of age 50yrs or less, possibly a good choice based on comments by representatives of Quasar MD Plus.</li>
      <li>This makes it far more easy to actually keep up a routine of using it 3 times per week.</li>
      <li>I have been an avid outdoorsman for years</li>
      <li>Explained further that I should have started sooner (50yrs+) to get better results.  </li>
      <li>When I focus only on the eyes and mouth area it doesn&#x27;t take more than 15-20 minutes to treat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping for a more lifted look in the future.</li>
      <li>Firstly I am still using the Quasar MDPlus about 4 times a week.</li>
      <li>i am an AVID sunscreen user.</li>
      <li>I love this product I am religious about using it &amp; my my skin texture</li>
      <li>and I definitely like my skin better.</li>
      <li>my fine lines are lessening and overall the texture of my skin is smoother and LIGHTER.&lt;br /&gt;it IS an investment, however, it is certainly worth the amount.</li>
      <li>and my skin looks good enough for me to wear short sleeves and not worry about spots on my elbows scaring people off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is my minimal routine, when i have more time i treat my whole face.</li>
      <li>you really want to see a difference go to a doctor office for a real laser</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>Any initial wow is most likely the result of increased blood flow to the skin from the warmth of the light.</li>
      <li>my whole face looks refreshed and tighter.</li>
      <li>and it really has protected my skin from the damaging rays of the sun.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also use it all around my eyes, even the lid, and i feel it helps give me a more wide eyed look.</li>
      <li>And the power button should have emitted a sound when pressed, different from that of when the 3 minutes has ended.</li>
      <li>i just cannot get over how much brighter and lighter my skin looks.</li>
      <li>have been a sufferer of psoriasis for most of my life and recently started using this treatment on areas/patches that generally get treated with steroids.  </li>
      <li>Fine lines and smile lines are less visible.</li>
      <li>Well this is nothing new, red light therapy etc.</li>
      <li>Instructions say 8 weeks daily 2c full results.  </li>
      <li>Took less than a week to show a change in the most effected area.</li>
      <li>Its so worth the time and effort as i have been using it for a month now and have recently seen my frown lines soften and my nasolabial folds are reduced in fact</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 43 with lots of sun damage and fair thin skin.</li>
      <li>and she appears to be near my age, possibly older.  </li>
      <li>At first I used it only on my face, but it can be used on all types of problems.  </li>
      <li>you, still significantly overpriced, for just 42 or so 3mm LEDs, but you get both red and blue in one device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I buy this device for several reasons first II have no time to go every week to a dermatologist office to do a procedure, second i dont want to spend a thousend dollars In a treatment that I all ready kwon</li>
      <li>clearly overpriced, but if you want it because it&#x27;s Quasar, well who&#x27;s stopping</li>
      <li>If it works for this old guy it will work for anyone.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t see how this could possibly cost so much.</li>
      <li>I had the old baby quasar which is a quality product.</li>
      <li>Ladies; this device, Retin A, &amp; Needler can give you professional results at fraction of cost.  </li>
      <li>You DO have to be very persistent in using it regularly (and patient with the amount of time per session), but I&#x27;ve received unsolicited compliments and requests to borrow it.</li>
      <li>Boshit , I dont feel anything at all in fact the old baby quasar feel more hot to this new expensive piece of sh...</li>
      <li>I find that if i use it on my lips for three minutes until the beep sound about every other day it makes my lips look fuller and younger looking.</li>
      <li>at such a high price it should work with out any problems...</li>
      <li>Only drawback is the high price tag.</li>
      <li>I saw results very quickly and I have pretty tough Italian skin.  </li>
      <li>, my only complain is that you have to spend like a half hour for the whole face , but I really like this !</li>
      <li>Saw this new larger model.</li>
      <li>Also, a general tightening of the face.</li>
      <li>Been using it for a little over two months and even my boyfriend noticed that my face looks brighter, less saggy and more youthful.  </li>
      <li>I frequently think I have it on, because I repeat the same spot several times.</li>

<li> is that I have a small face and high cheekbones and the large surface of the head makes it a little difficult to go over my cheekbones without some of the light escaping.</li>
<li> I use the Quasar on washed bare skin, other than that i&#x27;m using sun screen and Cerave.</li>
<li> The only issue is the plate that holds the lights becomes loose</li>
<li> Using this on my face is somewhat drying for the first week but after one month I started to notice a subtle change in the appearance of my jowls and naso-labial folds.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have noticed improvement on areas around the mouth.  Fine lines and smile lines are less visible. Also, a general tightening of the face.</li>
    <li> Does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes very long time tho&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it WORKS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get it if you can afford it</li>
    <li> Another product that is a miracle if you use it. Had a baby quasar &amp; thought it was the bomb! After 3 yrs the cord stopped working, &amp; couldn&#x27;t get a replacement. Saw this new larger model. Simply amazing! This is another product that you use &amp; don&#x27;t realize the dramatic improvement until you forget to use it for a few weeks. Then it hits you, OMG! Need to start up again. Cannot be without! What a value when you consider how much it costs for a few treatments at the doctors office.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a while until I wrote a review so I could see if it was effective or not. I knew it would be effective because I own an original Baby Quasar - I just didn&#x27;t know if the claims of only using one pass instead of two because of stronger LED would be true.&lt;br /&gt;Well - Yes it is! This makes it far more easy to actually keep up a routine of using it 3 times per week. I&#x27;m 52 and it does make a difference in the my fine eye lines nasal labial folds. It does have to be used regularly though. The one draw back for me is that I have a small face and high cheekbones and the large surface of the head makes it a little difficult to go over my cheekbones without some of the light escaping. I probably should have gone with the smaller Baby Quasar MD Plus. Regardless - the company makes a great product that actually does what it says.</li>
    <li> I love this product I am religious about using it &amp; my my skin texture looks great. Also use to have occasional breakouts i still do but it is very minimal if at all. I would recommend this. I also use on my neck area as well. Only drawback is the high price tag.</li>
    <li> I am using it and it really works , it came exactly as it says and it work perfectly, I really love it.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  At first I used it only on my face, but it can be used on all types of problems.  Using this on my face is somewhat drying for the first week but after one month I started to notice a subtle change in the appearance of my jowls and naso-labial folds.  I have been using it for 5 times a week for 3 months now and definitely notice an overall improvement (tightening) of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have been a sufferer of psoriasis for most of my life and recently started using this treatment on areas/patches that generally get treated with steroids.  Since I can’t use steroids for an extended period of time because they stop working after a week or so, I alternate using this device with steroid treatment.  I have noticed that I can go for about a month using this treatment, followed by of few days of steroids and my skin actually is starting to look normal again.  It is a slow process, but after 1 month I noticed that patches stopped itching and slowly started to improve.  It’s been about three months and my skin looks good enough for me to wear short sleeves and not worry about spots on my elbows scaring people off.&lt;br /&gt;I also had an ache on my knees from biking and used this treatment.  It didn’t stop the pain, but made it a dull ache.  After a few days of using this treatment, I’m back on my bike again.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> have used this product for about two months and already notice diminished fine periorbital and periocular fine lines; skin looks brighter and more refreshed</li>
    <li> Well this is nothing new, red light therapy etc. It&#x27;s just gaining popularity now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this product, the quality is very good. The feel of this device is great, even the packaging and carry kit, cord is braided, case is padded with soft touch material etc. But I don&#x27;t see how this could possibly cost so much. For 24 LED lights this is absurd, typically LED bulbs like the ones used here are about 50 cent each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on building a U shaped LED board with the same combination and wavelengths of these lights plus some blue as well. I could probably get over 200 LEDs for each 100 $, so I&#x27;ll probably make a billboard, and still not approach the drastic cost of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clearly overpriced, but if you want it because it&#x27;s Quasar, well who&#x27;s stopping you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Clear Rayz and cheaper plastic ones without the handle are a better buy, mind you, still significantly overpriced, for just 42 or so 3mm LEDs, but you get both red and blue in one device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been way more handy, and for  this price, if there was a select-able turn timer at the top, on the sides of the power button. And the power button should have emitted a sound when pressed, different from that of when the 3 minutes has ended. I frequently think I have it on, because I repeat the same spot several times. It could be a simple dial which would have increments of 3, 5, 7, 10 minutes and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect drastic results too soon either, it takes a while, months, before you see improvement. Any initial wow is most likely the result of increased blood flow to the skin from the warmth of the light. Increased collagen isn&#x27;t going to happen quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this unit.  You can feel your skin tightening. Instructions say 8 weeks daily 2c full results.  Ladies; this device, Retin A, &amp; Needler can give you professional results at fraction of cost.  I&#x27;ll write follow up to tell results @ 8wks</li>
    <li> Best $650 I ever paid for a product.  Been using it for a little over two months and even my boyfriend noticed that my face looks brighter, less saggy and more youthful.  I use it for 18 min 5 days a week after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> This works!  You DO have to be very persistent in using it regularly (and patient with the amount of time per session), but I&#x27;ve received unsolicited compliments and requests to borrow it.</li>
    <li> Boshit , I dont feel anything at all in fact the old baby quasar feel more hot to this new expensive piece of sh...&lt;br /&gt;if you really want to see a difference go to a doctor office for a real laser</li>
    <li> I love when something works and this really does work.  Since I began using it there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Not only can I see it but others can too.  I have had many people tell me that I look fantastic.  The creams that come with it are awesome too.  I use another cream called Vivite&#x27; and the combo is fantastic.  I saw results very quickly and I have pretty tough Italian skin.  I would recommend the investment to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love my Quasar MD Plus! My face feels so refreshed after I use it. Feel  younger and glowing. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;The Quasar MD Plus has reduced my wrinkles!  Friends want to know what I am doing and I tell them about my Quasar MD Plus!</li>
    <li> love the product but doesn&#x27;t stay lit have to keep working at it... albeit, take longer to get the job done... at such a high price it should work with out any problems...</li>
    <li> My wife loved it since day 1</li>
    <li> I had the old baby quasar which is a quality product. (Still working after 6 years) . But it was so time consuming. Bigger and more powerful got my attention. Also my most problem area are my eyes. I am tired of botox and fillers so I took the plunge. So far so good. It has been almost 2 weeks and I definitely like my skin better. Wrinkles are fading! I&#x27;m 43 with lots of sun damage and fair thin skin. I find that my face looks plumper in general which is odd. I&#x27;m hoping for a more lifted look in the future. Even my lips are plumper. I use it about 5 days a week and it takes about 28 mins. The only issue is the plate that holds the lights becomes loose and I have to put it back into place. It bugs me because of the price of the device. I don&#x27;t want to return it because I don&#x27;t want to be without this thing!!:)  My skin is changing for sure. I look better in photos. I hope to stay away from botox and fillers. It has been over a year for fillers and 6 months for botox. I am also taking hyaluronic acid supplements</li>
    <li> I used this according to directions for 30 days hoping to see some results, any results.  It dried out my skin &amp; did not make any improvements whatsoever.  I was using it primarily around my mouth area.  I am 46 and have slight to moderate nasal labial creases I was hoping to improve.  The dryness made them look worse!  I have no eye area wrinkle problems so I didn&#x27;t use it there.  I did not keep using it longer than the 30 days because my skin was only getting worse &amp; I had to make a decision as to whether I was returning it (within Amazon&#x27;s 30 day policy) or not.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks about 3 days a week. I have noticed around my eyes to have less crows feet. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Took less than a week to show a change in the most effected area. This product is worth every cent.</li>
    <li> seeing subtle results, have only been using 2 weeks is a pain  to use do I have to do this for the rest of my life</li>
    <li> i bought this after using the LIGHTSTIM for a year and not really liking the results. after the FIRST week of using this at nighttime while watching TV - my skin is noticably lighter and almost perfect. this little machine is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;i have nicole kidman skin. porcelain white yet patches of red and sun spots. i am an AVID sunscreen user. i will not even go in the sun without lathering it on. TOTAL BLOCK is the sunscreen that i use that is formulated to be the strongest sunscreen on the market. i&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really has protected my skin from the damaging rays of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;anyway.....if you want to make your skin REMARKABLLY smoother and clearer this investment is totally worth it. my fine lines are lessening and overall the texture of my skin is smoother and LIGHTER.&lt;br /&gt;it IS an investment, however, it is certainly worth the amount. i just cannot get over how much brighter and lighter my skin looks. this thing is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> After using for 6months+ I see little improvement.  I had called several times and spoke each time with representatives of the product and each time they explained &amp;#34;due to my current age, 60yrs+&amp;#34; it would not accomplish best results.  Explained further that I should have started sooner (50yrs+) to get better results.  Thought comments strange as the video displays woman using product and she appears to be near my age, possibly older.  Also, the connection cord after using for 6 months+ has become loose, not staying firmly in place, I am going to try to contact company to see if they can send replacement, especially in light of how costly this unit is compared to others on the market.  I had done quite a bit of research to reach my decision to purchase Quasar MD Plus, as it appeared to excel over others, of course, most costly of the units over competitors! If considering and you are of age 50yrs or less, possibly a good choice based on comments by representatives of Quasar MD Plus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this device for about a month and I hate to say it, but this works.  I have been an avid outdoorsman for years and well my skin has taken a beating.  My wife got me this device to help with my redness and my lines and both have really gotten better.  Well if the younger girls start lookin at me then something must be working.  If it works for this old guy it will work for anyone.</li>
    <li> I buy this device for several reasons first II have no time to go every week to a dermatologist office to do a procedure, second i dont want to spend a thousend dollars In a treatment that I all ready kwon you only see efect several month after the treatment. This is very safe easy to used device Ican tbring it whit me when I travel, and finally I only have a month using this but I can see a diference Im my pictures, becaused I take a before ( a month a go ) picture and I can tell the difference, my only complain is that you have to spend like a half hour for the whole face , but I really like this !</li>
    <li> I had been using the Quasar MD (older model) and while i liked it, it did not drastically do anything for my wrinkles. I upgraded to the MD Plus model and once i figured out how to use it properly (the instructions are very vague and i had to contact the company for more information) it became part of my daily routine. I&#x27;d say it takes about 40 minutes to do your entire face. Its so worth the time and effort as i have been using it for a month now and have recently seen my frown lines soften and my nasolabial folds are reduced in fact my whole face looks refreshed and tighter. I have a botox and filler appointment next week which i honestly don&#x27;t think i need now and am probably going to cancel. I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit of review - 1/22/13 - I continue to see improvements using this device in my wrinkles, my nasolabial folds are almost gone and my frown lines are so slight now. I did end up canceling my botox and filler appointment since i no longer need it. This is by far the best beauty tool i&#x27;ve used and i&#x27;ve used many. I am not using any fancy products on my skin. I use the Quasar on washed bare skin, other than that i&#x27;m using sun screen and Cerave. I am now noticing better elasticity and bounce to my skin now. The results do take time, i am at the six week mark and use it every day. I am only now starting to see a reduction in the dynamic lines around my eyes. After eight weeks i am supposed to switch to maintenance and only use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit of review 9/7/2013 - I continue to use this device but not more than about 3 times per week. I did end up going to get Botox and Filler but I managed to go 7 months without the Botox as opposed to 3 or 4 and i needed one less syringe of Filler. I have not managed to get rid of the dynamic wrinkles around my eyes, but this device does not claim to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit of review 01/21/2014 - I wanted to add a couple of observations. Firstly I am still using the Quasar MDPlus about 4 times a week. I find that if i use it on my lips for three minutes until the beep sound about every other day it makes my lips look fuller and younger looking. I&#x27;m pretty sure if i stopped treating my lips altogether they&#x27;d eventually revert back to how they were before, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to treat them. I also use it all around my eyes, even the lid, and i feel it helps give me a more wide eyed look. I see the difference in photos from before using Quasar MD plus to after, in these mentioned areas. When I focus only on the eyes and mouth area it doesn&#x27;t take more than 15-20 minutes to treat. This is my minimal routine, when i have more time i treat my whole face.</li>
