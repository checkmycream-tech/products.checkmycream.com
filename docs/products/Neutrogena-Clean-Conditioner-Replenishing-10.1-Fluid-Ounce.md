      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>Great service. :-)</li>
      <li>This has a very light, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>and this really is a better price than at CVS since I can&#x27;t find it at Walmart!</li>
      <li>It is so smooth and smells great.</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked PERFECT.</li>
      <li>I like this product because I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Neutrogena products have kept my hair healthy into my 50&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love them both - not alot needed to do a fantastic job.  </li>
      <li>excellent quality and a pity</li>
      <li>so your hair feels nice and clean and full of body</li>
      <li>Like the shampoo, this conditioner is great, my hair is so soft and full after just one use.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner has been as good as any I&#x27;ve tried for making my hair feel soft and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>Hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Has not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Clean Conditoner rinses clean</li>
      <li>I never want to be without Clean.</li>
      <li>I gave this a shot and its just as good if not better than most luxury products (I am referencing Keratese Crystal Conditioner and Davines Love Potion Conditioner).</li>
      <li>and I thought if it&#x27;s good enough for her I would give it a try.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Amazon shopping for hair supplies seems counterintuitive, but it is quick and economical with Amazon prime.</li>
      <li>Don\\&quot;t be fooled because this conditioner is not expensive!  </li>
      <li>my hair stays soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>My hair feels fresh and hydrated right after using this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Very fast.</li>
      <li>Most recently used used the Triple Moisturzer from Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So why four stars, not five - I only give to truly outstanding products five stars.  </li>
      <li>The hair comes out clean and soft.</li>
      <li>It cost way to much on Amazon</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena people should have made this a much lighter product.</li>
      <li>A tiny amount massaged into my hair after shampooing immediately makes my hair smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for years and am very satisified with the product.</li>
      <li>First use of this particular product, but long time user of the Clean line.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Jennifer for the little card :-)</li>
      <li>A comb goes through it without a tangle, and once dry it is light and shiny.</li>
      <li>Costs way more than regular store bought conditioner, but works great on my coarse, thick, wavy white girl hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone just to try and see and at this price its not an investment.</li>
      <li>This company makes high quality products.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost every conditioner on the market and found that most are too rich and weigh my hair down or they don&#x27;t moisturize enough and left a rat&#x27;s nest out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>My purchase of these products on Amazon was largely due to the price and free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I started using this specifically because I&#x27;d run out of ideas for my super dry, flaky, itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the magic is, but it is certainly different from other conditioners.     </li>
      <li>and it makes my hair clean and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>Occasionally if I do not thoroughly rinse it, there is a heaviness that makes it hard for my hair to hold a style or curls, but once I realized that, I made a point to rinse a little better, and it does not give me that problem any more.</li>
      <li>and so far I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I told them I will purchase it again as it has made major changes in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the associated shampoo, but it can be a little harsh, and this conditioner seems to remedy that, without leaving all the residue I was trying to get rid of with the shampoo to begin with.</li>
      <li>It gets all the tangles out of my long thick hair and still rinses clean.</li>

<li> It is very hard to get out of the hair.  </li>

    <li> After years of tangled, lifeless hair, Neutrogena came as a welcome surprise. A tiny amount massaged into my hair after shampooing immediately makes my hair smooth and silky.  A comb goes through it without a tangle, and once dry it is light and shiny. I don&#x27;t know what the magic is, but it is certainly different from other conditioners.     I never want to be without Clean. It disappeared from my grocery store, and I went on a search that ended here.  Amazon shopping for hair supplies seems counterintuitive, but it is quick and economical with Amazon prime.</li>
    <li> As described, product met all expectations.  Quick shipping. Great Conditioner.</li>
    <li> GREAT ESPECIALLY IF WHEN YOU HAVE OILY - LONG - COLOR TREATED HAIR. JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY OILY - TANGLED HAIR.</li>
    <li> Don\\&quot;t be fooled because this conditioner is not expensive!  This is one of the best conditioners I have ever used and I have paid for some of the best!  Neutrogena Clean Conditoner rinses clean so your hair feels nice and clean and full of body and you only need to use the smallest amount.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every conditioner on the market and found that most are too rich and weigh my hair down or they don&#x27;t moisturize enough and left a rat&#x27;s nest out of my hair.  Of course the superexpensive (Fekkai) ones work great but I get tired of paying that much money all the time. I was very pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked PERFECT. My hair felt conditioned but it was not weighed down and it had some body. This has a very light, pleasant scent. I highly recommend this to anyone just to try and see and at this price its not an investment.</li>
    <li> After I came to America, I&#x27;d tried different brands of shampoos and conditioners, which deeply harm my hair.I was thinking I have to bought shampoos and conditioners from my home country. However, I tried this conditioner one year ago. It surprisingly works so well for me! It is so smooth and smells great. I love it!!</li>
    <li> This company makes high quality products. As I use the Neutrogena shampoo, I wanted to add  the matching conditioner. Has not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for going on 20 yrs. I don&#x27;t know why there is so much trouble finding it in a store. It gets all the tangles out of my long thick hair and still rinses clean. It cost way to much on Amazon but I will continued to purchase it when it is not available in the local stores.</li>
    <li> excellent quality and a pity it&#x27;s become so difficult to source. Fairly expensive, but lasts and lasts even with daily use. Prompt delivery in sensible packaging.</li>
    <li> Just got my products. Very fast. Very good packed. Tape, etc etc. I am very Happy. Not damage at all. Great service. :-) Thanks Jennifer for the little card :-)</li>
    <li> I ordered one bottle and got three. Darn!</li>
    <li> I used it twice and so far I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I have long curly dry hair and this conditioner gave it a softer feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I also like its smell which is not strong.</li>
    <li> The only conditioner I have used for over 10 years.  Neutrogena products have kept my hair healthy into my 50&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Costs way more than regular store bought conditioner, but works great on my coarse, thick, wavy white girl hair. I started using this specifically because I&#x27;d run out of ideas for my super dry, flaky, itchy scalp. This helps about as well as anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I put it heavily on my scalp and throughout the ends of my hair and I blow dry every time I wash and my hair stays soft and healthy. Good stuff and this really is a better price than at CVS since I can&#x27;t find it at Walmart!</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo, this conditioner is great, my hair is so soft and full after just one use.  I wish I could find it at local stores</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. My hair is chronically tangled and dry feeling (though oily at the scalp), and I have a hard time getting a brush through it after washing. This conditioner has been as good as any I&#x27;ve tried for making my hair feel soft and easy to brush.

    <li> Excellent, I would recommend it to everyone.  I have used it for years and am very satisified with the product.</li>
    <li> I am sorry that this product was not as I expected.  It is very hard to get out of the hair.  After using it, my hair still feels clingy.  I really do not like it at all.  I have gone back to another conditioner that I have.  The Neutrogena people should have made this a much lighter product. Too bad that they don &#x27;t make a conditioner that you can leave in.&lt;br /&gt;G. Dodd</li>
    <li> I was actually looking for a stop loss hair when I came across this conditioner and shampoo, even when these products aren´t  for the loss of hair, it worked, just having a healthier hair I could feel the difference and the loss hair has reduced.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever found.  Too bad they stopped making it!</li>
    <li> I like this product because I have very fine hair and it makes my hair clean and shiny without weighing it down. I had read in a magazine it was what Heidi Klum uses and I thought if it&#x27;s good enough for her I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> I brought this conditioner and the shampoo at the same time.  I love them both - not alot needed to do a fantastic job.  Several friends have also asked about it and I told them I will purchase it again as it has made major changes in my hair.  My purchase of these products on Amazon was largely due to the price and free shipping.  Try it, you will like it too.</li>
    <li> Hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> As someone who loves her hair a lot, but is tired of spending a small fortune on hair products- I gave this a shot and its just as good if not better than most luxury products (I am referencing Keratese Crystal Conditioner and Davines Love Potion Conditioner).</li>
    <li> My hair feels fresh and hydrated right after using this conditioner. But doesn&#x27;t last too long. My hair feels dry again before the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I used a tiny amount and it was satisfactory for detangling but still had the creamy feel of a conditioner. I prefer the spray detangler that was once part of this product line. Hope the manufacturer brings it back.</li>
    <li> First use of this particular product, but long time user of the Clean line.  Most recently used used the Triple Moisturzer from Neutrogena.  The hair comes out clean and soft. Can&#x27;t ask for much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why four stars, not five - I only give to truly outstanding products five stars.  This is very good and recommended.</li>
