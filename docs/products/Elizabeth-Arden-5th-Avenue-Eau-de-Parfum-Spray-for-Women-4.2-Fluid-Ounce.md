      <li>I would definitely return here to get more fragrances.</li>
      <li>It has good strength and longevity, so only a couple of sprays are necessary for the day.</li>
      <li>Not so strong as to be offensive, but with a definite scent.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, but it arrived more than half empty, it leaked during shipping.</li>
      <li>My regular perfume thats sweet and not overpowered.</li>
      <li>Classic scent I have been wearing since my teens (now in my 30&#x27;s).</li>
      <li>I look for offers to buy and have it in stock.</li>
      <li>was not able to find it in the stores,but was glad to find it online at such a low price.</li>
      <li>This huge bottle has lasted me years and hardly has a dent in it....</li>
