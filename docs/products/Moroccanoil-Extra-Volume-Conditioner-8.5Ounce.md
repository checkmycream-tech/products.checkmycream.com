      <li>(I&#x27;ve been in search of the best natural products.)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nothing is better than this.</li>

      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

      <li>conditioner is OK.  </li>
      <li>recommended by a friend and have enjoyed using it</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a luxury, and I love the results.</li>
      <li>However, this product showed up with many hairs stuck under the tape that is placed over the top of the bottle.</li>
      <li>but is well worth it!!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and is exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a non-believer when it comes to products for fine hair</li>
      <li>Works well for my fine hair....</li>
      <li>This makes my hair very soft and smell good.</li>
      <li>It really does give my hair a bit more oomph!</li>
      <li>If they were free of sulfates, phosphates &amp; parabens, why would they include chemicals that were found just as harmful?  </li>
      <li>Well it makes my hair feel soooooo good and soft and managable.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair (but a lot of it) and it was too much for my hair.  </li>
      <li>amazing volume and silky soft feel...</li>
      <li>Thanks. :)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just too much moisture for all but the more damaged of hairs.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty fine however, so maybe this would work for someone with thicker hair?  </li>
      <li>so I am willing to pick my battles when choosing products that are free of chemicals found to be harmful.  </li>
      <li>The extra volume kind doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but makes it soft and smooth and smell AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>But even after washing it out my hair still had an extremely strong smell - so much so that my boyfriend even commented on</li>
      <li>LOVE the smell of this product, it makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>I have thin fine hair and it works great.</li>
      <li>I think it would work better for women with natural straight hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells OUT OF THIS WORLD and is very, very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Asked a hair stylist what she thought about product and how it would work on my hair, natural curly, fine and shoulder length.  </li>
      <li>Evidently the shipped by air and there was product all in the bag.  </li>
      <li>:) The shampoo is equally awesome.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this certainly lived up to expectations.</li>
      <li>Good for thin hair, but the real selling point is the SMELL!!  </li>
      <li>(found to be very toxic &amp; damaging to the reproductive and endocrine systems)</li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Straight to the trash with this item.</li>
      <li>Beware this seller is not shipping the real product.</li>
      <li>It hydrates reasonably well, but does not volumize.  </li>
      <li>IT IS NOT THE REAL PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>Bought from them twice and real deal both times.</li>
      <li>second complaint is that upon reviewing the ingredients, I immediately saw names of toxic red-flag chemicals on top of the frangance - most notable: isopropyl alcohol, DMDM hydantoin, and D&amp;C Red 17, among others.</li>
      <li>While it didn&#x27;t make claims to be free of these ingredients, I find it unfortunate that products market themselves to seem free of the harmful chemicals when they really aren&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>It also makes my hair feel soft and tamable!</li>
      <li>Moroccan Extra Volume Conditioner does exactly what it says....</li>
      <li>My hair immediately felt silky soft and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with any tangles!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of thin (compared to the Aveda volumizing conditioner I normally use).  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and have problems with it looking limp.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, silky and frizz is gone.</li>
      <li>tried nearly every conditioner and mask on the product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even when rinsed out really, really well, it made my hair flat.  </li>
      <li>My scalp is very sensitive to products and so far, this is my third bottle, it hasn&#x27;t irritated it one bit.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner products are so fresh and clean-smelling, they really got my attention -- not easy to do these days!</li>
      <li>I will admit it is hard to find products that are completely fragance free</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of moroccanoil volumizing conditioner in general.</li>

<li> I am a big fan of moroccanoil volumizing conditioner in general.</li>
<li> I was looking for a product that both hydrated and conditioned, and this fell flat.  </li>
<li> Keeps hair soft and shinny without weighing it down.</li>
<li> Love the smell, but I have crazy frizzy curly hair and this just didn&#x27;t work for me personally.</li>
<li> it is obvious when you first use the product as it is thin and has a smell similar to paint thinner.</li>
<li> At first I thought it was a very small bottle</li>
<li> Wish I had bought and used this long time ago when I was looking at it, I waited about 1 1/2 years before trying it.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little more expensive...</li>
<li> and it def helps with the hour long process!</li>
<li> I use it about every other time I shampoo or only on days when I have events or meetings</li>
<li> It is very thin, and it leaves my hair super dry and can’t brush through.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, probably because consumers are only beginning to be aware of sulfates &amp; parabens, &amp; they can squeak by with the other ingredients.  </li>
<li> I have long hair that is fine (not to be confused with thin)</li>
<li> Nothing other compares to this conditioner but for the $30 price tag its ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Humectress by Nexus comes close but leaves the hair too greasy.&lt;br</li>
<li> In an attempt to save a little money, I keep trying other hair products....</li>
<li> I have previously bought this product in stores and decided to order it on line.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even need to use very much, less than a dime size for each.</li>
<li> It is weird but this particular conditioner does not condition.</li>
<li> It was a mess and lost some of the product.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s too expensive to use every day, especially for really long hair.  </li>
<li> It conditions without leaving my hair matted and heavy.</li>
<li> The next day my hair felt so limp and thin</li>

    <li> I have long hair that is fine (not to be confused with thin) and I have a lot of it. These 2 conditions usually mean tangles galore. I can condition 2-3 times with brands like Treseme and Pantene and still have horrible tangles throughout my hair, which are almost impossible to get out without tearing my hair out. With moroccan oil conditioner, this was not a problem. My hair immediately felt silky soft and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with any tangles! And I found the smell to be very pleasant. I tend to wash my hair every 2-3 days and this conditioner does well with that length of time. Overall, one of the best hair conditioners I have tried! It&#x27;s definitely part of my regular conditioner routine. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product but I thought it was expensive compared to other sellers.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft and shinny without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.  It adds a lot of body to my fine hair and smells wonderful.  I would definately recomment this product.</li>
    <li> In an attempt to save a little money, I keep trying other hair products.... then I return to Moroccan oil after I am disappointed once again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  I have previously bought this product in stores and decided to order it on line.  Evidently the shipped by air and there was product all in the bag.  It was a mess and lost some of the product.  That&#x27;s my only issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a non-believer when it comes to products for fine hair but this certainly lived up to expectations. It conditions without leaving my hair matted and heavy. I would recommend it to those with baby-fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of moroccanoil volumizing conditioner in general. When I bought this item I assumed it would be just like the all of the others I have purchased from Amazon. However, this product showed up with many hairs stuck under the tape that is placed over the top of the bottle. It looked like a man had shaved his beard on the tape and then wrapped the bottle with it. Straight to the trash with this item.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair and it works great. I have used for over and year and will not change</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love what it does to my hair.  My scalp is very sensitive to products and so far, this is my third bottle, it hasn&#x27;t irritated it one bit.  It really does give my hair a bit more oomph!</li>
    <li> Nothing other compares to this conditioner but for the $30 price tag its ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Humectress by Nexus comes close but leaves the hair too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously if you have blonde, chemically damaged hair this is life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried nearly every conditioner and mask on the product.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is better than this.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. IT IS NOT THE REAL PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.  The extra volume kind doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but makes it soft and smooth and smell AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought and used this long time ago when I was looking at it, I waited about 1 1/2 years before trying it.

    <li> I have used this product for 2 years and have loved it. Beware this seller is not shipping the real product. it is obvious when you first use the product as it is thin and has a smell similar to paint thinner.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and gets the tangles out of my daughters hair. I have color treated hair and she has curly hair. Works great for both of us. Leaves hair feeling silky.</li>
    <li> recommended by a friend and have enjoyed using it</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I had heard it was sulfate, phosphate &amp; paraben free, and heard it was good (I&#x27;ve been in search of the best natural products.) I was shocked by the overpowering fragrance when I first used it, and that I don&#x27;t remember seeing anything about it from others&#x27; reviews.  I will admit it is hard to find products that are completely fragance free (found to be very toxic &amp; damaging to the reproductive and endocrine systems) so I am willing to pick my battles when choosing products that are free of chemicals found to be harmful.  But even after washing it out my hair still had an extremely strong smell - so much so that my boyfriend even commented on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second complaint is that upon reviewing the ingredients, I immediately saw names of toxic red-flag chemicals on top of the frangance - most notable: isopropyl alcohol, DMDM hydantoin, and D&amp;C Red 17, among others.

If they were free of sulfates, phosphates &amp; parabens, why would they include chemicals that were found just as harmful?  Unfortunately, probably because consumers are only beginning to be aware of sulfates &amp; parabens, &amp; they can squeak by with the other ingredients.  I will be returning this and will continue to search.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I use, I have frizzy curly hair and always straighten it during Winter and it def helps with the hour long process! It also makes my hair feel soft and tamable!</li>
    <li> My hair is soft, silky and frizz is gone. I do alternate with Pureology every third shampoo, because I find my hair gets oily on the second day if I do not. However, I break this rule if I need a good hair day - it is guaranteed with this!</li>
    <li> It is weird but this particular conditioner does not condition. It is very thin, and it leaves my hair super dry and can’t brush through.</li>
    <li> Good for thin hair, but the real selling point is the SMELL!!  The sales rep was at my salon today and they were just starting to use it.  The shampoo and conditioner products are so fresh and clean-smelling, they really got my attention -- not easy to do these days!</li>
    <li> Moroccan Extra Volume Conditioner does exactly what it says....amazing volume and silky soft feel...I am always getting compliments on my hair and this stuff is a big reason why. :) The shampoo is equally awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little more expensive...but is well worth it!! Piece of advice....don&#x27;t buy from beauty salons or supply stores...the mark-ups are a rip off! Was packaged well &amp; received fast....very happy! Thanks. :)</li>
    <li> For friends and family who have everything, Moroccanoil products make a great gift.  I purchased several of the products and put a basket together for my sisters.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a very small bottle then I went to Aisha salon it was the same</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but I have crazy frizzy curly hair and this just didn&#x27;t work for me personally. I think it would work better for women with natural straight hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!  It smells amazing and is exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner.  I have gray hair and it makes my hair nice and smooth.  The shampoo is great too.</li>
    <li> Works well for my fine hair....plus, it has a lovely scent!</li>
    <li> I received a FAKE bottle of Moroccanoil Extra Volume Conditioner.  The bottle has Hebrew writing (not French) and it is clearly a fake (despite what the picture shows)  BUYERS BEWARE.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is colored and curly.  Works great for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells OUT OF THIS WORLD and is very, very moisturizing.  I have very fine hair (but a lot of it) and it was too much for my hair.  Even when rinsed out really, really well, it made my hair flat.  The next day my hair felt so limp and thin a pony tail elastic almost slipped out of it.  That being said, it did make my hair feel healthy and shiny but it&#x27;s just too much moisture for all but the more damaged of hairs.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and have problems with it looking limp. this product was good to add volume and shine</li>
    <li> This is one of the very best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used and for the price one of the best sellers!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair very soft and smell good. I love this product and wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn pricey.</li>
    <li> Bought from them twice and real deal both times.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell of this product, it makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Eh,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is OK.  It&#x27;s kind of thin (compared to the Aveda volumizing conditioner I normally use).  I was looking for a product that both hydrated and conditioned, and this fell flat.  It hydrates reasonably well, but does not volumize.  My hair is pretty fine however, so maybe this would work for someone with thicker hair?  Will stick with Aveda.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner but it&#x27;s too expensive to use every day, especially for really long hair.  I use it about every other time I shampoo or only on days when I have events or meetings planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a luxury, and I love the results.</li>
