      <li>These pins are magic.</li>
      <li>I use two of these at a time and just swirl my hair into a bun, put one in from the top, one from the bottom</li>
      <li>My sister owns them and love them.</li>
      <li>I need to experiment with them more.</li>

      <li>You will love your spin pins.</li>
      <li>And I have never been able to do an updo myself and get it to stay in place, no matter how many bobby pins I use.</li>
      <li>I wish you could purchase more than two per box.</li>
      <li>finally glad to find a product to use for an up-do.  </li>
      <li>I love these things I can&#x27;t wear my hair in a pony tail as i get headaches</li>
      <li>Regardless you could probably use even the shorter ones you would just need to use more of them.  </li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say if these are considered fashionable or how they&#x27;d do with more upscale styles</li>
      <li>sometimes, my hair will not hold pins or clips because it&#x27;s just too silky, so I would use more hair product to try to give my hair some texture for pins and clips to hold onto.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to get the 3-pack, because now I have a couple of extras in case</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve made buns at the nape of my neck, on the back of my head, and on the top of my head, and all of them stay perfectly in place with these</li>
      <li>and I decided I needed more.  </li>
      <li>I figured out the best technique by my second try.</li>
      <li>I love these pins.</li>
      <li>They secure my hair in a cute knot or bun better than a hair tie</li>
      <li>They are very comfortable and keep your hair secure.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping, great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>easy to use and easy to remove, do not rip or tear your hair.  </li>
      <li>downside is I lose them easily</li>
      <li>These pins are sooooooooooooooo easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It screws into your hair so easily and holds all day.  </li>
      <li>that she&#x27;s seen on more cool uses for it.</li>
      <li>So easy and quick to arrange a cute hair bun on the go here in sunny Ajijic, Mexico.</li>
      <li>Once in a bun I put spin one or two of the style spins through the bun until it is secure.</li>
      <li>I can even run and the bun holds securely.</li>
      <li>Fabulous.</li>
      <li>I put my hair in a ponytail and then braid it, wrap it up and secure it with these</li>
      <li>stays secure.</li>
      <li>NEVER pulls any hair, and keeps it in a comfortably secure bun for hours.  </li>
      <li>I really am that impressed with this simple product.</li>
      <li>The pins are easy to screw in and super easy to screw out as well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very innovative and for long hair it&#x27;s really effective .</li>
      <li>Ok, now to get them out, right?  </li>
      <li>Not painful and easy to take out or put in.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use</li>
      <li>These are easy to use right out of the box.  </li>
      <li>I used to just load my hair full of bobby pins, but not I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually slept with these in, with the bun almost on the top of my head - still secure, but comfortable!  </li>
      <li>However, although I feel better using that many to hold the bun securely, it is sometimes too easy to accidentally interlock two of them and that totally ruins either one or both of them every time.  </li>
      <li>These work much better than regular bobby pins, but for the price I need them to hold more of my hair in place.</li>
      <li>Smaller ones are better for thinner and/or shorter hair, longer pins are better for thicker and/or longer hair.  </li>
      <li>spin pins take a couple tries to get it right, but once you do, its amazing!  </li>
      <li>These pins go so smoothly in and out they really save my hair.</li>
      <li>With any of the different kind of elastic hair thingies I was redoing my hair 5+ times a day and with this one pin holds my hair up in a bun all day.</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
      <li>in an up-do!&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped right away.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and even with multiple hair ties</li>
      <li>(And yes, I used them right, first aiming them out of the bun and then twisting them around to tuck them into the bun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I left one bun in for two whole days and nights recently), but you can make a nice elegant bun with them too.</li>
      <li>they not only went in quickly and easily</li>
      <li>Says that its super easy to use, material feels solid and not flakey/floppy.</li>
      <li>And holds her hair/bun/style in place exactly like it says and</li>

    <li> I have extremely thick, long hair down to my mid back and these screws HOLD EVERYTHING! This is probably my FAVORITE hair accessory I have ever used in my ENTIRE LIFE! . It holds very well, easy to use and small to carry. Super fast shipping, great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using these &amp;#34;screws&amp;#34; for over a year now and they are STILL the best product to hold my hair. I prefer these over any other hair accessory. I can put my hair in a French twist and with two screws, it holds all day. This is no easy task as my hair is extremely thick. I can&#x27;t use a standard pony tail holder because I can&#x27;t wrap it around my pony tail twice to give you an idea. I have used these for just about every hair style there is and not only do they hold well, they don&#x27;t bend, rust or lose their coating. I gave one to my friend with shorter hair and they work just as well for her. If you are looking for the fastest and easiest way to hold your hair look no further!. I wish I found these sooner, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product but beware, these will rip your hair if you aren&#x27;t gentle. The points are very sharp.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long curly hair, and these pins hold it very securely.  easy to use and easy to remove, do not rip or tear your hair.  highly recommend.  they don&#x27;t dig into your scalp either.  finally glad to find a product to use for an up-do.  thanks, Goody!</li>
    <li> I like using these pins to hold my long curly hair in a bun because you don&#x27;t need to use a pony holder too.  They keep me from getting the ponytail headache and hold hair really well.  I used to just load my hair full of bobby pins, but not I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> Bought them for a friend because I like my blond ones so much.</li>
    <li> I rarely wear my hair in a bun, because it simply never stays. Hair ties fall out after a few hours, and the amount of bobby pins it takes to keep my hair up (is it even possible?) isn&#x27;t worth the effort. These are AMAZING. I was worried that they&#x27;d be difficult to use - not at all. I was worried that they would get tangled in my hair - not a chance. I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t work - but they do.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the idea of these, but they did not meet my needs for the hair styles that I usually use.  I need to experiment with them more.</li>
    <li> So much easier than bobby pins to hold up a bun.  It takes three to hold up my long hair, but my bun is so comfortable and stays up all day.  I can even run and the bun holds securely.</li>
    <li> I do not know how these things are not the HOT TOPIC in all women&#x27;s mags, female social circles, Facebook, twitter, etc.  I have very thick, coarse Asian/German hair and have a heck of a time managing it.  Ponytails can start to hurt my head eventually since I have to make them so tight to keep the hair in one place due to its weight and volume.  THESE THINGS ARE MAGIC.  I have hair that is down to my chest and when gathered is the equivalent of several ponytails of typical female hair.  I put a high bun in when I got these puppies- and it STAYED PUT.  No hair elastics, no product, no 100 regular bobby pins, no slipping of the elastics as bun loosens over the day- BUY THESE ASAP!!!! I used 4 in my bun, just be careful when unscrewing that you do it in the reverse order of how you put them in so that you don&#x27;t damage the spin pins or yourself.  I haven&#x27;t touched my hair since 7am and it&#x27;s past lunch- this has never happened before.  Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I have thick, long hair that falls close to-&#x3D; my tail bone.  As my hair has gotten longer, one hair tie isn&#x27;t enough anymore.  I have tried all sorts of hairstyles, but the weight of my hair cannot hold the style and causes the worst headaches possible.  I saw these spin pins online and decided to give it a try.  These pins are sooooooooooooooo easy to use.  It screws into your hair so easily and holds all day.  I wore my hair in a low bun yesterday using 6 spin pins (I wanted a super tight bun) and it held for 13+ hours.  The pins are easy to screw in and super easy to screw out as well.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about knots or tangles in my hair.  You screw the pin clockwise to put it in your hair and unscrew it counter-clockwise to take it out.  I also had all 6 pins in a variety of directions and still had no problems taking it out.  I highly recommend this product for use on all hair types.</li>
    <li> saw these babies on mirror mirror-had to have them. they are great. hold hair in place. no pulling or tugging. ouchless. stays secure. completely hidden. wont move like bobby pins. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I get headaches when I wear my hair up in ponytails for extended periods of time. These do help relieve the tension, but sometimes I need to switch up the height of the bun. They&#x27;re also a lot more efficient and effective at keeping a bun in place, when compared to bobby pins, or the hair donut.</li>
    <li> Living in FL with long hair (down below my waist) I keep it up in a bun most months. I used the goody classic claw clips until I was introduced to the Style Spin pins.  They often left me with headaches &amp; they didn&#x27;t last long breaking easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine introduced the style spins about two years ago &amp; I am thrilled with them.  They are easy to use (take a bit longer than the clips but only seconds), they do not pull on my hair so have not given me a headache one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used both the long pins (like the ones I&#x27;m reviewing) and the shorter pins.  Both work equally well.  Smaller ones are better for thinner and/or shorter hair, longer pins are better for thicker and/or longer hair.  Regardless you could probably use even the shorter ones you would just need to use more of them.  I have very long but thin hair &amp; use either two short ones or one long one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is I lose them easily and they are not easy to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Use:&lt;br /&gt;Personally I pull all my hair together like I&#x27;m going to put it in a high pony tail.  I then spin it until it is in a fairly tight twist, then spin it in a bun. Once in a bun I put spin one or two of the style spins through the bun until it is secure.</li>
    <li> My coworker gave me my first one and I decided I needed more.  My hair is long, thick and straight.  I work in manufacturing and need to have my hair secured well so I wear my hair in a bun a lot.  These hold the bun very securely and it holds all day without slipping.  With normal pony tail holders, they inevitably end up pulling some hairs out with it or holding it unevenly.  Tight buns hold securely pretty easily.  The spins even hold a loose bun without slipping for hours and my hair is long and thick enough that I can put it half up with these and not have it show.  I&#x27;m not exactly one of the cool kids so I can&#x27;t say if these are considered fashionable or how they&#x27;d do with more upscale styles but they are quite functional.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and a lot of it.  When I put it up, it has a lot of weight to it and often gives me a headache when I&#x27;ve had it up an hour or two.  I use two of these at a time and just swirl my hair into a bun, put one in from the top, one from the bottom and it stays put.  I don&#x27;t get any pulling or extra weight from the pins and no headache!  Wish I had found these ages ago, I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of hair-up heartache!  :)</li>
    <li> Fabulous. I have fine yet very long hair and I can&#x27;t afford to lose any! These pins go so smoothly in and out they really save my hair. I can even sleep with one if I place the bun and pin high enough on my head. So easy and quick to arrange a cute hair bun on the go here in sunny Ajijic, Mexico. I ordered several boxes even though I only need one pin at a time. I refuse to allow myself to run out.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, non-ethnic hair with a tendency towards breakage and split ends (not entirely sure if the hair in my drain is from failing out or breaking off!)  Hair ties and scrunchies always snag some of my hair every time I pull them out.  Even claws and twist bands aren&#x27;t gentle enough, or not good enough for activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These spin pins take a couple tries to get it right, but once you do, its amazing!  NEVER pulls any hair, and keeps it in a comfortably secure bun for hours.  I&#x27;ve actually slept with these in, with the bun almost on the top of my head - still secure, but comfortable!  This 3-pack on amazon is essentially giving you one for free.</li>
    <li> I have thick, shiny, slippery, waist length hair, and I like to keep it in a bun while working out and stuff. I got so sick of cheap plastic clips breaking, or of getting split ends from using elastic bands too much, and of having an awkward shaped bun sticking out of my head that eventually started to fall apart. These spin pins fixed it all. Not only do they stay in well (I left one bun in for two whole days and nights recently), but you can make a nice elegant bun with them too. I haven&#x27;t needed to use any more than three at a time either. I just wish they were a little cheaper cause I know I&#x27;ll loose them over time.</li>
    <li> Saw them on Amazon (we dont get these in Oz) and had them shipped over just to see what on earth the fuss was based on the reviews. Wife had no idea that I did it! She totally loves it and wants all the sizes now!! Says that its super easy to use, material feels solid and not flakey/floppy. And holds her hair/bun/style in place exactly like it says and there are heaps on videos on youtube that she&#x27;s seen on more cool uses for it. Am happy I bought them...!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, slippery hair that usually does not respond well to bobby pins.  Normal bobby pins slip right out and I lose my hair style.  These pins hold really well.  I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have hip-length, very thick, straight, slippery hair. It eats plastic claw lips for lunch, snaps hair sticks, explodes hair ties, wiggles out of metal U-pins, and, for the short time it stays in place, gives me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But spin pins work. I use three and my hair does not move until I take them out. It took a while to find the combination of pins and bun placement that would last and not give me a headache, but it was worth it. And...they don&#x27;t break!</li>
    <li> I avoided buying these because I thought they were dumb and probably would not work.  Boy was I wrong.  I can achieve any style I want with these pins and my hair does not move out of place.  I have Long, long, fine, delicate, straight hair but a lot of it.  sometimes, my hair will not hold pins or clips because it&#x27;s just too silky, so I would use more hair product to try to give my hair some texture for pins and clips to hold onto. With Spin Pins, just a few pins do the trick WITHOUT having to use any product in my hair, so my hair can just be straight and silky....in an up-do!&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped right away.</li>
    <li> I said that about a brush, I think these have changed my life even more.  I have waist length hair and I&amp;#34;m very lazy, it spends most of it&#x27;s time in a bun.  I have hair ties seeded pretty much everywhere I spend time, my house, my car, work, both purses, I am never without hair ties.  My hair is very fine and even with multiple hair ties the buns will almost always fall and I&amp;#34;m constantly redoing them causing weird bumps on my head.  These changed all of that.  I just twist my hair and screw these in and it holds, it&#x27;s like magic.  I can even sleep on it and when I wake up the bun is as intact as can be expected, no more getting hair caught at night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome.</li>
    <li> I never knew what to do with my long, straight, limp hair - or how to get it to hold. These pins are magic. Two in my bun and I have an effortless, professional style that holds all day (including my walking commute through the hills of San Fran). Plus they don&#x27;t tangle and take five seconds to twist in or out. I bought the 3-pack so I have two each to leave in my purse, car, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAGIC, I&#x27;M TELLING YOU</li>
    <li> These are easy to use right out of the box.  Just wind your hair up in a bun-like shape and spin them in like you&#x27;re opening a bottle of wine.  I have long medium-weight hair, so just about anything will hold it up, even a single bobby pin.  But what I like about these is that you can spin them in, making sure that you secure the lump to some strands of hair close to your head, and then use your fingers to loosen sections of your hair, so the bun&#x27;s as big and messy as you want it to be, while still *feeling* like it&#x27;s tight and secure and not going to come out.  It also makes the cutest tight-but-messy buns on people with thick shoulder-length hair.  My mom works on a farm and can use these and the wind will whip strands out, but the bun will still be intact at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love these things I can&#x27;t wear my hair in a pony tail as i get headaches but I can wear my hair in the loose bun using these and it holds all day and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. Super easy to use and they really hold. I wish you could purchase more than two per box.</li>
    <li> My first concern when I tried these spin pins was they were bound to get horribly tangled up in my waist length hair.  I gave them a shot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement they not only went in quickly and easily, they held the weight of my hair up securely all day long.  Ok, now to get them out, right?  I slowly unscrewed each pin (they screw in and out). not once in over 2 years has one become stuck in my  long and heavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone.  Probably the best and most serviceable hair \\&quot;appliance\\&quot; I have ever used.  I bought the big box from Amazon.  I cannot imagine being w/o them.  I&#x27;d be lost in the summertime as this hair has to be put up to survive the heat.  NOTHING I have tried for this purpose has ever served as well.  Guess I ought to go to work for Goody&#x27;s or something huh?  I really am that impressed with this simple product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love them.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome! Wish I had found them before. My daughter has VERY thick, pencil straight, and LONG hair. If we used babby pins, we use about 15 pins to keep a bun in (and that&#x27;s with a LOT of hair spray). Nothing holds her hair up, but we only have to use 2 of these spin pins to hold her hair up in a bun! And it stays very tight all day long, especially if you can get the two to lock into each other. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have long, very thick hair. My hair breaks heavy-duty ponytail holders regularly. My hair laughs at barrettes and clips. Every time I&#x27;ve had a professional updo for a formal event, the stylist has used multiple dozens of bobby pins to hold my hair in place. And I have never been able to do an updo myself and get it to stay in place, no matter how many bobby pins I use. My hair just spits them out, and the updo falls down. I&#x27;d even tried those Magic Grip curved plastic hairpins -- people claimed those held up long hair -- and if anything, they worked worse than regular bobby pins in my hair. (And yes, I used them right, first aiming them out of the bun and then twisting them around to tuck them into the bun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was skeptical when a friend recommended Spin Pins. I figured they would be another disappointment. But they are BRILLIANT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes four Spin Pins to hold my hair in a bun (the package instructions say to use two, but they&#x27;re written for people with normal amounts of hair). I literally just screw them into the bun so that they catch some of the hair that lies against my head, along with catching the bun itself. I figured out the best technique by my second try. I promise these aren&#x27;t complicated to use. The instructions have pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once they&#x27;re in, that bun stays until I take them out. I can walk, dance, shake my head around, and the bun will stay perfectly in place. I usually need to use a couple of bobby pins to tuck in a few stray ends here and there, but the Spin Pins hold the weight of my hair -- and believe me, my hair is heavy. I&#x27;ve made buns at the nape of my neck, on the back of my head, and on the top of my head, and all of them stay perfectly in place with these pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them regularly for probably a year now, and they haven&#x27;t bent or broken or anything, despite the large quantities of hair they are forced to hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t panic too much about interlocking them (despite the dire package warnings). With four Spin Pins in my hair, they can&#x27;t help but interlock a bit, but I have never had the slightest problem unscrewing them from my hair again. They also like to interlock in storage, but again, I&#x27;ve never had the slightest problem just unscrewing them from each other again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to get the 3-pack, because now I have a couple of extras in case I lose one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never been able to get bobby pins to hold your hair up properly, do give Spin Pins a try.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;behind&amp;#34; length hair that I almost always wear up. Bobby pins just don&#x27;t work for me. These really work to keep hair in place and I don&#x27;t have to walk around worrying my bun is going to fall out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think these would work on my hair, which is heavy, thick, and slippery since I am Asian.  It works like a charm.  The bun stays in place all day.</li>
    <li> I think my hair is too thick for this product. No matter what I do, my hair wont stay up in these things. I even went so far as to use 4 once, to no avail. It wasn&#x27;t a total waste though because they work beautifully on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Perfect for all this extra heat and humidity we have been having lately here in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> I love these! They hold my hair in a bun for daily use and easy to use.  I have also put them in a bun while at a theme park, going on rides, and at a water park and they held my hair really well.  Far better than any hair elastic, and a bunch of painful bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Love them! I gave one to my sister and she loves it too! I have really straight hair and it doesn&#x27;t slip!!</li>
    <li> Love these, great for holding hair in a bun, doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Items were shipped in new (packaging) condition!</li>
    <li> These take time Getting used to but cause no hair damage or pain. It&#x27;s very innovative and for long hair it&#x27;s really effective .</li>
    <li> LOVE. Great for buns, etc. Doesn&#x27;t matter how thin or thick your hair is.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! They stay in perfectly and they&#x27;re so easy to use! I wish they had started making these years ago!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went my whole life without knowing these existed. It can be a while to get the hang of how to put these in to hold all your hair up, but they are so handy.</li>
    <li> I knew this product throug the internet blog. I wondered how to use and how to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;It works good well. I am satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> Holds my thick hair in a bun! Amazed, as nothing I have used before this worked.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;medieval torture devices,&amp;#34; as my friends like to call them, are the BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME. I have long, thick hair, and elastics hurt my scalp, so it used to be I never wore my hair up. Enter these beautiful spin pins. Now I wear my hair up all the time, sometimes wearing the same bun for a few days in a row (because that&#x27;s how well these spin pins work!) without my scalp hurting. They easily hold my heavy hair up, so I can do hairstyles I never even considered before because bobby pins aren&#x27;t strong enough. I recommend these to every woman ever.</li>
    <li> I have very thick straight hair. These work much better than regular bobby pins, but for the price I need them to hold more of my hair in place. I use at least 6 at a time to hold my hair and still some will spill our before too long. My sister owns them and love them. Her hair is not as thick and has a slight wave to it.</li>
    <li> Me and my girls love these Goody Spin Pins!  They actually work great even with very thick and long hair.</li>
    <li> I Love Love Love these!!  We have to keep our hair above our shoulders where I work and I have long thin straight hair.  With any of the different kind of elastic hair thingies I was redoing my hair 5+ times a day and with this one pin holds my hair up in a bun all day.</li>
    <li> My hair a little beyond waist length and these are the ONLY thing that can keep all my hair up ALL day! I put my hair in a ponytail and then braid it, wrap it up and secure it with these and I have a 5 minute hairstyle that people think takes forever! I would be lost with out them and can&#x27;t remember what I did before these! Recommended to anyone with long hair that needs to be securely out of the way. Very simple to use as well.</li>
    <li> all worked out in the end, good product</li>
    <li> Love these for making a bun! Before finding these, I&#x27;ve always used hair ties to put my hair up in a bun. Unfortunately, sometimes hair times snap or don&#x27;t actually hold my bun correctly so it all ends up falling out. Not with these babies. They hold all day long without me having to readjust or redo my hair. Not painful and easy to take out or put in. Be careful when you screw them in that you don&#x27;t accidentally screw the two screws weirdly into each other, I made that mistake one time and totally ruined one of the screws since it opened up really really wide.</li>
    <li> I love these pins for my and my girls&#x27; waist length thick hair.  They work great to hold a bun - usually just use 3-4.  However, although I feel better using that many to hold the bun securely, it is sometimes too easy to accidentally interlock two of them and that totally ruins either one or both of them every time.  I have already thrown away several.</li>
    <li> These are great since they don&#x27;t leave kinks in your hair when you&#x27;re putting it up but want to take it down later. I have long hair and if I twist the bun right I can hold it with just one spin pin for a loose/tussled look. Expensive, but totally worth it. They don&#x27;t bend out of shape like bobby pins do, and they last a long time!</li>
    <li> These pins are great for holding your hair in a bun all day! They are very comfortable and keep your hair secure. I have long, very thick hair down to my waist and I use four of these. I also like to do &#x27;bunlets&#x27; (two smaller buns) and I use two in each. I have bought these before at another store, but lost them and needed replacements. The price on Amazon for six was close to what I had spent on four. These are the best! You will love your spin pins.</li>
    <li> These pins hold the hair well, but I have trouble getting them out.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair that&#x27;s very thick. I love my hair, but sometimes I just need it out of my face. I love these pins. They secure my hair in a cute knot or bun better than a hair tie can. I never have to re-do the up-do. I love these! They&#x27;re wayyy cheaper to get online then in store.</li>
