<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I did not see results the way the other positive reviewers did.</li>
<li> He bought it at Macys (or Nordstoms) for a ridiculous price, like $50 for that little bottle, so $20 or less feels like a steal.</li>
<li> I have had a few bouts or really bad adult acne.</li>
<li> I broke out horribly on my face, shoulders and chin after briefly taking steroids to treat bronchitis.</li>
<li> Desperate, I tried Amazon, and voila!</li>

    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s awesome and it&#x27;s difficult to fine in my area. It&#x27;s gentle, yet it does the job!!</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not a miracle solution for my acne, it did help reduce the size within a couple days. Works better for prevention I believe, but still is a great product.</li>

    <li> I purchased this from a local store, not Amazon, but I absolutely love it. It is fairly pricey compared to drug store acne treatments, but the results justify the price. Not only does this clear up breakouts, it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin - that is the best part about this product, to me. I have tried numerous products and while they may treat blemishes, they dry the heck out of my skin to the point where the dry skin looks worse than the pimple did. This does not do that. If you have severe acne, cystic or otherwise, this might not be the product for you, but for moderate and mild blemishes this product works great.</li>
    <li> very effective and not overly drying</li>
    <li> I have had a few bouts or really bad adult acne. I&#x27;ve tried more drug store brands than I can remember. After one day of using this stuff I already noticed my pimples etc were starting to go away. My husband is a fan of this stuff too.</li>
    <li> Works great for my stubborn skin</li>
    <li> Hard to know how effective this is cause I don&#x27;t get much acne but I like it!</li>
    <li> I love this philosophy spot treatment. It used to be called &amp;#34;On a clear day,&amp;#34; but it is still the same great stuff! Put some on a zit after washing your face and 1-3 days later it is gone.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I broke out horribly on my face, shoulders and chin after briefly taking steroids to treat bronchitis. My skin is typically good so I had no idea how to handle the outbreak. My guy remembered buying this product for himself a few years&#x27; back and we dug it up. My breakout was 50% better in a day and almost gone in 3 days. Amazing. He bought it at Macys (or Nordstoms) for a ridiculous price, like $50 for that little bottle, so $20 or less feels like a steal.</li>
    <li> WORKS, WORKS, WORKS!!!  No burning or peeling like ProAcitiv products!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different products for acne and so far am impressed with this one.  I don&#x27;t have severe acne but I seem to get a couple each week.  This doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and a little really goes a long way which is good because this bottle is TINY.  I have purchased 2 bottles and will continue to use this product.  Worth a try.  Stops breakouts if applied early enough.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Works fast and great! Arrived quickly as well. I use it together with clear days ahead face wash from Philosopy. They really work great together. My face has never looked better!</li>
    <li> This stuff totally ROCKS for zits. Nothing like it on the planet that I have tried. Put it on the problem at night, it has nearly disappeared in the morning! It was sold out at Ulta, and Philosophy online. Desperate, I tried Amazon, and voila! Found it! Pricey, but it will do until it reappears at the other stores.</li>
    <li> This is for my teen daughters. I don&#x27;t use it personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this would work on more serious breakouts. My girls just get a small occasional blemish so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m rating the product performance on.</li>
    <li> she says she likes it and notices a difference. I haven&#x27;t but I love the crap out of her anyway so I am not the best judge of that!</li>
    <li> I also buy this brand of Ance spot treatment and I&#x27;m never disappointed. It works great for my type of skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Item just as described, Awsome</li>
    <li> Love this whole line, helped clear up my skin fast and made my skin feel noticeably softer and smoother, would recommend.</li>
