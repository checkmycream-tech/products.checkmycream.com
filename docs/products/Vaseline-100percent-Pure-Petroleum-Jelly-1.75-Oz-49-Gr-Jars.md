    <li> I use this for two things. One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover. I have tried like fifteen different eye makeup removers and this is the only one my eyes can tolerate long term. Others make my eyelids (top and bottom) red, dry/scaly and unbearably itchy after prolonged use. But not this. I take a dab, massage it onto my eyelids, let sit for a few seconds, take a baby wipe and wipe clean. And to be honest it takes everything off quickly without any harsh rubbing unlike a lot of eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> very happy, excellent</li>
    <li> Small containers are handy in every room!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a kid! Vaseline is great for so many things. Dry skin, chapped lips, minor cuts and scraps. I use this as a makeup remover, on my lips and as an overnight foot mask. I put this on my feet after my shower at night, put on a pair of sock and my feet stay super soft and smooth the next day! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This version of a famously good product can be hard to find in local pharmacies or super markets.  It&#x27;s a useful size, small enough to meet air-travel restrictions but not as ridiculously tiny as smallest version.</li>
    <li> This is one of the more delicious jellies on the market.  Conveniently packaged in snack sizes, these are great for the on-the-go mom or workaholic. Or toss one in your kid&#x27;s lunch box when you&#x27;re in a rush.  You&#x27;ll be surprised at his or her reaction!  Thick, viscous, and oh so satisfying.  Virtually NO CALORIES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this unique jelly is a versatile product.  I&#x27;d like to see grape jelly heal wounds as well as petroleum jelly.  Good for the skin, good for burns and wounds, good for slicking your hair back.  Plus, if you have anal itching, rashes,or hemmorhoids, you&#x27;re not going to find another jelly as soothing as petroleum jelly.  Cherry is a bit too tart for this application.  Grape is prone to give you sugar rushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, petroleum jelly brings out the best in you!  Peanut butter and jelly have NEVER tasted this NEW!  And minor scrapes and bruises--bye bye boob boos!  Need an ingredient to slather onto your favorite biscuits or maybe pancakes?  I give you petroleum JELLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My jellies arrived packaged well, fresh, and in great condition.  Good vendor.</li>
    <li> My feet skin was a little dry so I bought this Vaseline,after I use it for nearly 1 week ,I found my skin came back to moist. I like it because it&#x27;s not oil and probably can use anywhere external on my body .</li>
    <li> Jars smaller than expected but figuring ounces or grams is not my thing. This size works for me and cheaper than Wal-Mart. Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some cancer surgeries and this stuff really takes away the scars.  I use it on all my problem skin areas.  It&#x27;s been around forever for a good reason.  I works</li>
    <li> Vaseline brand has been around a long time and is very versatile in its uses.  It can be used for protection of skin, lips, nose, etc, without worry about extra additives which can irritate.  I use it a LOT for my nose to help keep it clear.  This requires multiple light applications.  For me, it beats dosing with antihistamines.  However, I did not realize how small these 1.75 oz containers were.  I just wanted smaller than the 13 oz as I keep a container with me in the living room, bedroom and by the computer and the 13 oz is a little big for small drawers. I know there must be something in between 1.75 ounce and 13 ounce but I missed this.</li>
    <li> This is a great size for my elderly, sight-impaired mother-in-law to keep on her table in assisted living.  She is able to open it even with severely arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> This is the standard Vaseline. I like the cap which stays attached to the container so you don&#x27;t lose it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize they were small bottles but that was my mistake not the sellers.</li>
    <li> miniture in size for the price you don&#x27;t get much vaseline</li>
    <li> I used vaseline since years ago. Good product</li>
    <li> This is old-fashioned pure petroleum jelly available in most local stores. Affordably priced for all, it soothes minor cuts and burns, can be used for dry skin, as eye-make-up remover and moisturizer. Before expensive cosmetics were invented, petroleum jelly was the all-round beauty product and moisturizer for average families. It has no fragrance or artificial color.</li>
    <li> We use this to prevent diaper rash with our little one.  The flip cap makes it easy to open one-handed and this size is perfect for tossing in the diaper bag.</li>
    <li> This is the Vaseline we use for our baby&#x27;s butt since she was born and it is just fine. No more, no less than what we expect. I am not sure this is the cheapest price out there, but I love the convenience of Amazon Prime. A six pack will cover us for a good year if not longer.</li>
