<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have pretty damaged frizzy hair and this Keratin infusion really helps smooth it out.  Use it with heat stying of some sort to make it work its best.  Hair really comes out nicely.</li>
    <li> This newer version of the Keratin Infusion doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the original formula.  My hair is not as silky as it was with the previous version.</li>
    <li> I have tried it too.  I like how my hair stays soft and it takes less time to blow dry.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work - but it did not work for me as I still have frizzy hair in Florida.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and my hair is dry, wavy underneath, and frizzy when the humidity rises. I color my hair, which doesn&#x27;t help matters.  ;  I don&#x27;t use a straightening iron on my hair, and didn&#x27;t do so with this product as other women have.  I used my ionic hairdryer.  Perhaps I would have received better results with a flatiron, but I don&#x27;t want to put my hair through any more than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for the sleek, straight look that many others enjoyed from this product, but unfortunately did not get that.  It was good in the sense that my hair was obviously less frizzy, and a little straighter than normal, so I gave it 3 stars for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a Youtube video of before and after photos.  Just visit Youtube and type in &#x27;Review - Keratin Complex Infusion.  It is under &#x27;MissTutor5&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, buying my 2nd bottle. Makes my curly wavy hair straighter, healthy and shiny,  my hair was looking damaged before I tried this and now it looks great.</li>
    <li> Wow... this has to be the BEST product I have ever used on my hair - and I have tried soooo many.  I used it on my beyond fried bleach blonde (that I box bleach 2x a month) hair and I can&#x27;t tell you how amazing it looks and feels.  I highly highly recommend this product to anybody! I have very long thick hair and I use much more then the instructions call for but no matter how much I use I never have that greasy overdone look, just flawless beautiful shiny hair :)</li>
    <li> I use this product because it helps keep my hair straight.</li>
    <li> I would like to express my satisfaction with the product and the buyer. Great price and fast shipping. Thank you..</li>
    <li> I have thick, dark, fine, but frizzy hair (probably too much blow drying and flat ironing).  I use the Coppola Keratin Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner and this product.  Both have played a role in restoring a healthy shine to my hair.  I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement.  Others have commented on this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Greatly reduced frizz&lt;br /&gt;- Has not affected my hair color&lt;br /&gt;- Restored shine to hair&lt;br /&gt;- Wonderful styling product for straightening my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If I don&#x27;t shampoo the second day and flat iron to touch up, it loses its fragrance and smells somewhat unpleasant&lt;br /&gt;- Gets expensive since I have thick, past shoulder length hair and it takes 10 - 12 pumps to cover all of it sufficiently&lt;br /&gt;- If I apply too much it weighs down my hair and makes it look and feel greasy (not really a CON about the product, just a note)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note this is NOT that for me, this is not just a conditioner, but specifically works well for straightening and flat ironing.  In the amount I use it weighs down my hair, which is what I wanted .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, on my 3rd or 4th bottle.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy hair that is totally unmanageable. I read in several magazines that the Coppola Keratin Complex Infusion serum would help. I have tried everything, CHI, Biosilk, Graham Webb, Redken Smooth Down,Biondi, Kiehls, you name it. If someone said \\&quot;straight hair\\&quot; I was right there buying it! So, no big surprise I jumped right on this stuff. I can tell you I have finally found the \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; of hair straighteners. My hair is now straight with a nice wave where it should be, it feels incredible, swingy, shiny, just fabulous. FINALLY!! I would completely recommend this, with no hesitation. It IS expensive (about $38) but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work but it made my hair dry and left no shine at all after using.  I&#x27;ve had the salon treatment done with this brand and it was awesome.  I was hoping that this product would be enough instead of going back for the full treatment.  Guess I was wrong.  I was a bit surprised with so many rave reviews.  Something to consider, there is no return if you try it and don&#x27;t like it, just so you know.</li>
    <li> Keratin infusion smells nice and feels nice in my hair. Works well whether you finger it thru or flat iron afterwards.  Bottle lasts a long time to cause u dont need to use it everyday</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to order this from anyone but the manufacturer (Coppola--[..]), be very careful. I ordered a 3.4 oz bottle from [..], the same company that also happens to be supplying it above. Not only was the product PINK instead of white as shown, but the pump did not work. Even though the seal on the top of the bottle was intact, I HIGHLY suspect that the bottle was opened from the bottom and refilled with a cheap substitute.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a salon in the past and loved it. It was a fair price here so I ordered 2 bottles. One was fine but the other was runny and watery. It was NOT the cream like the original. Total rip off.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the product pictured above. It is not the product I paid for. I have been using Coppola products for over a year and I suspect that the product they sent me is a knockoff. The bottle I received was made of a cheap white plastic and the cream inside was darker than the original, and did not smell or feel the same. I compared the product I received to one of the bottles that I bought at my salon. The ingredients listed on the (white) bottle I received are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the ingredients listed on the authentic Coppola product. Buyer beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a complete list of the ingredients printed on the two products (verbatim). Note the stark differences in the main ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients listed on the (white) bottle I received:  Water, Hydrolized Keratin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cyamopsis, Tetragonoloba Gum (Guar Gum). Glyceryl Cocoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methicone. Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolized wheat protein, Glycerine, Echinacea Purpurea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis Extract, Parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients listed on the authentic Coppola product: Water, Cationic Guar Gum, Cetereal Alcohol, Cyclodimethicone-Dimethicone, Dow Corning, 2078 Fluid, Keratin Protein complex extract, glycerine, glyceral monococoate, soy protein oil, wheat protein, Aminopropyl phenyl trimethicone, Arnica extract, scent.</li>
    <li> Dispenses conveniently.  Great for after keratin straightening.  (I couldn&#x27;t make it through the summertime without it!)  A bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> With this product I definitely see an improvement in my hair. It&#x27;s shinier and not frizzy with the horrible humidity!!</li>
    <li> Not sure, can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle!!!  It won&#x27;t come out and the bottle is tough and not squeezable. I was able to get a small amount out with a knife.  Also, the directions are so small that even with reading glasses I can&#x27;t read them.  I&#x27;m not sure if I used enough or used it correctly.  I saw no difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when my hairstylist used it on my hair. I wanted to purchase it immediately. She told me she could order it for me and the cost would be $40. I ordered the exact same product for less from Amazon. The Keratin Complex Infusion makes my hair softer, shinier, and look healthier. My hair is also less frizzy which is saying a lot because I live in high-humidity Texas!</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up for Coppola Keratin Infusion[[ASIN:B001S3I57S Coppola Keratin Infusion, 3.4 Ounce]].  As I age my hair has become drier and drier.  I had tried many commercial products and had just about given up.  I was amazed with the result after using it on my wet hair for the first time.  With continued use, my dry hair looks better and better.  I found that between washings I can run a wet comb through my hair and restyle it easily.  This stuff works.  Thanx.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair silky - but it&#x27;s expensive&lt;br /&gt;I think it feels nicer than Silk, which I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> I love Keratin Complex. It makes my hair very soft, style-able, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. It works really well with my ceramic round brush, and helps my hair hold the style and makes it SO smooth and shiny. The only thing I would point out is that I already have oily hair, and with this product...although it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel oily the day I wash it, I usually feel like it&#x27;s a bit more oily on the 2nd day than it is without the product. This is a VERY small thing to work with given how much i LOVE what it does for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used to condition the hair...I am on my second bottle...it lasts a long time.  I&lt;br /&gt;use it before blowdrying and it really conditions and protects the hair without any oily or sticky residue.</li>
    <li> This is a great problem solver.  My mid back hair is healthier and stronger than it has been in years.  At 60, my hair is as beautiful as it was in my 20&#x27;s.  you can&#x27;t go wrong!.</li>
    <li> Smooth, silky and so soft!!! love this product! Excellent finishing touch after using the Keratin shampoo.Smooths out my frizzy thick hair&gt; highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I liked this item and the price was better at Amazon. It smells good too! Nice for frizz in humid weather.</li>
    <li> The item delivered is not the same as the picture .... I received a white bottle. Still 3.4 fl oz Keratin Complex infusion therapy from coppola. I gave it a shot and I like the smell and the feel of my hair..i didn&#x27;t add any extra sheen or spray--left as it after straightening. Good for hair that uses a lot of heat (dyer/flat iron). Use sparingly, not much needed. Should last a very long time. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase this particular keratin product after this trial.</li>
    <li> Suddenly, at 43, my hair started looking frizzy and dull ...like middle-aged hair.  Yuck. I&#x27;ve been thinking of getting the keratin treatment but started using this stuff a few days ago, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to bother now.  My hair looks like it used to.  It smoothed out the frizzies, added shine and more of a richness to the color.  I&#x27;m actually really surprised how well it works.  I went ahead and picked up the Coppola conditioner and shampoo and they all work great together so far.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for frizzy hair. I have been using this stuff for several years now. I wouldnt trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> this product does everything its supposed to. which is incredible because it&#x27;s so inexpensive. my hair, which has always been crazy and unmanagable, is super tame...especially after applying it over a few days after blow drying. no crazy frizz, tangles, and fly-aways. YES!</li>
    <li> I have very fine and curly hair. As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has gotten pretty frizzy and it takes a lot of effort to dry it straight w/o the frizz and I noticed the extra heat was really damaging my hair in spite of protective products. My hair stylist recommended this for me (Keratin Complex Infusion keratin replenisher) and after 7 mos. of using it, I still LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I think I use more than the recommended amount (I double up in my frizzier and damaged area) and it still doesn&#x27;t weigh my very fine hair down. Also, I am able to blow it dry much much faster, even on warm heat (vs. hot) so am using less heat for a shorter time. It&#x27;s win win!! The next day, I use a little bit again while I hit it w/the dryer and it freshens my hair w/o another shampoo, and also keeping it soft. If you have fine hair, you know how hard that is to do! Also, I am just now finishing my first 3.4 oz bottle, 7 mos. later!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, curly hair.  My main concern is to lock the humidity and moisture out.  This product does help some but is not the instant fix I was so hoping for.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product &amp; have used for years! However, this bottle contained thick product which was difficult to pump out &amp; apply. :(</li>
    <li> This product really does it for me, i swear. Its creamy without the feel of greasiness, it disappears in the strands as if you never put on any product. Leaves my hair so shiny, FRIZZ-FREE, healthy. It even transforms my hair when I go to bed with hair still damp, I wake up with hair so messy and flat, I just put this on and blow dry and its perfect, great bounce with my hair staying in place. I love, love, love this product so much.</li>
    <li> I love this product. However, it arrived with the pump not working. Since the product is thick, I have to use a chopstickto get the lotion out.  It&#x27;s been awhile since I ordered it, otherwise I would send it back for an exchange.</li>
    <li> Product came broken in 1/2.</li>
    <li> bought this to help prolong effects of salon keratin treatment.  it works alright.  i have used products that worked just as well for much less money.  the one advantage over other products; my hair is much softer then usual.</li>
    <li> just like the salon, only less expensive through amazon.  great after saltwater and chlorine.  will definitely purchase again!  makes your hair look and feel healthy and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it tames my dry frizzy hair without making it look greasy. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was the lowest price I found on this amazing product.  I&#x27;ve been using Keratin Complex Infusion for over a year, and paying $40/bottle, so $25/bottle is a great deal!  Shipping time was excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Brazilian treatment and use this product after shampoo my hair. It&#x27;s work great! Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this infusion</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchase of Keratin Complex Infusion. Shipped quickly and arrived intacted.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item... it doesnot work as said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother and when they went applied it, there were no sign that it had been apply... this does nothing!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed...the pump would not work because the product was thickened.  I have tried the keratin infusion before and it should have been a smooth, creamy consistency. It makes me wonder how long the stuff was sitting on a shelf!</li>
    <li> It protects your hair from the blow dryer or hot iron, fixes the split ends of your hair, it makes it much softer I really think this is an excellent product I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I never write reviews for products even if I am a little unhappy, but this product is not Keratin infusion! I have purchased the Keratin Infusion from my salon every other time that I have purchased it. I read the reviews for this seller and thought ok, I&#x27;ll try it, REAL Keratin Infusion is expensive, why not save a little. The consistency is completely different, the smell is off, the coloring is similar but not the same. I am disappointed the Amazon is not a little bit more strict about who they allow to sell on their site. This is absolute not the real deal!!!!! Save your money and get it from your salon! DO NOT BUY! A complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever!!!!  Have a lot of curl in my hair and this product has made it so easy to dry straight and cut my drying time in half.</li>
    <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
    <li> The stylist who does my Brazilian Blowout recommended and sold this to me.  Ordering through Amazon saved me almost half the price paid in the salon.  I use on dry hair before using flat iron and find it smoothes my hair without making it look greasy.  I also sometimes use it to just tame hair when I don&#x27;t have time to use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have coarse curly hair and it is very thick...This product makes it look like \\&quot;real\\&quot; hair(my husband&#x27;s words). I put this on and then flat iron my hair, and I now am able to wear my hair in styles I never have before. Love It!!</li>
    <li> My wife tried this product upon the advice of her hairdresser, who used it on her hair and then sold her a can too.  She loves it.  The Amazon price was NOT a significant discount from what the hairdresser sold it to her for, but it saved a few bucks and some time.  After using this product just a few times her hair, which was thin and brittle, was very noticeably thicker and had more body and sheen.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Always love this stuff. Keeps my hair silky straight and shiny. Keeps my ends from splitting. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I live in Miami, land of humidity.  I&#x27;ve had the Brazilian twice.  Not only does this extend the life of this expensive treatment, but my family has found we really don&#x27;t need the treatments anymore.  Our hair is small and perfect and we are out the door in no time with no more bad hair days!  Best of all no heavy, greasy feel.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to help smooth out the frizzy in my hair. I used it before I dried my hair.</li>
    <li> The product is terrific but the packaging is very poorly designed.  I returned it because the only way to get the product out would have been to find something that could scoop it out.  The pump did not work.  I tried this from another place and returned it for the same reason.</li>
    <li> Not Coppola. Was advertised as it when I bought it, did not compare. When I wrote to them they told me the packaging had changed. Right, because I&#x27;m that stupid that I can&#x27;t read an ingredient list to see the difference, or see the value of the product. There is no comparison to the Coppola product as far as what it claims to do, far inferior product. Not the same. Wouldn&#x27;t have bought a weak knock off for this much if I knew!! Terrible company</li>
    <li> This product seem to be almost diluted. The strength of it is very poor and is not the same as the last time I ordered.</li>
    <li> I love this infusion. When I get keratin treatments this is my favorite hair remedy! Shine and takes away and frizz. Yay!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and did not get the product described. It is not a Copolla product. Very disappointed that it is not as advertised and that I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed when I used this product, as it doesnt do much for my hair at all. Im bi-racial with long, somewhat thick hair, and Ive been getting keratin treatments for almost two years. I purchased this product, in hope that it would replace my original hair serum since it was a keratin product. The product says you dont need much for one use, yet two pumps of this and its barely enough to rub through your entire hair, and its very thick and pasty. This product sells for $40 in the store, so i figured i would give it a try especially with the pricing on amazon. Beware, it will lighten your color as well. It adds no shine whatsoever. The only reason i continue to use it is because it has keratin in it, so im sure it has some benefit to helping roots/ends, after a couple of uses it slightly softens hair, and of course i dont want to waste my money so i will use it until its gone. This product is a no-go. Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> You only need one to two pumps because a little goes a long way.  This product really keeps my hair smooth and soft.  Love it!</li>
    <li> great product came in exactly as described</li>
    <li> I have an issue with the distributor of this product, not the product itself. The pump was broken in the bottle when I took it out of the packaging to use the very first time. I twisted off the top and there was a clear break in the pump. Keratin is pretty solid so there&#x27;s no shaking the product out of the bottle. Right now I&#x27;ve had some luck using a chopstick to get some out so I can use it, but I will  not buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> The product is the best investment for my hair, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner for best results. This product smells great and a little goes a long way. I will use this after I have washed my hair and when it is dry to tame fly-aways. The creme itself is pinkish in color but don&#x27;t worry that doesn&#x27;t show up in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and Quick shipment! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Best keratin product out there.  My hair is very curly and coarse, this makes it smooth and shiny.  Very good!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to keep my keratin treated hair lasting as long as possible, so I bought this to try. You put a dollop through your hair after washing and style with it in...keeps my hair silky soft and shiny. It was expensive but the bottle will last a long time since you don&#x27;t need to use very much!&lt;br /&gt;Love it and will continue to purchase and use all the Coppola Keratin products &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this product -- I have big bushy hair and it helps immensely ….</li>
    <li> Very good product. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;You will be glad you tried it. Good price. It makes your hair soft.</li>
    <li> Had an express keratin treatment and using this to help extend the length of time the treatment will last.  This is a great product if you have had the treatment.</li>
    <li> I love the product--have used it for years, however, I have now had to return four bottles over the six weeks due to a faulty manufacturing detail.  The stem or straw that is attached to the pump that draws the product up out of the bottle is missing.  Warning to purchasers who have ordered or plan to order be sure to immediately unscrew the lid and check to see if the stem is intact.  After the 3rd defective bottle, I called Amazon to let them know that they had a bad lot and they immediately took down their supply off the website.  So I decided to order from another distributor expecting that they likely would not have the same defective lot.  Imagine my surprise to discover the exact same problem.  It looks like someone cut the stem off with scissors or something.  Anyway, I now believe that Keratin has a much bigger recall issue on their hands.  It&#x27;s a shame &#x27;cause I really like the product.  One thought--if you still have your old bottle, save the lid and pump and you can always use it should you wind up with one of the defective bottles.</li>
    <li> I use it with every blow dry. Really extends the keratin treatment  actually works well without the keratin. Not too heavy or sticky. Nice shine too&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars but I have had a couple of issues with the pump and had to send for a replacement, but the product itself is excellent. A little goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to this product, and we both love it.  I ordered for her as well as for myself.  It keeps my frizzy hair manageable.</li>
    <li> Coppola Keratin Infusion is a great hair product, very pleased with this hair product, bought 5 bottles, it makes dried hair soft, healthy and shiny, my hair was looking damaged due to coloring, tried it and now it looks soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  This is an excellent product for those who have regular keratin treatments and color treatments to their hair.</li>
    <li> excellent product for protecting hair when blow-drying and styling color-treated or permed hair.</li>
    <li> Counterfiet. The pump doesn&#x27;t work, so I unscrew the top to find the pump is attached to nothing. No small tube that would normally extend down into the product.. making the pump functional! Then the color is wrong. I was just at my hair salon &amp; they used the product on my hair and it should be nearly rust-colored... this is pink. I am so angry right now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product!  Couple it with the IntenseRx and you have a great recipe for extending your keratin treatment!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> i see a difference using this.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice texture and smell in the hair, I recommend it</li>
    <li> I have purchased this identical item from this site in the past, and was shocked when I recieved this imitiation product.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it NOT coppola, it is a poor attempt at a fake!  BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and much less expensive then from the salon</li>
    <li> Coppola Keratin makes my hair super soft, smells great, and you only have to use a tiny bit so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years.  First bought from my stylist, then at a local grocery store.  This product does not seem the same as the others I&#x27;ve purchased.  The color is different and the consistency doesn&#x27;t feel the same.  Not as thick or creamy.  It&#x27;s ok, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Guess I&#x27;ll go back to the local store to purchase.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, this is a knock-off being advertised as Coppola.  If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, go ahead and try it.  If it does, stay away.  Definitely make sure you are paying a significant discount for it being a knock-off.  The product does not work as well as Coppola.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but the darn pump never works for me.  I always take the entire cap off to get the product out.  They need to come up with a better system.  But, good product.</li>
    <li> I received this product the other day and was very disappointed to see that it wasn&#x27;t from Coppola. I have ordered this product before and the packaging was different. I understand that packaging change but that&#x27;s not the case here. Nowhere in the bottle does the brand Coppola show which leads to believe that it&#x27;s not the same. Also, I have used it twice and it has made my hair look oily and sticky. Will not be ordering from here again</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I love this stuff. Or helps make my keratin treatments last and my hair much easier to style.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair product...I use it all the time...</li>
    <li> I have bren using this product for a while.  Like it a lot</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and my coworkers thought I got a Brazilian blowout. It made my hair soft and compliant and it lasted for a few days. The salon sold it for double what I paid for it through Amazon. Works for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be needing more soon</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair. I recently had the Keratin straightening treatment done on my hair so I now use this product everyday. It works great. It makes my hair soft and really helps to prevents frizz. I used it before the Keratin treatment and I liked it then, but now it works even better!</li>
    <li> I had ordered the Coppola Keratin Infusion 3.4 ounce and when I received the product it was not from Coppola.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for a couple of months and my fizzy curly damaged hair has never looked better. Yes I still have to blow dry it straight but then  it is straight and shiny without also having to additionally use a flat iron as i did in the past. Yes it will still fizzy up in humidity but not nearly as bad. By far the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I used to have very unmanageable hair: it was thick and frizzy.  It would take an hour to straighten and then 10 mins of walking outside in humid air would ruin it!  Then I found out about Keratin and started using it.  At first I was really amazed at how well it worked.  My hair was much easier to straighten and stayed straight even when it rained.  However, after a few months of continuous use I noticed my hair was getting thinner. I stopped using it because I missed having volume to my hair.  Even after stopping 6 months ago my hair has not gone back to normal.  I started doing research and saw a bunch of posts about girls who got the keratin hair treatment who started going bald afterwards.  I&#x27;m starting to worry that the damage done is irreversible, but I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t continue now that I&#x27;ve stopped.  All I can say is I would take my old hair, frizz and all, over worrying about slowly going bald.</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase I have made of this product. I love the actual product. It does what it is supposed to. However, the 3.4 ounce bottle I received recently does not dispense the keratin. The tube is missing from the bottle and the product will not come out. I wish there were another way to get satisfaction other than settling for a partial refund and paying shipping twice. It&#x27;s not worth it to return the product even though it is mostly unusable or at least, very difficult to use. Please make certain the packaging is correct on this keratin product. I won&#x27;t order from this source again.</li>
    <li> I wasted mu money on this, this product is not for tropical hair</li>
    <li> If you are wanting the Coppola brand of Keratin Infusion Therapy, like what is pictured, then DON&#x27;T order this.  You will receive some other brand.  I don&#x27;t dare even try this.  So disappointed!! If I could give 0 stars I would!</li>
    <li> It is a little pricey and did not noticed any significant difference. It does have a nice texture and smell,.</li>
    <li> Two things... my wife purchased this from House of Beauty Inc, (Philadelphia, PA) and received a product that was NOT Coppola Keratin -- it was some kind of substitute - didn&#x27;t have the same color or smell and the pump didn&#x27;t work (even if it was the right product).  We contacted the House of Beauty three times via email to request a return authorization and that was two weeks ago -- no response.  We finally contacted the credit card company which to refund our money. We&#x27;d be happy to still return the &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; -- but buyers beware...</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price.</li>
    <li> I love keratin treatment, great especially for natural hair like mine. I suggest getting it professionally done first so you know how to apply this product.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse thick curly hair. i had the coppola keratin relaxing system done about 2 weeks ago. When i washed my hair for the first time I found that I still had to work as hard on my hair then prior to the treatment. My salon suggested this product to me. I must say that it is the best hair straightening product I have ever used, (and believe me I have tried them all). My drying time was shorter, and my hair came out straight, shiny and so soft. I think this is an excellent price  for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product,and I find it leaves my hair soft and shiny..I have had the coppola treatment and it prolongs the treatment.. Linda</li>
    <li> I have tried many products out there that claim to leave hair frizz-free, but this is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve tried that works consistently, 100% of the time. Even the other products that have keratin in it, such as &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27;, etc., don&#x27;t have the correct formulation for me. And this one doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue or a filmy build-up, but it keeps the ends and edges smooth, soft, and touchable. I use the Intense RX treatment after shampooing (once a week), and use just a little Infusion every day in-between. I hope this company continues to make this product and it stays on amazon.com, because I can&#x27;t even buy it in the stores around here. A must-have for anyone with relaxed, color-treated, or just plain hard-to-manage hair.</li>
    <li> Executive Summary: This stuff is better than chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard how good this was, and wanted to try it. I trust Amazon, but was concerned about reviewers who complained that the white 3.4 ounce bottle that they received was some kind of knock-off product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to order the one stocked &amp; shipped by Amazon, as I expect they get it direct from the manufacturer. It is a few dollars more than the least expensive one for sale out of all the vendors listed as selling it (you&#x27;ll see them all in the section that shows all vendors offering it new or used). In my mind, it assured authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the authentic product, which happens to come in a white dispenser. It may be that only the 1.7 ounce dispenser is pink and the larger 3.4 ounce dispenser is white. The product itself is that pink color that appears in pictures of the smaller bottle, and the ingredients match those of the authentic product. Plus, you just can&#x27;t fake results this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is transformative and, since you can use it on both wet hair and dry hair, women who wash their hair every few days can get extra benefits every day by taking a little bit, rubbing it in your hands, and running them through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hair (long, blonde, dry, brittle and colored) seriously looks and behaves like someone else&#x27;s hair (lush, healthy, gorgeous).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 years and it does a great job.  I tried other sulfate free styling creams for my keratin treated hair such as Loreal and Burt Bees but they left my hair crunchy and stiff.  The cost of the product is worth, less expensive that a retail store purchase such as Ulta.</li>
    <li> Excellent product  and service from supplier</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair shines. It does not frizz. It maintains my Keratin blowout which is 7 months old looking like it was just done. I would use it even if I did not have a blowout.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair a lovely shine.  Be careful not to use too much.  I have fine, dry hair and this product is a winner for me.  I&#x27;d purchased some from my beautician at a much higher cost.  This does the trick.</li>
    <li> Coppola Keratin Infusion, 3&lt;br /&gt;Great product to use inbetween for styling - switching between Intense RX Ionic Kerating Protein Restructuring ... if using dry heat for styling.&lt;br /&gt;Order through AMAZON was proceesed promptly / packed well - delivery prompt. Thank you..</li>
    <li> I have used all sorts of products and I must say that this product beats all the rest in the Keratin leave in category. My hair is smoother, shiny and freeze was reduced by 70%. They only drawback is the pump design, they did not make the suction long enough to pull through the product, thank goodness that you can open the cap and pour out the lotion.</li>
    <li> I use 4 pumps for my thick, should-length hair. It makes styling my hair using the blow-dryer more effective so I use the straightening iron much less than I used to. Leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin, gets a bit frizzy and a lot fly away.  I had a keratin conditioner treatment at the hairdresser that really seemed to work until it washed out after a few shampoos. So I thought this might do the same thing and I can do it at home.  I seems to work great. I put it onto my dry hair and ran wet fingers through it, did a bit of blow dry and brush to lift a bit.  Was perfect, my hair fell into place with no frizzies or flying all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels good and it smells good.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> The Keratin Complex line of products have helped my gray, overprocessed hair feel and look healthy more than others I have used. I got a Coppola keratin treatment a few months back, and have been using their shampoo, conditioner, and infusion keratin replenisher. They have helped the initial, expensive keratin treatment last a long time. The shampoo and conditioner are expensive, but I only need one pump of each to wash and condition my hair, which is medium-long length, and the first set I bought of the big bottles lasted me over five months, and I wash my hair every day. My hair is softer, smoother, easier to dry and style, and the split ends are dramatically improved, allowing me to grow my hair longer than I used to.</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on all the positive reviews. I havent noticed much as of yet. I have thick curly hair and not sure how much to apply. I will keep using, at least to finish this bottle, and see what happens</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My hair dresser recommended this for my damaged hair. What&#x27;s especially great is that it works both when hair is damp (as a heat protectant &amp; conditioner adding Keratin) AND you can smooth it daily on to dry hair;  it is one of several things that has improved the condition of my hair.  Price is the best available that I&#x27;ve found (&amp; worth it). Shipping prompt, packaging perfect. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff just wish it was bigger and cheaper. My hair was frizz free after rain and that never happens</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before, I&#x27;. ve been using it for a couple of years. It does what it says. I wouldn&#x27;y hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and you only need to use about 2 pumps for long hair for the product to work. It keep my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
    <li> The Coppola Keratin line is probably one of the best keratin lines out there.  They are pricey, but worth every penny.  I have naturally straight/wavy hair...which means it looks stringy and frizzy if I don&#x27;t style it.  My hair is rather thick and long, so I use about the size of a nickel to achieve maximum coverage.  Unlike other creams on the market, this one actually cuts down on the dyer time and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film feeling on your hair.  If you can get past the price, it will become one of your best investments for your hair.</li>
    <li> This did not seem like the same Keratin Complex Infusion product used at Visible Changes.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product from Amazon in the fall and it was exactly as described.  And I loved it.  It made my hair very soft and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;Then in April I purchased it again, but this time from CLLof Beauty.  I received some imitation that looked and smelled like the original, but it was NOT Coppola.  I tried it anyway just to see if it worked the same, but it did not.  It made my hair look greasy and it was still frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;So again, the Coppola Keratin Infusion was great.  Just be weary of who you purchase it from!!</li>
    <li> The product I received in the mail was NOT the Coppola brand!!! It is in the same container, but the label is different and it does not say &amp;#34;Coppola&amp;#34; on it anywhere. This just seems wrong and like false advertising!</li>
    <li> Love this Keratin product!  It keeps the treatment in my hair longer and makes it shinier and easier to handle....</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works reliably to keep my hair smooth.  I used to buy from my hairdresser, but she changed product lines so thought I would buy here.  The packaging is the same, the product works the same and I a have happy hair again.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while and so far it&#x27;s working, leaves my hair smooth (have curly hair). Some people mentioned it has a smell to it, but I did not find that with this product. I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I found this product a bit to heavy and a bit sticky for my choice. I did like the amazing sheen it gives to my hair but because I like light products, it wont be my next choice.</li>
    <li> I have a salon Keratin Straightening treatment.  This stuff is an absolute must.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for hair and beauty products &amp; have tried just about everything out there to improve my 43 yr old, long highlighted hair that&#x27;s been abused from years of blow driers &amp; straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Coppolla Keratin Express Blowdry &amp; was very happy w/the result.  Smoother/younger hair....So, I went ahead and bought the Coppolla Keratin Blonde Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that was recommended, and also liked it.&lt;br /&gt;On a Coppolla roll, I went ahead &amp; purchased the Coppola Keratin Infusion, but just wasnt wowed.  Maybe my hair was maxed out on keratin due to recent treatment &amp; was just looking &amp; feeling as good as it possibly could, so there was no work left for the Infustion to do.... I dont know, but I just didnt like it.  It&#x27;s pink &amp; has a slightly thin, tooth paste like texture, that I didnt like at all.  I like the &#x27;slip&#x27; feel of silicone or preferably oil on my hair to make it feel smooth &amp; soft, which i just didnt get with the Infusion product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it another shot, but the directions suggested using a straightener to &#x27;cook&#x27; it in, but the whole reason I got a Keratin Express treatment was so that I wouldnt have to spend 30 min blow drying &amp; straigtening my hair...?  My hair didnt look or feel any smoother or shinier after using it.....  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I adore just about the entire line of Keratin Complex products, but I just can&#x27;t feel the love for this one.  I see no difference in my hair after use---as a matter of fact, my hair feels tacky/sticky and a little dry.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a keratin treatment or anything and takes quite a bit of work to get my hair smooth. It still gets frizzy, but, smells really nice.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever!  Coppola Keratin works to nourish your hair. Only a small amount is needed every several days. Do not over use. I have tried other products from time to time but have always been disappointed. This product you notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I have very curly dry frizzy hair, Keratin Infusion does a great job smoothing and defrizzing my hair. I use it after I wash and towel dry my hair, if it is a very humid day I use a little more after I blow dry my hair and before I use the flat iron. Keratin Infusion keeps my hair smooth and frizz free for 2 to 3 days with an occasional quick flat iron the second or third day. (It may take a couple of uses before you find the right amount to use for your hair. I have shoulder length hair and 8 pumps work well for me.) I have been using Keratin Infusion for about 2 months and will continue to buy this item. I am also planning on trying the shampoo and conditioner when my current bottles are empty. I find that usually if you use more than one product from a line the results are even greater. Would definately say to give it a try if you have frizzy unruley hair it works for me!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product. I use on damp hair, then when dried and ironed, my hair looks relaxed, smooth, and shiny. Highly recommend. Especially for hair straightening</li>
    <li> this is awesome for your hair and sooo much cheaper than buying it at the salon.  will bring damaged, treated, dry, etc. hair back from the grave</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I bought at a very popular salon and paid 45.00 for it. Twice the price I paid for it here. Besides that it makes you hair so soft and manageable and you only need a few pumps. I like the shine it gives my hair too.</li>
    <li> Not Authentic Product!  This should be removed by Amazon - Bait and Switch!  Look at the 4th picture - says made by COPOMON ENTERPRISES.</li>
    <li> I use this on my Keratin treated hair about once a month as a booster.  This is the product that the salon used that initially did the treatment and I have followed through.  After using it I can tell it has been infused and looks and feel healthier.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have Keratin treated hair and this helps to prolong the effects of my (expensive!) Keratin treatments.  I also used it before getting Keratin treatments and it worked great at controlling frizz - kind of like a mini treatment!  For reference my hair is unique - I have (white girl) curly hair but it is very fine/soft curly hair, most people (regardless of ethnicity) with curly hair have more coarser texture to their hair.  I feel like the fine/soft hair gets crazy frizz faster than those with a little more weight to their hair - this product really helps with that and I would guess that my fine hair responds more to this product than courser hair would - expensive but well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is one of greatest products I use on my hair after its washed and conditioned. A DAB of this goes a long way and will cause your hair to turn too greasy and oily too soon.. ,like most oils one needs to keep down the frizzies</li>
    <li> This is great for short hair where you want a Keratin look but don&#x27;t want to get a full treatment!</li>
    <li> This product does not work as advertised and furthermore, the pump mechanism to get it out of the container is shoddy.  I am throwing it out.</li>
    <li> I use this product once a week and it really does a nice job!  Would recommend to anyone to get rid of frizz.</li>
    <li> It does give the hair the soft feel but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to clear up a misunderstanding.  I did not buy from this person, but I did buy this product from a company and I received a white bottle with hydrolyzed keratin listed in the ingredients and the ingredients seemed to be all out of order and totally wrong.  So I did a little research and even called Coppola.  They did change the ingredients listed on the bottle and the bottle is now white.  Just thought you might appreciate this info.  I do plan on buying from this seller in the future when my supply runs out.  They have very good prices and this product is amazing!!  ;)</li>
    <li> I was so exited by the positive reviews so even if it&#x27;s expensive I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately when I tried it, I didn&#x27;t see any smoothing effect on my hair (blond and thin).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past couple of years and would not go without it. Whether I have had a keratin treatment or express blowout or neither, it keeps my hair healthy and feeling soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else that makes my hair look better.  This really tames hair and makes it look silky.</li>
    <li> Best product for colored, dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the one product you should use if no other to prolong your expensive keratin treatment. Helped mine last from May to September!!</li>
    <li> It is great!!! love this product</li>
    <li> the pump mechanism was broke upon receipt.</li>
    <li> I get my Coppola Keratin smoothing treatment done every 3-6 months and LOVE what it does for my naturally curly hair. I thought that this product would be just as good seeing as it was made by the same company. I thought it would help make my keratin treatment last a bit longer when I am nearing the end of my 3 months but unfortunately I felt like it does quite the opposite. I feel it makes my hair very snarly and almost dry. I can&#x27;t explain exactly what it does but it makes it more difficult to straighten and it starts to flake the next day. When I stopped using this product the majority of my issues were resolved. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again especially for this price.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! This stuff is AMAZING! i just bleached my hair and had to go in for a color correction and it has been dyed several times and I was so sad that my ends were all gooey and i couldnt run my fingers through my hair. I have been working on growing my hair out for over a year now and I thought I would definitely have to cut some of it. I ran over to Target and got a little bottle of this stuff hoping that it might smooth some of the damage. That was yesterday afternoon. This morning MY HAIR FEELS LIKE THERE WAS NEVER ANY DAMAGE AT ALL!!! i have used plenty of products and nothing has worked so well. I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT! ITS A MUST FOR EXTREMELY DRY DAMAGED HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered from a reputed seller cz I knew that it would definitely deliver me the original product. I searched online for the reviews. The product could be good or bad but here the first issue is authenticity of a low priced product. So, I decided to buy from the seller, \\&quot;Salons Best\\&quot;. It&#x27;s my first purchase from the seller and I trust it completely now. Contrary to other reviews, the container was authentic and so was the content inside. The container, which is a high quality sturdy one, matched exactly to the one I purchased earlier at high price. What else can I say? Other than this, the product works how it is supposed to. Gives you smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free advice for online purchasing: Since I have, many a time, purchased the products from the original company at high prices, I know from the packaging to the composition of product and the magic I should expect. I order my hair products from these online sellers frequently for low price. Here is a small list but I hope it would help: Salons Best (I ordered Coppola Keratin Infusion, 3.4 Ounce), Pandorabeauty (I ordered Keratin Complex by Coppola Smoothing Treatment 8 oz and Brazilian Blowout Acai Protective Thermal Straightening Balm 8 oz) and fragrancenet.com (I bought several packs of Loreal intensive repair masque. If you directly shop from this site, you get 20% off or free shipping when you cruise around for coupons.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free Advice for smoothening treatments (3 years of personal experience):&lt;br /&gt;1)Original Cuppola&#x27;s smoothening treatment (8 oz for $125 from pandorabeauty.com: Good for 2-3 applications, but only if you use using an application brush) lasts for 3 months nicely with this regiment and using this infusion treatment (3.4 oz $17-$34: Good for only one application) makes it last longer for about 2 more months. Cuppola&#x27;s Infusion is not a substitute for original smoothening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) For application of either of the two products: Take the hair in parts and apply the product from root to tip using an application brush. Make sure you have applied to all strands. Use two mirrors facing each other for keeping a steady eye on hair on back.  Always use the hair-straightener at 450 deg temp for the correct application of the smoothening product. At any cost do not wet/style your hair for 3 days. To undo sweat effects, straighten/blow dry your hair again as soon as u can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for maintaining smoothening results: Every time after your hair wash(with an anti-frizz shampoo only(Acai or Cuppola or Loreal or Wella):&lt;br /&gt;1) Use a hair masque (Wella&#x27;s/Loreal&#x27;s intensive repair masque (16 oz: $35 on fragrancenet.com. you apply double the amount u do for Acai/Cuppola) or Brazilian Blowout Acai Deep Conditioning Masque (8 oz: $34) or an equivalent Cuppola product, all cost between $30-$35, use the websites I listed above for buying) and leave the generous application of the same on wet hair (from root to tip) for 20-40 minutes before rinsing it off. Do not leave the masque for on hair for more than 90 minutes even if over-enthusiastic blowout acai people ask you to leave overnight. Do not use conditioner, it isn&#x27;t good for hair while a mask works wonders for fragile hair/damaged hair. A mask nourishes your hair and gives your hair the flow it never had.&lt;br /&gt;2) Dry your hair with a good hair dryer. For hair drying and styling, I trust Conair&#x27;s Infiniti Tourmaline Ceramic Ionic Styler (213GB Model Number: Original cost: $40, costs $38.69 on Amazon and $30 on Ebay.). It inherently has ionic function that shoos away the frizz. Also if you dry your hair using it&#x27;s hair straightening method, you need not use a hair straightener. Natural drying is a big no no for smoothened hair. You&#x27;d always remain crabby about frizz in damp environment.&lt;br /&gt;3) For using hair straightener or hair dryer, always apply a small amount of Thermal Protective Hair Balm (Brazilian Blowout Acai Protective Thermal Straightening Balm ($18 on Pandorabeauty.net) or Professional Sebastian Taming Elixir (easily available at CVC pharmacy big bottle for $19, feel free to find competitive prices online. Also I bought a small bottle of Sebastian&#x27;s taming elixir that lasted 6 months, so u need not buy a big bottle for this)) onto your wet hair. Just take a small amount in the center of your palm, spread it on palms and gently apply on all hair length wise at once much away from scalp using both your hands. Caution: Avoid balm&#x27;s application on dirty hair(even one day after wash), it would clog anything it finds and would make your hair brittle and trigger rapid hair fall problem.&lt;br /&gt;4) Use hair serum (of any good company: usually a small bottle is sufficient, costs around $10) on wet hair for magical silky look (everytime after wash). Some caution: Do not apply it on dry hair, it would make your hair look slick while the same application on damp hair (before drying/styling) would give shine and silky touch. Also avoid serum&#x27;s application on scalp, it&#x27;s the main reason for unstoppable rapid hair fall. Again the method of application and the tcautions are the same as above: Just take a small amount, spread it on palms and gently apply on all hair length wise at once much away from scalp using both your hands. Avoid serum&#x27;s application on dirty/dry/sweaty hair(even one day after wash), it would clog anything it finds and would make your hair brittle and trigger rapid hair fall problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, soak your hair thoroughly with water, use antifrizz shampoo sparingly on all hair. take small amount, spead on palms and work through length gently, cleanse ur scalp too (gently). It generally doesn&#x27;t produce any lather. Rinse it off. Apply masque on all hair generously and leave for 20-40 minutes. Then rinse it off gently from hair and nicely not vigorously from scalp. it will leave a soapy feeling on hair, which is what we want.  Use thermal balm sparingly (on hair only; no root/scalp) on wet hair, spread nicely. Use hair dryer and bring hair to medium damp level, then apply hair serum sparingly and spread through hair (on hair only; no root/scalp). Then complete the drying process with dryer till the hair are absolutely dry. Use flat brush to comb hair and bounce your hair upwards. That&#x27;s it. For everyday results: Washing you hair once a week is fine. Pick the same day every week.Follow the entire regiment cautiously and religiously and enjoy the results. It would feel tiresome job at first but after 2-3 washes, you get used to it. Also, get used to the compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)For celebrity bounce and fluff on hair use, Kenra&#x27;s (Not Brazilian Blowout Acai&#x27;s!) root lifting spray. Original cost: $18. Buy it according to hold you desire. Every hold value is given a number. The number varies from 0-25. I use the number 13 for medium bounce. Apply it directly onto the roots -&gt; 2-4 sprays in all would do the job.&lt;br /&gt;6) Never use comb on your hair, it would flatten the hair and give an ordinary look. Use a flat brush instead for an amazing bounce. Avoid round brushes other than using those while styling with a dryer. Round brushes cause curling. Do not tie or mutilate your hair. Leave them untied all the time, you will get used to it after a week or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!essional Sebastian Taming Elixir (easily available at CVC pharmacy big bottle for $19, feel free to find competitive prices online.

    <li> I love this profuct. I have very thin,fine hair &amp; Coppola Keratin has really given my hair a better texture, shine and my hair is really healthy. A couple months ago I had surgery on my elbow and the anesthesia burned my hair. This stuff really saved my hair. I use it every day and it also works great with Aquage products. Like others I received a knock off and I sent it right back. This product works great with all hair types.</li>
    <li> This product was not as great as I hoped. I read the reviews and thought I finally found something for my frizzy hair. I didn&#x27;t.</li>
