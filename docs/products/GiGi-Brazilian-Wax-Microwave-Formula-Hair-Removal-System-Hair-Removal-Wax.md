      <li>Boiled water in a ceramic bowl then set the melted wax container in that bowl to keep temp warm.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked for me. The oils will last forever,  I&#x27;m just going to order wax only next time. Not messy, just twist the wood stick like you would do with angels hair pasta.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this wax! I did not purchase this on amazon ( although i should have because it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper on here than at the store i bought it from). This was my first ever home wax kit purchase. I didn&#x27;t have an interest in doing a brazillian on myself, but i figured i could use it for my face. Being of Arab descent, I&#x27;m kind of a furry girl ( no shame in this but it can be annoying lol) So i grow a little more hair on my face than most women. I followed the instructions on prepping my skin and heating the wax, which were super easy btw and got to it! I found this wax was less painful and didn&#x27;t stick to my skin but pulled out EVERY SINGLE little stubborn hair! I was really amazed at this! It came off clean and my face didn&#x27;t break out the next day as it sometimes does when using other waxes. I look forward to waxing other parts of my body with it! especially for my upcoming vacation!</li>
    <li> I first encountered hard wax when I visited European Wax center for my underarms and bikini line. I loved the results, but wanted an affordable at home option. This kit is wonderful! I usually wax every 4-5 weeks, no ingrown hairs, and minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use anything else in the kit besides the wax and the wax remover because the leftover bits can be a little sticky and hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone for underarm use!</li>
    <li> This works very well but can be very time cumbersome. The wax cools down fast in cup but takes a while to harden on the skin. I&#x27;m still figuring it out, but it removes hair very well. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all either. Its messing in the beginning, so use lots of newspaper!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  Stick to going to a professional or to shaving.</li>
    <li> First off, for 20 more bucks, get the kit with the warmer, not this microwave one.  The is the most annoying thing with this wax is reheating it, you most likely aren&#x27;t going to be waxing yourself on the kitchen floor, it&#x27;s a pain to keep going back to heat it up and using a blow drier doesn&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second off, even though it says you don&#x27;t need the muslin paper fabric strip stuff, USE IT.  It is painful and annoying trying to pull up a bit of wax at the bottom to have something to pull on. I tried it a couple times without the fabric strips first and was hating life, much less painful with the strips to have something to pull on (glad I bought some just in case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hard wax hurts quite a bit less than the regular kind. Like the initial pain is probably the same but it doesn&#x27;t feel like your skin is being ripped off too. I&#x27;ve tried waxing myself before with the cheap like pre-waxed strips and I wanted to punch myself in the face, super painful and didn&#x27;t get everything off.  You still have to tweeze a little afterwards, but for the few times that I&#x27;ve waxed myself or went to place to get it done, this was the best/least painful experience I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get better/easier after doing it a couple more times...</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. So far that&#x27;s the best wax that I have used in USA.</li>
    <li> Brazilian at the salon is much too painful let alone do it at home! At least I tried. I will definitely use this for my underarms! It works well. You just have to make sure the hair is long enough and the wax thick enough to grab.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is easy to use and the results are awesome. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> It worked,looked and did what they said it would with no problems. It arrived quick and was easy and good to use. Would definitely order again. Thanks</li>
    <li> The wax really works- microwaves vary so the timing in the instructions may not necessarily work- if you&#x27;re using 30 second increments- make sure you have one of the applicators to keep testing the solidity of the wax...    when applying stay away frm carpeted areas... remember to use the the other things in the box to prep the area for hair removal before applying wax- also remember to take a pain killer in advance- this was easiest to use on the armpit area... not so much on the bikini area but practice makes perfect- Ive never waxed before and got a pretty good result on the first try...    Let the wax dry where its solid enough to tap with your finger and when you pull it it stays together- not breaks apart with stringy residue (think pulling apart chewing gum)</li>
    <li> I tried it and it&#x27;s good. I never thought waxing myself would be this easy. But it was a one-time thing. I like just laying down and being pampered by somebody else. I already gave what&#x27;s left of the kit to my sister. She loves it.</li>
    <li> The kit arrived in less than 2 days! Talk about a speedy delivery! And it was everything they promise! :) I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of waxing and this hurts the LEAST! This is by far the most comfortable waxing experience (waxing is still painful mind you, just this has been my best experience). It&#x27;s still less of a hassle to go to the salon and get it done for fairly cheap. But this is the most affordable way and definitely the ONLY kind I will buy if I do it myself. Forget those nasty clothe rip-off strip kits and the crappy sally hansen stuff - this kit is amazing and affordable!</li>
    <li> Wow. I don&#x27;t know where to begin. I bought this product because the reviews looked great. Um no. The wax did NOT take my hair off, but it hurt as much as if it was ripping my hair off! It hurt so bad I was shaking. Please don&#x27;t buy this product. I&#x27;ve never been in so much pain in my life! And it didn&#x27;t even work so the pain was for nothing. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product! The results are almost as good as getting it done professionally... as long as you have the guts to actually pull the wax! I think if I were as meticulous as the pros I&#x27;d be equally happy with the results. I actually found this to be less painful than the professional waxing I had done, although a Brazilian never actually feels good! Sit yourself down with a glass of wine and a mirror, don&#x27;t be afraid to let out a few choice words, and save a lot of money! I bet I&#x27;ll get 3 waxes out of this kit, and it was just under $20 including shipping. When you consider the huge price difference between a professional job and this kit, the choice is pretty obvious. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Hurts but beauty comes with a little pain. It takes a few tries in the microwave to heat but it also depends on the power level your microwave it set to.I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner and it&#x27;s great product.&lt;br /&gt;Two down sides :&lt;br /&gt;I think there should be little bit more wax I&#x27;m not the hairy person and I was afraid that I will run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;it cools off fast in container and you have to heat it up often</li>
    <li> I bought this wax just the other day,  was happy with the speedy delivery but depressed because the wax was all dried up and would not work. I tried microwaving it and it was nothing but a hard piece of plastic no matter what I did. I am very disappointed and very mad!!!</li>
    <li> I purhased it because all the good reviews and it seems like an good option to DIY at home. But it turned out it&#x27;s not....It is very difficult to use. The wax don&#x27;t melt and it does not work as easy as the instruction claimed. I am going back to the salon to do this next time!</li>
    <li> It works well but it&#x27;s very very messy, I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wife liked it good value</li>
    <li> it works great.  It is easy to use and the results are awesome.complet kit. just the necessary for waxing.if you have experience with waxing, this product will work well. just heat it in microwave 1 minute and is ready for use. of course it hurts. fast shipping. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Super!!! I love it. Efficient and easy to use. The kit is complete.</li>
    <li> Messy and confusing for a novice.  Did not do a great job on the bikini area, but was great on the legs</li>
    <li> I have attempted to give myself a bikini wax with a Sally Hansen&#x27;s wax kit bought over the counter. It was so painful, did not do a good job, and I ended up bleeding and being in pain with little to show for it. I was very skeptical about at home bikini waxing since. Two years later, I came upon Gigi Hard Wax and read tons of reviews about the product. I was skeptical but the main selling point was that it hurt much less than other waxing products. Everything the reviewers said about the product was true about it hurting so much less! I bought the kit which comes with solutions for pre-epilation, wax remover, etc. The hard wax itself is so easy to use, not messy, does the job by epilating while causing little pain! I LOVE this product and will continue to use it for at home wax jobs. It was worth every penny. The kit comes with a tub of wax that will get you through 2-3 wax jobs, the solutions will last much longer so all you have to do is buy a tub of wax! The previous reviewers did a good job about explaining how to use the hard wax, I followed their tips, and it is really easy to use and does the job!</li>
    <li> Best wax ever!! My hair is coarse and this pulls it from the root with ease!! I honestly don&#x27;t feel pain when I pull it off, but maybe I just have a high pain tolerance.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because of the mostly good reviews, and though I haven&#x27;t actually tried it, I&#x27;ve already encountered some problems. Problem one, and really the most important, the directions are in French. While I can kind of deduce what its says, when using bikini wax you really want to know ALL of the directions. Thankfully, some concerned citizen posted English directions on an eHow article (http://www.ehow.com/how_7526697_gigi-wax-kit-instructions.html). Second, there are a LOT of stipulations for using this stuff. The warning label, conveniently in English, says \\&quot;do not use inside nose, ears, on nipples, eyelashes, warts, or near genital area\\&quot; (I thought this was bikini wax?). But that&#x27;s not all, \\&quot;Do not use if you have varicose veins, diabetes, phlebitis, chapped, sore or sunburned skin, recent scar tissue, eczema or ANY skin disorder. Do not use if you are using Retin-A, Accutane, Glycolic Acid, and Alpha Hydroxy treatments.\\&quot; In this case a lot of people would not be able to use this stuff. I mean, diabetes! Come on, tons of people have it, and what does it have to do with waxing skin? Problem three, though the description says 16oz, there is only 8oz of wax, the other 8oz is the four bottles in the kit.</li>
    <li> This wax was SO EASY to use. The hair came off cleanly and easily. The application was no mess, no fuss, no worries. I was so happy with this product I will keep coming back over and over.</li>
    <li> Pretty good wax. Trying it out.  The wax remover really doesn&#x27;t work. I think that is how come you need to use the prewax oil.  However, Sally Hansen hard wax is still my favorite. It is no longer being made though</li>
    <li> This was very messy, very painful, and impossible to clean up afterwards.  It heated very quickly to a very thin consistency so when you use the spatula to go from the container to the bikini area it was sure to drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear their other products are ok.  But I won&#x27;t be trying.  For the cost it should be spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing various parts of myself for 10 years, and this is the worst wax ever!  I tried w/ the pre wash and oil, w/o the oil and just the pre wash, and w/o either and just soap and i literally counted the hairs it actually pulled out, under 10.  I even stood in front of the AC unit to dry my skin out, and then applied and stood in front of it again to cool the wax, and it did nothing.  Im going on vacation tomorrow and its too late to do anything other than shave.  Im furious.  THIS PRODUCT IS AWFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I can&#x27;t tell you ladies any tips or tricks or anything.  I just want to say I bought this for under 20$ so yay!! AND when I recieved this the Pre Hon pre-wax cleanser had spillage around the cap I guess for some reason the cap wasn&#x27;t put on correctly.  No big deal I just wiped it off.  I think for the price I got this at I was very lucky and this is just super convenient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/12/12&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be an update to my review. When I did use it I understand now why you would want another person to wax you. I used this on myself before I went on vacation and trust me, it was so painful!! I really wish I had someone else do it for me instead of buying this cheaply and doing it myself... The product is well made and it&#x27;s good don&#x27;t get me wrong. You can easily make a mess though if you&#x27;re not careful, especially with that wax. It hardens easy I think so make sure you melt it down hot enough.</li>
    <li> Buy woven strips for this and it works great!</li>
    <li> Good product! Doesnt need to go to the waxing place any more!!!</li>
    <li> I read all these great reviews of tis product, and I was expecting something awesome. What I got was a whole lot of awful and over an hour trying to get wax off of places I don&#x27;t want to be trying to pull wax off of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all the instructions on the box, then put the wax on. Then I could only get the wax off in small pieces. ThenI couldn&#x27;t get some of the wax off at all because it was pulling off in such small pieces. Then finally I ended up in the hot shower with a butter knife trying to scrape the wax off so I didn&#x27;t have hard green wax stuck in my hoo ha all freaking night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff sucks. I will never use it again. I&#x27;d rather pay someone else to do it for me. It&#x27;s also a HUGE mess. I don&#x27;t have time for all of the hassle the product put me through. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS buy this and I love it. It&#x27;s usually a green wax with no strips needed. It also comes with with pre epilation oil which is amazing. And I never cared for the wax off because it never worked, it just left a huge mess. Well I ordered this again and I got an all purpose honee which was just AWFUL. It came with strips and no oil. The wax was awful it made a mess all over my hands, counter and bikini area because it was just so gooey and hard to handle. It really hurt to wax this time and it took longer and I wasn&#x27;t even pleased with the results because it really irritated my skin unlike with the green wax + oil that I used to get. And on top of it all, like I said, there was wax EVERYWHERE and the wax off didn&#x27;t work like usual so it was really annoying and hard trying to get that c*ap off of me. Idk what the heck happen but if I order again and I get this \\&quot;honee\\&quot; I&#x27;m going to be very upset. This package I got recently is going right in the trash where it belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fernanda</li>
    <li> lol, all right so check it out, i decided to purchase this product number one because i am TIRED of shaving then a day later having spiky stubble and number two because i am not all that comfortable getting my hooha messed with in a salon and third because salons are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, a few days ago i finally got the guts to give it a go. yes, the reviews about the wax taking awhile to heat up are correct but keep at it, i didnt have much trouble busting the top layer, but i would advise against stabbing it with the applicator, gently scrape until you are in then stir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the actual application will take some getting used to and was a bit stringy when pulling the applicator away from the waxing site but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend that you let the wax cool completely otherwise it gets all mushy on your hands. also pulling the skin taut is a GREAT idea, ouchy otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take a big breath blow it out and give it a yank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for a microwaveable do it yourself kit, i was impressed with the results, will most likely order again unless one of the warmer kits goes on sale!!</li>
    <li> Perfectttt! This kit has saved me so much money. It works great and is easy to use. When I run out I am going to buy another! If you&#x27;ve never done it before, it is easy to use and comes with everything you need.</li>
    <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t melt using the recommended time. I&#x27;ve had to double to time to get it to melt and that is with mixing it once in between heating it. Then after heating it to the consistency it is supposed to be at the wax begins to quickly harden again, so I feel as if I have to rush to wax whatever area I&#x27;m waxing. I should have just invested the $40-$50 on the actual kit not the microwave one.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews! Everyone is right about the microwave time.  Take care to stir/fold in the top so that it will mix with the hot lava wax at the bottom. Do this with the top AWAY from your face and body.  Wait until it gets hard, not chewing gum sticky, but hard. If you are brave enough, I found it helpful to hold the skin taught and yank against the direction of the growth of the hair, it hurts more, but it&#x27;s over sooner!  I found good results holding the skin taught and peeling in the direction of hair growth also.  Whatever you&#x27;re comfortable with doing.&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt, but believe me, works better than Nads!</li>
    <li> One thing is for sure, my beautiful parents gave me the one biological trait that has been a curse more than a blessing and that is coarse/thick body hair. So with that being said, I have a confession to make, which is that I spend most nights perusing the internet searching for ways to remedy this problem, which brings me here today. I was initially attracted to this product because of all the glorious reviews, but I must admit, although this product is promising there are still a few cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- This product comes in only 8 ounces, although the seller claims it is 16 ounces&lt;br /&gt;- I went through most of the wax after one use&lt;br /&gt;- Its microwaveable, so while waxing I went from the kitchen to the bathroom quite a few times&lt;br /&gt;- Very messy which is to be expected it is wax&lt;br /&gt;- Hard wax is difficult to get off of porcelian, hardwood floors, etc. so you will need lots of newspaper or old towels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Very straightfoward product to use ( you just apply where needed and rip)&lt;br /&gt;- Stripless (Yay!!!)&lt;br /&gt;- Great for coarse thick hair&lt;br /&gt;- Gets the job done</li>
    <li> This is an awesome kit. I bought it for eyebrows and the fact that you don&#x27;t need muslin strips is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the wax, it was nice at first but the 3rd time it was just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not for me- messy, messy, messy and yes as other reviews have said it is extremely painful! Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Horrible barely took of any hair , stunk really bad and some of the bottles were open when I received this, I have been waxing since i was 13 I&#x27;m 32 now and this is the worst wax ever in all my years .but I returned and the seller gave my money back with no hesitation that&#x27;s the only good this don&#x27;t buy this , the veet wax strips are better than this</li>
    <li> It is great, it works really good. I wanted first to try something in smaller size to see if the brand works. It&#x27;s great but you have to know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Way too much trouble for what it&#x27;s worth. Instead I bought a wax melter,wax, sticks, and creams to do it myself. Cost more than this but was way more worth it in the end and lasts much longer with better results.</li>
    <li> I think it would work better with the strips</li>
    <li> Works really well for coarse hair. A bit messy but does the job and was expecting some mess.</li>
    <li> The wax does not, I repeat, does NOT come off.  Not with ripping it off per the instructions, not with the \\&quot;wax off\\&quot; that comes with it, nothing.  I had to literally chip the wax off with my fingers.  Not.  Ok.  Buy the regular wax with the strips and do NOT get stuck (literally) with this incredible mess</li>
    <li> I have never waxed myself, but I have gotten waxed in the past, so I almost knew what I was getting into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is stripless, but the problem is, it doesn&#x27;t harden the same way salon wax usually does. I was able to do my bikini really effectively, but because the wax stayed softer in the middle, when I went to rip it, the wax would come off in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the product for the bikini, so I will continue to use it (and maybe make another attempt for the rest in the near future)</li>
    <li> First time waxer and this was easy to use and worked great!</li>
    <li> This is my first Brazilian wax product, it WORKS. And yes it does get messy, not always easy to remove rest of the wax. I used my rice cooker filled with water as a heater to keep the wax warm and melted &amp; everything else worked out as the instruction. Remember to apply thick enough &amp; wait.. you will see the result yourself!</li>
    <li> Kind of a sticky mess after just one use! Need to run to the microwave every once in a while - can&#x27;t sit and wax in peace! Would I buy it again - Nah!</li>
    <li> This wax kit is ok but I would not purchase it again. The wax seems to cool too quickly when applied to skin and when I try pulling it off with the wax strip, the wax stays stuck on my skin. I wind up having to pull wax off with my fingertips which can get messy and painfull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not a bad product, but its not a good one either. Plus the creams that came in the kit are not really useful for what I want I guess. I would have liked to see a post wax soothing cream but they do give you a slow-grow cream which helps the hair not come back as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, as soon as it runs out, i wont be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I tried to use the nair wax before and that didn&#x27;t work. This stuff works great. Takes off all the hair quick and easy. I would recommend using the cloth strips anyway, even though this is a stripless product.</li>
    <li> This wax was very nice. it is a light green color and very pleasant smelling. I was a wax virgin and it didn&#x27;t hurt as I thought it was going to be. One just has to hold the skin taught. It left redness which is expected but that disappeared within 2 or 3 hours (and I have very fair skin)</li>
    <li> dang.. my 1st experience of doing wax by MYSELF! All these times, i usually go to a salon or wax shop to get that job done. Although you did wax many many times, it is totally BIG difference to have someone waxed you and you did it by yourself. Geezze all that nerves of pulling the wax.... but overall, when you got the nerves of pulling the wax, its just fine.  Since this is my first time, I bought this package which is including oil and treatment afterward and its great. And off course I made a mess when applying this wax, but this product serve its purpose... getting rid of you unwanted hair.  Its a lil bit hurt off course, but when you get used to the hurt, it did an amazing job.  From now on, forget the $65 for salon wax, I totally gonna get this less than $14 wax job. My suggestion is: If you a virgin to Waxing, NEVER DIY, always ask the professional to get the job done.  Once you got the rhythm of wax, then you can DIY.</li>
    <li> This product is not for a beginner! The wax is very difficult to handle maybe for someone who has experience is different but since I was trying to do this at home the outcome was not very good! Again maybe I should have gone with hot wax instead of hard wax! Another thing one of the little bottles came in spilled :/</li>
    <li> works good, not great.... claims don&#x27;t have to use the stripes but very hard to pull off from skin, went &amp; bought the stripes separate &amp; it wont stick to the wax. but overall with a little time &amp; a lot of pain it does work &amp; last about 4weeks so far.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing (tropical but not overwhelmingly so)&lt;br /&gt;GREAT for finer hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Messy/sticky&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t always remove hair (especially in places where it grows thicker)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some things I wish I knew before trying this out:&lt;br /&gt;1. Trim, trim, trim. If you are waxing an area that has a lot of hair, make sure ALL of the hairs are short enough.&lt;br /&gt;2. A thin layer will do it, but I recommend adding a bit more wax to the tip that you are using to pull away the hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. Aspirin. Ibuprofen. Ice.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t put any clothing on the freshly-waxed area until at least an hour has passed.</li>
    <li> I had never used hard wax before, so this was a perfect starter kit to try it out. I love it; however, after this ran out, I decided to purchase the non-microwave variation and bought a warmer. This keeps the wax at a perfect temperature as long as the warmer is on. With the microwave kind, I found that I was constantly having to reheat it and then wait for it to cool down a bit. With that being said that, I highly recommend trying this out first. The wax off and everything else has lasted way longer than the actual wax, so it&#x27;s a good deal anyway just to get those items!</li>
    <li> I will not buy again.You need a lot of the product to make a think application and pull it out. If you put a little it cracks and you are left with wax in all your legs. It was a mess to clean the room and my legs.</li>
    <li> works well..painful as most waxing is but not unbearable. easy to use &amp; the after care product of slow-grow works wonderful too. great product for at home bikini care!</li>
    <li> Once I was able to try the product, I was amazed. The wax is less painful and more effective than any other wax I have ever used. I experienced none of the &#x27;exploding wax&#x27; issues when I followed the heating directions. I was careful to pause it and check that it wasn&#x27;t going to explode though because I was scared from all the other reviews. The center of the wax melts much more than the side so I can see how it would have \\&quot;exploded\\&quot; if heated too fast or for too long. Just be careful and be patient. I have been using this wax for a year and I adore it, it&#x27;s much cleaner than my waxing kit with strips and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky goo all over the place. I also adore the SlowGro because it gives me an extra 4 days between waxing!</li>
    <li> I normally pay around $50-$60 for a full Brazilian wax. I thought this would be a great way to save some money. I paid around $10 or $12 dollars for this kit and you get what you pay for. It was difficult to get the wax to the right consistency and when you get it right it doesn&#x27;t stay at the correct temperature long enough. I had to make about 6 trips back to the microwave after starting. Also, hard wax is supposed to be less painful (or so I have heard the pros say) but when you do it yourself it hurts even more. It took me about an hour and a half. I have sensitive pale skin (I bruise easily) so using smaller strips reduces the chance of bruises, unfortunately using smaller strips means instead of getting it done in under 15 minutes by a pro, I am ripping hair out for over an hour. Honestly, it didn&#x27;t do as clean of a job as I am used to getting. I am very picky and like to make sure everything is sanitary, fast, easy and clean. This was not the case using this wax kit. I am not sure why I read so many great reviews, maybe my standards are just very high... but with this, it should be!!!!     No, I would not recommend this product to my worst frenemy nor would I purchase it again. Like I said before, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Not as great as reviews suggest</li>
    <li> Does not replace a spa was, but is easy to use and does the job well! I love how it comes as a kit so it has the pre wax cleaning solution and post wax soothing rubs. Only complain is that the wax remover lotion doesn&#x27;t really work. I usually just jump in the shower and give myself a good scrub after to ,she sure I get all the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;This is a hard was, so you can use it over the same spot multiple times and not rip skin off. Everything in the kit smells good and not too strong. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> love this wax! i use it on my face and arms. i save so much money.</li>
    <li> I pulled the plastic off the box and the pre-rubs cap was off and all over everything else but was salvageable. Then the directions were confusing at first, then I got it down. but the wax is super messy!</li>
    <li> First off the wax is green, why green? Don&#x27;t know? So if the wax get stringy and messy which it will, you get green goop everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Its a tiny bit of wax compared to the other prep products you get. Also, it takes a long time to melt the wax and it gets cool very fast. Not enough time to do your sensitive area without running to and from the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stick well and broke off into tiny pieces when ripping off, that&#x27;s fun when the tiny pieces are on a hard to see reach place ;)&lt;br /&gt;It was a frustrating experience. I decided to try the wax on my eye brows instead later but it was a nightmare. Hard to move and hard to stick yet again. This is by far the worst wax I have ever bought. Save your money ladies.</li>
    <li> I am conflicted about this product.  The first time I used it, like a lot of the 1-star reviewers, the wax was still hard on top and when I went to carefully stir it, the super heated wax in the middle squirted up and hit my chest.  I had second degree burns on my chest, and now have permanent scars that I&#x27;m still dealing with.     As part of my own cathartic healing process, I faced down this wax once again, this time with much more caution.  And to be honest, as a hair down there remover, it really works great.  The results are sometimes, dare I say, better than a salon.      Please please PLEASE be careful when using this product.  As someone who is generally very careful with this kind of stuff, I am slightly shocked at how easy it was for me (and now I know, other people too) to have gotten burned with this wax.  With that said, I&#x27;ll admit it is a great wax for a DIY brazilian.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Brazilian waxes by \\&quot;Wax Therapists\\&quot; and although i have never had a bad experiance at any salon, doing it myself rendered the same results. If you can put up with the pain this is a great choice. Plus this entire kit is one fifth the price of a normal Brazilian wax and it comes with the cleanser, wax preperation oil, wax remover and conditioning gel for afterwards. Amazing value!</li>
    <li> It is a very good wax. It wasn&#x27;t that messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when melting the wax. Very nice for the beginner waxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: I will never wax again.</li>
    <li> I was planning to try waxing for the first time,then i found this product.Waxing underarms was very easy and painless.But I felt like there was not enough instructions ,like howlong you have to keep the wax on your skin before removing it and wax  in small regions rather than the entire region at once(found it in hard way).I am satisfied with this product and recomending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> first of all, i dont reccomend someone waxing themself. its 10x harder then you would think. seconly. the wax took way too long to melt and dryed out way too fast. for the second use the wax looked weird because it was used previously. I say if u want to get a bikini wax, splirg a bit and get it done at the salon.</li>
    <li> It was the best wax I&#x27;ve ever tried...&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to buy again...this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> To be fair,5 stars rating is belongs to the effectiveness itself. I am not please with the packing and some other experiences with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it got a huge melted hole on the wax while I open it.&lt;br /&gt;http://s27.postimg.org/4l8zde8sj/image.jpg&lt;br /&gt;Is that a used product? Or just simply because it accidentally melted during the transition? You decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it said don&#x27;t pop in the microwave for more than a minute, but, I microwaved almost 2 mins to get it ready. Please be very careful, the surface might not look ready but it&#x27;s boiling inside. Give it a good stir for every 30 seconds due to the setting of your microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare to the brand I used before, that one comes with a warmer but it took almost two hours to heat it up, so I prefer this for quick use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please read through the instruction. Apply the oil come with the package before you wax. The wax sticks to ANYTHING. Especially your nails. Those little bottles run out quickly so you could use some baby oil instead. Forget about the&amp;#34; pre hon&amp;#34; it&#x27;s just some alcohol to drys out your skin. Be aware of it if you have sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t use the others bottles so I am not going to comment on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite painful and the wax itself is quite soft compared to other brands. Let it cool completely and pull it as fast as you can to minimize the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a very effective product. Get its job done really well and at least 90% of the hair is out in one attempt. It&#x27;s cheap and it could last you quite a while. I hope it could keep improving.</li>
    <li> This product just sticks to your skin. It does not remove hair properly, and the wax gets hard pretty fast. It really is not effective unless you are next to a microwave every 5 minutes. It&#x27;s an absolute waste of money, DO NOT BUY THE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Love this product and everything that comes with it. Its very convenient not having to use the waxing strips and leave a clean look</li>
    <li> I did a full brazilian wax on myself and it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected. Of course there will be pain for the more sensitive areas, but not as bad as I expected. Do lay down lots of newspaper before starting as the wax does get everywhere (stringy mess!). But overall this hard wax was easy to use on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I needed was a mirror and I was set. A lot of the time I didn&#x27;t let the wax set enough, so it was stringy when I pulled it off. Best to wait a bit longer for the wax to set then yank it off in 1 quick pull. It does a pretty good job at removing all the hair. If you don&#x27;t pull against the direction of hair growth, it does break sometimes and you&#x27;re left with stubble.</li>
    <li> Too messy. Prefer with wax and heating kit.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible experience with this.  It was the most painful wax I have ever experienced.  I&#x27;m not sure if I was doing it wrong or if my hair was too thick but it was not successful in getting rid of the hair.  However, it was successful in causing me a great deal of pain- I thought I was going to pass out at one point.  Good luck to anyone who tries this...</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It works just as well as going to a spa but a fraction of the cost. I only rated a 4 just because it&#x27;s a little messy and hard to remove the wax if you get it on your hands. Otherwise an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I really really like this but I can&#x27;t say I love it. I&#x27;ll try my best to get all the key points. For starters the price is good. You get a good amount of product for the price. If you were doing a Brazilian I think it&#x27;d be enough wax for one or two applications. There is more than enough of the other products, however basically a sample size of sticks. You will have to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we&#x27;ve established the good amount of product for the price, we have to look at how well it actually works. The Pre Hon is a pre wax cleanser. It smells nice and is gentle but if you were about to wax underarms for example I don&#x27;t think this is good enough. However, this is for bikini so it&#x27;s perfect for those sensitive areas!&lt;br /&gt;For the next step you use Pre Epilation Oil. This works well, I tried using powder for areas that sweat (arm pit example again :) ) and that worked OK. Then for normal areas (leg) I tried with and without the oil. IMO the oil is better but you must wipe the excess off if you want this to work. The hair removal was slightly less painful so I recommend you use it and use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next step is waxing. Warming it depended on how much wax I had. I think the first time I had to do a minute and a half but towards the end 30 seconds was good enough. Just do it in 30 second increments and you&#x27;ll be fine. Please be patient and don&#x27;t nuke it for an entire 2 minutes right from the beginning people. Application was easy with the slanted applicators so I&#x27;ll admit I double dipped until the wax started to cake on the end and then I switched to a new one. Also if the wax slides off as you apply it you need to heat it some more. It should be sort of liquidy when you apply. It gets thicker as it dries so don&#x27;t worry.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the hair removal it only worked in certain spots. There is coarse hair on my leg. This wax did not remove it there, nor from my bikini area. Oddly enough the hair is about the same texture, just more abundant in the bikini region. Next, I tried it on my thigh where the hair is thinner. This also did not effectively remove the hair. Only a small amount but I think it was because the hair was sort of long. Next I tried it on my arm (I have never removed the hair from my arm). This worked about the same as the thigh, but some of the hairs were simply ripped and not really removed from the root. Again, I think removal was hard because the hair was long. Next I tried my knuckles. This worked well! Removed just about every hair and I cleaned it up with the tweezers. It also worked the same for my upper lip. I tried this on my eyebrows since I was in the area lol and it worked sort of how it did on my thighs (only partially).&lt;br /&gt;The last area I tried was on a whim but I am extremely happy. This last method and the knuckles is why I&#x27;m decided to frequently repurchase this product. I tried it on my stomach and chest area. Yes my chest! I am a female, I have thick, dark curly hair and light skin. Therefore, every single hair I have shows. I usually leave it alone but it does bother me. This worked fantastically for those areas!!!! If there is anyone out there like this buy this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next step is the wax off. This is similar to a lotion. This seems like it doesn&#x27;t do much but if you need to tweeze definitely apply this first. Last but surely not least, apply the Slow Grow with argan oil. This worked really well. This stuff is magical, even though the wax didn&#x27;t properly remove all the hair, this slow grow made the hairs grow back slower. I use this after I shave and even if this wax doesn&#x27;t work for you I think you should try the slow grow (you can buy this separately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I say if you&#x27;re trying to remove thick and coarse hair, this won&#x27;t work for you. My hair is really stubborn and hard to remove so if you&#x27;re like me leave it to the professionals. If you have thin hair this is the product for you. However, it works best on shorter hair. You can usethis anywhere on your body because it&#x27;s so gentle. Make sure you test on your inner arm before each use and good luck. Try it and experiment because every individual is different. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the only time the waxing caused me any real pain was when I did the bikini area and stomach. That was really painful and none of the hairs were removed. That might be because I have stubborn and thick hair but compared to my other waxing sessions at the spa, this method was virtually pain free. Of course all hair removal hurts but this is by far the least painful.</li>
    <li> Wow! Talk about making it easy! This kit is great! Couldn&#x27;t of asked for anything better! The price is awesome for what you get, and the other bottles in the kit will last you 4 or more months, you will just have to re-up on the microwave wax. This stuff makes it SO easy! The first time took me about an hour, now i&#x27;ve got it banged out in 45 mins. Would totally recommend this to friends and family. Also, because it&#x27;s hard wax, even though I do recommend covering your floor with towels and what not (it is wax), if you let it dry out 100% it is pretty easy to easily pick the wax off your towels, so nothing ruined! I also don&#x27;t find cloth strips necessary, although I could understand where they would come in handy!</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with PCOS at 15 and have shaved almost everyday since before then. The hair on my face is thick and coarse since I am African American but it doesn&#x27;t grow long because i&#x27;m a girl. after reading these reviews I ran to Sallys figuring I could always just shave if it didn&#x27;t work. I have too much to tweeze, have been severelyburned by pulse light, pained by threading and chemically burned by depilatories. Within the last few years every single wax professional had used soft wax and told me the hair was too thick to wax. After watching YouTube videos of men waxing their beards I knew out would be painful but possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin is still slightly irritated 6 hrs later(not sure of this was supposed to go on a face but I was desperate to stop shaving and making things worse!) but its the first wax SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! I&#x27;m not a sponsor put paid, just a sad, embarressed girl who had suddenly found hope. THIS WILL REMOVE SHORT, COARSE HAIR! GiGi, TY TY TY for this product!</li>
    <li> Omg. I am a African American female and I&#x27;ve this wax. This was my first time using and I was scared of how painful it would be. It wasn&#x27;t that much pain to me maybe because I use the pre cleanser and oil. It was quite messy since I was my first time but I was amazed at how well the wax removed all my hair&lt;br /&gt;Side tip: I use my bottle warmer instead of buying a wax warmer and I love it lol. It kept the wax warm and I didn&#x27;t have to use the microwave.  Ladies if you gave a bottle warmer use this instead of paying for a high price wax warmer. I didn&#x27;t like the wax remover, so I&#x27;m going to try something else. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing the steps are as easy as 123 best thing is that its affordable. Would recommend it to everyone &amp;the shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my girlfriend and she tells me that she loves it. She said for a hard wax it works excellent and leaves no left over hairs behind allowing her to do everything with it. The less pain the better with this stuff and it works great</li>
    <li> My go to product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally heat it up in 30 second increments, but see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is best to follow the instructions as far as the order of applying the oils, and the oils do really help with it not pulling the skin!&lt;br /&gt;I only use this particular product for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for my armpits as well as my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;wax off &amp;#34; product smells absolutely incredible!&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself has a distinct smell, it is not bad.&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself is green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: exfoliate your skin before any hair removal! This helps to reduce bumps and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Also apply the wax in small areas, I would not recommend more than a half an inch at a time, just because it is easier to control and it also makes it a little less painful (pulling less hair at once).&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend putting the wax on in the opposite way that the hair grows. So if the hair grows down, start down and slide the wax up, this allows for the wax to pull out all of the hair effectively in one pull.&lt;br /&gt;Put the wax on thinly (not too thin of course) because you want to be able to see that it is dry, it is hard wax so you need it to harden for it to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate, pulling all at once quickly is a lot less painful than pulling slowly and feeling one hair being pulled out at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think that this product is fairly priced and worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was wonderful and shipped in a timely manner, I do plan on ordering again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes as depicted, inside of the box there are the four products depicted: pre-wax cleanser, oil, wax off, and slow grow, as well as the sticks and the wax itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time that I have purchased the kit.</li>
    <li> It was terrible. I followed the directions thoroughly and it only got part of the hair. I will however try again to see if it was just a bad batch of wax. I am so disappointed. I have tried several different brands and this one was recommended by a friend and it was the worst of all of them.</li>
    <li> It worked, kinda. It worked but tended to be messy and often body heat was enough it stayed sticky instead of getting hard.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It says that waxing paper isn&#x27;t needed, but I suggest getting some.  it makes the waxing so much easier.  Use the oils that are given.  They really do help.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but I definitely found out that it lessens the pain.  Do listen to the instructions on melting in the microwave.  It took too long to melt so I just placed it in for 3 minutes.  Bad idea.  you need to really keep your eye out for it during the melting process.  Do this on newspaper spread, it will ease the mess.  The wax container is too small.  It will get all over the place.  After the first time, the wax got everywhere.  So I didn&#x27;t put the cap back on, afraid that it may never come off.  So I just put a foil on top to cover it up.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. It seems that there may be something in this product that helps with the pain. I&#x27;ve used it twice for my bikini area. I am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product! Only disappointment was that one of the smaller bottles wasn&#x27;t tightly closed so when I opened the package oily substance had leaked all over the place.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax I have ever used!! I have used the Gigi honee wax it was terrible. I could not get the wax off at all. Plus it did not remove any hair. This is my second time ordering the hard wax. I&#x27;m done trying anything else. I&#x27;m only ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions to a T- used the cleaner, oil, etc. all as instructed... all I got was bloody skin and 40-50% missed hairs. At first I thought- maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have used it on such sensitive skin...until I remembered that &amp;#34;Bikini Wax&amp;#34; is on the label. It might have been slightly worth it if it actually pulled most of the hair out- but it most certainly did not. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I use strips to help pull, but you have to put strips on IMMEDIATELY after applying the wax or it won&#x27;t stick. This was my first time trying a brazilian wax period, it last a while, but is painful... take some aleve before hand</li>
    <li> The wax is great but I am not convinced by the creams that come with</li>
    <li> I recommend getting a Brazilian Wax at a salon first to learn how it&#x27;s done and how it feels.  My first time doing it by myself took about an hour for a partial Brazilian; I left a little triangle up top, but like it smooth underneath.  I recommend using strips even though it says you don&#x27;t need them because it helps give a better grip and just seems easier to me. Also, do small sections at a time for minimal discomfort.  This is especially important on the sensitive zones, like right above and around the clit; on one side, I did a 1\\&quot; square section and it took 3-4 stokes to get it off. It killed!  On the other side I did about 1/2\\&quot;sections and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  Of the 4 products it comes with, I think the &#x27;wax-off&#x27; is the only one that&#x27;s really worthwhile.  I just use my own alcohol to prep and coconut oil to finish.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to waxing and tried sugaring, but didn&#x27;t like it.  I REALLY wanted to learn to do a Brazilian on my own because I get so sick of shaving and don&#x27;t want to pay to have it done every few weeks.  I love this wax!  The microwave set works nicely, but I&#x27;m going to be ordering the warmer asap so that it stays the right temperature for as long as I need.  The wax literally got everything off.  I used it on my arms and gave myself a full Brazilian.  The oils work well and the pain wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as my first attempt at waxing.  I also waxed my upper lip with no issues.  I did use strips for the bikini area and my armpits- it makes it easier because I didn&#x27;t have to coat the wax as thick and it just seemed easier to pull off quickly with minimal pain.  I didn&#x27;t need to use the strips for my face.  All in all, this is a great product and I will definitely be buying it again and again.  No more shaving more me!</li>
    <li> I have had this for 2 yrs and it does what it says. I recommend you trim the hairs low first because it will be a bit painful. I mainly use this for my underarms. It is a bit messy as well so be careful.</li>
    <li> Of course with waxing pain is inevitable but this wax is so easy to apply and take off. I would highly recommend this to any female/male doing Brazilian waxes. You have to try it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good wax.. I love Gigi products and I recommend it to others. This a great product</li>
    <li> i tried couple times until i learned how to actually use it that everything would go easy and fast and now i have no other ideahow would i do my bikini. its enough for 3 - 4 times for bikini area, no mess, not too painful. i love it!</li>
    <li> Ez to use.  My girl friend love it.;-)</li>
    <li> I like this way more than any other waxing product I have tried. This is really saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successes earned: hair-free face, armpit, and patches of leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons learned: RTFM (read the freaking manual!), Don&#x27;t forget the preparation oil, Don&#x27;t wax alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cautionary tale, though, if you will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo.... I keep experimenting with different waxes. Well, I&#x27;ve had really good luck at the beauty school with hard wax and last night it&#x27;s not too expensive, so I went ahead and got some. Got a kit for less than $20 and was super stoked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No instructions in English that I could find- every other language on the planet in this little unfolding accordion thing on the lid. I spoke those five little famous last words. Oh well- *how hard can it be*, RIGHT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did the prep cleaner, the prep oil, and went to town. Was great on my face, very easy to use, didn&#x27;t hurt, no mess, no problem! So I thought, &amp;#34;This is AWESOME! I&#x27;m going to do my armpits!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was waiting for the wax in my armpit to dry out enough to rip, I started a couple of patches on my leg. Worked fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except while I was working on my leg, I neglected to remember that, golly- my armpit is closed, thereby gluing shut my arm. I figured I would just RIIIIIP and it would all be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that, while I had remembered to use the special cleaner, I had forgotten about the special oil. The purpose of the oil? So that the wax would stick only to the hair and NOT the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you see where I&#x27;m going with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try though I might, I could not unhinge my arm. The wax had hardened, using my armpit stubble (aw who am I kidding, we&#x27;ve reached &amp;#34;Don King in a headlock&amp;#34; status) and the wax as glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the wax was also stuck to my VERY tender armpit as well as the hair. Each pull felt as though it was ripping off chunks of skin as well as what hair was caught in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I noticed the blood dripping down my side, I realized it WAS ripping off chunks of skin as well as the hair! This is when I swallowed my pride, choked back my tears, and (as calmly as possible) asked my poor husband to come in and HEEELLLLLLPP!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter held the baby and watched from the doorway in a mixture of horror and amusement while my husband tried to help me pry my arm open. I had gotten it most of the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Heh.. it&#x27;s too bad we can&#x27;t microwave your arm!&amp;#34; my husband joked. He&#x27;s like that. He jokes in situations when I&#x27;m at my most irritable. Brave, brave soul. I think he checked the room and made sure I was far away from sharp or blunt objects before commenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I glared a deep, cold glare trying to fry his very soul and used that anger to once again RIIIIIIP out another chunk of armpit and release another inch of arm. Then it occurred to me. BRILLIANT! I had a hairdryer, once upon a time! My fevered arm un-wrenching became a frantic search for a hairdryer, which I found in my mostly unused (and this is why!) cabinet of beauty products. I plugged it in, turned in on and WHIRRRRRR scared the poor baby out of his wits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor thing- my daughter took him in her room to play for a while. By now, it was nearing 10 pm. A FULL HOUR had gone by spent mostly just trying to unhinge my arm without fully unhinging mentally. (Fail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we got the wax soft enough that we were able to pull some of it off. My husband stuck a tissue to it which was, shall we say, not ideal since I now not only had to deal with a clump of hairy, green chewed-gum looking wax balled up in my armpit but now had bits of tissue paper stuck to it and re-sticking to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We looked through the box for instructions or any clue as to what to do, and finally turned to the internet. APPARENTLY there are tons of sites and questions-answered dedicated to the removal of residual wax, but nothing for people inway over their heads. SURELY there are sites out there to help out with wax regret? People do this on their -ahem- more &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas, for pete&#x27;s sake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tore through the box looking for instructions and found a little bottle of hate and lies labeled &amp;#34;Wax removal lotion.&amp;#34; I slathered it on and pulled. Now I had a slippery slab of wax stuck to my armpit that smelled faintly of mangosteen and aloe. MMmmm!! Delightful, but unhelpful. Apparently this is ALSO only good for loosening residue, not huge slabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baby started wailing and wailing, aching from tired and stress. My husband got some tiny scissors and began trying to cut the wax away, but there was such little room between wax and skin, and sometimes none at all that this venture quickly proved fruitless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband looked at me, and I at him, and we knew that, try though he might, I was on my own. The baby&#x27;s needs had to come first. He left the room and closed the door. (I swear I heard Taps playing somewhere in the distance.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milimeter by milimeter I pulled and ripped, sobbing silently as chunks of skin came off with the devil wax. I&#x27;ve had problems with the wax strips; they hurt like a *(@$ but never like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11pm came and went like a meth-addled pizza delivery man. If you miss the metaphor, just know that there was a lot of twitching, ranting, and a strong desire to run someone down followed by a sad emptiness that could only be filled by cheese and carbs followed by 10 years of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, FINALLY after much tugging my moment of liberation had arrived. I cleaned up the blood, dabbed on witch hazel, put the bottles back in the box and limped, bloodied, scabbing, sore, tired, frustrated, hateful, exhausted, and at least 5 other dwarves back to bed to cuddle a screaming toddler who wanted to kick me in the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn it all if I don&#x27;t have to be symmetrical. I&#x27;m going to have to figure out the other armpit tonight.way over their heads. SURELY there are sites out there to help out with wax regret?

    <li> This product worked wonders! Arrived timely!</li>
    <li> Love it took all the hair out. It also came quickly to my home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through soooo many at home hair removal systems and this has by far been my favorite, a pro waxer told me once that if I wanted a good wax for sensitive areas like the face and/or armpits to try a bikini wax, they&#x27;re targeted for rough hair in sensitive areas :) Great consistency, easy to use, a little messy but I&#x27;m just clumsy :D</li>
    <li> It was better than I expected. It&#x27;s not messy at all! And the hair is removed completely!</li>
    <li> it was good but hurt verrrrry much lol i was super excited to use it but  would reccommend it if you can handle tthe pain</li>
    <li> It was my first time using hard wax, so it took a bit for me to get used to it but once I practiced a few times I liked it a lot. It did hurt less than regular strip wax however, it did NOT pull out as much hair. I used this on my bikini line (ouch!) and underarms. I have yet to try it on my face.</li>
    <li> I had had one professional wax and had horrible results.  Apparently, the salon used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; wax with strips and I had a horrible allergic reaction and my skin reacted terribly.  I read all of the reviews on this product before trying it and thought it was worth a shot.  I&#x27;ve used it only once now and expect to get better and better with more practice.  It took about an hour and I had to reheat the wax a couple of times.  I recommend putting the pre-waxing oil on your fingers and nails because some got on and under my nails and it took a while to get rid of it.  Overall, this is a great product.  I&#x27;m going to invest in the GiGi warmer as I plan on doing this long term and overall it will be worth the investment in order to avoid multiple trips to the microwave.</li>
    <li> the product exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. It was fast and easy and the least pain I&#x27;ve ever experienced whilst waxing. I actually used it just as a bikini wax, and it would good for all areas!</li>
    <li> My floors and clothes are embedded with this stuff. Also, it didnt remove all hair and the wax off lotion didn&#x27;t have any effect on its ideal use. Never will I invest again.</li>
    <li> As a guy, just couldn&#x27;t afford to pay $90+ for Brazilian wax charged here.  Used baby powder instead of oil and worked really well.  Boiled water in a ceramic bowl then set the melted wax container in that bowl to keep temp warm.  Worked well.  Only had to reheat once.  Instead of trying to pull strip in one pull by myself (which I was having difficulty with, I took thumb or finger and once had a corner of the wax rolled up, flicked it little by little with the finger/thumb and that worked well with seemingly less pain.</li>
    <li> First off for the price you are definitely getting what you pay for! The product is easy to use, can be a little messy takes some getting used to then again this product is muslin strip- free, all you have to do is zap it apply it and let it cool. I would not suggest however, that you do not use this product for a complete brazilian wax, really! Once dry, yanking it away on a sensitive part just does not sit well, for bikini and armpits however it is perfect but to become a bald eagle, to the strips. With that being said if you want to wax your own armpits, this doubles as a great kit.</li>
    <li> I love the wax.. But the bottles was not closed all the way to the leaked everywhere.. plus the wax melted on to the lid and was very hard to open.. won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> The wax does not work easily. It was way more painful and difficult than other wax I have used with the strips. I would not recommend this. I only used it one time and used almost all of the wax. Very disappointed. I will have to go back to getting the roll-on Nair Brazilian wax. Much easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice to at-home Brazilians, but Gigi Brazilian Bikini wax made the process so simple I won&#x27;t be headed back to a salon any time soon. It&#x27;s very effective and the wax smells nice. I haven&#x27;t used any of the included lotions besides &amp;#34;Wax Off&amp;#34; but that one is a must-have if you are waxing at home.</li>
    <li> Arrived yesterday and already loved it. I did my eyebrows and they turned out great. I bought it just for my eyebrows, so I can not really comment on the rest. However, make sure you use as directed and use the lotions/oils the kit comes with. I tested a small part of my arm first and forgot to apply the lotions first and it was painful to peel of!! I also used waxing strips with it and it was easier to remove the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: packaging. I almost took a star for it. The lotions do not have a seal and they leaked.</li>
    <li> This product is freaking great--I love their hard wax and all of the cremes they give on the side are excellent and work really well!</li>
    <li> Despite my two star rating, I&#x27;ve DO NOT at all recommend this product.  I&#x27;ll explain why it got two instead of one (or a stated 0) stars in a moment.    First, opening the product was extremely difficult.  When I got it open, there was wax dried all around the lid, which had sealed the lid tightly to the container.   Heating up the wax took double the amount of time as the instructions say, and if you&#x27;re like me and your bathroom/wherever you decide to wax is a bit away from your kitchen (downstairs for me), the wax will have cooled to an almost unusable temperature by the time you get there.  Because of this, I had to heat the wax constantly.    On to the actual waxing:  unnecessarily painful is how I describe it.  When I pulled each strip off, it would only get about half of the hair.  The wax itself was very stringy, so be prepared for a large mess.  Using very small strips and a very thick layer of wax each time worked best for me, but this makes it take much more wax than needed.  Running back and forth to the microwave made it even more frustrating.  The Wax Off doesn&#x27;t work at all.    And last, the wax smells terrible.  Really bad.  After using the finishing products, it kind of goes away, but prepare yourself for the awful smell the entire time you are waxing.    So why did I give it two stars?  Because it can do the job at hand with enough effort.  I re-waxed areas two or three times and eventually, basically all of the hair was gone.  But re-waxing?  It hurts badly.  If you&#x27;re like me with a pretty high pain tolerance, it&#x27;s do able.  But if waxing is very painful for you, this will not be an option.  So yes, it eventually removed all of the hair, but it was a terrible experience, took double the amount of time, and I do not recommend.    But if you do end up buying it anyway, make sure you buy an after care product, like Tend Skin or similar.</li>
    <li> Worst home wax kit I ever used.  I am so bummed that Nair stopped making their microwave wax which was amazing, simple, and worked fantastically.  A friend recommended this and it was the worst.  As other reviewers have said, it takes forever to heat up.  I had to heat it for two minutes!  It is really gooey and strings of the wax get everywhere.  In addition, it flakes and is hard to get off your skin if you don&#x27;t have a thick enough layer applied.  Also the pre lotions are just too much.  I can&#x27;t believe how complicated this kit is (and it&#x27;s not inexpensive).  It had 5 or 6 containers in it. When you actually get the wax on the hair, it works fine, but the cleanup is a nightmare.  Also pieces of it fall onto the floor and that is more of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this for a refund.  I&#x27;d love to find another as good as the Nair was.  The writing on the tub and bottles is so small it&#x27;s almost impossible to read.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilians for 5+ years so I finally decided to try it myself.  I&#x27;d definitely agree this is the best wax to use for yourself, but note this is a trial and error type event.  First off, make sure your hair is at proper length.  Longer hair will cause more pain as it will snag as you&#x27;re trying to pull it back to grip for the removal.  Also, if you&#x27;re going for the full Brazilian, you may want to have a trusting extra set of hands for your first and second attempt.  Let&#x27;s just say my husband and I had a funny bonding experience the first time through... &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe you [women] do this crap.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;d just recommend those that aren&#x27;t familiar with the normal procedures to watch videos and make sure to do all the steps.  Other than that, the wax is amazing, the oils and treatments very useful, and I&#x27;m interested to see how advanced my technique will be the third time around.&lt;br /&gt;Four stores only because I&#x27;m not into microwaving and fighting the access wax on the edges (may upgrade to a warmer), and would recommend getting a larger amount as with hard wax you tend to use more of the wax and run out quicker.  Summary: Great product, great finished wax feel, oh and I like the smell of the product (very spa like).</li>
    <li> I got so sick of shaving then the very next day there is stubble. So i bought this wax kit and tested it in a small area. I was not prepared for the pain because i&#x27;ve never waxed before but after growing a pair i ripped off the first strip and it got about 95% of the hair. Although it was difficult to get a grip on the wax with out sloowly pulling your hair i will def try the strips even though you dont need them just sounds easier i guess. I will however invest in a warmer because even with just a test area ( and a little procrastination? ) the wax started getting stiff and hard again. Messy yes but again im just a beginner. I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because the instructions on the side of the wax container suck ! lol but all in all i love it and recommend it and will be buying it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit to note : I bought htis from sallys with my membership card costs me $16 originally $19 but will def buy from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;from now on much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Works okay like other hard waxes. I don&#x27;t know if the lotions helped at all; still had some ingrown hairs and the slow regrowth lotion didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. But my hair grows back in about 8 hrs so YMMV. I probably go with something cheaper that works just as well.</li>
    <li> Product recieved, everything is there, but I &#x27;m scared to use it!  I am waiting for my friend to come in town who went to beauty school, so she can do it for me...I do know people who use this product and they love it, and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit from Sally&#x27;s and used it for my first Brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt; - It works great! It removed the hair to leave baby smooth skin&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s multi-use. I used the wax to clean up my eyebrows, and it worked just as well&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s inexpensive. A Brazilian wax from a reputable venue in NYC costs $60! I paid less than $20 for this, and I can get at least four more waxes from the kit.&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s great for a first timer/newbie. The kit has wax, sticks, and pre- and post-wax treatments--everything you need (except paper towels) to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s a painful process. You&#x27;re ripping the hair from the roots after all. I did noticed that the longer the hair, the more painful it is. Prior to  using this I was shaving my bikini area, but razor bumps on the bikini line are not cute.&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s messy. But I can see the process getting less messy with each successive use.&lt;br /&gt; - The wax doesn&#x27;t heat evenly. My microwave isn&#x27;t the strongest, and I had to heat the jar for four minutes before I could get the top spreadable to use. Little did I know that underneath the top layer, the wax was piping hot. At some point, I noticed the hotter wax bubbling to the surface, Be careful and test the wax on your hand before applying. I did this and didn&#x27;t get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When I opened the kit, I couldn&#x27;t open the jar of wax. I tried using a towel for additional grip, but that didn&#x27;t work. So I went on YouTube and found a tip that did: Turn the jar upside down and slam it on a flat surface. I did it it twice before jar opened.</li>
    <li> Normally I get waxed at a local spa, but occasionally don&#x27;t have the time to get in before vacation/an event/etc., so I wanted this for those times. I only got waxed a week ago, so I couldn&#x27;t use it down there, but did try it on my BF&#x27;s stomach (LOL) and my thighs. I would say that it works really well for a do-it-yourself wax. I had to play with the temperature a bit--ended up needing to heat it for almost 90 seconds, then broke the barrier gently to avoid the burns some other people experienced. I had no issues with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 creams included seemed to work really well (though I haven&#x27;t tried the growth minimizer yet). The wax took out a good deal of hair and was really quite easy to use (even my BF wanted to get in the fun). I deducted one star because it&#x27;s so super messy, but this is more user-error than product-error! I think as I practice, I&#x27;ll get better at keeping the wax IN the container and not everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit to add: A couple weeks after my normal spa visit, I had some fine hairs in my bikini region. I attempted to wax myself, which wasn&#x27;t too difficult at all, and did get some hairs out, yes, but it&#x27;s not AS good as my wax tech/spa wax at removing the very fine, blonde hairs.</li>
    <li> A little messy,  but saves you $ and a trip to the waxing lady.</li>
    <li> Really only good for 1 bikini wax</li>
