<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  Small enough to put into a personal travel makeup kit without making it too heavy.</li>
    <li> Cool product, feels durable. Took forever to get here though.</li>
    <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
    <li> ITS WHAT I NEED TO DO BACTERIA FREE MAKEUP.......I NEED THE MY PRODUCTS TO LAST SO HAVING THIS IS GREAT...I LOVE THE STRENGTH OF THE PRODUCT..THANKS..I WILL ORDER ANOTHER FOR A FRIEND.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but very good quality.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re tired of mixing product on your hand or staining your hands with makeup this is great! I use the spatula for mixing product or digging out of jars since I have nails. Who wants that under their nails. So very convenient.</li>
    <li> It is quite large and arrived in clean condition. I enjoy using it to mix primer and mineral powder foundation to make liquid and this palette is perfect. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this every day for my foundation because I need to mix two colors. The spatula is perfect and so is the palette. It is a great and well made product.</li>
    <li> Stiff palette and spatula, quality material.  Excellent to use with my thicker Halloween makeup materials.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality palette/spatula SET at a great price. The palette has a mirror like finish, and the spatula is solid and well crafted. Really, they are quite nice! It took about two weeks to get to my door, and I was pleasantly suprised. Nice size for mixing creams, foundation, etc. Just remember to spray or clean well with alcohol before use.</li>
    <li> Loved this! Can be easily cleaned and isn&#x27;t heavy at all. The little tool that comes with it is so handy! Love it!</li>
    <li> Very simple but do the job! That&#x27;s what I need. Help me a lot mixing up the foundation.</li>
    <li> such a great price for a quality product!</li>
    <li> Great size for travel and large enough for all face product artistry.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> This mixing palette is awesome! very professional look and feel. It is way beyond what I expected. The finish is very glossy and both sides of the palette looks almost like a mirror. I got great value for a small price! You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Very high quality product, especially for the price! Exactly how it looks in the picture. The metal is firm and sturdy and the spatula has two ends - one is slightly more tapered than the other but not a huge difference. I use this to mix my foundation with my highlighting primer and it&#x27;s so easy to do! Very easy to clean as well, I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved the 2 pallets that I purchased. Although it was a long wait, was definitely worth it. Had a few difficulties but the company made it right and fixed it as fast as they could. Thank you! Would highly recommend this product and this company!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a budding young make-up artist.  Evidently it is just the right size for mixing personalized colors.</li>
    <li> Palette is a must for makeup artists. Even though there was a slight mix up with my order, the seller worked diligently to correct it and I&#x27;m very pleased with the item and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Great product! very useful and cleans up well &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Fantastic, came just as pictured in a really fast manner. I have no complaints, it totally serves the purpose I need for applying and mixing foundation, it makes the process much more sanitary. For the price of this compared to other places this was a steal. Totally happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this palette. Makeup wipes off easily. Have not had any problems with it. Delivered on time. Will most definitely order again!</li>
    <li> shipping took forever.  item is heavy and not very easy to use.  cold and hard in your hand.</li>
    <li> Just finished a makeup course. Teacher had this, I love it</li>
    <li> I love  the stainless  steel  palette! Not to big or small, I get alot of complements in makeup class askin where I got mine.  Great buy. I&#x27;d recommend this  product</li>
    <li> I ordered this on January 7 and got an estimated delivery for February 8-16 so I was pleasantly surprised when I received it today. It came in a yellow envelope with bubble wrap, completely damage free. It is about the size of my hand from palm to tip so it&#x27;s a good size for me. I would recommend this to a makeup lover</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s a clean, flat metal plate. Exactly what I was looking for. Works great. Spatula is nice too, sturdy material.</li>
    <li> Shipped and delivered on time. I loved using it. Super easy to clean and great for sanitation of cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I love this palette.  I am able to mix foundations and concealers together to come out with the right color and shading for a flawless application of makeup.  This is a must have, if you are serious about becoming a makeup artist.</li>
    <li> I use this palette for my foundation and concealer. My foundation is Revlon Colorstay Whipped; I love the foundation but hate the packaging. The spatula keeps me from having to use my fingers to get it. I clean both before each use so I don&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating the foundation or my skin. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I&#x27;m now using less product, because the palette doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup unlike my skin. Wish I&#x27;d got this years ago but I&#x27;m so thankful I have it now!</li>
    <li> Love this ! Keeps my makeup sanitary</li>
    <li> Love it. Great quality and delivery was quick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. Happy I bought it. AJW</li>
    <li> In the process of becoming a makeup artist, and this tool is essential! Very similar to the Makeup Forever Flat Steel Palette, which they never have in stock at most stores. Very lightweight aluminium palette and spatula that works well for mixing creamy products. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Bought this palette and spatula set, when I received the palette, it arrived scratched, contacted seller and he was happy to replace. It took a while for the replacement, as he said he had just placed a new shipment for these. He was kind enough to send me 2 palettes which one was in great condition and the other had a few minor scratches, over all I am happy with it., The spatula is great quality, the palette is ok, Not Great, but will do the job. The seller was pleasant to deal with &amp; happy to make things right.... A+ :)</li>
    <li> good quality. not heavy or anything. easy to clean and sanitize. you get what you pay for. i just don&#x27;t like the packaging that&#x27;s all. still deserves 5 star</li>
    <li> This palette is so great for my makeup kit! Makes my job alot easier and more professional! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I really needed a nice palette that was great for mixing and I love this, it also is mirrored and cleans very well, it arrived in perfect condition no scratches and was packaged very well! I use it whenever I need to mix up a makeup concoction for myself or client instead of my hand and it&#x27;s honestly amazing ! Worth every penny and it&#x27;s such a great price :) I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Stainless steel, easy to clean, looks quite professional.  Great for mixing foundations and lipsticks.  Arrived and was just as pictured.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to be as big as it was but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it. Shipment was pretty fast and the product is great quality, very heavy duty. I would recommend buying this product because it strong, big and great for mixing products. This tray is as big as my hand which gives great space to mix n hold numerous products.... A good buy for sure!</li>
    <li> Does not look as pictured at all! Missing the little thumb holder.  So it looks like a sheet of metal. But it will do!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect size, but it didn&#x27;t fulfill my expectations from the picture and description. Eh, check before buying</li>
    <li> I realize this product was coming from Hong Kong so I understood the longer wait for the delivery. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law who works as a makeup artist. The product arrived just in time for Christmas (about 13-15 days after I&#x27;d ordered it) and was perfect. Good packaging, good quality, exactly as shown online. I&#x27;d definitely buy from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> perfect handy little palette and spatula, great accessory for my RCMA foundation palette</li>
    <li> This is a good pallette, although is quite big to carry around on your make up carrier,  The spatula is very good and precise.</li>
    <li> Great size, works amazing with foundations and cream products.</li>
    <li> I actually thought the palette was going to be smaller but it was a good size to have foundation, primer, concealer, gel liner, eyebrow gel, and liquid lipstick on it and not melting into each other. You don&#x27;t need too much of the product on the palette so there is definitely enough room. The thumb hole is quite comfortable enough for my size thumb and doesn&#x27;t rotate very easily which is good for stability. The metal it&#x27;s very easy to clean and so far, I haven&#x27;t found it easy to scratch or dent but I have been also taking care of it. I have it four stars because the initial setting up, putting the rubber piece into the hole was difficult and it took them forever to deliver the item. Otherwise, no complaints. It&#x27;s a great and sturdy product.</li>
    <li> I got it to star my kit as a professional make up artist. I mainly chose this one because of its price and size, and I am truly happy with the quality I got</li>
    <li> I love this tray for mixing cream colors, foundations and concealers!</li>
    <li> I just received my item today. I am so happy with it! specially it came early that&#x27;s my main concern as we&#x27;ll. The item is a good quality as we&#x27;ll the packaging...it&#x27;s worth it. The only thing is... I was expecting it would be black color rubber round the hole in the palette, I got it blue. But it&#x27;s ok I love my pallete.</li>
    <li> Use this for my professional kit, and I love it! It keeps things sterile because you can clean it so easily, non porous. The spatula has different shaped ends, so you can get the last bit of product no matter the shape container. I think this is a must for any professional makeup artist and even for the extreme collector!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I use palates for my foundations, so I just scoop and apply, instead of messing up the back of my hand.</li>
    <li> The palette is excellent for Makeup Artists to mix foundations or add any products without putting them on the back of your hands. I LOVE LOVE LOVE how there&#x27;s  a hole where you can put your thumb in. It makes me feel like an artist painting away! lol. The spatula is also really great as well. I highly recommend. It&#x27;s great quality and a great price!</li>
    <li> great inexpensive palette!</li>
    <li> As a make up artist I always have to mix and match foundations. This allows me to hold my mixes while not having to hurt my fingers as much. Plus the spatula is just percect for scooping out products to help keep things sanitary.</li>
    <li> The palette in the picture clearly shows a thumbhole. The palette I got has no thumb hole. It&#x27;s just a stainless steel rectangle. Being that it&#x27;s a simple product, it&#x27;s hard to give it a bad review. It&#x27;s sturdy and it hasn&#x27;t rusted or anything, but it&#x27;s disappointing that this seller had a misleading picture.</li>
    <li> it is a small plate made of stainless steel.it is good enough to mix make up on with a spatula.</li>
    <li> Beyond the confines of what can be done with this tool, it&#x27;s an endless satisfactory tool that balances the efficacy by offering creative aspect for its users. It&#x27;s a must-have tool, no doubt.</li>
    <li> Love this item as a makeup artist and student it comes in handy and is very helpful and would so recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve ordered.  I love these palettes.</li>
    <li> bigger than I expected ! It is amazing !</li>
    <li> This is amazing! If you are thinking about buying this product- just do it! Very high quality, feels extremely sturdy, rubber around the thumb opening protect your finger so it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Make up Spatula is very strong, and has a square and more pointed side so a lot of uses. SOO much better quality than I thought it would be. I did noticed when bought it, you had three different size options, I would suggest being careful when ordering. I order the 15X10- highly recommend. Great size for your vanity, not too big but plenty of room to mix colors, foundations, lip tar, ect. Great strong plastic protective sleeve it came in.</li>
    <li> Good quality and exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Simply perfect. No frills, no fuss, just a mixing pallet and a double-ended spatula. It&#x27;s small enough to fit inside my kit without taking up extra space but large enough to work on easily.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  It fits in my hand but it&#x27;s not really small.  It came in perfect condition and it is good quality!</li>
    <li> This is honestly a life saver! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this. It makes applying and blending so much easier and I don&#x27;t waste product by putting it on my hand where most of the product gets absorbed. Also it serves as a mirror as well which is great!!</li>
    <li> The quality of this is beyond stainless steel. Its mirrored and the weight is spectacular. Mine came with a rubber cushioned thumb pad, very nice surprise. The spatula is great and it came in a very nice vinyl protection case. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as shown, good finish and shiny steel which is not likely to rust in the long run imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spatula is fantastic, I like to use the pointy edge to scoop out creams from jars to prevent contamination.&lt;br /&gt;I use the plate to mix eyebrow pomades and foundations. Does not stain at all, wipes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for Makeup aficionados.</li>
    <li> Luv this palette for putting my foundation on without using the back of my hand. Product got to me very fast and well packaged. Definitely recommend this product as well as the seller</li>
    <li> This was a GREAT purchase. Great quality, nice weight, professional finish. Order with out hesitation!  A plus</li>
    <li> good quality. love it</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> Loved this! Came exactly as described, but the one I got actually had a plastic ring around the finger hole so you don&#x27;t cut yourself with the metal. It came in its own pouch with 2 slots, one for the plate and one for the spatula. Both in solid, sturdy material, great quality. I use it to mix my different foundations and to scoop out cream products to be more sanitary. Perfect and great price!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted!  I&#x27;ve seen YouTubers use palettes for a while now and didn&#x27;t know where to get one.  It is a great size for home use.  I can use it several times before cleaning :)  Did not expect it to be quite as reflective as it is (mirror-like), but that&#x27;s just fine.  I use it everyday and save so much makeup!</li>
    <li> The product is made of high quality material. It is much larger than I expected it to be, which makes it a better deal.</li>
    <li> cute, great size, smooth, came with a plastic holder for both so there were no scratches. Perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> This palette is made of qualtiy stainless steel.  It is not flimsy or cheap. Each tool is quite substantial. It was a great value, the only thing is that it took forever to arrive so if you are in a rush look elsewhere. If time is no issue then I suggest that you buy this.</li>
    <li> The item came with all the listed parts. Did not take too long to reach me, and the packaging was simple. Over it was a pretty straight shot purchase. It&#x27;s easy to clean and has a great shine when you first open the package and then clean it after use. No complaints. I will note, that I have yet to use the spatula that came with it. So I am not sure how &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; it is when trying to scoop out makeup or anything.</li>
    <li> This arrived 10 days before promised and in perfect condition.  It&#x27;s gorgeous!  Sturdy construction, pristine surface, and the knife/spatula tool looks high quality too.  It came with a red rubber ring to put on the thumbhole but honestly it&#x27;s comfortable without it too.  It has a good weight to it and feels natural on my left hand.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it!!!</li>
    <li> love it! Easy to use and clean. I use this for every makeup job I have for mixing foundations, lipsticks, pigments and more.</li>
    <li> Very worth the money! I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this product. The palette itself is the perfect size for me and I love how it has a thumbhole. The spatula is awesome as well. But I was most impressed with how fast it shipped and got delivered. I ordered it on a Wednesday, Feb 13th and when I placed the order, it said it was gonna get to me around late march or early april! It said that the sellers were on vacation, so I was kind of bummed out that I didnt get a disclaimer before I bought it. Surprisingly enough, it literally shipped early the following day and got to me the following Friday! I was impressed knowing that it was gonna be coming from China. I already anticipate 2-4 weeks when ordering overseas, but this was the fastest order I&#x27;ve received from overseas! Great job!</li>
    <li> Received timely and very thick quality steel along with the metal spatula</li>
    <li> Very strong and great. I use it as a makeup artist.</li>
    <li> Perfect surface size to work on, and you can have multiple amounts of product on it , satisfied 100% A must have for me</li>
    <li> This is a really good product and material!better than I expected!!!</li>
    <li> I  love this tool.  It&#x27;s real easy to handle when applying makeup. This tool is a must have to great applications.</li>
    <li> It does what it needs to do, although I don&#x27;t use it as much as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to mix foundation shades, as I&#x27;m usually in between shades. It arrived very fast and serves it&#x27;s purpose. You can&#x27;t beat the affordable price either.</li>
    <li> My school offered a pallet to buy there, but i got this one and ive got to say i love it, its great quality, easy to clean. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good quality happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it comfortable to use easy fit in my hand, just love it.</li>
    <li> This palette and spatula makes blending super easy. And its easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Just ordered a second one, love this item.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife&#x27;s makeup kit and she loved them both! Great priced item!</li>
    <li> This set is great. It was smaller than I thought but that was great for me. Perfect cause its so lightweight, especially if you have carpal tunnel. Great price</li>
    <li> As advertised but took 2 MONTHS to arrive.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s prefect for your foundation and other makeup and it saves you money on your makeup because you don&#x27;t use as much.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well made this item is.  It is a sturdy product that delivers. Although much larger than I had anticipated gets the job done and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my art. It&#x27;s a great size, it fits on my hand very comfortably.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s metal so it&#x27;s easy to clean off after use. It can&#x27;t absorb any of my product. I love it. Very simple but effective.</li>
    <li> it was exactly as I was expecting it to be.  I like the stainless steal wand that came with it.  Works great for scooping loose product onto the pallette.</li>
    <li> I used to put my foundation on the back of my hand...which I never enjoyed.  I also used various lids, which worked out well also.  However, I wanted a stainless steel palette and this did not disappoint.  Foundation wipes away with a tissue (even after all day) or I use a baby wipe.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It took a while to ship but it was great, exactly as pictured and comes in a little vinyl cover. No scratches or anything either.</li>
    <li> good product for cheap</li>
    <li> Took a little long to receive but love it!!!! It&#x27;s very sturdy and you get well worth your money!</li>
    <li> Very helpful for mixing lipstick colours, or for mixing cream with foundation!</li>
    <li> Very impressed! Super high quality product! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is how long it took for me to receive it! I ordered it a week before halloween and just received it yesterday (nov 22) I totally forgot it had even ordered it.</li>
    <li> awesome product. was worth the wait</li>
    <li> Perfect, it was just as described, arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This item is great it helped me a lot to be able to mix foundation or other makeup and other things easy to work with</li>
    <li> It took quite a while to get here, considering it was shipped from China. And since it was shipped from China, I has expected something substandard and far worse. The packaging it was in made the palette look dull and not &#x27;stainless steel,&#x27; but after removing it, it looks nice, clean, blemish-free, and even mirror like.  I was able to try it out last week and it works just like I expected it to. Easy to clean. Easy to hold/handle during make up application. The included utensil was convenient for removing bits of concealer from my concealer palette to mix and blend. Overall, a good buy. I&#x27;d recommend this product for any make up aficionado who wants to more &#x27;professionally&#x27; handle foundations and concealers.</li>
    <li> This is great for mixing products on instead of your hand. It does not waste product by absorbing it like your hand would. I do wish there was rubber around the thumb hole as it does create an indention while holding it but it&#x27;s not a huge deal. I still would recommend this to friends and family because it keeps things less messy!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, it comes at a very convenient size. I would prefer better packaging, mine came misplaced and slightly scratched by the spatula.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Lovely. Smooth to the touch. The hole is filed off nicely so it doesn&#x27;t cut your finger. Nice and sturdy not flimsy at all. Best of all it does not soak up product like the back of your hand!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I just recieved it yesterday and have already used it.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my mua business.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as pictured. It was actually bigger than I expected because my grasp of measurements and reality don&#x27;t always coincide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned it will take FOREVER for this to be delivered, it&#x27;s coming snail mail (They may have actually used a snail) from Hong Kong, but shipping is free, so it&#x27;s all good. I believe the shipping quote stated you will receive it soon after hell freezes over, so it wasn&#x27;t exactly a surprise. It took about a month, maybe slightly over a month. I purchased from Imports247.</li>
    <li> Finally. I have something where i can mix my foundations to have the perfect shade for me. Good quality. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> works well for mixing all my makeup &amp; keeps it sanitary for putting on makeup for me and others.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product! Would recommend to any makeup artist. Came with the hole - just as pictured. I think I will be using this for quite some time. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually what I thought it would be and arrived before the expected delivery time.</li>
    <li> Love it! Sturdy and looks professional</li>
    <li> This items is as described and is a good medium size.  It&#x27;s great to use when mixing foundations.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Got the pallet and spatula love them both so much now I can depot my lipsticks and can make a lipstick pallet yayy thanks soo much :)</li>
    <li> This is a great quality palette and spatula. I use it to mix foundation or create different color eyeliners with eye shadows by mixing them with a mixing solution.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s all metal with a thumb hole so it&#x27;s durable. It has a sleek look and is very easy to clean off</li>
    <li> i loved that it was shipped rather quickly BUT the plastic it came in was already opened and the surface of the steel Palette was all scratched up.</li>
    <li> Makes mixing on steel easy clean up and also the thumb hole makes for easy means to apply makeup</li>
    <li> super inexpensive but also great quality.I got this months ago but im just getting around to write a review but this product is great i use it almost everyday to mix foundations, lip colors etc.i would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very heavy duty and nice! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Very Helpful to mix colors prior application!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and handy for doing makeup!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rusty!  It even has rust flakes in it&#x27;s plastic container. Wife dissapointed. Guess I can use it for some hobbies since wife wont use this for makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great, low-priced spatula and palette for makeup.  I like how large the palette is, but if you have small hands, it might be a little large.  I use it daily!</li>
    <li> Very nice makeup palette to blend different colors of foundations, liquid and creme and the spatula comes in handy too!</li>
    <li> I can now blend all mediums of art and makeup with ease. It is high quality, and good for the smaller hand.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy palette with a plastic-coated finger hole and a very nice 2-ended palette knife. It is marvelous for blending shades of foundation, concealer, and cream eyeshadow, as well as mixing in pigments to make really custom colors and textures. It&#x27;s even nicer than I expected!</li>
    <li> Received exactly what I ordered . Pleased.</li>
    <li> this palette was better than i expected.</li>
    <li> Im starting to freelance and i realized that it was getting very annoying having to mix foundations on the back of my hands. so i ordered this and i am very happy with this purchase. its stainless steel so its like looking into a mirror &amp; when i washed it ,it looked as good as new. good size too &amp; the spatula kind of feels slightly too long but regardless ill find a use for it. i recommend this palette too any makeup addict or makeup artist.</li>
    <li> Good size, good quality steel, the spatula has one skinny end which is great.&lt;br /&gt;You might wanna have a bigger one if you are a makeup artist but if you don&#x27;t mind wiping it with alcohol to make room and keep working on it that&#x27;s a great one!</li>
    <li> Essential in any Makeup artists kit!</li>
    <li> First I have to say this item took A WHILE to get to me. Perhaps being it was shipping from China. But, I have had other items from other venders that took less time to get to me from over seas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, when I finally received the product it was nicer than I anticipated. It was package well and arrived in great condition. It&#x27;s just the right size for my needs. I&#x27;m hoping it will stay shinny and in good condition. The description on their page said &amp;#34;stainless Steel&amp;#34; , so I hope for the best from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind waiting for about 3.5 weeks-then save money and order. If you MUST have it sooner, then purchase the ones that are twice the price and ships from the US and get it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, lastly, when I contacted the seller regarding Where&#x27;s My Stuff-their response time was quick.</li>
    <li> Great quality&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly in small hands</li>
    <li> That is really great but just the things ıt is really so larger than What I expected. But anyway I love it.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought but I love it!</li>
    <li> love this little gadget makes doing makeup for other a breeze because i can blend on this palette and then clean it off quickly and start all over when i am doing multiple clients</li>
    <li> The product came in a little clear pouch with a snap button so you could always carry the palette in there. The spatula was longer than I expected, but it is true to size in the picture (a little bit longer than the length of the palette). The palette itself is around 6 inches so I think that&#x27;s a good size. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product and I think I&#x27;ll be using it a ton.</li>
    <li> Very neat. Great quality and very affordable. It came in a little pouch i absolutely loved it. And its a great size. If you&#x27;re looking for a metal palette and spatula don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one!!! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is my favorite addition to my SFX kit! Especially while mixing colors and working with silicone out-of-kit compounds. It took awhile to get..but the quality and price are worth it.</li>
    <li> Looks very professional, the wand works great for scooping creamy products. The stainless Steel is so reflective, its practically a mirror.</li>
    <li> Good thing I read that it would take a while to arrive; it did, but at the early end of the estimated time. This is heavier duty/higher quality than I expected.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I had previous used a plastic palette to mix makeup but was told recently that using plastic can change the color of the product. The solution to this problem is a stainless steel palette, so I purchased this. It&#x27;s pretty small but still great value for the price. It&#x27;s a quality product and has been very useful.</li>
    <li> It was just what I was looking for to mix small amounts of make-up foundation, concealer and other make-up! Not too big or too small, can easily be used when travelling. They also said it&#x27;ll take 3 weeks to get to me, but from overseas, it only took a week and a half from when I ordered! Great seller :)</li>
    <li> Love it finally decided to purchase this I kept using my hands to put product or mix not no more with this its amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it was going to be, but it works very well for what I want and I like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for mixing foundation or any cream product without all the mess. This is easily cleaned and sanitized. I also like that it includes a spatula and pouch for traveling. Great quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a pro. I got this with the hope to make it easier to mix my own foundation. I use brush, so it would be much easier to do the mixing on a solid surface instead of the back of my hand. This is larger than I expected, and of a decent quality. Also easy to clean up. One thing I wish could change is the size... but I guess it just depends on what you need.</li>
    <li> it seems to be a nice size and its nice that it comes with the tool to take out product</li>
    <li> Works good for me. Helps me with my make up. Instead of using my hand to put the liquid</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in a reusable bag to hold both products, the spatula just came in a little zip lock. But it&#x27;ll do what I need it to do so I wont complain too much!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful little makeup palette.  The size fits wonderfully in my hand.  I was concerned that it would come without the rubber finger insert as other reviewers have noted, but fortunately, it was included -- makes it so comfortable for my thumb. The parameter of the palette is slightly sharp, but, then again, it is cut metal.  I also really like the spatula.  I like that both ends of the spatula are flat &amp; not concave.  The package arrived on 8/21 -- much earlier than the 9/2 - 9/16 estimated delivery date.  Terrific palette &amp; spatula for a great price.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted, not too heavy, but it feels solid enough to last for several years.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to a friend, its perfect in my book.</li>
    <li> I liked this item. And it&#x27;s cheep. Great for the real thing. &amp; practice.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend getting one of these.  If you are acne prone or just want to keep your face clean, this is the way to go.  Always pour your foundation or powder on a clean palette before applying.  Also, you end up using less foundation when you use this versus just pouring foundation on the back of your hand.</li>
    <li> The product is good, and the customer service is great!</li>
    <li> I love it! Would highly recommend! and you cannot beat the price! I use it for mixing foundations and powders!</li>
    <li> I love it..!!! I do makeup for the Today Show &amp; it&#x27;s amazing. ..  Thanks for offering all your products &amp; everything else..! !!!  TKs again...&lt;br /&gt;Enid</li>
    <li> super to mix different tones of liquid foundation!</li>
    <li> The palettes came one at a time n I only received 2. And the package was tampered with n if course had items missing. But what can u say about a steel plate?</li>
    <li> Great size and quality! Shipping took very long though.</li>
    <li> Took a month to receive but it was expected because they tell you before ordering. The product is a great size although I expected it to be a bit larger but happy it isnt. Great for MUA on the go. I have yet to have used it but it has a great deal of weight, which i love. I just hope this doesnt rust when time to clear makeup off of it. Thank you so much and i def will be ordering again!!!    UPDATE: Does not rust!!!!! Goes to every booking with me and helps save product!!</li>
    <li> This stainless steel makeup palette is exactly what I was looking for. It came in the mail in perfect condition. When I opened the package I was pleased to find the palette made of high quality, it&#x27;s not flimsy at all. It looks like it could last a long time. I would recommend this product to any makeup artist looking for a high quality stainless steel makeup palette.</li>
