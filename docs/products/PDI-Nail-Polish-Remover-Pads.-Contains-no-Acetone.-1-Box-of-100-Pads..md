### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They take off the fingernail polish great!</li>
      <li>But they work great and travel well!</li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, great product!</li>
      <li>Still very nice.</li>
      <li>and then they don&#x27;t do a good job of getting the polish off.  </li>
      <li>Since I cannot use acetone, maybe this is as good as it gets without it; I just do not know.</li>
      <li>I loved them tho...really convenient with snall children.</li>
      <li>Which I thought was a good thing...</li>
      <li>The small pads are perfect to take in your bag with you and work great.</li>
      <li>and it looks better to just take it off</li>
      <li>They work fast and are great</li>
      <li>I wont be using them for nail polish remover most of the time, but for removing sticky tape residue.</li>
      <li>Very nice fast service, the nail polish pads will make my job easier.</li>
      <li>Good for quick clean up</li>
      <li>fast delivery and good product</li>
      <li>Plus they&#x27;re thing and easy to carry.</li>
      <li>great to carry around for when your nail polish suddenly gives out on you</li>
      <li>But the price is so cheap it does not make a difference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of these factors, I was excited to see these Nail Polish Remover Pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Received quickly and was able to use right away.</li>
      <li>One pad doesn&#x27;t even clean one nail.</li>
      <li>they are okay, but do not work very well.  </li>
      <li>I love that I can carry them around with me though and always have a set of 6 in my purse ready for when I need it.</li>
      <li>I suspected the low price was too good to be true, and it was.  </li>
      <li>When you pull the pad out from the package it is very moist and removes the polish extremely easy.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and what I ordered!</li>
      <li>not as good of quality as I expected</li>
      <li>but I find these to be extremely useful.</li>
      <li>They took up very little space and did a great job.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am pleased to note one of these pads easily manages to clean small amounts of glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>exactly as described.</li>
      <li>and they work pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Granted, I had on more than one coat of nail polish, maybe it would do 10 nails if there was only one coat.  </li>
      <li>But you will need more than one to do all ten nails...depends on the color and type of polish you use!</li>
      <li>Good for home, put a few in your purse and of course for travel.</li>
      <li>I got 2 nails completely clean, but the 3rd one did not get completely clean.</li>
      <li>Thepads were removed from box and box folded flat in envelope with pads on top.</li>
      <li>might not make much sense...</li>
      <li>Very convenient.  </li>
      <li>Maybe other people use darker colors or more coats of polish</li>
      <li>Nice, but they do dry out after a couple of years if you don&#x27;t open them.</li>
      <li>Polish remover quickly removes the offending glue, leaving me ready to approach my next project.&lt;br</li>
      <li>easy to use with out a large mess</li>
      <li>I opened a new pad, then it took it off...</li>
      <li>They are flimsy and small and each one removes polish from at most 3 nails.</li>
      <li>A little bizarre on delivery.</li>
      <li>I use a base, color, and a top coat when I do my own nails</li>
      <li>Also this seller misleads, using a picture from a different company deliberately to mislead you into thinking their shoddy product is the better product pictured.</li>
      <li>The envelope and flat method of shipping new.</li>

<li> They had so little polish remover on them that they were completely ineffective.</li>
<li> And my nails are natural, I do not have long nails, so this is just very odd and a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> For planning purposes note that you&#x27;ll need one pad per hand and two pads per foot (for red or dark polish removal).</li>
<li> Wariness for travel with a bottle of polish remover due to too frequent leaks and spills...and messy when stored in a zip-type closure bag.&lt;br /</li>
<li> They arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
<li> practically dripping wet..</li>
<li> I tried one  tonight-----it was quite small and not very wet.  </li>
<li> But, I opened a pad, the pad was very wet-</li>
<li> Might needmore if its a really dark color.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with cotton balls anymore.</li>
<li> This is a very odd item...</li>
<li> These nail polish remover pads are so small that it takes about two pads for each hand</li>
<li> You must use at least 2 pads each time you remove the nail polish, but the packages are very small and discreat.  </li>
<li> These are very small.</li>
<li> These pads were useless.  </li>
<li> was disappointed to discover that the odor of these pads is much worse than the odor of acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t look dirty.</li>
<li> Does a bad job of removing polish too</li>
<li> This product is worthless.  </li>
<li> Smells horrible.</li>
<li> These are horrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t wear nail polish.  I use nail polish remover when I work with cyanoacrylate glue.  Polish remover quickly removes the offending glue, leaving me ready to approach my next project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several factors led me to buy these Nail Polish Remover Pads that contain no acetone.&lt;br /&gt;  Wariness for travel with a bottle of polish remover due to too frequent leaks and spills...and messy when stored in a zip-type closure bag.&lt;br /&gt;  Acetone-based polish remover pads are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t do well with the odor of acetone-based removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of these factors, I was excited to see these Nail Polish Remover Pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to note one of these pads easily manages to clean small amounts of glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to discover that the odor of these pads is much worse than the odor of acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to decide how to move these polish remover pads on to someone else.  Maybe I&#x27;ll take them to our neighborhood Buy Nothing Project...perhaps someone there is allergic to acetone.</li>
    <li> These nail polish remover pads are so small that it takes about two pads for each hand and then they don&#x27;t do a good job of getting the polish off.  I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a very odd item...&lt;br /&gt;This  might not make much sense... But, I opened a pad, the pad was very wet- practically dripping wet.. Which I thought was a good thing... I used it on my thumb nail first-removed it with ease, moved to the next finger- pad was wet and was far from covered in nail polish and the pad didnt do a thing to the next nail... I opened a new pad, then it took it off... Basically 1 pad per nail... And my nails are natural, I do not have long nails, so this is just very odd and a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;I can take off all my nail polish on all fingers and toes with one cotton ball with nail polish remover on it, so I have to say something is up with this item</li>
    <li> works but takes a lot of pads and pressure</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. Not like nail polish remover but something else. Does a bad job of removing polish too</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with cotton balls anymore. Received quickly and was able to use right away. Had to use two for all 10 toes though. Still very nice.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and good product</li>
    <li> These are horrible.  I suspected the low price was too good to be true, and it was.  They are flimsy and small and each one removes polish from at most 3 nails.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very nice fast service, the nail polish pads will make my job easier. I wont be using them for nail polish remover most of the time, but for removing sticky tape residue.</li>
    <li> Nice, but they do dry out after a couple of years if you don&#x27;t open them.</li>
    <li> Good for quick clean up</li>
    <li> These pads were useless.  They had so little polish remover on them that they were completely ineffective.</li>
    <li> Good for home, put a few in your purse and of course for travel.</li>
    <li> They arrived sooner than I expected. The small pads are perfect to take in your bag with you and work great.</li>
    <li> You must use at least 2 pads each time you remove the nail polish, but the packages are very small and discreat.  When you pull the pad out from the package it is very moist and removes the polish extremely easy. I like to keep a bunch in my office at work so it works well for me. The only issue is you have to use 2. Otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> exactly as described. haven&#x27;t tested to see if they actually work</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE. One pad doesn&#x27;t even clean one nail. I have natural nails and half the polish was already peeled off and I had to SCRUB my pinkie nail for over 5 minutes with one pad to get the polish off. DO NOT BUY THIS. I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK.</li>
    <li> not as good of quality as I expected</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly as described and what I ordered! But you will need more than one to do all ten nails...depends on the color and type of polish you use! But they work great and travel well!</li>
    <li> !  This product is worthless.  It took 10 pads to remove nail polish from the nails on both hands.  Save your money!  Also this seller misleads, using a picture from a different company deliberately to mislead you into thinking their shoddy product is the better product pictured.</li>
    <li> A little bizarre on delivery. Thepads were removed from box and box folded flat in envelope with pads on top. The envelope and flat method of shipping new. If it saves me money and limits packaging no problem</li>
    <li> great to carry around for when your nail polish suddenly gives out on you and it looks better to just take it off</li>
    <li> I bought these to take with me on vacation because I had my nail polish remover leak last year!  They take off the fingernail polish great!</li>
    <li> I tried one  tonight-----it was quite small and not very wet.  I got 2 nails completely clean, but the 3rd one did not get completely clean. Granted, I had on more than one coat of nail polish, maybe it would do 10 nails if there was only one coat.  The biggest plus for me be for when I am traveling, I&#x27;ll just have to take extra packages.</li>
    <li> One pad lasted all toes. Then 2 pads for all fingers. Might needmore if its a really dark color. I loved them tho...really convenient with snall children. I dont have to worry about a bottle of nail polish remover getting tipped over.</li>
    <li> they are okay, but do not work very well.  Since I cannot use acetone, maybe this is as good as it gets without it; I just do not know.</li>
    <li> works well. easy to use with out a large mess</li>
    <li> These are very small. They work fast and are great but I can&#x27;t get all ten nails done in one pad.</li>
    <li> I bought these to pack when I flew to Phoenix so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about liquid remover and they work pretty well.  It takes about 3 pads per hand.</li>
    <li> I find I can remove 10 fingers polish with 2 packets. Maybe other people use darker colors or more coats of polish but I find these to be extremely useful. Plus they&#x27;re thing and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> I took a pile of these with me to Europe for three weeks.  They took up very little space and did a great job.  For planning purposes note that you&#x27;ll need one pad per hand and two pads per foot (for red or dark polish removal).</li>
    <li> Very convenient.  Not a lot of remover on each pad.  But the price is so cheap it does not make a difference.</li>
    <li> I wish the pads were a little thicker so it doesn&#x27;t dry up as fast. I use a base, color, and a top coat when I do my own nails and it takes my 6 packets to remove nail polish. I only use these when I am on the go and one nail starts to chip so I have to remove all of them so it doesn&#x27;t look dirty. I love that I can carry them around with me though and always have a set of 6 in my purse ready for when I need it.</li>
