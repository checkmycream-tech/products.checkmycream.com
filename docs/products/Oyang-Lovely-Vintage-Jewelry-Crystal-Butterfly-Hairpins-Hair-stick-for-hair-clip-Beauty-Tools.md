<li> I have pretty thick hair</li>

<li> I like that this clip is long enough to hold my thick hair.  </li>
<li> I plan to give the other one to a friend.  </li>
<li> I have wanted some of style clips , but most were either poorly made for the money or too expensive..</li>
<li> Pretty, but very poorly made.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that this is heavy.</li>
<li> But, points to improve on: the transparent glue was obviously overused, and some plastic stones does not really fit in the metal casings either too big or too small, and, the big ones used for the butterfly which is the focal point, unfortunately looks quite dull and ran out of other colors to use there, why two reds?</li>
<li> I normally have a difficult time finding clips that will hold all of my hair.</li>
<li> I received it little delayed for like a week but</li>
<li> I wear my hair twisted up nearly every day at work.</li>
<li> I took it out and it had two stones missing on it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s well made but doesn&#x27;t have as firm of a spring as the ones sold by Plush Image (which are about triple the cost).</li>
<li> It also had 2 orange stones on one side of the butterfly and one blue and one green on the other, making the butterfly look awkward.</li>
<li> Heavy, I can&#x27;t hardly keep it in my hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way too big to just randomly tuck into an updo.</li>
<li> Maybe if I was 15 and had hair as thick and heavy as a horse or if I was a hooker and wanted to carry a &amp;#34;concealed&amp;#34;</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t hold thick hair, so I wear it over a ponytail or to dress up a bun.</li>
<li> Not very happy.</li>
<li> It came all the way from china, in a thin plastic wrapping.</li>
<li> It arrived broken, but I can&#x27;t imagine using it anyway.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I will be borrowing it often!</li>

    <li> Got the (2) items, and that was 3 days ago, finally! The color arrangements are well placed, looks very sturdy, holds my hair great! I plan to give the other one to a friend.  But, points to improve on: the transparent glue was obviously overused, and some plastic stones does not really fit in the metal casings either too big or too small, and, the big ones used for the butterfly which is the focal point, unfortunately looks quite dull and ran out of other colors to use there, why two reds?</li>
    <li> Heavy, I can&#x27;t hardly keep it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it looks amazing in my hair I had to buy more with the different colors because this one looks so great in my hair</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail. It came all the way from china, in a thin plastic wrapping. The wrapping looked like it had been through hell, scuffed up with holes in it. I took it out and it had two stones missing on it. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> Although it is a beautiful hairpin; I cannot use it because it is way to big to fit in my hair.  You really need long, thick hair for it to stay in or look good.  However, it has made a beautiful ornament for my dresser, so it was still a win for the price.</li>

    <li> Not worth the price. Stone missing right out of the box. Few day later more stones fell out. Pretty, but very poorly made.</li>
    <li> I love these hair pin&#x27;s. They work really well and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking. They are so pretty</li>
    <li> Awesome hair pin these hairpins are the most sturdy and beautiful....well worth the 3-4 weeks for shipping, always get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken, but I can&#x27;t imagine using it anyway. Maybe if I was 15 and had hair as thick and heavy as a horse or if I was a hooker and wanted to carry a &amp;#34;concealed&amp;#34; weapon right in my &amp;#34;hair do&amp;#34;. BTW, it&#x27;s HUGE. It also had 2 orange stones on one side of the butterfly and one blue and one green on the other, making the butterfly look awkward. I just really can&#x27;t think of an occasion where something this large and gawdy would be appropriate in the hair of a grown woman. It&#x27;s way too big to just randomly tuck into an updo.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair twisted up nearly every day at work. I have a plain clip I purchased from Ulta that works great, but isn&#x27;t nearly as pretty. I wanted something with some color and this clip is perfect. I have pretty thick hair and it holds my hair all day long. I normally have a difficult time finding clips that will hold all of my hair. My only complaint is that this is heavy. I found my self taking it out when I left work of the day. That said it is perfect!</li>
    <li> beautiful, but the jewels pop out and the metal is not strong enough.  it bends.</li>
    <li> This is even prettier than I had imagined, and bought it for my daughter.  Unfortunately, I will be borrowing it often!</li>
    <li> These are Great i have everyone of them they look great in your hair and everyone who see them loves them...very happy customers</li>
    <li> This is strong and sturdy, yet beautiful and delicate looking.  My daughter wore it in her hair to prom and danced all night and it stayed put.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend. She liked it. It seems like its pretty well made and is just as described.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a while, and the item arrived as pictured, but one of the &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; popped off when I got it out of the packaging.  I glued it back on, just as was originally done with all the plastic parts, and it was fine.  Just wouldn&#x27;t have it in the house with tiny kids who stick stuff in their mouths.  Otherwise it&#x27;s cute and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it.  It won&#x27;t hold thick hair, so I wear it over a ponytail or to dress up a bun.</li>
    <li> For the price, this hairpin was an excellent purchase.  I reordered two more for gifts and look forward to others enjoying this product as I have.</li>
    <li> Colors are so vibrant and pretty. All jewels are in tact. Great for bun or updo, and a little larger than you would expect. Great product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This arrived first off 3 weeks ahead of time, which I was very pleased about. This hairpin is so gorgeous and well made. Very sturdy, nice and heavy and the crystals are just very pretty. I bought a couple more to give away as presents. This was an amazing buy and I highly recommend it. I will be buying more of these in every style they offer.</li>
