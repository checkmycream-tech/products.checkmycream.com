      <li>/&gt;I am very pleased that WaterPik saw fit to supply the repair kit.  </li>
      <li>I gave up at that point and considered it a worth while try and had it been successful</li>
      <li>It functioned better than the original - cosmetically, it didn&#x27;t look as good, but the tubing made it longer which made it easier to use.  </li>
      <li>Hope you were able to follow me throughout this dissertation.  </li>
      <li>DON&#x27;T FORGET TO MAKE SURE</li>

      <li>Surely the maker of this thing could do better than this.</li>
      <li>I have even tried the heating method, to try to &#x27;shrink wrap&#x27; the hose safely onto the connector.  </li>

      <li>Mostly, the replacement process went well.</li>
      <li>WaterPik should use better material to make hoses for their systems.</li>
      <li>it works better than when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>If you do so you need to be sure it is correctly placed and has the correct curve coming out of the unit.</li>
      <li>My hose had gotten brittle and snapped off when I put the top on with the hose sticking out.</li>
      <li>Although this may the best (only) choice for repairing a Water-Pik with a damaged tube or nozzle.</li>
      <li>I saved a bunch of money and kept more junk out of the landfill.  </li>
      <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>If you understand all of the reviews and believe it is OK for you, buy it.</li>
      <li>Best not to stretch the hose any more than absolutely necessary when you use it, else the combination of the vibration &amp; the hose&#x27;s brittleness (esp with age) will break it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works fine.  One little problem: they give you a splicer to join the hose from the new wand to the piece of hose coming out of the Waterpik.  The splicer basically did not work, as water pressure forced it apart after a few uses.  So I took the Waterpik apart and joined the new hose onto the fitting inside the unit.  That worked.</li>
    <li> This repair kit needs to be upgraded. almost impossible to get the tube on the handle or the base. Quite challenging.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions&lt;br /&gt;1.  Do not assemble the unit and cut the hose about 4&amp;#34; from the unit.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Boil water in a pan, soak the cut of the tip of the unit&#x27;s hose for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Align to the coil hose and then push the hot hose tip to the repair hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are now done.</li>
    <li> The replacement had a connection that was not a duplicate of the old one being replaced.  In the process of trying to make the connection the fitting on the equipment to which it was to be attached broke. I gave up at that point and considered it a worth while try and had it been successful all would have been well.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great repair to an otherwise fine water pic. Apparently, the tubes get brittle and die before the rest of the appliance.</li>
    <li> I decided to attach the hose to the inside of the unit since the old hose was brittle. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you&#x27;re not mechanically inclined as it is difficult to reassemble the unit. Once I got it put back together though, it works great. If you have to take the pump unit apart, carefully remove the plastic switch from the housing. This will make assembly a lot easier. Also, make sure the tank tube is lined up with the pump pipe post when you put the housing back on. I didn&#x27;t get this right the first time and ended up with water leaking everywhere.</li>
    <li> This kit more than met my expectatiions. It included not only the hose with an attached handle, but an additional hose. I used the additional hose for my very old WaterPik Model 300-W. It worked perfectly after removing the handle from my old hose and placing it on the new hose. All you need to do is carefully remove the collar that secures the old hose to the handle by sliding it away from the handle. I used a very small flat-blad screwdriver to do that. Then, just pull out the old handle from the old hose, slide the old collar over the new hose (narrow end first) push the old handle into the new hose, then slide the old collar up and over the ring created when the old handle was inserted into the new hose. Then, you can just cut off the old hose near the base unit and use the connector that comes in the kit to attach it to the old hose. If your old hose isn&#x27;t suitable for cutting and splicing to the new hose, you can carefully disassemble the 300-W base, remove the old hose from the pump assembly, attach the new hose to the pump assembly, then reassemble the base unit. I have done both solutions with no problems.  Highly recommended even if your WaterPik is like my 25-year old Model 300-W.</li>
    <li> I was waterpik-ing and my handle broke from normal wear. What a shame to have to throw away the whole unit because of one little part! So I googled \\&quot;Waterpik repair\\&quot; and this product popped up on a link to Amazon.com.  I bought and installed it and have been using it with no problems. It was a bit difficult to get the fitting on, but it is on tight and holds well in spite of the pressure exerted by the water. I would recommend being careful to dip the end in hot water as the instructions tell you, but there is no clip or mechanism of any kind to help you keep it in the water (that is why four stars and not five). I found it difficult to hold the end in hot water since the flex tubing is coiled and you have to have your hand close to the steam from the water.  During the first few uses, I held the line wondering if the product would work or if it would come apart and water would fly everywhere, but it held and now I don&#x27;t even think about it when I use it. Good job on a clever product.</li>
    <li> This replacement water hose repair kit does not fit my water pik unit.  There is no other replacement kit so I didn&#x27;t order the&lt;br /&gt;wrong one - it just doesn&#x27;t fit.  The handle does not properly fit the tools to be used.  It has a octagon space inside while the tools&lt;br /&gt;all have round handles.</li>
    <li> Did not work out for me</li>
    <li> I agree, don&#x27;t waste your money on this repair kit.  The old pipe just kept splitting while trying to insert the connector for the new pipe.  This is the third Water Pik that has had the pipe break.  No more Water Piks for me.</li>
    <li> A fine replacement to my failed hose.  Shortening the old hose didn&#x27;t last but for a week or two, certainly not worth all the effort; that hose was &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;.  So starting over with new materials is the answer, working fine now for months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I suspect when/if this one fails I will think it time to replace the Whole waterpik....  I am convinced they are a teeth/gum Saver~~ I enjoy my daily use)</li>
    <li> My hose had gotten brittle and snapped off when I put the top on with the hose sticking out.I was very skeptical about ordering this after the reviews...but decided to give it a try. I have the old style one with the Hex-shaped piks, and that&#x27;s what the picture was when I ordered it. I saw some reviews that claimed to have a newer, inaccurate picture, they must have changed it since then.&lt;br /&gt;It went well! I didn&#x27;t have hemostats and such things, but it went fine with a flathead screwdriver, and a pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;Getting the base and cover apart was probably the most time consuming. I didn&#x27;t need to take the motor off or anything like that...the little clear piece that came attached to the new hose was not needed. The one inside my unit was fine, so I took a chance and cut it off. Just attached the cut hose over the existing coupling( it&#x27;s probably not called a coupling but I don&#x27;t know what else to call it, lol). I was concerned that it might leak or pop off but so far , so good. Figured I could always use some glue or Sugru to make it stop coming off, but so far I have not needed to.&lt;br /&gt;I think the hardest part was trying to get the on/off switch post to go back in to the mechanism correctly. That part got a little girly, lol. I wasted about 10 minutes trying to rig it in completely ineffective ways. Then I realized you can just pull the switch off, put the cover back on, line up the two pieces and snap it back together.&lt;br /&gt;So, for the cost of this part and about 30 minutes, I saved my 12 year old Water Pik.</li>
    <li> This may not work for you, but it just worked for me and took about three minutes. My leak was in the first inch below the handle. I cut the inch off, pried the short leaky section of hose up with pliers and pulled it out. I then simply worked the new hose end into place over the male fitting, and my Waterpik is back in business. I got the idea from the following comments by a person who had bought the replacement kit on a site titled My Adult Braces, though the instructions there sound a bit more complicated:   When the replacement handle came, I saw how it attached to the hose. I decided to see if I could use the old handle. I cut off the hose where the break was. There is a little plastic piece where the hose entered the handle. The piece locks the hose in place. Using a knife, I pried up the little piece to release the lock. The with the piece locked up, I pulled it out with some pliers. Now with the lock removed, I needed to remove the small piece of hose. The hose is pushed onto a small plastic tube. I tried pulling the hose off, but that didn&#x27;t work. I ended up using a sharp pointed knife to slice the hose off the small tube. That worked.  I cleaned up the end of the hose. I slid the small plastic lock piece onto he hose. Then I pushed the hose onto the small plastic tube in the handle. Then I slid the lock piece down, and locked it into place. My repaired Watepik works great. I still have the unused replacement handle. Not sure what I will do with it. I will probably just hang onto it in case the handle I have breaks.</li>
    <li> Like so many consumer products these days, this item was designed to fail. One more for the Ralph Nader list....</li>
    <li> If you use your waterpik at a high setting (4 or 5), this may work. However, 3 or less will blow the connection loose, so be sure to move anything you don&#x27;t want to get wet when the connection comes loose. This uses a barbed plastic connection to attach this kit to the old water line, but has no clamp or anything to keep it from slipping off of the old water line. You will have to heat up the old line with very hot water just to push the barb all the way in (or else lookout when you turn it on). I waited too long to use it so could not return it. Should have ordered replacement rather than waste money on this product. The problem is the old hose is no longer flexible and the barb connector will not insert without the old tube breaking... even if you can force it in. Would have been nice if they designed the unit so the hose could be replaced on the unit instead of splicing into old plastic tubing.</li>
    <li> This replacement handle and hose worked great! To make an invisible connection to the existing hose I simply removed the cover and made a connection close to a small piece of hose extending from the pump. Total time to do the repair was about ten minutes. I took the advice given in the instructions and heated the tubing in hot water before connecting the hose sections. I&#x27;m back in business and hope to get another few years worth of service from the machine. Would purchase again.    PS: While I had the cover off I put a few drops of oil on the crankshaft and small dab of grease on the gearing. Now it runs quieter as well.</li>
    <li> perfect part, timely service</li>
    <li> This is pretty useful, if comes with a document on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two used waterpick machine, both of them need this replacement. After breaking one of them, I learned how to use this, and it works. Before buying this thing, I do suggest you read all of the reviews. If you understand all of the reviews and believe it is OK for you, buy it. Otherwise, buy a new machine and save you some time and money.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over two weeks and still cannot connect the hoses.  I have had others with more strength than me try and they cannot do it either.  I am still not able to use the appliance.  Very disappointed.  And the extra piece of hose--what is that for??</li>
    <li> The kit was as described and shipping was prompt. My unit was in working condition except for the multiple tubing leaks. Found the repair kit to be an excellent economical &amp; environmental option rather to buying a new oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> Depending on where your original hose was broken (mine at the connection inside), you need to take the unit apart.  It did fix my leaking hose but not easy.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money !!! Did not work - leaked like a sieve. Cost me $13 with shipping. I could have applied that to the purchase of a new water-pik. I would not order this product again, and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ours is a WP 70. The hose had cracked a couple of inches out of the base and was spraying water everywhere so a new hose was in order. The package came with a hose/handle assembly and an extra hose (for next time, I guess. Another five years?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay attention to how everything comes apart. Everything goes back on the same way it came off. There are very few parts inside. The only screws are the two holding the motor on. Everything else snaps together. Be careful how hard you pry things apart so you don&#x27;t break anything. I started by prying off the base from the internal assembly which required inserting small screwdrivers around the bottom periphery to hold the retaining clip-tabs open and then just sliding the interior assembly out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ours is several years old and I had to clean it up after getting it apart. I ended-up completely taking everything apart and cleaning. God knows what grows in there in a damp environment! (I just won&#x27;t think about this the next time I use it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to thread the new hose through the opening in the cover where the old one was. The replacement hose I received was pre-configured with a little plastic nozzle that my unit did not need so I trimmed it off. The hose then just pushed back on to the male port on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slide for the power switch should be popped off by squeezing the clips on the inside of the cover. This has a long pin that will be re-inserted through a loop inside after you have gotten everything else back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine back together without breaking anything and it worked the first time! I was shocked. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is the repair kit for the older model, which I have. It worked as advertised. I&#x27;m glad I left the waterline extra long as it periodically splits at the repair connection and must be reworked. The picture I was presented was not the product I received. The product I received was what I needed. The reviews on the repair kit helped me determine it was right before I ordered, thanks to the helpful reviews. The fact the original machine was not easily reparable is an original manufacturer issue, and not a reflection on the repair kit itself.</li>
    <li> comes with an insert tip so you can just cut the existing hose and insert the new one without taking the waterpick apart. I chose to take apart and go directly to the pump inside. Product worked well, need to use hairdryer to soften end and glue if you attach it directly to the pump, worked well none the less.  Glad I paid no attention to the negative write ups have a 10 yr old pik that&#x27;s now like new. Bought a brand new pick for another bathroom  since I think water pik products could outlast your teeth</li>
    <li> My review is strictly meant to help others who are having difficulty attempting to replace the handle assembly including the hose. I purchased the identical kit directly from the Waterpik-Store for $8.99 plus P&amp;H total $12.94. However, the item shown is the same thing. Very easy installation/replacement. This chore was completed in approximately 10 minutes. My unit is WP-100&lt;br /&gt;When reading other reviews I noted another member who suggested using the Waterpik Store as well. Good Luck</li>
    <li> Do not buy this kit.  The reason your hose broke to begin with is it has become brittle with age.  Thus, the plastic connector that attaches the new hose line to the old hose will continue to break through the old hose side.  As well, the new hose will not stay lodged into the tip connector.  I have even tried the heating method, to try to &#x27;shrink wrap&#x27; the hose safely onto the connector.  And, waterpik (thoughtfully) allows no access to attach the new hose directly to the motor (which would alleviate one of these problems).  So we are all stuck replacing our waterpiks every 18 - 24 months, as I have done for about 15 years now.</li>
    <li> I had no problem splicing the hose according to the instructions.  I was surprised to find out, however, that the new handle did not accept the jet tips that came with my Waterpik.  I had to order new ones -- \\&quot;BRJ\\&quot; tips.  Amazon should advise customers ordering this hose repair kit about the need for the different tips, so that they can order them at the same time.  The delay and extra shipping cost were irritating.</li>
    <li> Bought this kit to repair my Oral-B (Braun) Professional Care 8900 DLX OxyJet Oral Care Center. Similar diameter hose attached securely to both connectors on the Oral-B unit. With Oral-B repair kit not available, this is the only option to get your 8900 back in service. Crack open the handle, clip the hose at both ends, and attach it to your 8900. Works great.</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews. This replacement part is not the same as the one on the original WaterPik. None of the tips will fit. I was not satisfied with what they sent me so I returned it in their box with the return label. Boy was I surprised when they did not accept the return and sent it back to me. I made lots of waves with Amazon who did finally refund my account.Do yourself a favor and spend $30 more and buy a new WaterPik</li>
    <li> Following the instructions, it&#x27;s very difficult to attach the new hose to the old. After managing doing so, it leaked at the connection. I redid it three times. Questioned, Waterpik suggested me to buy a new machine!</li>
    <li> It was the wrong handle for the model of water pik that i own.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why it showed up when I input my model number of water pik.</li>
    <li> Read the other reviews.  This product is great and exactly like the original.  But if your plastic tubing is brittle like mine was, the recommended repair included in the kit will not work.  One needs to be comfortable in disassembling the irrigator.  I recommend you disassemble your unit first down to the pumping mechanism before ordering this item.  See if you are comfortable at doing a new connection at the pump cock.  I repaired my unit at the pump level and it works like the original.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected. I&#x27;m very happy. The old handle&#x27;s rubber seals started to deteriorate. This was much less expensive than buying a whole new unit. Just takes a little do it yourself talent to take apart the case and replace the previous hose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a WP-20 WaterPik for years. The hose split from use, but this kit provides exactly the hose I need to replace the damaged one. And delivery was very quick.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to repair my water pic! Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The WaterPik hose repair kit with handle was so easy to install. Also it came with a small instuction sheet how to replace the hose.</li>
    <li> The hose they send is about 10 inches shorter than the original for some reason.  That is annoying but not critical. They send you a little plastic connector piece to splice to your old hose.  The connector is pretty useless because it restricts the water through a narrow opening.  I removed the entire old hose and connected this new one to the waterpik unit itself.  Had to use the hair dryer to heat the hose end so it can slip onto the waterpik unit fitting easily, and then when it cools a bit the hose shrinks a small amount to form a good seal so it doesn&#x27;t leak.  There are nice Youtube videos showing how to get the waterpic unit open.</li>
    <li> TELEDYNE you need to make your hose out of more pliable material. I have tubing for a fountain that has lasted for years and is just as pliable as it was from day one, and it came from a big box hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;I also work with tubing in the medical field and never had an issue with brittle/breakage.&lt;br /&gt;My hose does not need to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It needs to last.&lt;br /&gt;Why wouldn&#x27;t you want a &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; product?&lt;br /&gt;The hose is the main complaint for any waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Fix it!</li>
    <li> speedy delivery and easy to install. worked fine.</li>
    <li> We ordered this repair kit because my husband uses the waterpik device daily due to an extreme sinus condition.  According to the instructions you cut the current cord a few inches out and apply the new hose.  Problem is the old hose is so brittle that when you insert the device to splice the hoses together, the old one splits and crumbles.  Not a good fix.</li>
    <li> I uploaded a picture of what was sent me. The official picture is of a new style handle with a round hole.  What was sent was the old style handle which has a hex hole for the tip and a sliding pressure controller on the handle.    If you need a replacement for an old style handle then I assume this will work for you.  But if you only have a button on the handle and the hole for your tip is circular not hexagonal, then this will not work.    Again, when I ordered a picture of a handle with a blue button was displayed.  This picture ought to be removed as it is inaccurate.  I am guessing that Goodman has so many products that the wrong picture just slipped through.  My order did include tubing, an old style handle and the angle piece that connects to the base.    I gave this one star because it was clearly not what was displayed in the picture.</li>
    <li> I had no problem with it.  Some improvements must have been made as the tip is easier to rotate when cleaning your teeth.  I took the unit apart and installed the hose on the inside just like it came from the factory.  If you do so you need to be sure it is correctly placed and has the correct curve coming out of the unit.</li>
    <li> Perfect kit, all you need to repair the waterpik.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great, it&#x27;s used all the time and we love it. I would recommend this to anyone. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> The waterpik is great I just ordered the wrong one my other parts do not connect in the top end.</li>
    <li> you have to be willing to take the base apart and remove the old hose.  the way the instructions read (inserting the new hose into the old hose) will not work.  the old hose will just break again.    some people will be unable or unwilling to take the thing apart.</li>
    <li> easy repair and lots less expensive than buying a new one. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> It functioned better than the original - cosmetically, it didn&#x27;t look as good, but the tubing made it longer which made it easier to use.  I would have given it five stars if they had supplied a cover for the patch where the repair was made!  Good product! Thanks</li>
    <li> Read first the instructions, do not disassembly the Water Pik if it is not necessary as it is some tricky. Already installed, works perfect.</li>
    <li> This hose kit really requires more effort than advertised, but it was the correct thing to do. Just splicing this kit into the hose is not the best thing to do since the entire hose is old and brittle. Fortuitously You Tube had a video of the correct technique to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good replacement for an &#x27;old&#x27; hose assembly.</li>
    <li> waterpick helped me to mantain good my teeth and is a good product&lt;br /&gt;so, Yes I wolud recommend this product</li>
    <li> Tricky to install. Don&#x27;t bother trying to use the inline coupler, if your hose is broken or calcified the coupler won&#x27;t work the hose will just crack again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look on Youtube for  DIY videos to take the whole water pic apart...its tricky but doable...if you&#x27;re patient. Definitely cheaper than replacing the entire unit.</li>
    <li> Got this like a half a year ago, installed it, and it&#x27;s still going strong now.  The main trick is, do NOT try to attach it to the old hose, because the old hose is brittle and will probably break again. Instead, take off the outer shell from the main waterpik unit, pull the old hose off the little nozzle inside, and slide the new hose right on where the old one used to be. Reassemble the unit, and it&#x27;s good as new!  Tips and tricks for the repair procedure:  1. it will take a little force to take off the old hose - use a pair of needlenose pliers, and be VERY careful to pull straight out, not to break the nozzle tip.  2. it&#x27;ll also take some patience to slide the new hose onto the nozzle. just be careful, and slowly coax the hose onto the nozzle tip. a little help from the needlenose pliers may be helpful, but i found that with a little lubrication with water, and some patient coaxing, the hose slid on.  3. of course, before connecting the new hose, thread it through the exit hole in the outer shell of the unit (where the hose normally comes out of). you would hate yourself if you spend all the effort to attach the new hose, and then discover that you forgot tho feed the hose through the hole in the shell, and have to take it off and redo it. (thankfully i realized that i had to feed the hose through the shell before i connected the new hose!)  4. taking off the shell can be a pain, but is relatively easy. unscrew a couple of screws, then you may have to use a screwdriver to convince the shell to come off, since there are snap-notches in the shell holding it onto the body of the unit.  5. when putting the shell back on, you should take the sliding power switch off the shell first. just squeeze the snap notches from the inside, carefully (!), and the slider switch will come out. once you put the shell back on after you attach the new handle, you can just snap the slider switch right back on. (you can do it without taking off the switch, but it&#x27;s a lot easier if youdo since things just go on nice and smooth and straight without the switch interfering.)  That&#x27;s it. If you&#x27;re handy with basic household tools and can take things apart and put them back together, you should be able to do this whole operation within about a half hour.</li>
    <li> I purchased the WaterPik repair kit (then subsequently had to order new \\&quot;piks\\&quot; as the old ones did not fit in the new handle).  After one week the new hose blew out of the old hose where it was connected as the old hose had developed a tear at the connection site.  This was a complete and total waste of time and money. Why WaterPik doesn&#x27;t make a kit to replace the part that you can unscrew underneath the unit that has the hose connection and the assembly then connects directly to the pump...but I quess we all know THAT answer; they want you to have to purchase an entire new unit!  Do not waste your money on this useless kit.</li>
    <li> Apparently the tubing deteriorates over time.  This comes with a fitting so you can cut the old one off and stick this one on.  I took the appliance apart and replaced the tubing at the source and it looks and functions like new.  Can&lt;br /&gt;t beat that for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally received an incorrect part but it was replaced with no problems and fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is ideal to repair your WaterPik hose or control valve and the installation is simple. Great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was prompt and this item was as represented. Easy transaction and great service.</li>
    <li> was what i expected but old hose was brittle and the little adapter would just crack the old hose. i just&lt;br /&gt;open the unit and connected the hose top the pump. works fine</li>
    <li> Wrong handle didn&#x27;t fit my nozzles.  Used the hose and thru the rest away. You need more description when selling parts so we can order the right parts.</li>
    <li> Did not go on as easily as described.  Finally, soaked old remnant in VERY hot water (as suggested) and also had a little oil on the connector, and used 2 pliers to slowly push on.  Worked adequately.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace the new hose kit. Works great!</li>
    <li> This repair kit saved a perfectly good waterpik and kept it out of the landfil. I did ignore the directions and took the bottom of the unit off and replaced the entire hose rather than couple the new to the old. Very satisfied with the product and the company.</li>
    <li> It is ridiculously easy to defeat the original design of this product and make it work on your Waterpik product.  I bought this several years ago and installed it on my WP-30.  I&#x27;m fairly certain my model is called a WP-30 because it&#x27;s at least 30 years old.  Anyway, I bought the replacement handle and installed it to the main output on the Waterpik pump (instead of splicing it into the old &amp; brittle hose that had broken in the first place) and all was good with the world.  Or so I believed.  I soon discovered that none of my Waterpik attachments would fit the new handle.  So I dejectedly threw it into a drawer in the bathroom vanity.  I recently started shopping for a new Waterpik and stumbled onto the page @ Goodman&#x27;s ((via Amazon.com) where I bought my replacement long ago)) and found they had updated the product information to include the fact that the new handle would convert to the new style WP-BRJ tips.  So I belatedly ordered the new tips a few days ago and just had my first Waterpik experience in many, many years.  I soon realized how much I had missed it.  The nice thing about this handle is it provides several controls - including water pressure, on/off switch, and a device that lets you rotate the head.  My vague memory leads me to believe that the newer WP-BRJ tips provide a much better blast to the gums than the original equipment tips (which are no longer available).  If you have an older Waterpik and wish to revive it, I highly recommend this product.  Just follow the instructions from the other reviewers on how to remove the body &amp; attach the replacement hose directly to the pump (it&#x27;s been so long since I did it, I have absolutely no recollection of how it was done - but if I can do it, so can you).  All in all, between the replacement head and the four pack of WP-BRJ piks (which will likely last another 20 years (www dot goodmans dot net slash i slash 3952 slash replacement dash brj dash jet dash tips dash fits dash waterpik dot htm (ten bucks forfour, half the price I found anywhere else) I spent roughly twenty bucks.  Far cheaper than buying a new Waterpik.  Plus, if I recall correctly, this kit includes two lengths of tubing.  One of which should be used immediately and the other should be vacuum sealed and stuffed into a dark bathroom vanity drawer (and clearly labeled) for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> years ago this was a repair process that took a lot of time. now it is so quick and easy.</li>
    <li> perfect replacement piece. our waterpik is at least 30 or more years old and still going strong.  just needed a new hose.  this fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> The tips I had didn&#x27;t fit the repair kit in spite of looking as if they would.  It would have been helpful to include the exact dimensions of the replacement tips needed.  The old hose was too stiff for me to cut and heat it.  I used the web to find directions to open the Water Pik and install the tubing inside.</li>
    <li> It installed easily.&lt;br /&gt;One small picky issue:  It is stiff by design (so that the tube coils up when not in use) but it is a little too stiff to easily maneuver the handle.  I&#x27;ve accidentally pulled the base unit off the counter because of the stiffness.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works just as the original.  Be sure to heat in water before installing as instructions state.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and much cheaper than a new waterpik.  To install it you only need a pair of scissors or a sharp knife.</li>
    <li> When my waterpik started leaking at the handle and had no pressure, I threw it in the trash and priced new models.  What a shock!  A quick Amazon.com search for repair parts located this replacement kit for less than 1/5 the price of a new machine.  The repair could not have been easier, directions were included and spot on.  I think the Waterpik works better now than when new, not leaking and pumping more pressure than my gums can tolerate.  What a great fix!</li>
    <li> Easy to follow instructions, took 5 minutes to install, saved money by not needing to buy a whole new unit, works as it was as new.</li>
    <li> Anyone who doesn&#x27;t use WaterPik by now is missing out big time as this is one of the best inventions since sliced bread.  I had to replace the handle because of design problem.  There is one fitting for the handle that has a gum massager tip.  By design, it allows less water to flow through it while the user water-picks and massages the gums at the same time.  Unfortunately, the gum massager can only be used on the low flow setting.  I had used my previous handle on a setting too high and the handle mechanism failed internally and began leaking.  (My bad.)  I replaced the handle and did not have to buy a whole new WaterPik.  (Thank you.)  The replacement handle was very easy to install.  It also included some very strongly stated directions that when using the gum massager tip, to use only the low setting.  Ah-ha, so that was my problem.  All is corrected and me and my teeth are happy again.</li>
    <li> It works very well and is a very acceptable replacement for the original - couldn&#x27;t use the pik without it.</li>
    <li> I was able to repair two waterpiks with these hose repair kits. It&#x27;s nice both economically and environmentally to know I can repair these without throwing them out.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T THROW THE WATER PIC UNIT IN THE TRASH. TOTAL REPAIR IN FIVE MINUTES INCLUDING THE TIME TO OPEN THE PACKAGE.</li>
    <li> It failed after 4 uses.  This design works with water only and will not work with mouthwash in the irrigation solution.  While talking to service, I concluded that apparently is uses a very old generation of O-rings on the handle push button.  They swell and cause the button to jam.  The use of a much newer material for the O-rings would solve the problem.  The unit that I was repairing had been in use every day for about 8 years with no problem unit the button assembly had a catastrophic failure, i.e., it fell apart.</li>
    <li> Did NOT FIT my water pic. I must have an older model, or something! No use to me. NOT Amazon&#x27;s fault!</li>
    <li> Great replacement part as I did not have to buy another water pik but simply repaired it by replacing with this item.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x60;t  sure ,  why  the water pik needed a  splice ,  to attach to old hose on my machine ,  { when  someone has  one of the older units,  the  hose  is pretty much  rotten ,  will not accept the splice ,  }  so what I had  to do was  , take apart  my water pik base unit , take off the old hose ,  cut off the splice section of my new water pik , and  push the new hose onto the old unit where  the old hose had been connected.... { take care of reassembly , used  a  sturdy straight  small tube , went through the water reservoir feed to pump on top of the unit ,  too guide  the  lower section back to home position,  also making sure , the  new hose section  and power cord were in the correct position as I closed the two sections back together }  it did  take  2 try&#x60;s ,  fist  was to check for  leaks ,,  works  fine now ....{  footnote ... it  was  a bit tricky to get unit apart first try }</li>
    <li> The handle to my water pick was leaking and this kit was an easy method for repairing it and putting it back in working order.</li>
    <li> Probably a waste of money because it didnt work as a replacement for the one that i had that looked different.  but i thought for a few bucks i would try it.</li>
    <li> This repair kit fixed my old waterpik that the tubing was splitting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes all assembled with a barred connection on the end of the tube. You are suppose to cut off your old handle from the tube and then insert the connector into the old tube. No surprise my old tube kept splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other fix. Pop off the bottom of the waterpik unit exposing the pump. Take off the old hose where it connects to the water pump. Cut the connector off your new repair kit hose close to the connector. Cut straight. Insert the new tube onto the pump connector. Make sure you run the new tube through the top cover hole before making the connection to the pump. The tube curves into the the curve post. This helps keep the tube connected to the pump. Pop back on the top cover making sure the protruding water pipe from the bottom goes into the tube in the top that goes to the water reservoir. You may also have to pop out the outside electrical pump switch and match it to the loop lever inside. May sound a little complicated but it will make sense if you pop off the top and look around inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my old Waterpik is back to working. It has a better water pump than the newer Waterpik models. I bought a new one and it failed within a year and Waterpik gave me the run around that it was mineral build up. No. Our water is very clean and my old Waterpik has been running for 6-7 years with no problem.</li>
    <li> You are wasting your money on this repair kit. The hose breaks because it is brittle. It will eventually break at a point where you no longer can attach replacement hose at the unit or wand end. Thus - your WaterPik is ready for the trash can.    Hmmm, is this by design. Has a \\&quot;consumable\\&quot; been built in to this great product? I think so.    For this reason, I will buy no more WaterPiks. Surely, better design can come up with a hose formulation that does not become brittle.</li>
    <li> Beats the heck out of trying to replace the older, reliable, Water Pik with a newer Water Pik model.</li>
    <li> Be sure to read the product description before purchasing this.  You will probably need to purchase new tips to fit the handle that comes with the hose.  I would purchase them from Goodman&#x27;s- not from another picture listed with this item.  They may not necessarily be the right ones.  While I had an issue with Goodman&#x27;s on this initially, they made it right and I applaud their concern for their customers!</li>
    <li> The old hose got torn by the connection which is too thick. I had to buy a new device.</li>
    <li> It only took five minutes to be as good as new. Cut the cord and stick on the bee one.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor sent the wrong item initially, but sent the right one with a rerun envelope as soon as I contacted them.&lt;br /&gt;great customer service!</li>
    <li> Great replacement part for our waterpik. Saved me money from buying a new one.</li>
    <li> Succinctly, this did its purpose and now I am able to use my WaterPik again.  That makes me happy!  Sure, it&#x27;s not an elegant solution; however, it works well in sure beats having to buy a new system when the base is working totally fine.  Just wished more things worked this way.</li>
    <li> My waterPik works like  new. This replacement kit made my 10 year old waterPic works just great. Without leaks and a strong stream.</li>
    <li> Easy to install! Love that we now have a clean, functioning waterpik! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had a little trouble at first trying to hook this to the existing hose, but then I heated it with a hair dryer and have been using it now for a few months!</li>
    <li> This would have gotten five stars had it been easier to do. I watched several YouTubes and in the end decided to open it up and attach the new hose to the base rather than splice it to the old hose...eliminating the continuing breakage of old parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 6 butter knives to open base. Pulled off the old hose and cut the end of the new hose removing the splicer. I boiled the new tubing for about ten seconds, fed hose through exterior housing and using needle nose pliers attached the hose to the motor. Then I detached the on/off switch from the exterior housing (I couldn&#x27;t line it up right) snapped the whole thing back together and snapped back on the on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 10 minutes. I am a 35 year old female and not an engineer. I&#x27;ve missed my waterpik!</li>
    <li> Connector too large. Original hose has smaller diameter. Otherwise this was the answer</li>
    <li> You can resolve the hose damage and run the water pik again.</li>
    <li> Is difficult to install. Very tight fit. You will need two pair of pliers to insert the replacement tube into the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Do not cut the old tube too short. makes it more difficult to handle.</li>
    <li> The handle was fairly easy to replace but only lasted about 8 months before the button valve that allows you to temporarily stop the flow of water started sticking in the off position and would open only if manually &#x27;wiggled&#x27;.  Tried everything to get it to operate normally again (ran white vinegar through the unit to dissolve any possible buildup from minerals in the water, ran food-grade mineral oil and water through the unit to try and lubricate the moving parts but no luck).  I&#x27;m trying to decide whether or not to replace the handle once more or to get a new unit.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is merely coincidental but the problem with the button valve showed up after I started adding a small amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the water in the tank to provide for better cleaning. The H2O2 shouldn&#x27;t have affected any of the plastic parts but perhaps the return spring in the button valve is not stainless steel?</li>
    <li> This is where internet shopping really shines.  The hose on my Water pick broke.  i would not have had a clue where to look locally to fine a replacement.  A quick search on Amazon found this little unit.  For $20 I was able to easily fix my Water Pik like new so I saved about $30 over the cost of replacing the whole unit.</li>
    <li> So far so good. A great replacement and just a little less expensive (by 50%) than buying a new Water-pik.</li>
    <li> Works like they said. Very pleased with product. You need to heat tube in very hot water. Go inside case where tubing is still good</li>
    <li> It failed to attach as per instructions, resulting in the destruction of the entire WaterPik.  It appeared to be a good idea but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The kit worked fine. The rest of the unit quit working  soon after install.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your fast delivered, I follow the instructions from your company and worked,&lt;br /&gt;now I am using the water pick  it works better than when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for saving me some $$ I just Love it! I highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> The experts at WaterPik may be able to insert the barb in the old hose, but neither my wife nor I could. Amazon.comshould be ashamed to sell something ordinary customers can not assemble.</li>
    <li> Mostly, the replacement process went well. However, I found it difficult to slip the hard plastic tip onto the end of the trimmed original tube.</li>
    <li> Works great, saved me a lot versus buying a new WaterPik.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really cheap, more like frugal. My waterpik is 16 months old and the hose broke at the handle. It would kill me to buy a new one over a broken hose. I got a small screwdriver and pryed the bushing out that holds the hose in. got a needle nose pliers and pulled out the small piece of old hose,slide the bushing back on the hose, Push the hose back into the handle and push the bushing back in. And wala, cheap Joe is back in business for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.</li>
    <li> Worked great with my older WaterPik. Saved on having to buy another whole new system. Easy to install. I ran it right to the pump. Did not splice. No leaks</li>
    <li> I threw away about $20 by buying two kits.  There was no way to access the innards of the pump to remove the old tubing, so I carefully followed the directions for splicing the new kit onto the old tube.  Despite following the directions exactly, heating the old tube to soften it, the old tube was so brittle that it split when I pushed the fitting into it.  This happened on both of our WaterPiks.  Terrible rip-off.</li>
    <li> The repair kit works very well. It&#x27;s actually better than the original because the détente switch that varies water pressure has more pronounced clicks and stays in one position more reliably. With the original, the switch often slid up and down at the slightest touch, and that meant I could accidentally switch it to highest pressure, which I don&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> Works great but at an incredible price for three pieces of plastic... oh well you need what you need!</li>
    <li> It was fine, It was the wrong part for the WaterPick I owned.  Maybe, it will work for my new one, when it gives out</li>
    <li> Barely useable, as it is well nigh impossible to connect the little white tube to the waterpik itself.  But with surgical tape and a lot of pushing hard I made it.  Surely the maker of this thing could do better than this.</li>
    <li> Simple, straightforward and very easy to install.  About a quarter the cost of replacing the entire water pik unit.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> My handle had broke and this replacement was easy to install and seems to do the job.  I like it  G</li>
    <li> I have taken apart, repaired, lubed and reassembled the same WaterPik numerous times. The only difficult aspect is DISASSEMBLING the base and/or the handle. To take apart the base remove the bottom screws AND have handy some popsicle sticks. Pry between the bottom plate and the side of the cover and insert a stick as you work around and between the bottom and the top cover. You will need to insert about five sticks at which point the cover will disengage. Once open, you should take the pump apart and use this opportunity to lubricate the pump gears and piston. Usually you will find a little excess grease around the pump. Using a toothpick, move the grease onto the moving parts. If not enough grease present, simply use a little petroleum jelly such as Vaseline. Attach a new water hose or shorten the existing one cutting out the cracked section. snap the cover back on the base and return the screws. DON&#x27;T FORGET TO MAKE SURE THE OFF/ON SWITCH IS IN THE CORRECT POSITION WHEN ATTACHING THE COVER. If you screw that up, you can reopen the WaterPik or simply add a small off/on in-line electrical switch that you can buy at any hardware store. Use the in-line switch on the power cord to turn the device off and on. Opening the handle is a little harder, but I have done it many times. I don&#x27;t have time right now to explain.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the same WaterPik for ten years! Best wishes, and YOU can do this job.</li>
    <li> Beats buying the whole unit. The hose is what dries out and breaks. I saved about $32 by replacing the hose assembly.</li>
    <li> Works fine but gave it a 4. The distributor had no chart on their site to indicate the matching tips to use. I had to place another order after finding this out. I have been without use of my water pic for a month now.</li>
    <li> nothing wrong with product but I think I ordered the wrong part for my machine.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewer. The old hose is too brittle. Save your money and buy a new irrigator. My Waterpik lasted about 7 years.</li>
    <li> The other two reviewers have it right on. This repair kit is essentially useless. Unfortunately you have to toss the old waterpik and buy a new one when the hose gets old and brittle.</li>
    <li> First of all, this repair kit works for model WP-65W, which is the one I have. The product description here says it works only for WP-60 and WP-70.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the kit comes with the sprayer handle with the hose attached, but there is no additional spare hose (not anymore, if it had before). Also the switch and the push button on the handle are in blue color. So what shows on the product picture (with spare hose) is not accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Installation takes a LOT of effort. First I tried to insert the connector (in the new hose connected to the handle) into the old hose, which is what suggested by the instruction manual. But as lot of reviewers have reported here, the old hose is too brittle due to aging, and it won&#x27;t take the force of insertion. After trying twice and both times the hose cracked, I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;I then tried to open the base and connect the hose directly to the motor. A reviewer Thomas Corrado has described in detail (in a comment to D. Alexander&#x27;s review: \\&quot;Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money\\&quot;, January 25, 2007) the procedure how to remove the base from its housing. Follow the directions given by Thomas to the open the unit.&lt;br /&gt;(OK, to save people some searching around, I took the liberty of lifting that direction here, with credit given to Thomas:&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Under the bottom of the unit, you&#x27;ll see 8 areas where the bottom is held in place with the housing part ( 2 each on the longer sides and 1 each on the shorter sides (totalling 8)). I took some dish detergent on an a q-tip and lubricated those 8 areas. Then I slipped a few non-serrated butter knives and wedged them in those base-to-housing lock-in areas, just enough to show that there&#x27;s clearance in all 8 areas ( you have to be very gentle, as prying and clearing those 8 areas too wide might create a crack somewhere. Just wedge the knives enough to barely create clearance. ) After visualizing that there&#x27;s sufficient clearance everywhere, LIFT the HOUSING OFF the BASE. Remove the hose off the base&#x27;s feed outlet (it came off fairly easily by prying with one of the butter knife edges), and purchase a replacement hose w/ handle. You can get this part from amazon or ebay for under $10. After the part came in for me, I just fed the hose through the proper opening in the housing, connected the hose to the base&#x27;s outlet, and gently pushed down on the housing over the base until all 8 areas were locked in again.&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;There are several points I want to bring up during my struggle to get this to work--it&#x27;s not trivial that&#x27;s why I give only 3 stars for the kit.&lt;br /&gt;1. DON&#x27;T FORGET to thread the hose through the opening in housing where it allows the hose to come out from the base BEFORE you try to connect the hose to the motor.&lt;br /&gt;2. heat up the hose before you force it onto the hose connector to the motor. Lacking a heat source, I used the heat plate of a coffee maker. It&#x27;s pretty hard to insert the hose as there is a tab stick out from the base and it&#x27;s right in front of the hose connector so it&#x27;s kind of in the way.&lt;br /&gt;3. you need to snap out the switch (that turns on/off Waterpik) from its housing before you put the base back into the housing. The switch is held in the slot (so it can move up and down) by 4 tabs. Push the tabs to snap out the switch from the slot.&lt;br /&gt;4. Note there is a rubber bushing on the top of the housing that allows water from the reservoir to pass through down to the motor. You need to take the rubber bushing out before you put the housing back over the base.&lt;br /&gt;5. put the housing back over the base. You should hear the tabs on the housing snap to hold the base into place.&lt;br /&gt;6. Put the rubber bushing back, make sure you align it with the upright water pipe rising from the base (inside the housing).&lt;br /&gt;7. Snap the switch back into the slot in the housing, make sure you align the protruding tab of the switch through the hole of the \\&quot;eye-ring\\&quot; of the electric switch inside the unit before you push the switch into the slot. You should test as you slide the switch up and down, it will move the electric switch inside to on and off position.&lt;br /&gt;8. Test the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the steps I had to go through that it&#x27;s not a trivial task. Actually, just to take the base from its housing is a pretty demanding one as you have to ply open all the 6 tabs that hold the base in place (as described by Thomas). It took me over an hour (more like 2) as I tried to figure out the steps I need to do (as described above). And in doing so I had to open and close the housing 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;I considered myself a pretty handy person, yet this whole thing took enough effort that I don&#x27;t recommend it to anybody who is mechanically challenged and who lacks dexterity.</li>
    <li> This product is okay if you don&#x27;t mind trying to tie in the new handle to the old hose, but I have doubts about the ability to withstand the pressure the Waterpik unit puts out. If you have the mechanical ability to get into the unit and replace the hose at the pump then this is great. I tried this and broke the outlet at the pump, so I was forced to get a new Waterpik unit.</li>
    <li> Pulled out old hose, put new one in, good as new.</li>
    <li> my waterpik leaked and I replaced the handle with this kit...it worked and was much cheaper than a new waterpik</li>
    <li> I was not sure if I wanted to repair or replace my old faithful waterpik.  I took a chance.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open the appliance and had to resort to reading the included instructions.  No opening required.  Very simple replacement if you read the one paragraph directions first.  My teeth feel so clean and my gums are again happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item thinking it would fit any WaterPik. Wrong, when it came it showed only model WP 60/70&amp; I have a WP-100 It does not fit.</li>
    <li> The repair kit worked as well as the origional and was very easy to replace.  Do not remove the old hose until the new kit arrives</li>
    <li> I expected to have to take the unit apart but their fix of cutting the tube worked just fine. There&#x27;s plenty of tube length if you felt ok with disassembling the base and replacing the whole tube.</li>
    <li> I got this just the other day to fix my Waterpik oral irrigation appliance.  The problem with the original appliance is that it is made of plastics that exhibit little or no durability.  After less than a year, the plastic hose sprung a leak, and started spurting water.  Within no time, the whole hose just broke off, because the plastic becomes too brittle.  I stashed the Waterpik in a cabinet, because it was just too expensive to throw out.  When I saw this repair kit, I thought it would be worth a try.  I noticed that some others had disregarded the instructions NOT to open the machine, because they could not replace the hose anywhere along it&#x27;s length and had to install it at the source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept trying to cut the original hose back, but while trying to push the small nipple at the end of the replacement hose into the remaining length of the original, the old plastic would simply break apart.  I tried soaking the end of the old plastic hose in hot water to soften it, but the length simply got shorter and shorter.  And so did my patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up taking the whole machine apart, and was finally able to soften up a small length of the old hose inside the housing, and just BARELY flexible enough to accept the repair nipple - using a hot water bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have given the replacement hose another star because in the end it did make the appliance workable again.  But I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same plastic that will just stiffen with a little time and crack like the original.  And I feel that Waterpik doesn&#x27;t deserve 5 stars for a product that requires a replacement part like this to keep it running more than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik seems to have managed to cut every possible corner on materials, while still producing a relatively expensive appliance with a rather short life span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to think that a company would find ways to identify and improve on design and material flaws, but I&#x27;m not sure Waterpik is trying too hard to do anything but cut costs at the consumer&#x27;s expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is worth a try if you&#x27;re Waterpik hose has bitten the dust. But it&#x27;s not easy to install, and the jury is still out on whether it is a durable fix.</li>
    <li> Too difficult to install.  I ended up trashing it and buying a new one.</li>
    <li> You do have to take apart the WaterPik to connect the hose form the inside.&lt;br /&gt;See  YouTube: How To Fix A Broken Waterpik Hose&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first connected the hose without taking the pump out and I pinched the hose too much and ended up doing what the video recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However when you re-assemble the WaterPik after the hose is connected.&lt;br /&gt;Pop the On-Off switch out first, before you put the cover on. Then put the switch on, aligning it properly, it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other reviewers, I found the repair kit east to install. It salvages a WaterPik that I otherwise would have discarded.</li>
    <li> In the past, i always bought a new machine when the hose broke.  Since the cheap plastic hose lasts only about a year, this got to be very frustrating.  The hose is the weak point in the product design.  With this repair kit repairs can be done very easily and cheaply.  Buying several kits will save you on the shipping.  You c an also check on youtube on how to make the hose repair without splicing since the splice connector will reduce the inside diameter and restrict the flow resulting in lower output water pressure.</li>
    <li> This is a good solution for a leaky hose or handle. Instructions must be followed closely to allow adequate softening of the old hose to get the adapter put in.  After the installation, the Water Pik worked much better. I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This replacment handle and hose worked perfectly. Keepet me from having to buy a whole new unit. I Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was not able to splice it into the old tube. The old tube inside diameter was too small so the splicing connector would split the tube. I was however able to remove the old tube completely and attach the new tube to the pump. Works fine. This is not recommended if you have no &amp;#34;DIY fix it&amp;#34; skills...</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to splice into the existing hose because it was too brittle. However I was able to take the base apart and replace the entire hose.</li>
    <li> It comes with a tube-to-tube connector.  This will not directly attach to the pump base unit.  That means that if you existing tubing is becoming brittle all the way to the special connector that screws into the base of your pump unit, this will not work.  It does work for me, but I&#x27;m waiting for the tubing that I had to plug this into to crack again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion for buyer, try to save as much of your existing tubing as possible when cutting off your current handle.  If the hose is too brittle and splits open when trying to push in the connecting insert that comes with this, cut a little more off of your existing tube.  Keep doing that until you can push in the insert without a crack.  Save your tubing.  Cut to close to the base and you&#x27;ll be out of luck quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it. Best not to stretch the hose any more than absolutely necessary when you use it, else the combination of the vibration &amp; the hose&#x27;s brittleness (esp with age) will break it.</li>
    <li> It extended the life of our WaterPick another fourteen months. Now the whole unit is dying, but it has been a four years. I guess the normal life of a WaterPick is about three years.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted, but I couldn&#x27;t get it connected, because I had read instrucctions on the internet and used them, instead of reading the ones that came with the hose repair kit. Consequently, I messed up the whole water Pik and had to dump it and buy a new one. So I have the new repair hose you sent me, and guess I will just keep it, as I don&#x27;t want to go to the expense of returning it to you. I feel pretty dumb for not reading your instructions, as they make the job so simple. My old water pik was really old, so I am enjoying the new one very much. Thank you for checking up on my order.</li>
    <li> I was glad to get the kit - it will help if I need it to repair my new WaterPik.  Unfortunately I got bored and curious one day before the Repair Kit arrived, so I took apart the old waterpik to see how it worked inside - and busted one of the plastic parts that the hose attached to - effectively ruining the machine.&lt;br /&gt;The Hose Repair Kit would have worked great if I hadn&#x27;t played handy man before I got it.  There is NO NEED to disassemble the device in order to use the repair kit to fix the hose.  OOPS!  My Bad!</li>
    <li> Easy repair, cut hose 2&amp;#34; from base, heated hose in warm water to soften, shoved connector into hose, wahla....success works like new.  Only took a couple of minutes to heat hose.  Works like a charm.  Glad I purchased it. tks.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and working good</li>
    <li> My waterpik is model No.WP-100W/WP-100C.  The tips are not hexagonal as in the repair kit.  Also the hose is a bit smaller making it much harder to install even with heating the hose with hot wáter for a minute.  The rating of this product should not be &amp;#34;I don´t like it&amp;#34; it should be &amp;#34;I can´t use it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Numan Vasquez</li>
    <li> The replacement was relatively easy other that the difficulty in removing the base of the unit to access the connection point to the pump.  I chose to replace the whole hose rather than splice the hose.</li>
    <li> Work at replacing the leaking one. Need to have two people to take unit apart. Not to difficult but working together helped.</li>
    <li> I received the repair kit and the hose is stiff and difficult to fit to the existing hose even after slight heating. The hose split at the provided connector within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would avoid this product.</li>
    <li> WaterPic hose broke flush at handle repair fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply got a knife and carefully inserted it into the gap on both sides of the handle and worked my way up gently prying free the plastic weld used to hold it together a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opening the handle you will see the hose has a plastic ring loosely holding the hose to handle. Gently pry this downward and with a lighter carefully heat up the hose and remove it from protruding nipple on handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reassembly... I heated up hose connected to base, placed ring on hose and slipped in on nipple. Some crazy glue or tape will secure handle back together and you are ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I am sure the cheap brittle hose it came with will break again and at that time will replace it with a quality rubber hose of same diameter from auto parts store etc.</li>
    <li> The hose to my WaterPik dried out and cracked, so I was glad to see that I could easily order a replacement.  You have to cut your old hose back to the base and connect the new one via a tube connector.  The problem I had is that my hose was dried out all the way, so it cracked too.  I eventually needed to buy a whole new WaterPik.  Like I said, I liked that I could replace the hose, but the execution was not so good.</li>
    <li> Installation is not too difficult. Took a little effort to connect the hoses to the adapter.  Do yourself a favor and cut the existing hose a little longer (~2 inches more) from the base than recommended in the instructions,  You need the extra length to help you pushing the hoses together using the adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, works good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received it a lot sooner than expected. Nice!</li>
    <li> The product does not work for the purpose WaterPik made it. The product is meant for repairing on to the old hose but the issue is that the old hose has become all brittle (this WaterPik unit is less that 2 years old) and it is not possible to use that any more. It has been impossible to open the unit to get to the internal connection to attach the new hose. This kit is of no use. WaterPik should use better material to make hoses for their systems. I would like to receive my money back and would send the product back.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...the only draw back is the directions as to how to replace the item on the machine.  The directions where somewhat vague in ref to attaching the hose to the inside of the unit..Had to figure it out myself...</li>
    <li> There is no way to attach the new hose to the original without tearing it off.&lt;br /&gt;If your WP is older than a couple or years don´t buy this replacement.</li>
    <li> The product works well.  The only glitch was the installation.  When I followed the instructions to mate the old and new hose together with the provided connector, the old hose kept splitting.  This required me to snap the cover off and install it directly to the unit.  This, in turn, required taking out the switch cover to enable reassembly.  The end result is it works, though the path to success was longer and more difficult than expected.</li>
    <li> well, I did it.  The nozzle handle attachment thing shown in the pic is useless, water comes out all sides, and yes I have the right make and model of WaterPik, according to the instructions.  But I just used the hose, stuck the nozzle right into the hose and chucked the handle thingy in the trash.  Yes, it helps if you dip the hose into boiling water for a few secs, though is still difficult to get the hose all the way over the link.  Mine has about a 1/8 inch gap between the two hoses, but it is still holding together just fine.  What happens with these hoses is that they dry out over the years (mine, at least a decade old) and so then they crack, leak and tear.  Is why I needed this replacement.  Even now, the old hose on the other side of the link (ie, the hose that came with the WaterPik) is cracking, had to cut and redo the linking once.  But now that the part that takes all the abuse (movement, twisting, maneuvering to aim nozzle) is primarily the new hose, I believe I will be going maybe a year between cuts and redos, instead of the previous monthly thing when I had just the old hose.  Not perfect, but I hate throwing out a perfectly good WaterPik motor... just more plastic pollution on the planet.</li>
    <li> The old hose is attached to a tiny plastic nipple. If you look at it the wrong way, it breaks off leaving no place to attach the hose. Broke two so far. Hoping the third time will be a charm. I may be able to fabricate a new nipple for my really old model, but it&#x27;s less likely for the newer model where a new nipple would be much harder to attach.</li>
    <li> My only reservation about this product is that my waterPik is quite old and the original plastic tubing is now quite brittle which is why I needed new tubing in the first place.  This product is easy to use since you merely need to attach the new tubing to the old.  Unfortunately my old tubing splits easily where I need the attachment of the new replacement tubing.  I wish that there could be a sleeve to slide over the point where the new and old tubing are joined.</li>
    <li> Even though I warmed (in very hot water)  the 2-3&amp;#34; that remained on my old hose after cutting, I had tremendous difficulty inserting the &amp;#34;barbed union&amp;#34; up to the flange.  Even hot water failed to soften the plastic tube and make it more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the resulting union has a somewhat less than polished appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think that this is going to make much of a difference:  I doubt the union will pull out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how strong the pulsing water jet was after repair.  My old handle was in very bad shape.  I wonder why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider it almost an ethic to keep stuff running as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased that WaterPik saw fit to supply the repair kit.  THANK YOU!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - Waterpik:  why is the water tub on my WaterPik unit so &amp;#34;yellowed&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> Most water pics have a round pic.  I was sent one with six sides and it requires a different design.  I does not work with the round pics.</li>
    <li> The item was not described correctly and made me believe it was correct for my model Water Pic.  It was not.  The hose end had a different connection and the handle would not take my style of spray tip.&lt;br /&gt;I had to get the correct one off eBay where the description was done very well and shown as the correct one right up front.</li>
    <li> A bit difficult to fit to base but works like new.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product, unfortunately, I ordered the wrong thing,and had to reorder the right thing. My fault.</li>
    <li> The hose breaks because it gets brittle with time. Attach this to the old hose and the remaining old hose immediately breaks again, and again, until there is nothing left to attach this to. Unless your hose is still as flexible as when new and was damaged with a knife or scissors or such, don&#x27;t waste your time and money. Just buy a new WaterPik.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work.  The hose on the replacement was too big, so the old hose that was supposed to slip over it simply cracked apart.  I tried heating up the old hose to make it more pliable, but that wasn&#x27;t good enough either.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> This works, but not as delivered. The 1 star reviews are absolutely correct; the hose breaks because it is brittle and the supplied barb fitting  further splits the remaining hose. The fix, that should be included  with the kit as an alternate, is a 1\\&quot; piece of 1/8\\&quot; ID  thick-walled tygon tubing that couples the old and new white tubes. Cut off the supplied barb fitting and taper the outside edge of the new and old tubes. A little vasaline helps the two ends slip into the tygon \\&quot;coupling\\&quot;. Two turns of small solid copper wire for a twist-tie hose clamp on each side finishes a perfect repair job.</li>
    <li> The installation of the replacement unit was fairly simple, saving me buying a new WaterPic. It is working just fine, like new.</li>
    <li> My hygenist recommended a periodic treatment using a WaterPik so I dug out my 15+ year-old unit and put it back into use.  After a few days though, the hose split and I was faced with the replace or repair dilemma.  Waterpik doesn&#x27;t actually have a kit for my older unit but I noticed a review from a WP-20 Reviewer who had successfully replaced his hose and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was awaiting the arrival of the repair kit, I watched a couple of YouTube videos -- one that showed how the WaterPik works and one about replacing the hose where it connects to the pump-- and disassembled my unit.  When I took the top off, I found some dried up mold (I think from having once lifted the internal valve out with the resevoir).  That motivated me to take everything apart, soak the bits in bleach water, then scrub them with an old toothbrush before leaving them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reassembly with the new hose a few days later was relatively easy.  As the videos note, it&#x27;s important to get the switch and valve properly placed.  Since the new handle doesn&#x27;t have a mounting hole to use to store it, I put a strip of industrial velcro on the side of the resevoir to hold the handle and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the repair.  I did have to order some new jets to go with the new handle but it still ended costing less than half the cost of a new unit and the only thing that went to the landfill was the old hose.</li>
    <li> After a few years, the handle gets to looking ugly and the rubber seals start leaking inside the handle. This is makes the whole thing work like new and as a bonus, you can keep most of the old tubing, which effectively doubles the reach. Very easy! Saved me a lot of money!</li>
    <li> My WaterPik revived!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent repair kit.</li>
    <li> WaterPik hose repair kit is easy to install (as long a you follow directions to heat tip of old tubing).  Only have unit for 3 days, but it performs perfectly. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The price was right, so i bought it hoping it would work with my later model Waterpik - but it doesn&#x27;t accommodate the nozzles I have.  One of the previous reviews said that it would work, so I decided to take a chance.  I can&#x27;t use the handle, but at least I was able to splice the cut hose back together using the nipple provided with the new hose.  I corrected most of the original problem with the old handle, which was excessive water leakage, by taking it apart (it is ultrasonically welded and has to be cracked open) and replacing a small O-ring inside.  Then I Super-glued it back together.  I&#x27;m sure this product would work just fine with an older model Waterpik with corresponding nozzles.  The 3 star rating was given to reflect all these comments.</li>
    <li> This was an economical repair of an otherwise fully functional WaterPik.  I couldn&#x27;t force myself to discard a good dental tool.</li>
    <li> The hose on my water pick broke right next to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For little more than $12.00 I was back in business in literally a feew minutes after I received this repair kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works like a champ.</li>
    <li> I was able to repair my Waterpik with thei repair kit. I had a little difficualty putting the insert that connects the tubes into my tube. It never inserted in fully like it should without splitting the tube and had to use a file to thin it down a little to get it in and secure the connection with super glue, but after that It works excellent and did save me the cost of buying a new waterpik so I am stillk giving it 5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> The hose is supposed to connect to a stub of the old one.  The old one has hardened over time.  Also, the hose pulled out of the new handle.  Some work and some super glue and tape remedied the situation.  It now works fine.  Still glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Because Water Pik is no longer the company it once was (Newer WP&#x27;s , sadly can&#x27;t hold a candle...or Water Pik to older, better-made models) my mom was grieving over the fact she was going to lose her otherwise good Water Pik, albeit for the leaking handle that was spewing lots of water all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS a trick to get the unit open. (This repair part is meant to be used WITHOUT OPENING CASE and it&#x27;s specifically for WP-60 and WP-70 models only. )  When I opened case  I also (carefully) removed the on-off switch as well as the black rubber connector (this is the part that mates with base of water reservoir) so I could get everything properly lined up when putting it back together.  IF you do this, do so with care and caution....because if you break/lose the switch --- or the reservoir connector you&#x27;ll really be out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Chose To Open Case - But, again....THIS ISN\\&quot;T NECESSARY unless your old hose is damaged/leaking near base of unit.&lt;br /&gt;Check YouTube too.  The first YouTube video I saw of someone taking unit apart helped a great deal in showing what you need to do and know in order to get it open.  Worth the effort to take a look, otherwise,  it&#x27;s tricky and can be a frustrating thing to get apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you receive the replacement hose/handle, you&#x27;ll find it has a small plastic connector on the end - rather than just the plastic hose.  Life probably will be easier if choose not to open the case (if your hose isn&#x27;t brittle or otherwise damaged) and just insert the small (very small) \\&quot;barbed\\&quot; connector into \\&quot;the old hose\\&quot; you&#x27;ve cut off near where it enters base of Water Pik. Remember ... when cutting old hose...leave enough of old hose so you can grip it to insert barbed connector into that section that remains.  Cutting old hose too short will require opening the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to open case as I did, you&#x27;ll also need some small needlenose pliers to CAREFULLY remove old hose from connection on pump.  I snipped offa very small piece of new hose along with barbed connector... because it will not fit over connection if you don&#x27;t do this.  I took a cup of boiling water, placed it closeby and then soaked the end of the Water Pik hose in the water for about 30-60 seconds then used a pencil... or any small tapered tool will do... this will increase the inside diameter of  the hose enough so it will go over the pump connection.  Soaking the end of the plastic hose in the hot water makes it more malleable and your repair effort less challenging.  Make sure replacement hose is pushed (carefully) all the way on to connector or you&#x27;ll have a leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completed the whole repair from start to finish in 15-20 minutes.  If you choose to take your WaterPik apart as I did,  It&#x27;s important to remember on reassembly that the On/Off switch must be properly aligned and the reservoir connector too ...otherwise you&#x27;ll have to take it apart again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merchant shipped this replacement kit super fast.  Great job!  Had part in just a few days.</li>
    <li> Works great to repair my 10-year-old line which cracked from normal wear and tear.  Just cut the old line below the crack and insert the joiner and attach the new line and handle.  It required a little effort to put together, but well worth the money saved!</li>
    <li> Everything I was looking for. AAA+++</li>
    <li> Although this may the best (only) choice for repairing a Water-Pik with a damaged tube or nozzle. I was a caught by surprise to learn by that the Water-Pik does not allow the consumer to open the bottom of the case. That means you really can&#x27;t replace the entire tube and nozzle assembly to make the unit look like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather, this kit consists of a new nozzle/hose assembly plus a barbed splice-fitting.  You need to cut the existing hose and splice the new tube/nozzle assembly onto it.  It&#x27;s the next-best thing, I suppose.It&#x27;s not hard to install, and it works, so I guess it&#x27;s fine, though the repair remains visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if your existing handset tube is damaged very close to the body of the Water-Pik, you will not have enough tube left to make a splice and this kit may not work, in which case you will need to replace the entire machine.</li>
    <li> Great product serve perfectly to repair my water pik</li>
    <li> connects and works well.</li>
    <li> Every single time I have had to replace my Waterpik it&#x27;s been because the hose has broken right near the handle.  I was about to change brands but who knows if others would be any better.  I finally found this item on Amazon, tried it, and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Much cheaper than constantly replacing the entire appliance.  It was pretty easy to install taking about 30 minutes.  I now keep a couple of them around to use as needed.</li>
    <li> install is easy if your sink if isn&#x27;t too old to take off spout. Easy to regulate pressure. No electric, no batteries.</li>
    <li> This kit is a lot cheaper than replacing the entire WaterPik. The instructions were clear and easy. I had no problem and no leaks. Alternate instructions can be found online that show disassembly of the base and connecting the tube directly onto the original connector, but that required a bit more work, but it eliminates the visible tubing coupler.</li>
    <li> And, it saved me money.  Just be sure that you read the directions.  My hubby and I thought we were supposed to take the water apart to put in the new hose, but all we had to do was repair the hose - and it works great.</li>
    <li> My Waterpik hose was plugged, so I determined that I would purchase this repair kit, rather than spend another $45 for a whole new apparatus.  I watched several videos on Youtube, describing the replacement process. NOT a job for those with shaky hands.  Once I disassembled the bottom from the cover assembly, I removed the old hose from the nipple.Now,  I was ready to install the new replacement.  Problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The replacement hose comes with a hard plastic connector, which is designed to be inserted into the cut-end of the old hose.&lt;br /&gt;2) The instructions clearly warn NOT to take the appliance apart.&lt;br /&gt;3) TOO LATE!!  The appliance is lying there in many pieces, and the old hose has been removed from its connection to the pump mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;4) The replacement hard plastic (&amp;#34;male&amp;#34;) connector cannot be inserted onto the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; pump mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;5) The plastic connector from the replacement hose needs to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;6) This procedure was NOT easy. Needed to heat the end and pull like heck with pliers.&lt;br /&gt;7) Fitting the &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; end of the new hose onto the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; pump assembly was a &amp;#34;bear&amp;#34; to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;8) Make sure to route the new hose through the opening in the cover assembly BEFORE you connect it to the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; pump mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;9) Route the hose around the motor so it doesn&#x27;t tangle.&lt;br /&gt;10) The best way to reassemble the apparatus is to first pry off the ON/OFF switch.&lt;br /&gt;11) Slide the bottom into the upper cover housing, until it clicks into place.&lt;br /&gt;12) The ON/OFF switch has a peg that needs to fit into an &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; ring on the inside of the mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;13) The ON/OFF switch can now be able to move up and down, turning the motor appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;14) Snap the ON/OFF lever into place.&lt;br /&gt;15) Fill the reservoir with 1/2 way with water. The black &amp;#34;valve&amp;#34; at the bottom should not be leaking.&lt;br /&gt;16) Make sure that the black plastic nozzle fits onto the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; end of the pump connector.&lt;br /&gt;17) Plug it in. Lift the ON/OFF switch, and floss-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice:  DON&#x27;T DISASSEMBLE THE ENTIRE UNIT.  Try to connect the replacement hose to the cut end of the old hose...as the instructions advise.  However, I did learn quite abit about the functioning of the unit.  A little smarter, and non the worse for wear. Hope you were able to follow me throughout this dissertation.  Have fun, though, if you venture into the bowels of this monster. A clean mouth is a happy mouth.  Learned that from my dentist.le&amp;#34; end of the pump connector.&lt;br /&gt;17) Plug it in.

    <li> Did what they said it would and fixed my WaterPik.</li>
    <li> The hose on my waterpik - which is several years old - got very brittle, so I was&lt;br /&gt;going to buy a new unit.  I found this replacement hose here on Amazon, and,&lt;br /&gt;although it was a bit difficult getting the unit apart to replace the entire hose (they&lt;br /&gt;count on you splicing it in, but I wanted to replace the entire length) it works as&lt;br /&gt;good as new now.  I probably could have cut the old hose close to the case and&lt;br /&gt;spliced, but, with as brittle as it was, I wanted to replace it all, and was able to with&lt;br /&gt;a little effort.</li>
    <li> I saved a bunch of money and kept more junk out of the landfill.  I didn&#x27;t bother with the &amp;#34;splice&amp;#34; technique to connect the new tube to the old tube.  I disassembled the whole unit and replaced the hose all the way to the pump.  I used hot water to make the tube a little more pliable so I could push it onto the pump more easily.</li>
    <li> Nearly impossible to connect to older models of WaterPiks, the ones most likely to need repair. So I have no idea ho well it works.</li>
    <li> If you have a WaterPik 350W travel model, you may use this kit, but, to use the handle you also have to buy the Wp 60/70  Water Pik Jet Tips</li>
    <li> Product was as expected and worked well</li>
    <li> Installing it was abit hard, but it works!  Just remember, HOT WATER first to install it!!!!  Certainly is cheaper than sending the entire unit back to the factory to be fixed!!!</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this item, almost impossible to fit, I ended up throw it out.</li>
    <li> After installing as directed, the pressure at the junction with to old doesn&#x27;t allow sealing off without holding button on wand, but it works.</li>
    <li> I bought the WaterPik hose repair kit with handle to repair my 10 year old WP72.  After watching a few how-to videos on YouTube got to work with a few slot head screwdrivers, exacto knife, needle nose pliers, and had the old flosser apart in little time.  Putting it back together was a little tricky buy trial and error got me through the process.  I was prepared to by the newer replacement tips, but I found that my old tips worked fine as this is the older model handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice How-to video: [...]</li>
    <li> This kit comes with a barb to connect directly to the stub of the previous hose.  Simply immerse the stub in hot water and seat the barb in the stub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, if the snub is too short or brittle, one can disassemble the water pick unit and connect the replacement hose kit directly to the barb on the pump as shown in this link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;K09v9aVmsoE .</li>
    <li> It did arrive on time.  That&#x27;s about all the good I can say about it.  There was NO WAY my husband could make this fit onto our Waterpik.  It never sealed correctly so leaked all over the place, and when he tried to seat it more securely it ruined the hose.  Not worth your time or frustration.</li>
    <li> Beats the heck out of buying a whole new unit and works as well as the original</li>
    <li> Works okay, but not as good as original.&lt;br /&gt;As always - Read The Friendly Manual before doing anything with the product.</li>
    <li> this did not work , wrong piece</li>
    <li> The replacement hose and handle were installed as instructed, but the cut end of the original hose on my older unit split open - probably due to age. Cut the split end off only to have the old hose split again.  I was able to disassemble the unit and remove the pump to replace the old hose completely. Now works OK.</li>
    <li> New hose and handle arrived on time and in good condition.  A bit difficult to attach to old hose.  Soaked old hose in hot water and got it attached.  Tried to use and it seem that the attachments don&#x27;t seat in this new head.  Water leaked everywhere and no pressure at the tip.  Tried several attachments with the same result.  Not sure if there are different size handles or there is an issue with this particular unit.</li>
