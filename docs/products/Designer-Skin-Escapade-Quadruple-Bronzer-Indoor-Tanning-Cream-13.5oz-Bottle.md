### Positive Reviews

      <li>Anytime I use a bronzing lotion I always try to wait to shower afterward, and I do believe that 5-6+ hours before showering will give the best payoff there.</li>

      <li>At first, I loved that it has a cooling sensation when I am in the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>kind of a light, clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>Nice clean and light smell, def.</li>
      <li>Also this product has a nice fresh smell but it does not stand out.</li>
      <li>Leaves the skin smelling good even after tanning, but really haven&#x27;t noticed any changes with the built-in bronzer</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion for close to 60 bucks at a local salon and absolutely LOVED it!</li>
      <li>and you receive color automatically from the strong bronzer.</li>
      <li>However I saw color after first use and it smells amazing even after tanning.</li>
      <li>; which is fine by me-</li>
      <li>Smells mildly like cat pee, but the color of the bronzer is awesome and unlike any other bronzer I&#x27;ve tried so II can overlook the smell.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt rubber after tanning.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this tanning lotion.</li>

      <li>This lotion has helped me to get bronzed quickly and not orange.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my favorite bronzers. A very dark bronzer, but is very easy to apply without streaking.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I would never recommend buying from a retail or tanning salon. The mark-up, is, crazy and, yet they try go tell you to be careful what you buy here? Greed. This is awesome.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the real lotion sold in tanning salons for double the price</li>
    <li> Was skeptical!! But glad I purchased, looks and smells the same as the solons!</li>
    <li> The bronzers are RIDICULOUS. Expect to see a shade or two darker within one session. I absolutely love the smell as well...perfect beachy smell. Only downfall is the lotion feels a bit greasy, which usually goes away after you&#x27;ve laid and tanned. Have already been through two bottles!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this bronzer!! I tried it out at the salon when I just needed to buy a packet to hold me over. The color of the lotion is brown, and it has a rather unique smell- pleasant, but definitely unlike anything most tanning lotions usually smell like. It&#x27;s a cool, fresh musk type scent- almost like a unisex cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not notice the &amp;#34;cooling sensation,&amp;#34; which is fine by me- I&#x27;m consciously planning to tan so I was expecting to feel warmth for a bit anyway. The consistency of this lotion is medium thickness, and slick due to the oils in it but it absorbs well. I did not notice any streaking or any uneven coloration (I went from one packet to buying two bottles, which says a lot!!).&lt;br /&gt;After tanning you may need to dab lightly at any areas that may have started to sweat considerably during your session, I usually do for my face as I turn fans off. A light dab did show some color transfer to a white towel, but there was no color loss on my skin later after the color developed. I have not had any issues with color transfer from this lotion UNLESS the lotion was literally not dry yet.&lt;br /&gt;Color payoff? AMAZING!! I&#x27;m only able to get to the salon about once or occasionally twice a week, but this keeps me looking bronzed. Anytime I use a bronzing lotion I always try to wait to shower afterward, and I do believe that 5-6+ hours before showering will give the best payoff there. This is one of the few lotions that do not leave me feeling dried out after use. I rotate between this and a tingle + bronzer lotion. In bronzing lotions, luminary has a huge following, but for me this gets me much better results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Just be careful with wearing white after you go tanning because it can leave stains on your clothes.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this at the tanning salon for $70. I liked it so much but could not afford to pay that much, so I looked on amazon and found it for a fraction of the price. I was so excited cause I loved this lotion so much!!</li>
    <li> Smells mildly like cat pee, but the color of the bronzer is awesome and unlike any other bronzer I&#x27;ve tried so II can overlook the smell.</li>
    <li> Not all that, the lotion turns your hands and I could not see a difference using the lotion daily.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives a great bronze color without making it look fake.</li>
    <li> I had heard nothing but good things about this lotion from the tanning salon and read reviews on it before hand to make sure it was really great before buying the whole bottle. First things first, the color is actually very dark, however it honestly doesn&#x27;t seem to be making me dark relatively quickly. I&#x27;m used to jwoww black bronzer and Black by designer skin which shows tremendous color in one visit, this lotion truly takes probably 3-4 to even see a remarkable difference. Secondly, it got a star taken away because of how oily it is. The tanning lotion I mentioned using above have never felt oily like this one and thirdly, most likely because of the oil infused in it, makes you very streaky. I know I&#x27;ve applied tanning lotion on correctly for years now because I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this until now. Even when you rub in very very well, you can still see small streaks however on me anyway, they do not stain that way but I&#x27;m sure some people have actually been stained streaky. So, to be summed up- this lotion is not a must and is truly, not all that great but it will just have to manage for now! Still trying and hoping it won&#x27;t fully prove me wrong.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this tanning lotion. It smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt rubber after tanning. Instead, it smells light and crisp. I also like that I am not orange from the bronzer. It gives you a subtle bronze glow and looks very natural. This is now my favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions/bronzers I have ever purchased.  Love the fact that after leaving the tanning beds I don&#x27;t have the tanning bed &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; that I have always experienced with all other lotions I have used.  Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Smells great before &amp; after&lt;br /&gt;Gives great bronzed color after minimal usage&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy feeling at all&lt;br /&gt;The cooling additive isn&#x27;t super noticeable, but it feels great with a fan blowing&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my first bottle from my tanning salon 30% off &amp; was still $40</li>
    <li> No cooling sensation. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Been laying little over momth. Smells great no tingle or streaking not sure What coolant means can&#x27;t really tell.  Give it try</li>
    <li> Great lotion love everything about it!</li>
    <li> I love designer skin lotion. However this one has no pleasant smell and I don&#x27;t think that the bronzing effects are that great. It may work great on someone else. I will stick with Spellbound or Glam Slam.</li>
    <li> This lotion will put a nice tan on you. The smell of this lotion is very nice to me, kind of like a fresh clean smell. One of the important things to me is the smell, after tanning sometimes you do have to go to other places. There is no tanning bed smell with this. The smell from when you first put it on versus after tanning is just a very light smell of the lotion, no one will ever know you just stepped out of a tanning bed. This lotion comes out of the bottle looking very dark, and on me a little goes a long way. There has been no streaking with this and the color you get looks like you just came from the beach. I love this and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Moisturizes great.  But,  the bronzer is just not up to speed. At least on my skin tone, which is somewhat fare, the bronzing effect is virtually unnoticeable. I&#x27;ve had other lotions that are better due to the bronzer being better...in other words, a noticeable, natural rich color.</li>
    <li> Love ❤ this to and st a great price</li>
    <li> I tried this bronzer today. First off, it smells pretty good; kind of a light, clean fragrance. There was a slight cooling sensation when I first put it on kind of like a little bit of menthol. And after tanning there wasn&#x27;t any of that funky after-tan smell.&lt;br /&gt; I have been tanning for about a year and using a bronzer for the last two or three months with little results but after my first time using this lotion, I am at least a couple shades darker.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this lotion and it is so much of a better deal to buy it here than to pay upwards of $100 at a salon!</li>
    <li> This stuff will get you dark quick! I have fair skin and it can be hard for me to tan but this is one of my favorite tanners out there. I&#x27;ve tried many but a lot of times other lotions will leave me sticky or I can&#x27;t stand the smell. This one isn&#x27;t too sticky feeling afterwards and they smell is great. Plus it has self tanners in it to help you tan quicker!</li>
    <li> Bought jt at the tanning salon...smells great! Nice clean and light smell, def. felt the cooling sensations. Doesn&#x27;t leave me&lt;br /&gt;Feeling greasy or sticky. Def. recommend it! Also a plus bc there is no after tan smell..leaves me skin soft and silky.</li>
    <li> It cools as you tan and you receive color automatically from the strong bronzer.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and gives me the best tan ever!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells great and even after I tan the scent lasts for hours. I tanned 3 times so far and already so much darker than I was. The cooling sensation is nice and not overwhelming and goes away about 20 minutes after im done tanning. Definitely going to buy again.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin smelling good even after tanning, but really haven&#x27;t noticed any changes with the built-in bronzer</li>
    <li> Works well, gives my light-medium neutral skin a nice golden-bronze tone.  Would have given five stars but the bottle I had shipped was six months expired, so don&#x27;t know if the lotion is working at full strength. Smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Best lotion, great price. Doesn&#x27;t stain hands and has a great smell</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!! Smells amazing. Feels great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have bought in the tanning salon! ! !!  I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for close to 60 bucks at a local salon and absolutely LOVED it! As much as I loved it $60 was still steep for me so despite the reviews I decided to go out on a limb and order it on here for 1/3 the price. It IS the same lotion! Same color same smell same effect! Perfect for someone who already has a base tan and just wants to keep up there natural glow! Doesn&#x27;t have that burnt skin smell either! You leave smelling like you just took a shower:) great product!!</li>
    <li> The color gets on your clothes.</li>
    <li> Tried this lotion for the first time today. I love it! It smells good before tanning and doesn&#x27;t leave you wanting a shower immediately after.  I&#x27;m at least two shades darker after one use!  The bottle says something about the lotion having a cooling factor, I don&#x27;t feel it but overall it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This lotion gives you a great bronze tan. Unfortunately I could not continue to use it. I do not have sensitive skin but something in this lotion caused me to itch like crazy. Switched to a different lotion and no problems. This lotion might not be good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Same as in the tanning salons but way cheaper!!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells SO good. It arrived quickly and is such a great price in comparison to my tanning place.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion works great.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than in the local tanning salon.  It works great.</li>
    <li> The product is not the real deal. I have used this product in tanning salons many times.. And for that reason I decided to buy the bottle. The product is meant to cool your body as soon as applied. IT WASNT AT ALL!  It also stained my shirt even after It was rubbed off. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great gor a deep dark tan. Love It.</li>
    <li> Scent- Smells kinda like a good cologne with no after tan smell.&lt;br /&gt;Results- Got good color using this. Not like super dark just a good tan.&lt;br /&gt;Cooling- this lotion says it has cooling but I don&#x27;t feel it, but thats not a deal breaker because I never feel cooling in any lotions like Ruby by designer skin or one I used to use called frosted hemp by swedish beauty&lt;br /&gt;All and All- Good lotion if your working on building up a base tan or want something to help maintain your color.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great but it is very dark!</li>
    <li> I am a male who wants to impress the ladies by looking tan. Escapade lotion immediately makes your skin appear tan and darker. it easily gets absorbed in the skin so it wont look oily and artificial. Also this product has a nice fresh smell but it does not stand out. I am not a big fan of tanning beds but when used one with this lotion, the lotion kept my skin darker for longer.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended lotion!</li>
    <li> LOVLEY! exactly the same as what you buy in the store.</li>
    <li> THANKS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++++++++</li>
    <li> It is an awesome bronzer and but it is a very temporary bronzer, my color washed and faded by morning time-everytime. Not orange at all, not much of a cooling effect. The scent gets old after a while. Great shipping-no problems.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It gives me great color and smells fantastic after tanning too.  I needed a boost and this gave it to me...it&#x27;s the lotion I use the most now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about 1 1/2 months. At first, I loved that it has a cooling sensation when I am in the tanning bed. After a month - it doesn&#x27;t seem to have that cooling sensation anymore (which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars). This lotion has helped me to get bronzed quickly and not orange. I like the smell and it feels silky and leaves my skin feeling soft - not oily. I will buy again!!</li>
    <li> First designer skin lotion I have purchased that leaves brown streakes on you and makes me feel like I am rubbing pudding on</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite tanning lotions. I don&#x27;t really understand the cooling part. I don&#x27;t feel a difference like I did when using a tingling lotion. However I saw color after first use and it smells amazing even after tanning. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon &amp; only ordered online to hold me over until our employee sell! When I received this yesterday from Jenny&#x27;s best &amp; compared it to our escapade on the shelf it is totally different!! So much lighter in color!! Didn&#x27;t feel a cooling sensation AT ALL! Extremely mad and frustrated! This lotion must have been tampered with or mixed! Will NEVER order lotions online again!</li>
    <li> great lotion for tanning, great price!!</li>
    <li> Wifey loves it, better deal on Amazon then tanning salon.</li>
    <li> This lotion has become one of my absolute favorites. Multiple people have used it and raved about the products features. Great smell kind of like a one of a kind smell but it smells DELICIOUS. Cooling technology is defiantly present and the quad. bronzer technology does work with in time. Usually am a tingle girl but this one is defiantly in the top 10. When you but lotion on feels like your walking into a chilly room. Highly recommended from Solarium seller</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will purchase again. Accelerated my tan in one week. Pleasant smell and non greasy. Reccomend to anyone for outdoor or tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Great deal for a new lotion smells fresh and clean no ato not so much cooling but no complaints ! And prompt delivery !</li>
    <li> Scent--I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a unisex scent, anyone could use it. It smells kind of like a perfume or cologne. I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;Results--I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion twice. The first time around I liked it, I noticed a little extra color. The second time I bought it I didn&#x27;t care for it. I was already dark, and it didn&#x27;t get me any darker.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell I used any lotion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells great, used first time today I&#x27;m so tan.</li>
