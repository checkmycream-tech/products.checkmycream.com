<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 20 years.  I know how my hair will respond with it, so I hope to never be without it. It leaves my hair soft and manageable, not sticky or stiff.  It holds my style beautifully.</li>
    <li> Good product, shipping ontime</li>
    <li> Nexxus Liquid Gel is wonderful.  I used to use the Vitatress Potion that unfortunately is no longer made.  This is just as good.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for more than a year now... I have curly, thin hair... yeah so Is difficult to manage, but this gel makes it a little easier... now I have my own routine... which inclundes mixing, another brand, you know that brown sticky gel... rub it in between my palms and voila!! my curls are maintained thus far is been part of my daily hair care.. yeah but take notice that some places is a lot hotter so curls are not always maintained... but if you know of something... Please advised.</li>
    <li> not as good as versastyler used to be.  Was supposed to be a new linwe for nexxus but I don&#x27;t particularly like it too heavy on the hair.... I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair and live in Galveston TX, so we are talking humidity plus. This keeps my hair from frizzing, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> excellant-used it for years</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have been using it for years and can&#x27;t imagine running out. It is a alcohol free extra hold gel for fine and thinning hair. I use a very small amount each boring after showering. I also mix in my hand with a little water. It holds my hair in place without giving it a &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; feel like hair spray. It is a great product and would recommend for anyone!</li>
    <li> This product came on time and it was packaged well.  Product does what it says it will do and leaves your hair very soft and manageable.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I WAS NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK OF TH-IS GEL. IT PROVIDE A BALANCE TO MY HAIR I CALL IT HAIR BISMOL.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT, LIKE IT, I  WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT. I REFUSE TO SHARE MY GEL!&lt;br /&gt;IT IS  THAT GOOD! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR IN THIS PRODUCT. IT SOME GOOD STUFF</li>
    <li> Became my favorite liquid gel!!</li>
    <li> This product works the best for me.  I have been using it for about 3 years now.  I Love it!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used Nexxus Vitatress on my hair and I was very pleased with the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very curly and quite a challenge. I get Keratin treatment every six months and Vitatress keeps my hair relaxed, and smooth.  It adds a nice shine and my hair is manageable.  This  product smells so nice.  It&#x27;s the best product I have used for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...help manage my hair style. I reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to tell the difference between product i&#x27;m using now.&lt;br /&gt;Next week I&#x27;ll start using it more often.</li>
    <li> Great Product, I tried many other products and this is the best for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Glad amazon had it. Much of the stores don&#x27;t have it on stock. Really keeps hair in place. No flakes or build it.&lt;br /&gt;Can be reactivated with water. No alcohol either. Has spf for the sun and vitamins for the hair. Would buy again. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Mary Hilt,  i have used this product for the last 4 yrs. does everything its supposed to do. i have tried many, many other products and never was satisfied. only complaint i have is that i paid 10.00 for this product but at amazon i paid 16.00.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t have the hold l want.</li>
    <li> lived up to its stated performance</li>
    <li> Does give your hair volume  but be careful not to use too much at once.  Has a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ugh. Threw it away after I saw it had sodium laural sulfate in it.</li>
    <li> Simply the best Gel! Never sticky!</li>
    <li> This is a great nexxus product thank you !!  This product works great when you want to wash your hair and go!</li>
    <li> I have tried other gel products but nothing compares to this one. I use to buy it at the beauty salon and paid twice what it costs on here.</li>
    <li> I read another review that referred to this product as &amp;#34;perfumey.&amp;#34; It stinks. Smells bad. Horrible odor.  I haven&#x27;t used it because of the smell.  It&#x27;s like bad discount store men&#x27;s cologne from the 70&#x27;s. I love Nexus products; I use Vitatress shampoo daily. It works (REALLY WORKS) and it smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve used Nexus Versastyler in the past; its a great product. I couldn&#x27;t get past the stink to objectively form an opinion.  If you like AVON men&#x27;s fragrance products from 1970, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for years and it works great. It keeps my curls from frizzing without being too heavy or sticky.</li>
    <li> This product conditions the hair nicely.  I am not sure if it promotes any growth but makes the hair very manageable.</li>
    <li> this stuff make hair grow like grass in your yard</li>
    <li> Just as expected! No problems.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing works as well as Nexxus Viatress LIguid Gel. I can&#x27;t find it in my local stores but I can always count on finding it on Amazon - thank goodness.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my fuzzy, puffy hair weighted down, but in a moisturizing way.  My hair feels great, not stiff.  It moves and the gel simply takes the frizz out.  Believe me, I have tried just about every product known to mankind, but this one takes the cake.  Most products are either too heavy and stiff or too drying.  I used this product years ago and decided to try new product to see what was out there, but have come back to this and can&#x27;t believe I even looked around in the first place.  I have not only damaged my hair in the process, but I&#x27;ve spent a fortune.  This is a good priced product.</li>
    <li> A very perfumey product and doesn&#x27;t work on my fine curly hair. It&#x27;s too heavy and stiff. I used it during the summer when my hair is curlier so I know it won&#x27;t work in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love Nexxus for my hair, because is health for my hair.</li>
    <li> AFTER USING SEBASTIAN WET  AND NEXXUS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONERS FOR 30 YEARS WE TRIED EVERYTHING TO REPLACE THE WET. THIS ONE CAME OUT ON TOP.WE WILL TRY OTHER VITATRESS PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> One of the better hair products that my wife has used; very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it holds my hair without a dry brittle effect. I do recommend this product for anyone who uses gel on their hair.</li>
    <li> Similar to the Versastyler Nexus used to make, but not as good. Does add volume to hair. Not sure why Nexxus doesn&#x27;t bring Versastyler back.</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t find it anywhere only on the internet. Best price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for several years.  But, I am now using it regularly.  Great for adding texture to fine hair and helps build body in hair that is otherwise limp.  First bought it at the salon that have been going to fora long time.  But, the price is better here.</li>
