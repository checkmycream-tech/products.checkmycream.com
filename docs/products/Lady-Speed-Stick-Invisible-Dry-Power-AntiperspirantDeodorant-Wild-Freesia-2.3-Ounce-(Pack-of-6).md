### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best deodorant and scent out there!</li>
      <li>The best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very happy camper.</li>
      <li>It works well for me, and I like the beautiful scent of it.</li>
      <li>I brought this deodorant, because my boyfriend uses it and I&#x27;m so happy that I did.</li>
      <li>Smells great.  </li>
      <li>The price is great.</li>
      <li>This product works great as an antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Works good, what can I say</li>
      <li>Great price, nice 6 pack size.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on Subscribe &amp; Save &amp; am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant!</li>
      <li>This one smells nice and refreshing!</li>
      <li>(Nice uh?)  </li>
      <li>Absorbs moisture well, doesnt cake and has a nice floral smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand before and liked it.</li>
      <li>Very strong and effective, and I love the way the &amp;#34;Wild Freesia&amp;#34; smells.</li>
      <li>Simply the best!</li>
      <li>This is easily my favorite deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Have used these for years and still love them.</li>
      <li>My local stores stopped selling this one &amp; I was very happy to find it online!</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll use up what I have, but I will not be purchasing more of this scent.</li>
      <li>Perfect, what I expected.</li>
      <li>Getting it at such a great price from Warehouse was even better.</li>
      <li>No other kind of deodorant works as well for me.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected, at a great price.</li>
      <li>This is the kind I typically buy, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find my scent in stores.</li>
      <li>I cannot stand shower fresh or powder scents in deodorant.</li>
      <li>The price for a case of six is also a great deal, especially since I can never find this scent in my local grocery stores.</li>
      <li>but it keeps the skin in great condition, soft, well moisterized but appropriately dry (meaning sweat-free, as a deodorant should), and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t ruin your clothing, even black tshirts/blouses/dresses.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I picked out and paid for.</li>
      <li>Very well-priced on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Thanks for being there for me!</li>
      <li>I love the fact that they are bigger than the ones I see over here, so I&#x27;ll have deodorants for a whole year</li>
      <li>but the quantity made me purchase because it&#x27;ll be that much longer before I need to buy it again.</li>
      <li>I really like this antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>as well, and I much prefer the Shower Fresh Scent over the Wild Freesia and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>I really like this brand; however, this particular product that I ordered does not work well at all.</li>
      <li>It keeps my dry, but more importantly it doesn&#x27;t turn the underarms of my white T-shirts and blouses yellow.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very subtile, which is what I want, but enough to make me smell fresh.</li>
      <li>I normally buy this product from the store but decided to buy in bulk.  </li>
      <li>My favorite scent, long lasting, keeps me sweat-free, affordable!</li>
      <li>, I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>But not usually; just if it&#x27;s over 90 degrees.</li>
      <li>On a really hot day, you may need a second application.  </li>
      <li>Stick A/P Deo Shower Fresh Invisible Dry 1.4 Oz</li>
      <li>This is another item missing in Venezuela, but you can easily get it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was surprised</li>
      <li>I got this at a good deal (6 pack) since it gets expensive at store</li>
      <li>The wild freesia not only doesn&#x27;t do those things, but it also is a gorgeous scent that I never get tired of.</li>
      <li>Lady Speed Stick, Wild Freesia is the only deodorant that actually keeps me from sweating and getting B.O.</li>

    <li> Best deodorant and scent out there!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I picked out and paid for.</li>
    <li> Absorbs moisture well, doesnt cake and has a nice floral smell.</li>
    <li> I bought the small traveling size on a hotel where I was staying and it was shocking for me that I didn&#x27;t have skin rash or irritation, I have very sensitive skin I even have rash from allergies.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this product on WHITE.....OMG I was shock I didn&#x27;t have white residue. :-)&lt;br /&gt;Best product ever!!</li>
    <li> Perfect, what I expected.</li>
    <li> I really like this antiperspirant. It works well for me, and I like the beautiful scent of it. It&#x27;s very subtile, which is what I want, but enough to make me smell fresh. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is my fav deodorant, long lasting, i shower at least twice a day and it actually takes some effort to rub it off. but it keeps the skin in great condition, soft, well moisterized but appropriately dry (meaning sweat-free, as a deodorant should), and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t ruin your clothing, even black tshirts/blouses/dresses.</li>
    <li> The price is great. I really like this brand; however, this particular product that I ordered does not work well at all. It clumps up when I sweat and the scent does not cover body odor. I was surprised cause I use Lady Speed Stick and other kinds that I have use previously work really well. I was definitely disappointed and now I have six of them.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used! Thanks for being there for me!</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant! My favorite scent, long lasting, keeps me sweat-free, affordable! Simply the best!</li>
    <li> I brought this deodorant, because my boyfriend uses it and I&#x27;m so happy that I did. It keeps my dry, but more importantly it doesn&#x27;t turn the underarms of my white T-shirts and blouses yellow. For years I&#x27;ve fretted over this issue and I feel as though I&#x27;ve resolved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before and liked it. Getting it at such a great price from Warehouse was even better.</li>
    <li> Works good, what can I say</li>
    <li> This is another item missing in Venezuela, but you can easily get it on Amazon. I like this brand, scent and feel. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Lady Speed Stick, Wild Freesia is the only deodorant that actually keeps me from sweating and getting B.O. Also, all other deodorant scents make me sick to smell them, or only make my B.O. smell worse. The wild freesia not only doesn&#x27;t do those things, but it also is a gorgeous scent that I never get tired of. I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for as long as I can remember. The price for a case of six is also a great deal, especially since I can never find this scent in my local grocery stores.</li>
    <li> I normally buy this product from the store but decided to buy in bulk.  Saved lots of money by doing so.</li>
    <li> On a really hot day, you may need a second application.  But not usually; just if it&#x27;s over 90 degrees.</li>
    <li> I can not find this product in the stores and when I did it was not very often.  Smells great.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Great price, nice 6 pack size.  Have used these for years and still love them.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Subscribe &amp; Save &amp; am very satisfied. The deodorant itself is one that I&#x27;ve bought for years but the quantity made me purchase because it&#x27;ll be that much longer before I need to buy it again. As long as it&#x27;s on S&amp;S, I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughters can no longer get this item from the local stores.  thankfully amazon has them for now.  from a mans perspective i like the smell of it on my wife.  dosent aggravate my sinuses like other deodorants have.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, at a great price.</li>
    <li> I got this at a good deal (6 pack) since it gets expensive at store and they usually don&#x27;t have a scent I like.  This one smells nice and refreshing!</li>
    <li> This product works great as an antiperspirant. The one thing I was not prepared for was the overpowering scent. Besides being way too fragrant, the scent itself reminds me of grape-flavored candy or medicine--something I have always disliked. So I&#x27;ll use up what I have, but I will not be purchasing more of this scent. I have tried the [[ASIN:B005MQJDCI Lady Speed Stick A/P Deo Shower Fresh Invisible Dry 1.4 Oz (Pack of 6)]] as well, and I much prefer the Shower Fresh Scent over the Wild Freesia and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just bought this because you just can&#x27;t find them in Venezuela (Nice uh?)  I love the fact that they are bigger than the ones I see over here, so I&#x27;ll have deodorants for a whole year (yay!)</li>
    <li> I wish they would come out with a mini body spray of this scent. My local stores stopped selling this one &amp; I was very happy to find it online!</li>
    <li> This is easily my favorite deodorant.  Very strong and effective, and I love the way the &amp;#34;Wild Freesia&amp;#34; smells. Very well-priced on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I cannot stand shower fresh or powder scents in deodorant. This is the kind I typically buy, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find my scent in stores. Now I&#x27;m all stocked up for awhile! I&#x27;m a very happy camper. No other kind of deodorant works as well for me.</li>
    <li> This works just as advertised.  Use it once a day and it works for at least 24 hours.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering so it won&#x27;t interfere with any other scent you want to wear.</li>
