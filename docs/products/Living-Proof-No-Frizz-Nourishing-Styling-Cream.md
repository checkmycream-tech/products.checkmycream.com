      <li>This product will make your hair smooth as silk.</li>
      <li>Nourishing Styling Cream via a free sample from the beauty store, Ulta.</li>
      <li>I AM A RETIRED HAIR DRESSER AND HAVE NEVER USED A PRODUCT I LIKED SO MUCH.</li>
      <li>THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER TRIED FOR THICK CURLY BUT FINE TEXTURE HAIR.  </li>
      <li>but it was nothing special.</li>
      <li>Tried it for the first time and its amazing, works really well.</li>
      <li>, I had to eat the cost and get a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells nice and handles styling frizzy hair nicely without drying or weighing hair down.</li>
      <li>IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND SMOOTH AND JUST STYLES SO MUCH BETTER  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every other hair cream/serum/spray/oil under the sun and nothing works to get my hair silky, baby soft, smooth, and fly away free like this</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t worth the expense, for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Used about a dime&#x27;s worth and worked in my hair before blowdrying.  </li>
      <li>For me it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a month of using this product, I am absolutely sold and highly recommend it for people who would like softer, smoother and more manageable hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue to use this product and look at more of the Living Proof products.</li>
      <li>It looks good at first, as I can tame the thickness, but  it doesn&#x27;t move.  </li>
      <li>It will literally hold my style until I&#x27;m ready to wash my hair again.</li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing to prevent frizz.</li>
      <li>It gets very frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair is as straight as a board and it works on me.</li>
      <li>I had never spent that much on a single hair product in my life, but the results were so amazing that I decided to bite the bullet and buy the 4 oz.</li>
      <li>-- I am editing my review to add the following information that I forgot to include in the original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Later, when I went to Ulta.com to find out how much the FULL size bottle cost, I was stopped in my tracks.</li>
      <li>Because these products have high hold, every time I run my fingers through my hair</li>
      <li>Longer hair has always been difficult for my, as it requires a lot of maintenance and a $70 haircut and still never looks great.  </li>
      <li>I used the sample for a few days and got so many compliments on my hair from coworkers.</li>
      <li>I think FRIZZ ease, which you can buy at the grocery store works better, for far less money.</li>
      <li>It is a light cream and doesn&#x27;t feel like glue, like some of the other styling creams.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new anti frizz product before going on vacation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Within the first week, my hair felt not only substantially softer but also noticeably smoother.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do any better than the usual stuff you can buy at Walmart or Sally&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks you will notice a natural shine returning to your hair.</li>
      <li>and now I can finally wear my hair down without having to straighten it first with little or no frizz. :-)</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, didn&#x27;t really think how sad and old my hair looked until I started using this stuff.</li>
      <li>Frizz isn&#x27;t just about curl, it&#x27;s about the lack of smoothness, which was a major issue for me.</li>
      <li>Phenomenal hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy/curly, frizz prone, long hair.</li>
      <li>As an author and natural product speaker, I have to do occasional public appearances.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft cream, almost like a cream conditioner, with a strange chemical floral scent.  </li>

<li> I can now have smooth hair without spraying every random hair down!</li>
<li> Based on how this product was marketed, I expected this to replace my moisturizing mouse.  </li>
<li> Going to try to return product, since I spent $26.00.</li>
<li> It took only a few uses for me to notice a difference in my hair.</li>
<li> BUT A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  </li>
<li> I have fine and thin hair which I wear short in part because it is so difficult to get my hair to do anything I want it to do.</li>
<li> recently received a small sample of this product.  </li>
<li> I would like to try some of their other products.</li>
<li> Since my hair has been a bit longer this last year, my usual hair after washing has been to blow-dry &amp; apply oil-based products to style.</li>
<li> I have thick and wavy/curly hair that I could only wear down if I straightened it with a flat iron and even then on a humid summer day would frizz up after a half an hour outdoors.</li>
<li> Not weighed down.</li>
<li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, make it greasy, sticky, or anything else.</li>
<li> Little bit is all you need.</li>
<li> IT&#x27;S A LITTLE PRICEY</li>
<li> My hair is mid/lower back length, and very thick.</li>
<li> I leave it  looking messy.</li>
<li> However, as soon as I used it, there was a dramatic different in the feel and manageability of my hair.  </li>
<li> My hair is insanely hard to tame, and even though this product was recommended to me by my stylist, I was somewhat pessimistic.  </li>
<li> When my hair is longer it starts looking really thick, square, &amp; one dimensional.</li>
<li> It was very expensive (and for only 8 oz of shampoo/conditioner!!)</li>
<li> I spent $38 for the 8oz bottle, but for a few days I used other products instead of spending the money, and it was awful</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a man with very thick, wavy hair.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with the price.</li>
<li> This did not work for my hair :-(</li>
<li> Disappointed for the price I paid.</li>
<li> So disappointed!</li>
<li> Worst of all it ends up looking dingy and matte by the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> Based on how this product was marketed, I expected this to replace my moisturizing mouse.  Nope. Hair is puffy. Curls not defined. Add more and my head gets oily.</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time and its amazing, works really well. No more frizz nor curls, so soft and not heavy. Great for styling</li>
    <li> This did not work for my hair :-( It smells nice but it was nothing special.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy/curly, frizz prone, long hair. The first time I tried this product, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Turns out I just didn&#x27;t use enough for my hair. My hair is mid/lower back length, and very thick. For my entire head I use over a quarter sized dollop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, make it greasy, sticky, or anything else. I use this and then do a blow out and flat iron. I&#x27;ve tried every other hair cream/serum/spray/oil under the sun and nothing works to get my hair silky, baby soft, smooth, and fly away free like this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with the price. I spent $38 for the 8oz bottle, but for a few days I used other products instead of spending the money, and it was awful, I had to eat the cost and get a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.</li>

    <li> I have fine and thin hair which I wear short in part because it is so difficult to get my hair to do anything I want it to do. It gets very frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Living Proof No Frizz Nourishing Styling Cream via a free sample from the beauty store, Ulta. It took only a few uses for me to notice a difference in my hair. Later, when I went to Ulta.com to find out how much the FULL size bottle cost, I was stopped in my tracks. I had never spent that much on a single hair product in my life, but the results were so amazing that I decided to bite the bullet and buy the 4 oz. size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first week, my hair felt not only substantially softer but also noticeably smoother. Even one of my subscribers on my YouTube channel commented on having noticed the difference in my hair in my videos! I had been using a styling mousse before using this product, and I enjoyed the fact that my hair no longer felt like it was full of product both during and after drying/styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated hair on the dry side, so I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily. Perhaps the biggest benefit I discovered from this product is that it holds my style from day to day! It will literally hold my style until I&#x27;m ready to wash my hair again. You just don&#x27;t EVER have that happen with thin/fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using this product, I am absolutely sold and highly recommend it for people who would like softer, smoother and more manageable hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED 12/16/14 -- I am editing my review to add the following information that I forgot to include in the original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One would think that a product called \\&quot;no frizz\\&quot; would just be for people with curly hair--au contraire! My hair is as straight as a board and it works on me. Frizz isn&#x27;t just about curl, it&#x27;s about the lack of smoothness, which was a major issue for me. Some people just have a lack of smoothness in their hair on a rainy day. Mine was every day. When I would finish blow-drying my hair, there would be this halo of hairs sticking up all over. This Living Proof product has ended that. I can now have smooth hair without spraying every random hair down!sticking up all over. This Living Proof product has ended that. I can now have smooth hair without spraying every random hair down!</li>
    <li> Really nice product. Smells nice and handles styling frizzy hair nicely without drying or weighing hair down. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes it would have some effect on my curly hair. It was like I did not put anything in my hair. Anti-Frizz...NO. This product must be made for a different type of hair than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsatisfied and want a refund!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for curly/frizzy hair. It&#x27;s not oily and leaves my hair with a healthy shine. I&#x27;ve purchased several times and will continue to use in the future.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t worth the expense, for my hair.  I thought the scent would be better as well.  I think FRIZZ ease, which you can buy at the grocery store works better, for far less money.</li>
    <li> I put this in the category of &amp;#34;Rip Off&amp;#34;. My still frizzy hair is Living Proof this stuff doesn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t do any better than the usual stuff you can buy at Walmart or Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product will make your hair smooth as silk. After a couple of weeks you will notice a natural shine returning to your hair. Don&#x27;t overapply. Little bit is all you need.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new anti frizz product before going on vacation. This product claims it stops frizz period! Not even close. Did absolutely nothing to prevent frizz. I tried it twice,  with the same results. Going to try to return product, since I spent $26.00. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man with very thick, wavy hair.  When my hair is longer it starts looking really thick, square, &amp; one dimensional.

It&#x27;s a soft cream, almost like a cream conditioner, with a strange chemical floral scent.  Used about a dime&#x27;s worth and worked in my hair before blowdrying.  Let me tell you this stuff makes my hair look like MOVIE STAR hair!  My hair looks shiny - not grease shiny, but healthy shiny. Not weighed down. I can run my hands through my hair and it falls so nicely. I used the sample for a few days and got so many compliments on my hair from coworkers. For me it&#x27;s totally worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper at Sephora - 4oz bottle is $26.00</li>
    <li> I have thick and wavy/curly hair that I could only wear down if I straightened it with a flat iron and even then on a humid summer day would frizz up after a half an hour outdoors. I tried this with the shampoo and conditioner a couple of years ago at Sephora hoping that it would work. It was very expensive (and for only 8 oz of shampoo/conditioner!!) did not work at all!! Only recently I found a product that works for me, which is Nexxus Frizz Defy (I use the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream) and now I can finally wear my hair down without having to straighten it first with little or no frizz. :-)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. As an author and natural product speaker, I have to do occasional public appearances. This hair serum is good under lights and good for your hair health, too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, didn&#x27;t really think how sad and old my hair looked until I started using this stuff. It&#x27;s like botox!</li>
    <li> THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER TRIED FOR THICK CURLY BUT FINE TEXTURE HAIR.  IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND SMOOTH AND JUST STYLES SO MUCH BETTER  NO FRIZZ  IT&#x27;S A LITTLE PRICEY BUT A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  I AM A RETIRED HAIR DRESSER AND HAVE NEVER USED A PRODUCT I LIKED SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> My hair is insanely hard to tame, and even though this product was recommended to me by my stylist, I was somewhat pessimistic.  However, as soon as I used it, there was a dramatic different in the feel and manageability of my hair.  I will definitely continue to use this product and look at more of the Living Proof products.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product!  I put it on damp hair, then style.  If I have this, it&#x27;s the only product I use!</li>
    <li> Disappointed for the price I paid. Overrated and overpriced.</li>
