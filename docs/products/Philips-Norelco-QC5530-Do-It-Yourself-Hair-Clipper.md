### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so maybe I am not the best person to read a review from on that point.</li>
      <li>You will be very impressed at how proficient you will become in no time.  </li>
      <li>Best of all:</li>
      <li>These Norelco clippers are perfect.</li>

      <li>for the price I paid real happy.</li>
      <li>He is very happy!</li>
      <li>But when I saw these cordless clippers I knew these would be perfect for him.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m deducting a star for value, even though I think this is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>It will not cut your hair perfectly even.</li>
      <li>The battery is of excellent quality as one charge lasts forever.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Receipt of the feel good, this is a good hair clipper. I use handy. If you just can not make me bald.</li>
    <li> The first time I use, it broke down. Very disappointed about this one. But the other one is OK and used by my little brother.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a means to give myself a touchup between haircuts. I am a very busy physician and I dont always have time to get a haircut. I thought this might buy some time between visits to my barber. Not as easy it it looks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. His hair grows fast and he likes a plain simple (no layering) #2 size cut. I do it every two weeks, this clipper is easy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just made my first hair cut , not bad for a start , a little bit too short but I&#x27;m tuning in , ....... Most important , no more waiting in the Barbar shop .&lt;br /&gt;The clipper cuts great through my hair , must run it more than once to get an Even cut , but I like it very much , recommended for all who like short hair cuts. .</li>
    <li> Liked this thing and how it works. You can do most of the cutting yourself just need little help  to adjust corner and back side, rest it is what it says \\&quot;Do it yourself\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Very handy during travel as it supports 100-240V. Need to be careful while changing the attachments as they are kind of fragile plastic.</li>
    <li> I have found that the hair length adjustment slides while it&#x27;s being used, and I have accidentally cut my hair shorter than I expected to. It will work if you&#x27;re very careful to keep it completely horizontal to your scalp. I could also see it working if someone else is cutting your hair for you and is careful.  But I can&#x27;t get it to safely cut my own hair.  I like the idea and would love it if you could actually lock the length adjuster but that is not working on mine.  I guess it&#x27;s possible that mine is defective since there are so many favorable reviews.</li>
    <li> $10 a week on haircuts stopped after this investment, easy of use, head tilting is amazing. One charge gives you to great 15-20 minutes of haircuts. Multiple clipper heads, gives you a perfect .5 level cut, if you want a true 0 you need a t-line trimmer. None of those are cordless. Doesn&#x27;t get hot during operations, and is water proof for rinsing.</li>
    <li> This is so far the best clipper on the market, it only has 3 sets of combs that go up to about 3 centimetres (30 millimetres). In the box there will be: 1-Hair clipper device; 2-Charger; 3-Three(3)combs; 4- A precision cutting attachment; and 5- A cleaning brush. The whole clipper in general has an excellent, solid build to it and the idea of it was very well thought, probably the most practical clipper on the market. The clipper is manufactured in Hungary (and hope it stays that way), which was also an important selling point for me (I&#x27;m sick of all the nasty Chinese crap on the market). Overall it&#x27;s a great clipper, I would definately recommend it, it will pay for itself probably within the first 2 or 3 haircuts. This clipper would be great even for barbers themselves to buy, it&#x27;s just much more practical than traditional hair clippers.</li>
    <li> After the cheap clippers I had been using for the past 6 years began to dull, I decided to splurge a little bit and get some \\&quot;nice\\&quot; ones. My old clippers still worked great, but I threw them away before I tried these out. BIG MISTAKE! First of all, these clippers come with 2 adjustable attachments. A \\&quot;long\\&quot; one and a \\&quot;short one\\&quot;. The long attachment includes settings from #9 to #5 an is completely useless. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much pressure I put on, or what angle I hold the clippers at, it just doesn&#x27;t cut no matter how long and shaggy my hair is. The short attachment includes settings from #4 to #1. #4 is practically a buzz while #5 on the longer attachment cuts nothing. So every time I cut my own hair now I have to give myself a buzz. I don&#x27;t think the long attachment is defective, it looks to be in working order and pretty simple without a lot of moving parts.  I think they are just badly made. There are also issues with the akward shape of the clippers and how the blade is situated making it difficult to cut behind the ears and the neckline. I was shocked to see the great reviews. My only explanation for them is that perhaps this is the 1st pair of clippers most of these people have ever purchased, and they have nothing else to measure them against. Or maybe they work for Norelco. Do yourself a favor and save some money. Take 15 bucks to wal-mart and whatever you end up with will be much better than these clippers.</li>
    <li> Great value for money. Gives you a decent hair cut if you learn how to use it properly. Takes a few trials to get a hang of it but once you do, its very easy to use. Start with a higher setting so you accidentally don&#x27;t end up balding a part of your head.</li>
    <li> It used well.but when you hair cut,you must set the chassis of this product level to touch you scalpotherwise your hair may be cut long or short. It means you must used it carefully.I&#x27;m sorry,My english is poor.</li>
    <li> i have been purchased this clipper for around 3 months, it works for my short hair. very easy and handy. especially it can be rinsed in water so make cleaning much easier after DIY</li>
    <li> The clipper looks good, after I try it and will write more product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know what voltage is the clipper? International voltage? Or only European or American voltage? I am in China, the voltage is 220VAC.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair and my three sons for a few years, in the past I would give some friends haircuts. I am by now semi-pro at haircuts, and went through a few machines, this is by far the best one I have had. It charges quickly and stays charge for about 5-6 haircuts, also it doesn&#x27;t pull my kids hair. so they love it too&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomned this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for probably over a year now using the [[ASIN:B002C741MW Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper]] so naturally I was excited to try this do-it-yourself hair clipper.  After a few haircuts, though, I must say that I can&#x27;t really tell that much of a difference.  When comparing the two, the only significant difference I could find was that this model is washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve seen the two models and aren&#x27;t sure what to get, well then I guess this one is better for the washability because both seem to work well.  Here&#x27;s my list of pros and cons, which (with few exceptions) applies to both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts very well.  I have thick hair so I was nervous that a wireless clipper wasn&#x27;t going to be able to actually cut like a professional.  It does.  Sometimes you gotta go over the same spot a few times to make sure everything is even, but otherwise, this beast could shave you bald in a matter of seconds. Also, I&#x27;m quite impressed that the blades have stayed strong and sharp even after a year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 180 degree angle.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this feature THE selling point, but occasionally I find adjusting the angle to be beneficial in getting odd areas of hair.  90% of the time I just keep it upright, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Adjustable zoom ring\\&quot; - I really like that there are so many length possibilities.  Personally I prefer the 1 - 5 numbers on the QC5170, but the same concept is featured here and it lets you play around with how close or unclose you want the clipper to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good charge life.  Not GREAT charge life, but the good news is that it will function as fully charged until it goes out so even if the battery is half dead it won&#x27;t be running on half power.  Considering that haircuts are a fairly sporadic event, I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone having a really severe problem with the battery life unless they just forgot to charge it after a month or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Limited hair styles.  You get a lot of different length options, but in the case of my unprofessional knowledge of hair cutting, it would be hard for me to imagine anyone giving themselves a truly awesome hair-do that wasn&#x27;t a buzz.  I mean, you can do a lot of touching up and such, but for an all over cut - I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily invest in this unless you know someone who can help you with it or unless you like a simple short cut like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I must say, if you&#x27;re in any way interested in cutting back on unnecessary spending, this personal hair clipper may be a great way to save a lot of money.  As long as you aren&#x27;t especially picky about a certain style, you can easily give yourself a decent variety of simple looks that will in no way scream unprofessional.  I&#x27;ve had great experiences with Philips Norelco products, including the other model of hair clipper and their bodygrooms so I would definitely stand by the brand.length options, but in the case of my unprofessional knowledge of hair cutting, it would be hard for me to imagine anyone giving themselves a truly awesome hair-do that wasn&#x27;t a buzz.

    <li> Philips Norelco Qc5530/40 Do-it-yourself Hair Clipper    When given the option of trying out these new do it yourself based clippers I decided to go ahead and try it. I have actually never tried cutting my hair myself and I really didn&#x27;t here either so maybe I am not the best person to read a review from on that point. But what I can tell you is that this very much works and works rather well. I actually had my grandmother cut my hair with these since she owns her own hair place. She loved them and said they worked great, and I must say I liked it as well.     I am sure you have read the other reviews so there is not much new I can say about them. They do turn 180 degrees making it that much easier to do it yourself and there are many settings in which you can set this clipper. Also you can shave with this thing as well giving yourself a little trim so that is cool as well. I mean really there is nothing else to tell you other than this worked very well and I will continue to use it. So in the end it is very effective and is washable and chargeable, so I say pick it up if you are unhappy with what you have.</li>
    <li> Good but leaving ridges on  hair, making your hair like with funny patterns . Have to trim the same place for 2-3 times to cut the hair to a same height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But great for the price.</li>
    <li> I just cut my hair with this product and I must say that I&#x27;m VERY satisfied.     Cutting my hair with this unit was fast and really simple, even when cutting the back of my head. Also, it has a good weight to it and is very well built.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> For years I used the [[ASIN:B00292BR9A Wahl 9655 Rechargeable Clipper 18 Piece Haircut Kit]] to Trim my beard and shave my head when I got lazy.  And it worked fine, but usually I had to make 2 passes to get it even and it also took a significant time to clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was given the Norelco Do-it-yorself Hair Clipper, and boy, what a difference!  It gets things nice and short on the first pass.  The head turns so you can easily hold it with either hand to do either side of your own head.  And it is practically self cleaning, you rinse the running blades under water and it is cleaner than I ever got my Wahl, unless I also spent hours scraping between each blade with a needle.  It has 3 blade guides that are each adjustable to several heights, so you have a lot more options.  The ONE thing I do miss is the Wahl had right &amp; left angled blade guide combs and you can&#x27;t really mimic this.  This one also rocks forward and back to to contour of your head, so you don&#x27;t miss spots or have uneven trims.  This is a very nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to hold a charge better than I remember the Wahl doing, but in all fairness this is new and the other old, so they might be the same when new.  However, the Wahl gets slower as it loses a charge &amp; winds up pulling, this one remains running fast until it dies and needs a charge, so the batteries are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They might work the same when using them on someone else (except the cleaning) but this is far easier to use on ones self.  If I tried them both out in a store before buying, this is the one I would buy.</li>
    <li> This provides the most comfortable cut of any clippers I have tried.  The hinged design aligns to the contours of your head and the blades cut nice and sharp with no jamming.  Cleanup is also quick and easy, just run under tap water!  The cordless design is also a plus.  This does tight fades very well on the precision settings.  The only criticism I have is that this doesn&#x27;t seem to cut quite as accurately as a conventional pair of clippers on the higher comb settings (#3, #4 and up) due to the nature of the adjustable comb design.    For the casual home haircutter this should do fine as a standalone, but if you want to make sure your styles are precise it might be worth it to have a second set of standard clippers as a backup for touchups.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of clippers, with most being corded and heavy. Comparatively, these don&#x27;t make a lot of noise, which is nice. It may follow that they would be too weak, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that. The cuts have been nice and clean and battery life is good, though it lacks the power of a heavy-duty corded unit.    The comb style is nice, and a rotating ring gives the ability to adjust length. Hair flows through smoothly and doesn&#x27;t snag. They also have a degree of flexibility, letting them contour to the head at the awkward angles you might use while cutting your own hair.  Additionally, the shaving head spins to make cutting the back of the head less of a contortionist routine.    Cleaning is really easy, since you can run it under water.    The primary complaint I have is that the futuristic teardrop shape is not very natural to hold.  I think this was designed for hairy homedwelling aliens.  Also, don&#x27;t expect instructions on how to cut your hair.  They leave that up to you.    This is a unique product that does its job well.  If you want a clipper for cutting your own hair or it&#x27;s just on sale, you&#x27;ll likely be happy with this one.</li>
    <li> easy to handle, and quick clipper. it is my first time to use this do-it-your-self clipper. good for short hair. will save a lot in hair cutting.</li>
    <li> The rotating head is a great idea, and it makes reaching all sides of your head a lot easier. Unfortunately, the plastic guides are very soft and flex if you push the clippers to your head. This means that you end up with closer to a #1 shave in the middle of the clipped area, and the actual setting near the edges.  The first time I used the product, I ended up clipping my entire head with a #1 to make it consistent. The second time, it was better, but you could still see some differences in the length of the hair on my head. The third time I tried extremely hard to use the clippers without applying any pressure. It was hard, and took a lot longer to cut my hair than normal. At least that time it looked OK.  If Philips would use a stonger plastic that didn&#x27;t flex, the device would rank 4-5 stars</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking it will last, after the first hair cut one of the heads broke. Now I can&#x27;t cut my hair evenly on size 3. The clipper cuts well, but a $30 clipper would have last longer and done the same job.</li>
    <li> This is great for a beard, and anything you want to clip with a size 1 clipper setting or lower.  However, once you get into the longer clipper extensions (anything above a 1), it&#x27;s not so great.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to describe the issue without seeing it, but the way this is designed, there is a space between the clipper blades, and the plastic clipper guide that determines how long the hair will be. The problem with that is, if you exert pressure on the clippers towards your head (which you must), the clipping guide is pressed towards the clippers... meaning it&#x27;ll cut a bit closer.  If it were just a little bit, i wouldn&#x27;t mind, but it makes a significant difference, so you really have to try to perfectly balance the amount of pressure you exert on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue is, after using this for several months, the clippers don&#x27;t always stay at the same setting.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll be clipping at a 4, and then realize that I pressed a little too hard and the setting slid down to a 3.  It&#x27;s not bending... but pushing the whole trimmer down a notch.  I wound up having to shave my head MUCH closer than I wanted to this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that this didn&#x27;t last longer because they worked great for the first several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think i&#x27;m going for Andis clippers next time, or something else with replaceable blades.  They&#x27;re more expensive, but they are supposed to last forever. I&#x27;m tired of swapping between various cheaper clippers and wasting money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revision:  I just changed my rating from a 3 star to 1 star because 2 of the clipper guides they gave me broke (The smallest, and the mid size extensions).  It was quite unfortunate as both broke while I was using them... not fun!  The hair wasn&#x27;t a huge issue as I was using it a the longest hair setting and had some play to fix it up, but when the small one went, I wound up having to shave off my beard (which I hadn&#x27;t done in 8 years) because when it broke, it went all the way down to the lowest setting.</li>
    <li> I used to use a pair of conair clippers but it took a long time to charge and had one slow setting with a boost button on the side that had to be held the entire time I was trimming my hair. Unfortunately if I didn&#x27;t use the boost button, I&#x27;d end up with a headache at the end of my trim because the regular setting was too slow and would pull and tear at my hair. These Norelco clippers are perfect. Lightweight, faster charge, and great speed so no pain! There&#x27;s no need to constantly change attachments which saves time and alleviates the frustration of rummaging through a pile of attachments to find the correct size. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone looking for a new hair clipper set.</li>
    <li> Very strong, light, long lasting battery and very easy and convenient to use. I&#x27;m cutting my own hair for more than 10 years, got through many hair clippers and that one is the best so far and not as bulky as my old one.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using it to cut my hair every two weeks for the past 3 year and it still cuts like new. My best hair clipper so far!</li>
    <li> I was waiting for this item from long time since i shipped it on mar 6th, 12. I opened it and went through it basis doc. Next step was to do it myself :)&lt;br /&gt;and seriously if you are confident then you can have your hair cut urself, which is seriously quit tricky but using this device you can make it possible. its amazing device manufactured by Philips with couple of interesting features like 180 rotation, washable. Again my confidence in Philips getting more stronger than before. This is my  6th personal product from Philips and I am very happy and satisfied with this brand quality and user friendliness device. last but not least Amazon is superbly reliable in its packaging and deliverable of products.</li>
    <li> The hair clipper is very &#x27;flexible&#x27; and functional.    - The handle is ergonomically contoured for a good grip  - The cutting head can be rotated for comfort and convenience  - Comes with three plasic spacers to control the cutting length  - There is a dial to adjust (increase and decrease) the cutting length for a given plastic spacer. Combination of spacer selection and hight adjustment gives a wide range of cutting length.  - Compact power adapter and charging cable are quite good  - The clipper is washable (without having to dismantle anything)  - One charge is more than enough for one hair cut    Below are not necessarily cons, but are difficulties that probably apply to all clippers:    - Hair clipping skill must be learned for a good outcome  - Use of scissors can not be avoided in some areas    Caution for first timers:    - Use the higher setting for the first few attempts. That way, if you mess it up, you can visit the local hair cut shop.  - Allow plenty of time for clean up after the session</li>
    <li> When I first picked up this hair clipper I thought it would not be up to the job.  It felt a bit to light and flimsy but so far it has been a pleasant surprise.  Sturdy enough to handle one son&#x27;s thick wavy locks and the design allows my older son the ability to easily shave his head on a regular basis.  Furthermore he feels it cuts closer to his scalp and is easier for him to do the back of his head without a helping hand.  This item will pay for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> GF took 30 minutes to finish, Using 20mm limited, but it&#x27;s short for winter, next time will be try to 30mm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this hair clipper. It&#x27;s actually better than I expected for my short hair. The first time I used it I was worried about scalping myself, but it was actually very easy to use with no pulling, snagging, or uneven spots whatsoever. Now I can touch up the \\&quot;do\\&quot; whenever I feel like it and I&#x27;m saving time and money without relying on a barber.    I really like the fast charge time of the lithium batteries on this model (one hour to a full charge). I&#x27;d strongly recommend this model over the QC5170 which is also cordless but has an eight hour charge time.    Length adjustment is a snap. It comes with three guides: 1/2, 1-5, and 6-9. Once you&#x27;ve got a guide snapped on you simply rotate the base between the available sizes for that guide. In my case, I snap on the medium guide (1-5) and go with #4 on the top of my head. Then I rotate it down to #2 for the sides and back. And finally, I&#x27;ll snap on the 1/2 to let my Wife or Daughter trim the back of my neck.    My only complaint (like an earlier reviewer) is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case. But I&#x27;m still giving it five stars because it exceeded my expectations in functionality.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cutting hair. The attachment and versatility lends itself to most hair sizes. Extremely light weight and manageable. Only down side is that the they are very sharp on lowest setting and can cut on irregular skin surfaces.</li>
    <li> I use a \\&quot;1\\&quot; One to cut my hair usually but with this cutter the lowest setting with the lowest cutting blade does NOT touch my hair and using the cutter without a blade guard is akin to shaving your head.  For those wanting very short hair, (but still some hair)&lt;br /&gt;I would advise against purchasing this product.  I have other cutters that come with a 1 and cut my hair without any problems but not this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it seems like a good a decent cutter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m balding and have elected to buzz my hair for the last 5 years.  I typically trim at least once a week, and have historically used the chorded trimmers with multiple attachments.  Bought the Qc5530/40 clipper about a month ago, and absolutely love it.  Extremely easy to use---the rotating head and chordless feature make it much easier to evenly trim the entire scalp without being a contortionist.  Very ergonomic---light and fits in the hand perfectly.  So far the battery has been holding a charge well---I&#x27;ve yet to re-charge it after the initial charge.    Great product at a great price---Philips Norelco did their homework on this!</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase clippers for a do it yourself haircut.  The first time I used this kit, it didn&#x27;t turn out too good.  The second time was alot better.  It does take a bit to get used to.  The fact that the head pivots makes it easy to do the back.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my haircut.  Now I save about $150 a year for haircuts.  Its well worth it!</li>
    <li> I shave my head to quarter-inch length two times a month using an AC-powered hair clipper.  That&#x27;s works well but I liked the idea of a cordless.  If you are like me, I dont think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this clipper. The guides are large and are designed for folks who want to _cut_ their hair, rather than shave their hair. You can adjust the guides to a closer cut, but it still isnt close enough.  I was a bit surprised there isnt a guide that allows for shaving your head -- sort of a no-brainer when selling a hair clipper.  You can of course completely remove the guide and shave but that will shred your skin (as will any clipper used without a guide) and that wont be a quater-inch cut either.</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair for years and these clippers make it very easy.  The clippers are rechargeable and hold charge for quite a few cuts.  It has an adjustable setting, although I can&#x27;t really comment on how well that works since I use them with the comb off.  It is easy to clean and you can run it under water to clean out the hair.  It adjusts to hit those hard to reach spots and really gives a close cut.  I have owned dozens of clippers over the years and this is probably my favorite and definitely the most user friendly.</li>
    <li> I can definitely say this is an apple product in Clippers. I had bought 2 more of different brands. But the quality of this is the best one can expect. First time I will give a 5 star to any Philips product ever.</li>
    <li> I got better using this with time.  I use the small comb on the largest setting for the entire head, and then reduce the setting incrementally as I cut the sides and back.  I get lots of compliments on my haircut, and I love saving money, and not having to tell a barber how to do it only to see it come out wrong.</li>
    <li> I recommend this item may times for my friend.. good quality and good price too... once again good price..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bader</li>
    <li> I asked and recieved this for christmas because I was losing my barber to retirement, and needed a way to cut my own hair until I found another barber. I chose Norelco because of past products and their excellent customer service when those products needed service. Overall, I would have given these clippers 5 stars, except for the fact that the height adjustment tends to move lower while cutting. I use the highest setting on the short attachment, and while cutting it tends to move to a lower setting if applying too much pressure to the device. One must be careful while cutting not to apply too much downward force or you&#x27;ll have uneven areas. Overall though, I&#x27;m happy with the results and the clippers. The battery lasts pleny long to get the job done, and it comes with plenty of attachments...just take your time and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son who will be going off to school next fall and wants to learn to cut his own hair. His first attempt was . . . interesting, but I used the clipper to clean him up and found it easy to use and very precise. We will continue experimenting and I am sure he will learn how to use it successfully before July. Seemed to have a lot of versatility.</li>
    <li> Never cut hair before, not the kids, not mine, not even the dogs. This was a first. Being a little apprehensive it sat on the shelf for a couple of weeks before I first used it. Charging it up only took minutes. While it charged I had a couple quick cups of coffee and I was ready.  Just went for it. Longest setting first on the whole head. Hadn&#x27;t had a hair cut in almost 4 months and my hair was quite long so I figured I&#x27;d whack it down to size first. Then down a couple clicks for the sides and lastly down a couple more for the bottom. A couple of quick trims at the sideburns and done. Might almost say I went at it with deliberate disregard.  Turned out great. Saved me the cost of the clipper on the first use. To use the expression the critics have banned for 2012, Amazing.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very comfortable and safe.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s useful to cut my hair myself.&lt;br /&gt;maybe i will buy other item of Philips.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m really sad to give this such a poor rating because I do like the way it works.  It is easy to adjust the length of the cut with a simple turn of the dial.  It is lightweight, cuts with precision and gives a nice haircut overall.  HOWEVER, after only using it 3 or 4 times it began to malfunction.  I will be in the middle of using it when it will suddenly make a very loud SQUEEK thout sounds like an abrupt (EERGH) sound, then it poops out.  It does this over and over until I finally give up and go to the salon.  I am going to have to purchase something else when I see a good sale!</li>
    <li> I use to go to the barber and trendy cutting hair places until one day I looked in the mirror and decided right then and there to find a method to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt; One consideration was the considerable amount of money you would have to pay, plus tipping and the whole social expectation, only to find out at the end of the session that my haircut was nothing special, and even more pressing news: I would have to repeat this process within two months or else.&lt;br /&gt; Figuring that there were products to help a person cut their own hair or the hair of  family members, I started searching and buying. One of the first devices I purchased was the \\&quot;Flow Bee\\&quot;. This product you would have to attach to a vacuum cleaner and it guaranteed an even haircut with no room for errors. One of its advertisements was that it was used in outer space by astronauts, and at the time I thought I was in the cutting edge technology, and happily purchased this item. After using it it for several months I got tired of having to attach it to a vacuum so it lost its novelty.&lt;br /&gt; I then bought a Remington Hair Cutting system at Costco for a very economical price and it worked as expected and paid itself many times over, but it required a willing person to complete the task.&lt;br /&gt;Enter Philips Norelco Qc5530/40 Do-it-yoursel Hair Clipper for 2011. As opposed to the Remington it said I could do a haircut by myself and this intrigued me for what is better than a complete power of choice as to when and where. I received this new Hair Clipper today and I immediately read the instructions and familiarized myself with the parts and instructions. I found it very light and liked the fact that it swivels with an 180 degrees rotating head. Easy to charge and washable on a faucet now the most important thing to find out was wether I could cut my hair easily and painlessly without any assistance.&lt;br /&gt; Yes to both accounts, even though the hairline on the back of the head is something that requires accuracy of a more precise nature, and I am sure that with practice and the right set of mirrors  it can be done.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco cut my hair fast, and I must admit that I am gladly surprised and happy with the product. One more person in my house tried it and the results were equally satisfying. It is an ingenious product and in its simplicity does not seem to be lacking any key aspect to accomplish a very decent haircut. Now I am heading for the shower, for one thing I do despise is those little particles of hair that end up in the clothes, or worst still, on the sheets when sleeping time is at hand.&lt;br /&gt;I must also add that amazon.com continues to dazzle the consumer in me and I am convinced that they are top dogs in the internet. That said and with an open heart I give this one 4.5 Stars, not quite 5 for I only enjoy it for one day but it looks well built and I am certain that many good people will find it to be an asset. Wish amazon would consider the half points for there is a big difference from one number to the next up or down and sometimes a 3.5  is more like it than a 3. And a 4.5 is much better than a 4 Star rating.</li>
    <li> Now I myself can cut my hair. It is very easy. Head rotation help a lot. Love it!  It is a money saver. Use it a couple and it is already paid off compared to Barber shop.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend and proved how little I know about shavers - this is a hair clipper with everything you need to give your man (or yourself) a really nice haircut - it&#x27;s cordless, charges quickly has several attachments for length and has a swivel head that makes it easy should you need it.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that many men would be able to cut their own hair with this because of the rotating head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this is not, is a shaver.  The man I got this for keeps his head shaved at all times (to hide the fact that he&#x27;s getting a bit gray - but I didn&#x27;t tell you that) this did not allow the close cut he needed for his head.  So being the genius that I am, I tried it on the dog who always needs a good haircut and doesn&#x27;t want to be bald.  This does not work well at ALL on fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what this is designed for, and the price, it is an excellent do it yourself clipper.  I don&#x27;t believe that it will last for a long time or through heavy use - but then again it&#x27;s not priced like a Wahl so you can&#x27;t expect the durability.  Based on what I see in construction - I would give it about 5+ years if used once a month or so.  Well worth the current posted price.</li>
    <li> After spending money on haircut for about a year, I decided to give the clippers a try.   I found this one highly reviewed. It also had oil-free usage and cleaning - something I was particular about.   I went to the Philips website, compared similar products and found this one to be a balance of price and features that I was looking for.     The product arrived fast, and I found it to be of very sturdy built and easy to modify setting and use.   The combs moved easily through my hair and the cut went smooth and thorough.     I tried the precision trimmer, works awesome. I almost love it already, after using only once.   Tell you what, the best part is that you don&#x27;t have to maintain a whole BIG bundle of combs, clippers and oil in those highly advertised 20+ piece kits.     And for you, the globe-trotter, it&#x27;s easy to pack and put in a bag and specs allow it to be charged anywhere across the globe. Both corded and cordless operation only add to the nice-to-have feature list.  I wish it came with a travel pouch though.     Overall excellent product, don&#x27;t look elsewhere. Do place your order now.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a standard style at-home clipper but was always concerned that the seemingly flimsy plastic comb attachments would break. Therefore,I went online with the intent of finding the best quality hair clipper I could find. Recommendations from several sources pointed me to the Norelco Qc5530/40. It appears to be a well made piece of machinery but it still has those plastic combs. I will say that they appear to be much more durable than what I had before though. The product descriptions I read made claims to the ease of use due to the unique swivelling head design but I did not find it to be particularly helpful. The height adjustment features are nice but it seems like the detents that \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the height adjustment in place are not very substantial and that the cutting height could quite easily change while in use. Admittedly I have only used this product twice so far so maybe with use I will grow to like and trust it more.&lt;br /&gt; On the positive side, this item is lightweight and fits in my hand quite nicely. The motor is surprisingly quiet and runs very smoothly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and the design is good. you do not need to worry about the wire. you can find some videos in youtube to teach you how to cut you own hair.</li>
    <li> I did not figure the higher settings would have much luck with my hair and was correct.  I started with the highest setting with the longest comb and the clippers stood no chance.  I then went down a couple more and laughed. At 3/7 setting with the longest comb I had better luck but still my hair said, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t think so!\\&quot;  Finally the lowest setting on the longest comb got it mostly under control.  I was hungry so I went out to eat and let my hair get wind blown and finally the last bit of hair that was playing hide and go seek got snipped once I got home.  I cannot give an actual amount of time it took because I played with so many settings but now that my hair is at the length I want it will not take much time to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a clipper length of 6 or below these clippers will do the job.  The higher settings might work for some people but for me I would have to have someone else do it which defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to ding it one star because the dial indicator was not placed in the proper location.  The indicator on my unit is off 50 percent so the lowest setting actually shows it is at the half way mark.  Since I will be using the large comb on the lowest setting this is no big deal.  For people wanting to use a setting above 4 with the combs this could cause problems since there are no indicators to mark the setting.  Who knows I might of gotten the only unit that had the indicator put on wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good investment for those that want to do it yourself and don&#x27;t mind a 6 or below hair cut.  If I had gone to the stylist I would of had my hair cut at the same setting and paid $20.  Since I took advantage of the 40% off sale these clippers have nearly paid for them self after one use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using an older, corded clipper when I came across Norelco&#x27;s DIY at a sale price I couldn&#x27;t pass on. Before receiving it, I&#x27;d read the positive reviews and was just hoping that it would live up to some of my expectations; not believing that it could ever live up to them all, as it would eventually do. In hindsight, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made, when taking the price and product quality into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could give a more detailed review, but the best thing I can say is that it works as well as you&#x27;d want it to work. Unlike my old clippers, there is no cord to get in the way and it doesn&#x27;t require any messy oil. The rechargeable battery lasts much longer then I expected it to last (in fact, I&#x27;ve already cut my hair several times and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.) I&#x27;m not sure if I really make use of the rotating blade, but honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how you could make it any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was able to purchase it on sale at half of the MSRP price, I think it&#x27;s worth every penny of the higher MSRP price. Around the same time, I purchased a far more expensive Norelco razor and I only wish that I was as happy with it, as I am with the DIY clipper.</li>
    <li> very sturdy, reliable, precise clipper. i have moderately long hair and have cut it twice with very nice and sharp results.  best clipper i have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love the concept of this hair clipper... unfortunately it&#x27;s implementation makes it one of the worst trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned. As I see it, there are two key problems: the motor and the motor attachment. First, it seems like Philips took the motor out of a standard face shaver and stuck it in a hair clip... this is a terrible idea! Simply put, this unit doesn&#x27;t have the torque to cut through anything but the thinnest / shortest hair. It regularly gets caught in my moderately-thick hair, which brings me to the second problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit translates the rotational power of the motor into linear motion via a metal pin driving a plastic wedge. The strain of cutting the hair is put on a cheap plastic component, being driving by a metal one. The result? Half way through my first haircut, the clipper starting making a terrible squeal. I immediately stopped it, cleaned it, and went back to work. A few minutes later, the same thing happened. This time, I took it apart to see what the issue was... the aforementioned plastic component had been ground down to nearly nothing! By the second haircut, I had to throw the unit out... the critical plastic component had literally been ground away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this thing is woefully underpowered and cheaply made. I got exactly 1.5 haircuts out of it before it irrevocably broke.</li>
    <li> When I first reviewed this product right after buying it, I gave it a top review. It worked great. Second time, it started making this weird screeching noise every 1-2 passes through the hair. It eventually stopped trimming altogether. Hair constantly gets stuck in the trimmer, forcing removal and cleaning after each pass, and doesn&#x27;t cut more than an inch into the hair with needing that cleaning. That screeching is so loud, I actually stopped using it. It is now holding my drawer down and useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 2.5 years and it still works fine.  It uses the same charging cord as my Norelco 3100 shaver, so I only have to keep one cord handy.  It comes with a plastic bag to wrap around your shoulders to keep hair off your clothes, but it is flimsy and the ties come off easily.  Not a big deal because I didn&#x27;t even know it was included.  Makes cutting your hair a bit easier since it is cordless and the blade head rotates 180 degrees. I bought this specific cutter because it had a large #9 guide comb which I think translates to 1.25 inches.  Many other trimmers only had shorter lengths. The trimmer has twenty settings which are adjustable by simply turning a ring along with two comb guards.  Be sure and double-check if the comb guide is extended or retracted after switch the external comb guide or you might be in for a surprise when you cut a chunk out of your hair. For the record this is Maria&#x27;s husband.</li>
    <li> First, I like to review based primarily on the value of a product.  This hair clipper is more expensive than another hair cut clip Vine sent for my review: [[ASIN:B004FJ3QQM Remington Products HC5350AM Professional Cord/cordless Rechargeable Haircut Kit]].  That one has top notch construction, and I note even that one is much more expensive than the hair cut kit I actually purchased with my own money some time ago [[ASIN:B0001ZMXSQ Remington HC-8017B Precision 22 Piece Corded Haircut Kit]].  So, I&#x27;m trying to get real here about spending $60 for a product I suspect most people spend $20 on.  Why would you?  Well, this one&#x27;s a LOT better.  First of all, the construction quality of excellent.  The handle and the operation are much simpler.  The way the clipper mechanism is not at the end of a &#x27;stick&#x27;, but rather a protrusion below, does make it a bit easier to see what the heck you&#x27;re doing.  The ability to simply adjust the clipping length without changing the filter combs (you do have two of them, one for the short lengths and one for the long) is a huge benefit over the cheaper clipper.  And it&#x27;s cordless, which makes life so easy.  I have a mirror in my garage, and I&#x27;ll just run out there to clip the majority of my hair, and then go into my bathroom for the high detail work.  Because it&#x27;s cordless, this is very easy, and it really reduces the cleanup chore.  In fact, with the cheapest clipper, the one I paid money for, I had gotten so frustrated I simply put it up and cut my hair with scissors alone.  This clipper is simply much easier than traditional clippers.  The cool design makes accurate cutting very easy, producing great results.  But... is it worth the price?  If you pay it, you&#x27;ll be satisfied, but if you&#x27;re happy with the older clipper style, I think you could also happily choose a cheaper cordless option.  So I&#x27;m deducting a star for value, even though I think this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> My son cuts his own hair, and does a good job of it. But when I saw these cordless clippers I knew these would be perfect for him. And they are. Fits well in the hand--it is pleasant rather than clunky to hold. Easy to use. And no cord makes it quite convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does precisely what you&#x27;d like it to do, and does it well. He is very happy! Reasonable price, good quality, cuts well, tidy package. A winner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend as a gift.She loves it very much.It is very convenient to use.A good tool of your everyday life.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair clipper before Christmas and just tried it out. My wife cut my hair and it worked great. It will take a few times to perfect the cut but with the ease of use, that will certainly be easy to attain. Definately would recommend this product. It paid for itself using it one time.</li>
    <li> Since I began going bald around 1998, my wife has been cutting my hair with clippers at home.  This saves about $15 per month or so (plus gas and time spent) and I get the same result as going to a hair salon.  Currently, we have the [[ASIN:B00181YEVQ Wahl All-Star Combo Designer + Peanut Set #8331]] and it has stayed sharp and works with no issues for about the past 8 years.  This clipper is corded and has detachable combs that control the length of cut.  It also has a magnetic vibrating motor that powers the cutter, so the motor should never wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco clipper is cordless, and its motor is a gear-driven, rotating pin that causes the cutting heads to cut.  It cuts just OK compared to the Wahl.  The comb on it seems to push hair on the edges away, leaving them uncut.  If you go over the same area a couple times, it gets all the hair though.  It&#x27;s a little louder than the Wahl as well.  The combs are more comfortable than the Wahl, as the head on the Norelco tilts and follows your scalp, whereas the Wahl combs are fixed and have more pointed tips that can dig in.  The head does rotate, which might allow someone to cut their own hair, however I wonder how you would be able to see well enough to trim the back of your neck evenly with your hairline?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the question of longevity.  I have no doubt my Wahl clippers will last a lifetime, although I&#x27;m sure the blades may need to be replaced at some point.  But this cordless Norelco -- how long will the battery last?  How about the geared motor -- will it ever break down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the only advantages I see being that it&#x27;s cordless and you could rotate the comb and more comfortably clip the back of your own head, I think I will stick with my corded clipper for now.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and even shorter patience for sitting in the salon chair.  This product has come to the rescue.    It is compact, easy to use, comes with additional attachments, is cordless and light-weight, and has a complete set of easy to understand instructions.  And, after charging it up for about an hour - I was ready to go.    My only words of caution is to start slow and cautiously.  It is such a well made machine that if you aren&#x27;t careful you might wind up cutting more hair than you&#x27;d planned. But if you have small children and want to save a bunch of money, than this is the product for you.  You will be very impressed at how proficient you will become in no time.  Just ask my husband, who now cuts my hair on s regular basis.</li>
    <li> Although the design requires some practice to use ergonomically, these hair clippers works as described. The rotational function does seem awkward at first, but it is advantageous for do-it-yourselfers, as long as good lighting with &#x27;two&#x27; mirrors are used during the process [one in the front and rear] for better views.     The lithium battery power is above average, and the charge seems to hold well thus far.  Best of all: In addition to easy cleaning, unlike other clippers, absolutely no maintenance or blade lubrication is required.</li>
    <li> The clippers are excellent. I owned a few Conair clippers before this one, that constantly needed oil and let me tell you, none of them are on the same quality and design, Philips had put on these. They are a joy to use and so convenient. Love the fact they are washable and easy to clean. And they can rotate 90 degrees, so they are comfortable. Overall an A+ product. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I tried getting a good haircut with this clipper for about 2 years. I found that I had to go over and over the same spot to get it to cut. I now have a Wahl and it does a great job the first time and for less money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own haircut for years and this is the best hair clipper I had so far. The accumulator holds the charge for a long time and it is quite powerful.</li>
    <li> Got this unit today , a few days earlier than projected. Instructions are fairly easy to understand, though you dont really need them unless you plan to take it apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, i have very coarse hair and these clippers made lite work of it, only snagged a little if i went to fast. Hair emptied the same way as other clippers, out the front, only occasionally would some get trapped in the &#x27;hollow spot&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have complained that the comb can come out of adjustment, i found this only true if your hand accidentally&lt;br /&gt;brushes against the adjustment knob, but i caught it before i made another pass. And you can avoid this by keeping you hand awaw from the middle adjustment section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light weight and came about half way pre-charged, i plugged it in for about 15-20 minutes and it finished charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i cant comment on the longevity of these, i will update this if i have a problem later.</li>
    <li> Haircuts have become a luxury for me since the economy is down. I just couldn&#x27;t  afford it. I looked for alternatives and this seemed the best. I knew nothing  about cutting my own hair but a couple of trips to the library and after many internet vids, solved that problem. I search around for the perfect cutter that will fit my needs. Then came  this one, the norelco qc553. The 180° head works very well. I was able to effortless cut my hair with relative ease.The blades are very sharp and cut the hair with no problem at all. I was relieved in particular on how well the blades cut, because my old barber would say that i have Thick hair. All in all this beauty gets the job done and in style!</li>
    <li> I ordered this clipper to replace a standard clipper that broke after about 2 years of monthly use.  Although it is a little pricier than standard clippers, I feel the upgrades justify the extra expense (especially considering that extra expense is only about $10-15).  Having a cordless clipper makes clipping your own hair much easier, as does having the rotating head.  I thought this may be a gimmick, but it actually works, and makes covering all areas evenly easier to achieve.  I also found the telescoping combs to make everything that much easier.  Make sure you know what you are doing, or start with a long length as a trial.  The combs are great because they glide easily through the hair work well at feeding the hair through the cutter.  The precision trimmer has angled sides at 45 degrees, which makes it perfect for trimming hair around the ears without worrying about taking out a chunk of hair on the side of your head.  It takes me about 15 minutes to cut my hair with this trimmer, so a charge should easily last a few cuts for me, and if it dies, I can use it plugged in to finish.  ******** Update after 3rd use********  I have to deduct a star from my original 5 star review.  My only qualm with this clipper is the combs bend in slightly which makes the trimmer cut closer in the middle than on the sides, basically it caves in in the center of the comb if you press too hard.  This makes it awkward to trim my facial hair.  It can be controlled by not pressing too hard, but old habits die hard and my chin has suffered a couple rough trims at the hands of this clipper.  I just wish the combs were a slightly more rigid plastic.</li>
    <li> I use these to touch-up and keep an expensive cut longer.  Very easy to use; well made and durable --and the cordless feature is really great.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I really liked this hair trimmer and Notelco products but just after 2 months of usage the plastic adjustment piece for hair length cracked, so I just use the other pieces at this time. So I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Received the item quickly and packaged well. I have not worked up the nerve yet to try cutting my own hair, but have used it to cut someone elses hair and it worked fine. I am a little concerned how well it will hold up over time as the different combs are made of plastic that seems kind of light.... not sure how well it will last, and if dropped I am sure it would be easily broken. The cutting length settings work well, although I would have preferred a longer setting be available. I used the longest settings for the top (maybe 1.5\\&quot;), shorter settings for the side, and the shortest settings around the ears and back for a tight taper. It can cut very short and the cutting blades seem to be plenty sharp, giving a good cut. I do wish there would have been more guidance on \\&quot;How-To\\&quot; to give the user confidence in cutting their own hair. I would suggest the manufacturer prepare an online video to teach you how to use it to cut your own hair yourself. So far I have not used it on myself and need to use it a few times on others to develop confidence in doing so.</li>
    <li> In these times of economic hardship and thrift, self reliance is key.  Why spend $15 to $25 dollars and wait at the local barbershop to do a relatively simple task you can accomplish with some merit of satisfaction all by yourself?  This device makes it easy and entirely possible to cut your own hair.  You no longer need fear the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Norelco Qc5530/40 clippers today and immediately set to testing it out.  It&#x27;s best to play it safe and start  with the longest safety comb placed at the top setting of #9 to get a feel for the device.  I ended up using a setting of #8 on the top of my head, #6 on the sides and #4 on the neck.  Be careful, however, at the lowest settings because a mistake at the low settings can be seen (as I quickly learned!).  Hair always grows back, though, so no need to fret about any learning mistakes for too long.  You&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful device!  It is a step toward thrift and self reliance.  It does a very decent job of cutting hair.  The adjustable length comb guides make it easy to use.  I got mine for only $24 with a special Amazon coupon which is about the price of a single haircut!  You can&#x27;t go wrong at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be frugal, go for it and save some money.  These hard times practically demand it and you&#x27;ll feel a sense of accomplishment when you can finally cut your own hair without fear.  Heck, you probably shave your own beard so why not take the next step and cut your own hair now that technology has advanced to help you accomplish the task at a very low cost?</li>
    <li> It is true that this product is very easy to use.However,if you want to \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot;,still tough.  cheap good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It does have a somewhat difficult learning curve to use, but when has it ever been easy to cut your own hair?!  The battery charges quickly and, amazingly, holds the charge for weeks.  The attachments and the blades clean up easily since they can just be run under the faucet.  I highly recommend this clipper as it&#x27;s an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Qc5530/40 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper  I already use it to cut four head including my self.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and long better life.</li>
    <li> What sets this clipper apart from the others is the adjustable rotating head.  If you want to cut your own hair and have tried with a clipper that doesn&#x27;t rotate, then you know how difficult that can be if you aren&#x27;t Plastic Man.  This one is the answer to that problem.  If you don&#x27;t need the rotating head,  it&#x27;s still a very good clipper.</li>
    <li> this phillips norelco DYI hair cutter is truly amazing.  I was careful to begin with the longest setting, then quickly learned to use attachments and setting to shorten side hair; then to use it to trim around ears, and back of neck... I now have a better hair cut than Amy charged me $30.  It has already paid for itself, in one cut.</li>
    <li> I started cutting my own hair about a year ago, this little buddy does a fine job, the more I use it the more I like it.</li>
    <li> mine lasted about a 9 months before the guard broke. i fixed it with a paper clip and some cement. then the other side broke about 4 months later. i fixed it but it was in a bad spot, so it didnt hold. guards are not covered under warranty and they cost $19 bucks plus shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its  a good trimmer and makes cutting your own hair easier, but i wish they would bulk up the guards or price them more affordably.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s durable, easy to use, and cuts really well! Of course, I&#x27;ve only used it the one time, but it&#x27;s already earned its keep, so for the price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat it!</li>
    <li> Being a cordless hair clipper, the rotational head becomes a significant feature. The clipper is sharp and makes uniform length haircuts. An excellent product that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Major update as of 7-20-12.  My first review was mainly a caution about carefully selecting the hair cutting length, but after a few weeks I had to exchange the shaver because the 2 long adjusting comb heads were not staying in place.  Only the short comb would not vibrate loose.  My replacement trimmer does work...BUT...now I am absolutely convinced that the vibration is excessive.  Turn the unit on, and the trimmer is as much a vibrator...as it is a hair trimmer. :(  Disappointing, because the prior Norelco hair trimmers have always been well made with minimum vibration.  IMHO, the way this trimmer is designed, I&#x27;m guessing that the comb heads will not last as long as the trimmer unit.  Consistent with the poor quality, you&#x27;ll eventually find that the hair length plastic strip will easily peel off.  I thought it was just a protective cover, but once it&#x27;s off....just black plastic behind it.  How Norelco could create this new design trimmer is disappointing.</li>
    <li> I own a peanut by Wahl and decided to try another clipper that was cordless for self haircuts. Boy was I disappointed. This thing sucks! My peanut is small and light and cuts the correct amount of hair according to which guard you use. This one no matter what guard is NOT going to be the length you want. I find my cuts to come out very uneven with this clipper and I actually just dropped it off at goodwill. Get the Peanut by Wahl if you want a nice self cut thats simple.</li>
    <li> The clipper arrived on time. I had a problem trying to get the 40% rebate offered. But a little time spent with customer service; I finally received it. The item is nicely packaged; with all accessories included. I read the instructions on how to get it up and going. The main thing that you have to do is charge the unit before use. Charging takes about an hour. The indicator light at the base where the cord is plugged in blinks; then remains lit when charged. Since my hair is short now. I will not have to use it for about a month from now. That will be the true test. More on the actual grooming experience then.&lt;br /&gt;The first cut took about 15 minutes to do. Even though I read the directions, I still had to figure out which clipper attachment to use. Then the length, turning the dial beneath the attachment to the desired number. After that it was just turning it on. Then just like brushing or combing my hair I followed the contours of my head and it cut. I used the precision trimer to touch my neckline up.  Not bad for the first time. I cleaned it with some water and let everything dry. As time goes on, the next cut will be even easier and faster. That was $12.00 saved. Another cut and I will break even. What a savings! Overall I am impressed with the clipper, the way it cut, and the finishing touches. Buy it and use it; you will not go wrong!</li>
    <li> Bought this on as it was a great price and needed to replace our existing clippers.  Well worth the money.  The cut is much more even than our old clippers.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, everything works well,easy to use, easy adjustable heights, and quick easy clean up, I have to give a two thumbs up to Philips Norelco!!</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this product after using it for at least 6 times so I can give an accurate review.  I like this product so far, it clips off hair very fast and clean in a painless way.  I even use it to cut my 7 years old hair and he didn&#x27;t complain at all.  It&#x27;s not that noisy as well.</li>
    <li> Does a reasonable job on my old balding head.  When I found out my son has been cutting his own hair for years with these, I though why am I paying $15-20 for a 10 minute haircut?  So I tried it.  The only problem I have is the hairline by my neck.  My wife helps so I don&#x27;t do any damage :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for a few months now and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  I still haven&#x27;t gotten used to handling it because of its unconventional shape......but that isn&#x27;t a big problem.  It cuts very nicely...and the battery is excellent...I&#x27;m still on the first charge after probably about 5 or 6 haircuts.  It takes a little getting used to but all in all I definitely don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I had an older cordless clipper that was dying - it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge or work properly when plugged in.  I decided for under $30, I&#x27;d give these a try.  So far I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve used the clippers twice and they had much more power to cut than my previous.  I also love the fact I can wash them under the sink and don&#x27;t have to worry about oiling the blades.  I use these to shave my head once a week.  The clipper attachment is removeable, which allows for a close shave with just the blades.  I don&#x27;t find it uncomfortable or too rough on my head, but if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, you may want to go with the other model that has shaving attachments.  The adjustable clipper attachment is a great idea, although I don&#x27;t have much use for it.  Overall great product and hope it lasts for a while.  Money well spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 MONTH UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The clippers have been holding up well and I&#x27;m still happy with them.  I use them once or twice a week for 10 minutes for shaving my head.  I don&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but don&#x27;t really like to use a razor.  These work perfectly, getting really close once I take off the length attachment.  The battery only needs to be charged once a month.  I&#x27;ve washed the unit each time after use under the sink and let it dry out until the next use.</li>
    <li> Just got this today, and gave it a try since I&#x27;ve been waiting to cut my hair to use it. I&#x27;ve been buzzing my hair for a few years, using a number of different clippers (most a bit cheaper than this one - your usual $20-$30 Wahl cheap-o&#x27;s), and this one has worked by far the best. The blades were noticeably sharper than on the other clippers I&#x27;ve used, no random long hairs to go back over afterwards, and it cut straight through on the first try. The swiveling/contouring head took a little getting used to, but was really nice after a couple minutes of use, especially for the back and my left side. The washable feature is handy as well, and the unit cleaned well just by running warm water over the head. The only thing I would say to watch out for is the unit cuts deeper than all others I&#x27;ve used at the same length measurement; I would start with at least 1 # higher than you normally use (makes a huge difference when you normally use a 2, and come out with a 3/4 to 1 - but oh well, it&#x27;ll grow back in no time). Wish it came with some sort of case, but not that big of a deal as I&#x27;ll only ever use the smaller clip and the charger.</li>
    <li> This is the product I was waiting for.  Previously, I had a regular, large, barber shop-type set of clippers, which required my wife to cut my hair (very short, from #1 to #4).  I wanted to be able to do it myself, so I could cut it more frequently.  This product does everything it advertises, and does it well.  Here are the highlights;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First of all, and most importantly, it cuts!  No need to pass the clippers many times over the same area to make it cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It stays sharp without requiring messy oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The way the heads adjust without having to change combs is great and saves a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Much more convenient wireless operation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The head swivel mechanism is key to allowing you to cut your own hair in the back and works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. You can clean it under the sink easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but it is refreshing to find a product that really does what it promises.  I fully recommend this clipper.</li>
    <li> This clipper charged quickly and delivered a great buzz-cut the first time used. Cutters are sharp and the guard is easy to adjust. Read the instructions first -- the guard simply pops off without a catch, but the cutter head has a pair of release buttons you should press and hold to avoid stressing the retaining hooks. The swivel head is very well-designed, and the shape of the device fits the hand nicely. The included small trimmer for beards is very precise. I wear a simple buzz-cut, but users who desire more complex styles will certainly find this clipper pleasing to use.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this unit.  The swivel head is very useful, especially for cutting the left side of the head using the right hand.  You swivel it 45, then 90 degrees one way to cut from the back of the head, and 45 then 90 degrees the other way to cut from the front of the head.  Nice height adjustments with a wide range.  It is difficult to get hair to stand up enough for larger guard lengths so clippers can trim the tips off, but that is the art of hair cutting. I suspect that is why at salons they do it by hand with comb and scissors. I use a brush to help it stand up on top just prior to the clippers coming in.  I use #6 on top, #3 on the sides and back, and #2 on the lower sides and back, in that order.  I do it once a week just prior to a shower, and have a small canister vacuum cleaner to clean up the small amount of hair in the bathroom.  Bathroom has great light and mirrors.  Just prior to showering, I plug unit in to recharge then put the vacuum away.  It is recharged soon after showering and dressing and I put it away for next week&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> Very good, easy to use, high quality design. My only worry is that it would be hard to find substitues if the plastic guard breaks</li>
    <li> I just cut my own hair for the first time in my life. It only took me about an hour, including the shower. And I can&#x27;t yet believe how well it was done! Besides, the cleaning is easy since this product is tap-water safe.  I used some other clippers to cut other&#x27;s hair before. It wasn&#x27;t a joyful experience.</li>
    <li> its very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;it gives a nice even cut&lt;br /&gt;very good product if u want a self cutting product</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This gets used so infrequently the charging feature is not a great advantage.  I don&#x27;t particularly like the shape.  I bought it because I love my norelco shaver.  This is just ok.  Sometimes the top pops off when I am trying to get the back of my head.  Minor irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and yes I&#x27;ve also bought a baseball cap just in case I royally screw it up... next time I use it I&#x27;m going to go a step further and actually cut more hair (you&#x27;ll be afraid to start at a low setting and give yourself a lopsided haircut on accident..so yeah..a baseball cap just in case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good unit.. I&#x27;ve read reviews on some people breaking the plastic fins and I can see why.. they&#x27;re not thick and the unit seems delicate so it&#x27;s not something you want to drop...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it. :)</li>
    <li> My hair is very difficult to cut it is too straight. I am Hispanic but my hair is too Asian, I wanted to save money and bough this, it is very easy and i think i am going to save good money because my hair grows as weed.</li>
    <li> Well, have used it once so far, basically easy to use, did a GOOD job on hair-cut, think I just need more practice!!(Read the instructions!) Think it was a great deal, seeing as how the cost of 1 haircut exceeds the cost of this nifty lil tool, like the idea it can be used cordless, look forward to more hair-cutting!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He only cuts his hair at home, and will not pay to have it done. His old clippers were kind of worn out and missing certain attachments. This was a birthday gift and he said it is so much easier to use. I actually gave him his first cut from me on his birthday (and it looked great. Easy to use and change attachments out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with incredible long battery duration.</li>
    <li> This product makes it easy to trim my own hair. It will save me quite a bit of money, and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> it is precise flexible and I like that it can be charged and clip without a chord, the charge lasts long enough for me 2-3 haircuts + some beard trimming, but I feel big difference between the highest level of the small comb and the lowest of the large comb.</li>
    <li> Well...... when I first got the Philips Norelco Qc5530/40 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper, I took my time and was really careful. I had never clipped my own hair before. I am close to 70, and this was my first try. I read the instructions. I read all of the reviews. Then I carefully tried to clip in the direction of the hair. I set up two mirrors so I could be careful to cut in the right direction and that I would not take too much off. I was using the largest attachment and had the clipper on the longest hair setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was coming out OK but I was much too timid. I was afraid of botching my haircut and having to hide-out in my home for a week or two until it grew back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...... today, I blundered into a few videos on YouTube showing how other men cut their own hair. They cut their hair quickly, in all directions, up and back, up the sides, across the sides, up the back and over the top of the head, etc., in ALL directions, over and over again just like they were combing their hair! Plus... they didn&#x27;t need to use a mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to do the same thing. Without the use of a mirror, and without regard for my well being, I threw caution to the wind, turned the little sucker on, and then started clipping in all directions as calmly as I could, just like I was combing or brushing my hair. It turned out GREAT!!! I LOVE it! No more waiting in line for a haircut. No more spending the bucks on a haircut! No more wasting good gas money driving to the barber! Who says that you can&#x27;t teach old dogs new tricks! :)</li>
    <li> What I like most about the Philips Hair clipper, is the ability to evenly cut course hair on all ends. Easy to clean &amp; manage, &amp; holds electric charge for a good long time. So far theres no complaint I can find, this thing really works fabulously &amp; saves users a trip to the barber shop.</li>
    <li> These clippers are awesome for humans but even better for dogs! The teeth are wide enough to cleanly shave a dogs thick hair. If your dog needs a haircut, go with these!</li>
    <li> well from the add of this product it looks, cutting hair and giving it style is very easy with this clipper&lt;br /&gt;what is dose is jut cutting the hair for creating style you really need to work of with other stuff&lt;br /&gt; and be more skilled. But it&#x27;s cheep anyways so it&#x27;s good to have one!</li>
    <li> I was amazed how simple this machine is to operate and the battery is strong. Starting with the longer attachment, I made a first pass following the way I comb my hair. I quickly dropped the long attachment to the lowest trim setting and then still found it not enough so I attached the shorter cutter. At that point, maybe I took a bit too much before I noticed the chopped areas where visible.  With some finesse on a higher setting and still more hair cut overall to even out the mistake, I managed to make it look good.  Have plenty of light and go easy as once you trim too much - it&#x27;s gone. This review is based on my first use and it looks darn good!  I had family help me with the back of my head as I did not want to take too much like I did elsewhere.  Frankly even if the cutter rotates to aid you (which helps), it&#x27;s still tough to work the back of your head.  A minute or two of assistance I think is needed to have someone cut the hair on the back of your head so that it is consistent. Excellent product considering I did not go to a stylist, was done in 10 minutes and not a word from anyone at the office the next day (no news is good news). If I can just delay cuts with a stylist or trim a bit as needed then I am happy with purchasing this product for home use. Considering I cut my hair complete on the first use says a great deal to me about the product functioning as designed.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair with a razor comb but saw this product and decided to try it. This product is so easy to use. It charges in exactly an hour. I especially like that you can change the angle of the blade to work with different parts of your head. I start out with the bigger comb at the longest setting and then if it didn&#x27;t cut enough hair, I changed the setting, one notch at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I hang a mirror on the bathroom door, facing the mirror over the sink so I can see to do the back and sides.&lt;br /&gt;It does take some practice to get your hair the way you want. I will never go back to the manual razor now that I\\&quot; have the Norelco. I&#x27;m sure this will work great for men and women&#x27;s hair. My hair is about is 3-4 inches all around but I think it will work even if it is a bit longer.</li>
    <li> This is an all around trimmer! It&#x27;s good for body,beard &amp; general upkeep men &amp; women!&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> I bought a clipper last year and it work out great till I moved and lost the cord. No one sells a replacement cord for this product. Other than that it is great. I cut my own hair. the battery last for an hour running before needing a new charge. I would say it is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I ever bought that was made in Hungary. They came up with a clipper that can cut and I mean reeeeaaaalllly cut! I tried to follow the directions in what was intended to be a users guide but proved to be as useless as mammary glands on a boar hog. I decided to proceed against my better judgement with the intention of giving myself a medium cut. The hungry clipper took a chunk of hair right down to the scalp. I tried to make an adjustment in an effort to reduce the absurdity of the bare spot by trimming around its edges. More chunks of hair and more bald spots were the result. When my wife came back home from shopping she looked at me with a puzzled expression and a grin that she could not suppress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had short hair before and in fact the USMC cut me a bit. Nothing I have experienced gave me the baldnesss of this Phillips cliper. When I leave the house I do so with a Marine veteran cap firmly planted on my head. In a few months I will probably be able to go capless as long as I stay away from Philips Norelco QC5530/40 Do-It-To Yourself-You-Fool Hair Clipper.</li>
    <li> What can I say hmmmm AWESOME! It does what it says and after having this for a year it is still working like I just bought it. Check out my review at the link below to see it.    [...]</li>
    <li> For years I have traveled 30 miles to get my hair trimmed - since the barber and myself are good friends - and enjoyed the same interest in hunting.&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing the PV5530/40 trimmer thru Amazon, I don&#x27;t know how to tell my barber that I&#x27;m now cutting my own hair (or I should say my wife&lt;br /&gt;has been cutting).  My wife had never cut mens hair, before using this trimmer -- and the first time she cut my hair, it was the&lt;br /&gt;best haircut I&#x27;ve had in years. It took us both reading over and over the instructions on how to use because neither one of us had ever used a product like this and I think it was the Fear of The Unknown.  She went very slow to start - I would check what it looked like - tell her to cut somemore and so on until I gave her the OK.  Once you get used to the operation, you&#x27;ll love the outcome, at least I did. The price I paid for the unit paid for itself the first time.  Give it a try -- there is a momey back guarantee if you are not satisfied.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m usually really harsh in my product reviews, but this is actually a quality set of clippers for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;it;s been over a year since i bought it ... it keeps a charge for a long time, and the blades have stayed sharp...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that the attachments have no bag/case but i just keep mine in a ziplock in the medicine chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall great product.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Still running well as of today (07/16/2015). Will buy same brand, similar model if this one breaks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and my wife has been using it to cut my hair. The rotating top comes in handy and the adjustable guard rail works too. Cuts fine, better than some heavier/larger models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it gets four rather than five stars is build quality. There is something rattling around inside of there and I&#x27;m not sure how long this will last.  If this one goes, I will buy another though.  The fact that it is rechargeable is nice too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and need to maintain a certain haircut all the time. I was tired of going to the barber 2-3 times per month and spending somewhere around $40 a month just on my hair. That is almost $500/year on just haircuts! I purchased these when Amazon had a coupon available, bringing the total to around $15. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these hair clippers! They work perfectly for giving myself haircuts at home. The included guides work great and I give myself a perfect haircut every time. The only thing I recommend buying in addition is some sort of mirror so you can see the back of your head/neck while trimming back there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy these if you want to save some money on haircuts!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, holds battery charge well, easy to remove and switch attachments, base works perfectly for mustache trimming. Very easy to clean and maintain. Already saved me more than it cost!!!</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with a self-haircutter for so cheap?  I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and still use it twice a week, works just as well as it did on day one and holds a charge really well.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this purchase. Rechargeable battery lasts probably about 30 minutes on continuous operation. Quick grooming and clean-up is easy with this cordless. Would have been nicer if a storage case was included.</li>
    <li> If your normal haircut is clippers only, you will have no problem using this, and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results. I like the fact that the numbering on the combs is the same as at the barber shop. My normal cut is #4 (1/2 inch) on the sides and back and #8 (1 inch) on the top. I did #4 on the sides and back, did #8 on the top, and then ran #6 over the area in between. I made several passes to try and catch stragglers. I never did rotate the head of the clipper, but I suppose it could be a useful feature. I got my spouse to QC the back and also trim the neckline. It is really tough to screw up. I was surprised how well it worked and I&#x27;ve already paid for it with one use. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have not been to my Barber since I bought this. I have tried others but this has worked the best. The head swivels but not a feature I have used much.</li>
    <li> I owned the older model and really liked the upgrades this model offers.  It is the best trimmer for my hair and beard that I have owned and I&#x27;ve been trimming my hair and beard with an electric trimmer since 1984.</li>
    <li> at the beginning, this clipper running very well. I liked it so much. but after 6 month, the clipper got stuck frequently. I have to clean tiny hair inside the clipper every 2 minutes. so upset.</li>
    <li> My son always has me cut his hair whenever he visits. Sometimes it gets very long. Now he can do it by himself and he looks good all the time, not just when he has come by the house. Step by step independence</li>
    <li> I really like this clipper. I use it frequently for trimming by hair and what I like about it is:&lt;br /&gt;-The chargeable battery is quite decent and lasts for a full single hair cut session (even more).&lt;br /&gt;- The head serves as a set of multiple clippers and this easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- The cutting is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely better compared to Conair, Wahl etc.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews, have not yet mastered it. The rotating head makes things possible that otherwise you would not be able to do. The neck area is difficult. I am going to install a swing arm mirror, and see if that helps. I wear my hair short I am not so sure how this would work on longer hair. I am sure my skill will improve, either no one noticed the uneven off square back of neck, or they did not choose to comment.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Had two Remingtons, both had battery problems.  The Norelco seems much more durable, works great, and can double as a beard trimmer.  All around top quality item.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best clipper that I ever use</li>
    <li> This is the first clipper that I have owned and it has worked well for me. Easy to use and does the job.</li>
    <li> i freakin love this thing. great power, lots of attachments and battery lasts forever</li>
    <li> I Like philishave, but this time this  Hair Clipper shut down too fast..:(( I was disappointed because I always thought that philishave is a great company</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hair clipper very easy to use and very resistant. Simply the best one I have tried so far. I also use it to cut my beard and it works perfectly. Absolutely worth the price. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THESE CLIPPERS BECAUSE THE HEAD SWIVELS AND MAKES THEM MUCH EASIER TO USE.  I HAVEN&#x27;T USED THEM BUT ONE TIME, BUT THEY DO WORK AS DESCRIBED AND GIVE A NICE CUT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Wahl and Norelco trimmers before. Basically, they all wore down before too long and became less and less usable - either the battery would die, or cheap plastic components would break.    This cutter is built extremely solidly, with few parts that seem likely to break, and its Li battery won&#x27;t fail the way others do, and it cuts through hair like butter. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of accessories, but if what you need is a reliable way to trim to a particular length, you should absolutely buy this.</li>
    <li> I have owned this system for 6 months before its little pieces started breaking.  I have used the system a total of around six times and though it worked fine the first 3-4 times, a couple of plastic pieces started failing one after the other.  For example the main cutting attachment (big comb) caved in and I discovered this after the haircut I received was much deeper than anticipated; not good at all.  The motor and all electric/electronic parts work just fine and, I believe, they are of good quality.  The battery is of excellent quality as one charge lasts forever.  The plastic attachments though are of inferior quality. I wish I could find another main plastic attachment (the big comb) because now I can&#x27;t use this clipper at all.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate receiving them.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts our hair, two boys and myself, and she loved the clipper.  One of the combs broke and it turns out it would cost around $13 to replace it, I paid around $30 for the whole set:(</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was very cheap. Still works great after 2 years. Now there is a newer model and this model was discontinued. I don&#x27;t see why the new model should cost much more than this model.</li>
    <li> I started useing  it, sounds good, parts all  fit good, so far so good.  for the price I paid real happy.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the design and quality of the clippers.  The rotating head makes it much easier to cut the back.&lt;br /&gt;Philips does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers except for the interchangeable smaller clipper, couldn&#x27;t get it clip in but don&#x27;t need it because the main one does it all</li>
    <li> Good for giving myself a buzzcut which is what I like. Arrived on time with everything it was supposed to have.</li>
    <li> A great multi-tool for men&#x27;s grooming needs, it does all I need, to trim the necessary parts of&lt;br /&gt;my head</li>
    <li> I have been using this cutter for about two months now and am very pleased with the results. It has saved me a lot of time and money. It works particularly well with short to medium hairstyles. Here are some tips that I have learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first get this product take the time to carefully read the instructions and try out all of the parts, particularly try fitting the combs and adjusting the heights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few times you use this product, plan what you intend to do before you start cutting. For example, Pick a comb and length setting for the top of your head, the back, the sides, and around the ears. Also pick an order to do your cutting. It can be from top down or bottom up. For your first haircut, use slightly longer settings to make sure you are cutting the way you want. After your first cut, you might want to \\&quot;even up\\&quot; the next day to get the hang of your final routine for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will quickly get the hang of using this cutter and settle into the settings you want for each part of your head and the most effective order of cutting. You should jot these settings down for future haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you cut using the flexible cutters use only a light pressure and, as the instructions say, run the cutter back and forth from different angles for an even  cut. It is really quite easy and the only trick is making sure you are using the right comb and height for the area you are cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep things simple, I have not used to the rotating head but you may want to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cordless feature is a big improvement over a  cord. For easy cleanup, I use it either in my bathtub or shower (this makes cleanup very easy since I can then continue with a bath or shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cutter charge time is very quick and it will last through several haircuts. And it is very easy to use this cutter for quick trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still highly recommended!!You may want to skip using the rotating head. I found it is no real use because your haircut is more effective if you are using the cutter from different angles, as recommended in the instructions. Because you have no cord, angling the cutter is really very easy and switching hands, which you have to do anyway, is no big deal. It also saves you time when you don&#x27;t bother rotating the head.</li>
    <li> Paid for itself after two hair cuts. People who say it has limited hair style potential are actually limited by their ability/knowledge, not this clipper.</li>
    <li> This just works perfectly, it is easy to use, the leght range is fine and recharges quickly, thanks a lot!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a simple haircut kinda guy. I needed hair clippers that didn&#x27;t require constant maintenance and greasing, because I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to maintenance. Oh well. This product rocks! The head rotates, so when you get used to the angle, you can even trim the hair on the back of your neck. The trimmer section easily opens up, and while hair does get in there, it comes out just as easy. I still haven&#x27;t had to replace anything on it after a year of use, and I&#x27;ve saved far more money on haircuts than I spent on this unit.</li>
    <li> The product is packaged well.  The hair clipper I received was already charged and I was able to use it right out of the box ( the instructions tell you that you have to charge it)  Using the clipper is fairly intuitive,although I had to read the very clear instructions, with picture, on how to put on the smallest shaver.  I used it immediately with great success.  It worked smoothly, easily and did a very nice job of removing the hair.  it did not leave any &#x27;stubble&#x27;.  When you cut hair, there is a guide to adjust for length, which is very helpful, you won&#x27;t be able to give a buzz cut if you didn&#x27;t intend to!  A very nice product, I&#x27;m happy to have and use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use these clippers every week for the last year. I like to keep my hair short. I have saved hundred of dollars by cutting my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers work great if you have a simple style for your hair.</li>
    <li> I am mostly bald, but hair grows on the sides and I need a haircut about once a month. Barbers still charge me the full amount, even though it takes them 5 minutes to buzz clip my hair. Finally I got this with some trepidation, especially for the cleaning up afterwards. My worries were groundless with QCS5530. It cuts the hair and keeps the clumps until I shake it off. It neatly fits in my palm, and gently running my hand around my head does the job. A quick vacuum afterwards cleans everything up. All that&#x27;s left is my eroldynamic head.</li>
    <li> I brought it for myself as the X-mas gift of 2011, this is my 3rd \\&quot;do it myself\\&quot; hair cut tool. Compare with the others, this is the best design but ...  It making noise louder and louder time by times. I&#x27;ve carefully checked it, nothing wrong, all parts are thin black plastic, they are shaking resonant.  Although I bought it at the cost of only one hair cut  after discount, I really hope it can last for six months or longer.  Why don&#x27;t Philips make the core parts in metal? or they just want it lasts for a few months? The secret of business success :)</li>
    <li> This is presented as a no-brainier, but beside instructions that are useless and great difficulty assembling, it either doesn&#x27;t cut at all or it shaves clunks out of your hair. If you watch a You-Tube, you&#x27;ll see you need to be a professional or have a professional help you to get any passable results. It also requires scissors, a comb and patience.   Save your money for a haircut or use a regular razor and scissor</li>
    <li> The design, usability and multifaceted design of the Norelco Hair Clipper makes it much more than just a hair cut device. The amount of cut lengths give it so much versatility that it is a must have for pretty much any grooming you need. It wil fill the job of a hair cutter, facial trimmer and all purpose trimmer. Probably saved me $25 on buying another trimmer for my face. Its also very well made and has a long battery life.  Also, Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around.   Honestly, buy this right now and you won&#x27;t regret it.  PS- Hair cutting takes a little practice, but the device makes it so much easier.</li>
    <li> I had been searching clippers and reading the reviews to find a good pair of clippers. I have a 3 year old who refuses haircuts of any kind!!!!The last time I cut it, I did it in his sleep - you can imagine the outcome, as I am no barber. I decided I would buy a pair of clippers and have his Grandma try it out.(I was scared I would mess it up!!} I was searching for something that wouldnt pull or scare him with the noise. After reading many reviews - this is the pair I ended up buying. His hair was quite long, so we started it on the next to highest setting on the small attachment, which is pretty short, it did not pull his hair at all, we then moved it down one more setting - still good, It took a while due to length of his hair (20-25 minutes) but I was so pleased with his new haircut. Pretty quiet - did not scare him at all. It will be quicker next time, now that it is short.  2 days later, I gave my husband a haircut, having never used clippers in my life. Turned out better than the results from his barber. Very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> The product is very innovative in that it is cordless, depth adjustable and ability to swivel the head.  Having said that, it does take a little getting use to.  On my first go at it, I used the wrong adapter and cut a little too much off...nothing a visit to the barber couldn&#x27;t fix though.  On my next try, I was a little bit more reserved and used the adapter for the longest cut...better, but I will have to practice a few more times before I can feel comfortable with it.  The rechargeable battery seems to hold it charge very well.  I haven&#x27;t had to plug it in yet.  Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product and may change my rating after more usage.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised this unit could give such an outstanding haircut on the first attempt.  It is important though that your hair is completely dry, and you cut it against how it lays on your head; it doesn&#x27;t matter if you go from front to back or vice versa or even side to side:  cut your hair with the unit against how it is laying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with #9 on top, proceeded to #7 just down from the top (my hair grows thick here), and finished up with #6 on the sides including the neck and sideburns:  just turned out perfect!  I couldn&#x27;t really believe how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep your hair short, this Norelco clipper will give you as good of a haircut as you might receive from your regular barber.  Most people spend about $200/yr. on haircuts, and since this clipper only cost me $33 plus change (no shipping charge), it has almost already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Works ok but hard to get it right. Awkward to use and adjust.  After 2years, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> works great, charges in under 30 minutes, over an hour of run time, highly recommended. And at around $40, it&#x27;s a no brainer!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with another review about the length attachments. I bought this a few months ago when I read those good reviews. However, when I tried using it today, I got very confused. \\&quot;20 Length\\&quot; is total Bullsh*t. I could only use the #1. Philips should give 20 attachements as those wired clippers instead since other the soft plastic clip won&#x27;t stop at any other length except the bottom one. I am contacting philips for an exchange or just send me some other attachements.</li>
    <li> Done my hair cut for like 5+ times. Be aware that its measurement is sometimes incorrect...  It will not cut your hair perfectly even. You really need to press it to your head skin to get perfect measurement. Other than that, it does the job and I&#x27;ve saved quite a lot of money    Dec 5, 2014:  Been cutting my own hair with these and it still works really well. I have probably saved $400+ from hair cut by using this for 2+ years.  Dropped it once so far though but luckily it still works!</li>
    <li> I bought this more than a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t complaint about the quality of the trimmer itself. It&#x27;s very easy to use also. The only complaint I have is about the quality of the Combs, especially the small and the big combs. I applied a little bit more pressure while the small comb was on and it broke and almost messed up my hair. I didn&#x27;t over-pressure it of course, because I am doing this against my head not the wall :D&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like the trimmer so I decided to order a replacement for the small comb. And that was a pain itself. It is very hard to find it online. After chatting with Philips customer service representatives online, phone calls and emails finally they told me how to order this part. It turned out that the comb would cost $22 after adding the shipping fees. And this is really crazy. It&#x27;s more than half the price of the whole unit. And it&#x27;s also stupid because it&#x27;s more than buying a new QC5510 here at amazon. So, what you can do is order the QC5510 and get its comb (which is the same one for QC5530) or just hate Philips and decide not to buy any of their products again just like I did.</li>
    <li> As way of background, let me first say I have never been to a barber. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for almost 50 years, using a good pair of scissors and a mirror. Last month I bought the Norelco clipper and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well-designed product that is easy to use. First, there  is no cord to deal with. This makes it easy to best-position yourself  in front of the bathroom mirror without entangling a cord. Everything you need is normally attached to the clipper. You don&#x27;t have to hunt for assorted attachments. The single comb attachment plus the built-in adjuster provide all the height adjustment I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pleasure to use a product that simply does what it is supposed to do, and does it well.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco hair clipper several times and they work as advertised.  Much lighter than my old clippers and with the adjustable head much easier to use.</li>
    <li> Is high utility and nicely designed but starts making screeching noise in just 4-5th use ...and then stops working altogether .Problem not with motor but motor clipping mechanisam.....needs to be reliable...</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I used a corded conair for years and thought it was the best.  This is way better.  It&#x27;s very lightweight, cordless, and I love the adjustment on-the-fly guards instead of having to completely take off each numbered guard each time.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I could not imagine this equipment would work so well. It&#x27;s built good. Reliable and practical. It does the job as it claims</li>
    <li> What a great design and performance ! This was one of the best I have had so far. You can cut hair at any length. Very durable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I used this thing this morning to cut my hair and it did amazing, everything is straight and neat. It just sheared my hair right off and the adjustable feature is amazingly convenient.  I will be using this thing for a long time and no longer have to spend an hour in the shower trying to comb my hair off with those hair cutting combs that cut the hair but look like you used a weed whacker. A+ on design and quiet functionality.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but the plastic hair guard broke during use twice now.  The first time Philips sent me a new one, the second time I wasn&#x27;t as lucky.  Durability an issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a old Wahl self hair cutting clipper for years that finally bit the dust. Boy am I glad that it did. I now cut my hair (shaved no guard) every week and it&#x27;s easy to maintain. No screwdrivers needed and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting battery.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to disassemble.&lt;br /&gt;Rotates easily.&lt;br /&gt;Useful attachments if you want longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was a bit wider, I would say it&#x27;s between a mustache trimmer and a regular trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not truly washable, you take the cutting parts off and clean it. It still works great but it would be nice to submerge the whole thing and run it to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price is amazing for this and I would not hesitate getting these clippers.</li>
    <li> good，very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what I was getting when I ordered this hair trimmer/cutter. Basically ordered it for the low price and the Norelco name. As typical of so many products on the internet, the descriptions don&#x27;t begin to show what a product does or how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know that the simple cutter is adjustable both in height and that it rotates 90 degrees to either side. Both of those adjustment are critical to the function and a marvel of clever engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for smooth shaving your face, this trimmer can remove/lower any hair anywhere on your body over a range from 1/4\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; in small increments. As an example, today I decided to prune my bushy eyebrows, fast, simple, painless. I could give more examples, but suffice to say, any hair anywhere on your body!</li>
    <li> Works fine for me. Only used it once so far &amp; it is far superior to what I had in past.&lt;br /&gt;Previously someone had to do the back of my head, but with the swivel I can myself.&lt;br /&gt;Also like the adjustment for height without having many attachments.</li>
    <li> Much quieter, faster to switch lengths, and far easier to clean than the Wahl clipper I used before. Battery lasted at least 4 cuts between charges for me. Would be 5 stars but I found that during travel the plastic clipper guards break easily and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a brand new clipper than replace the two plastic guards. So if traveling, keep the clipper heads in your carry-on luggage or place them in a hard protective case.</li>
    <li> I like this product and would have given it a greater response, but it does not taper around the ears.  It takes some getting used to when it comes to comb size, but once you get used to it, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I dropped the hair clipper and the larger blade guard cracked and then a few weeks later broke. I was able to super glue it back together so we&#x27;ll see how long that last. The clipper is still working great and very happy with the purhcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;32 years old&lt;br /&gt;Male&lt;br /&gt;Balding but still have some hair on top and plenty around the sides&lt;br /&gt;I always shave my head with a number 1or number 2. Hey! that doesn&#x27;t sound right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my Wahl clippers that I&#x27;ve had since high school were finally getting to the point where they needed to be replaced. I bought this on a whim after seeing it on slick deals. I read the reviews prior and there were a few mixed reviews. One common complaint was the attaches bending and causing your hair not to cut evenly. Now I personally use the smallest attachment so that has never been a problem. So I took out the bigger one and just messed with it a little before I cut my hair and it seemed to be cutting evenly just fine. So either I don&#x27;t have a enough hair to notice such a thing or those people had a death grip on the clippers and were pushing too hard. Probably a combo of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things cut with ease. You don&#x27;t get and pinched hairs and sometimes you wonder if it is even working. But it works so good you only have to go over a spot twice at the most. You really don&#x27;t even need to do that but if you are cutting your own hair you probably should since you can&#x27;t see your whole head to make sure you are getting everything. The rotating head and the ability to wash it off are great features but the beauty of this thing is the fact that it is cordless, cuts well and relatively small so it easy to navigate with your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully endorse this product. I would absolutely recommend to anyone who has minimal hair and keeps their head shaved/buzzed because it works great for that.</li>
    <li> I got the QC5530 yesterday and tried it this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short all over so I figured this would be fairly easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently my hair has be combable on top and short on the sides.  I started going shorter and shorter on top till I got to 3/8&amp;#34; on top, 1/4&amp;#34; on the sides and very short around the ears.  I would go the the barber shop every 3 weeks and get my hair cut this way.  I have been thinking of trying the do-it-yourself approach and finally broke down and ordered these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was due for a haircut so this morning I set the small comb to 3 and started on top.  The clippers started taking off what seemed to be a lot of hair but it looked OK.  I went all around at the #3 setting and my wife said I hadn&#x27;t messed anything.  Tomorrow I&#x27;ll try trimming shorter around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of being able to keep my hair short and get a haircut once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With tip a trip to the barber was $20.00.  I paid $27.00 for the clippers so I almost have them paid for now.  I look forward to saving the money I spending on haircuts but I look forward even more to keeping my hair short.</li>
    <li> My haircut is pretty simple.  A little longer than buzz cut, but not much.  It took a while for the first try but even then the results were satisfactory.  Satisfactory became good the next day when I went back for some retouching.  Well worth it.  It paid for itself with the second use - and that is putting no value at all on my time spent in travel.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use.  Works well.  Has already paid for itself.  This seems to be the best value out there.  Norelco makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> In the past there have been other miracle do it yourself hair cutters that I have tried. One was many years ago and was just a razor blade concealed in an adjustable comb. That one left me with bald patches and looked like moths had gotten my hair !! This one is much more useable but I did manage to give myself an almost bald patch. Fortunately I am old enough to have given up on vanity for the most part and hair grows so quickly I&#x27;m not even concerned about this temporary minor uglyness. I can be pretty ugly on the inside so it&#x27;s only right that my outward appearance reflect this ! I live in Alaska and take care of my very elderly parents. There are very few old style barbershops that you can just walk into without an appointment and it&#x27;s a 20 mile drive so I figured this will be great for cutting my own hair and my Fathers hair. I think it will be really easy to cut his hair but as I said will take some practice to cut my own. It&#x27;s really hard to look at the back of your head with 2 mirrors and do anything right without practice. It&#x27;s kinda like backing a 45&#x27; trailer into a parking spot without ever having backed up a trailer before. Seems like a good well built product that I would reccommend.</li>
    <li> Good:  -Made in Hungary, not China.  -Li-ion battery.  -Cuts efficiently.  -Washable    -Top quality plastic, top quality design, top quality assembly.  -Light weight  -Reasonably priced.  Bad:  -Non user replaceable battery.  -Looks like a cockroach from certain angles.  -Hard to decipher, graphic/icon only manual.  -Proprietary external charger adapter. So no power cord sharing with older shavers. I want my old style IEC 60320 C1 type shaver plugs back!!!     4-and-half stars.</li>
    <li> Great power for cordelss. I dont really use the turning head much.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish was better was the guard system. Its one guard that you dial down to the length (#1 doesn&#x27;t cut as close as other #1 guards)&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I would have given perfect 6 stars</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This hair clipper does all I expected.  It is relatively quiet, cuts well, and is easy to clean.  I travel overseas a lot, so appreciate that it will run on 220 volts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable head and the provided guides work perfectly.  I have fine hair that is thinning on top.  I was concerned that the clipper might just push it around, cutting unevenly.  However, it did the job perfectly.  I wear my hair short, so was able to cut my own hair with no difficulty.  I did have my wife trim the neck in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that it would be difficult to do a good job by yourself with long hair, but even then this would be good for in-between haircut trims.</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly. It works realy great. I would surely reccomond this Hair Clipper to others.Though I use it to cut my dog&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it smoothly trims your hair. Usability and maintainability is an added advantage. Will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After I opened the package, I found that there is something like white color toothpaste on the precision comb. That means someone must use it before. And that makes me feel really unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> The clippers work well.  Certainly better than the Wahl clippers that I wore out. They are good good good good.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to own because it is very convenient to have. it is small, very well built, and has an adjustable edge. Great product</li>
    <li> Very lite weight and quiet too. It does take  a little to get used to compared to my old conaire. I like that you don&#x27;t need to oil it. And the charge only takes one hour. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because you can plug it into the wall if the battery is fully dead however the plug wound not stay in the clippers so I had to wait till it got fully charger. Overall pretty good product 4 starts.</li>
    <li> The best one until today.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 5 hair Cooper with Phillis, and it improved significantly.&lt;br /&gt;I try the Remington and nothing to comper.</li>
    <li> I bought these hair clippers several months ago and have used it several times.  This item has paid for itself and then some.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and I have not had any problems with it.  It has more than enough power to cut through think long hair.  It charges really fast and will last up to an hour without loss of power.  I really like this set of clippers and hopefully will have it for a long time.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Best Do It Yourself Hair Clipper.  This is my 3rd Norelco Hair Clipper.  Each generation of do-it-yourself hair clippers keeps getting better.  They made every upgrade that I would make to the previous generation.</li>
    <li> I give 4 stars to the design and feel for the price. Definatly a better-made product than the cheaper ones, notably the swivel head of the Norelco that allows for buzzing at any angle. Unfortunately, for me at least, it produced the same results.</li>
    <li> An excellent clipper. Makes cutting my hair easy and fast. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have probably saved over $200 with this device on hair cuts. Of course your style is a bit more limited, but if you go for a uniform shave you can even use it yourself!</li>
    <li> If you want something that slices through hair, this is it. For me, it was too hard to control, taking big bites of hair in one pass. If that&#x27;s what you want, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This is a flimsy product, something evident the moment you open the package.  I do have thick hair.  That said, by the third use fo this hair clipper the blades were so dull that the clipper was hacking, rather than cutting, my hair.  As the blade got even duller, the unit began to bog down almost to a complete halt.  All this leads to an uneven and unsatisfactory cut.  Spend a little more, get a good product, stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR THE PRICE. ACTUAL THING LOOKS WAY BETTER THAN PICTURE. DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW LONG IT SURVIVE, MAYBE SHALL GET BACK HERE IN A COUPLE OF YEAR FOR THAT PART.</li>
    <li> I cut hair myself while I received the hair clipper. My friend felt my hairstyle well. It&#x27;s great and convenient. But surely, it is a skilled work to cut hair yourself. You need to prepare some mirrors and place them on the reasonable position.</li>
    <li> I cut my on hair now with the Phillips Norelco clippers. I have saved a lot of money cutting my own hair. Its easy to use and I love it.</li>
    <li> I like the Panasonic ERS224 better.  Personal preference.  The Panasonic cuts hair shorter.  This once works, just not as good for my needs as the ERS224.</li>
    <li> Now i can finally cut my own hair at home very easy. It useful because i cut my hair for the same length. If you need to make degrees of length, it might be challenging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for over a year now and their still going strong.  Battery life still last long enough to finish about 2 or 3 cleanups of my head, but they don&#x27;t last as long as they used to.</li>
    <li> If hair is much over 3/4 inch, the reciprocating blades tend to push it away rather than cut it, unless you cut it very short and it can&#x27;t easily push it away.  This works very well for short beards, and maybe if it&#x27;s someone else giving you the haircut.  But it&#x27;s tedious to cut all other places, taking many passes, if you are working on your own hair.  You end up using a scissors for all but but your beard and at the margins of your scalp where the hair tapers to the skin (maybe an old fashioned style, but not so rare that this should be omitted from the description/performance).</li>
    <li> I bought several hair clipper to do my son&#x27;s hair cut. This is the one which satisfied me. The usage frequency is very high, 3 times a month: Mine, my son&#x27;s, my fathers hairs all be cut off by it. and we can finished after a single recharged.</li>
    <li> first time cut hair by myself, tough I haven&#x27;t handle it. it&#x27;s easy to use and works in a good way!</li>
    <li> Amazon sent me a used Philips Norelco QC5530, pieces of hair and shaving cream still on, very unsanitised. I returned it since, It is actually deserved a minus one star, future purchase with Amazon look very dim.</li>
    <li> These were easily the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned. The problem is after 6 months of use, the blade guard broke. This clipper isn&#x27;t like others, where it comes with multiple size guards. There is one guard and the trim height is adjusted by turning on knob on the clippers. So these are somewhat useless after that part brakes and I can&#x27;t find the replacement part anywhere. I&#x27;d just buy another, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it would just happen again, so I&#x27;ll just have to look elsewhere for clippers, sadly.</li>
    <li> These clippers work really great, I am happy with the purchase. Cuts evenly and runs smooth and its too loud when on.</li>
    <li> Does what it says efficiently, effectively and without fuss.  Takes a little getting used to - the wide combs tend to leave the hair a little uneven on the longer settings, but a little patience sorts this out.  The wide range of length settings is great.  It can be a little tricky to change the heads but that could be me.  Best of all it doesn&#x27;t seem to jam up with cut hair like my last one from Braun did.  Will see how the battery does but so far no complaints at all and some of the competition costs 3 times as much!</li>
    <li> I enjoy Philips products and was pleased with this clipper that works as advertised. The ring dial makes the cut length easily visible and easy to change. Worked very well on the areas of my hair that I like to keep shorter than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the box arrived, I could hear some loose pieces rattling around inside. Although the box was sealed as it should be, something didn&#x27;t quite feel right. Like it opened a little bit easier than it should. Once opened the parts inside were wrapped very loosely in plastic bags or not at all (not characteristic of the Philips Norelco brand at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I will enjoy using this clipper but definitely feel that I was sold a refurbished device.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I got an awesome deal on it and I wanted to practice cutting my sons hair.  The Do-it-Yourself hair clipper worked well.  However, the comb did fall off several times because of my son&#x27;s thick hair.  BUT, it didn&#x27;t break!  Another minus is that I can&#x27;t figure out how to get the other comb on, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an operator error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package I received comes with a 45 day money back guarantee which means if you hate it, you can send it back to Phillips and they&#x27;ll send your money back. You&#x27;ll be out of a few bucks for shipping, but it almost makes trying this out worry free.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this is only for the cheap do-it-yourselfers or those new to cutting hair.  If you&#x27;re experienced at cutting hair you&#x27;ll probably find that this set of clippers is at the lower end but it works nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 07/11/13:  This thing quit working on me after 3 haircuts.  DON&#x27;T bother wasting your money.  This item is an absolute piece of junk!!</li>
    <li> After 2 haircuts I am very pleased with this purchase. I have always used wired clippers and the move to wireless was like going from a landline phone to a cell phone. It is amazing how much easier this has made cutting my hair. I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for 15 years but this has immediately made a night and day difference. I&#x27;m no longer constantly having to change out heads and with a simple twist I can adjust to any needed size in seconds. Great clippers! This would be a 5 star item if I didn&#x27;t find that sometimes it will switch sizes on me during use. Luckily I&#x27;ve always caught it before it would have messed a cut up, but maybe making it a little harder to turn would help solve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;180 Degree rotating blade makes right and left handed use easy.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Charges quickly and last for an hour&lt;br /&gt;Compact system with 2 adjustable clips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Too easy to change size (can result in accidental size change while cutting)</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco QC5530 Hair Clipper I have for about a year. I use every day since that and it still work perfectly . well made !</li>
    <li> Very noisy, screechs at times, doesn,t hold charge.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair like this it works great for short mens hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a tip:&lt;br /&gt;Set up a niche with mirrors in front of you and on both sides, makes it MUCH easier to do the sides and back.</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago,just now writing a review,  It&#x27;s great product!! Still don&#x27;t have issues with it after all these years</li>
    <li> The hair clipper itself works pretty well, and the rotating head to adjust hair length is easy enough to operate. The problem is that the comb attachment is very very fragile flimsy plastic, it broke on me only third time I used this thing. Therefore I can&#x27;t recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Awesome Clipper , combs are not. Fixed it with glue guns/sticks, now I feel more control with it and can do more style..&lt;br /&gt;Im not paying for $14.99 they are selling in their site just for a lousy comb.</li>
    <li> very good! many levels for different hair length. The knife is sharp and the hair length controller is smooth and soft for your skin!</li>
    <li> I doubt the package had been opened before, and some white gels are left on the clipper, it is so disgusting.....</li>
    <li> i have \\&quot;do-it-myself\\&quot; for 2 times. and it is relly easy to cut ur hair.  and i also help my friends cut their hair too.  trust me ,it is relly easy.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the best cut ever but did the job and was handy -- until the clip broke after using it twice a month for six months. Of course, Norelco doesn&#x27;t sell the clips separately so I am out forty bucks.</li>
    <li> I would get my haircuts every 3 weeks from a salon at $30 per haircut (sometimes twice a week if I had a special occasion, and everytime I got it cut, I always thought \\&quot;I honestly think I could do this myself\\&quot;.  I purchased this hair clipper and LOVED it! The rotating head makes it really easy to cut the back and sides.  If you&#x27;re REALLY picky about how you want your haircut, then you might need to stick with the salon or someone else cutting it.  I don&#x27;t cut my hair VERY short.  I do a #4 on the bottom and the sides and blend it upwards, and a #8.5 - #9 on the top.  I do a messy hairstyle, so for that reason, even if it isn&#x27;t perfectly even, it still looks good.  Even the bottom and sides might not be PERFECT, but since I don&#x27;t cut it that short, you can&#x27;t even tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, if you&#x27;re doing a #1 kind of haircut and are not very good at blending, then I would recommend getting someone to help you because people can definitely notice bad fades with hair that short. Overall, I think it works great. I use a large handheld mirror to assist me.  It cuts well, and I love not having to mess with 20 different attachments.  Just 1 smaller clip for numbers 1-5 and a second bigger attachment for 6-9.  Selecting the different numbers is very easy, just by turning the head. I&#x27;m very happy considering I&#x27;m saving $60 a month!  I definitely recommend it if you want to save some dough, and you don&#x27;t do a very complex haircut.</li>
    <li> While initially I was pretty happy with it after 3 months (5-6 usages) it start making screeching noise and altogether stopped working.</li>
    <li> Just want to cut hair by myself, so I try some kinds of cutter from my friends. At last I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really excellent!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it so you can do it your self easily</li>
    <li> I believe the implementation of the rotating head is an ingenious implementation for maneuvering around the head while cutting your own hair. The adjustable ring is used to select multiple lengths of cuts without changing the attachment (well not really there are 3 different attachments that have multiple hair length setting; Precision #0-#1, Small comb #1-#5, Large comb #6-#9). The cordless feature is one of the reasons why I bought these clippers (I already had traditional clippers). Other than that.. It&#x27;s weak, faulty, and needs improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weak: Weak/not powerful enough motor. Multiple times throughout the haircut the clipper stalls and shuts off when there is a little bit too much of hair for it to handle. Now I have thin hair and I was only going from a #9 to #8.. So yeah.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faulty: The comb is way too wide to appropriately lift the hair to be cut, which constantly lead to an uneven haircuts. The \\&quot;2-D Contour - Following Comb\\&quot; is just BAD. It should be considered a defect, not a feature. Follow other reviews and remove the spring from within the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs improvement: Other than putting a stronger motor, making the comb narrower, making the comb fixed. I would suggest the manufactures (or rig it yourself) to implement a vacuum attachment to lift hair from the scalp, which would provide an even cut. I have to say that getting an even cut is the hardest part cutting your own hair. Barber often use their fingers or a barbers comb to get the appropriate and even length cut on all sides on the head, but a vacuum attachment for this device can alleviate this issue for the fellow do-it-yourself-ers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I would choose a traditional clippers over these clippers. Make the suggested improvements and I would pay $20-$30 more bucks for this (especially the vacuum attachment).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have anyway to rate this. After I bought it I decided to let my hair grow. It look cool. Has lots of attachments. Lots of great reviews so I&#x27;m sure I will like it. Everyone else did. I did plug it in to charge it and it turned on. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it this weekend. Maybe I won&#x27;t. Maybe I&#x27;ll have my girlfriend use in on my back.. (kidding).</li>
    <li> My small adjustable guard broke and now that I&#x27;m looking for a replacement on the guard, I can&#x27;t find one on amazon.  Guess I&#x27;ll either buy a new one or just a different set of clippers altogether.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I do like that it&#x27;s cordless and has a swivel head to it!</li>
    <li> The combination of a lithium-ion battery (as in a laptop pc), easy twist-to-adjust and multiple heads makes this little&lt;br /&gt;gem the right and full answer to cutting/trimming your own hair -- or to have a non-barber trim it for you safely.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best for short hair styles, charges quickly (and holds a charge for several haircuts) and feels light and snug&lt;br /&gt;in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
    <li> one piece of the comb was broken,then it made a funny hole on my head, how can I get a new comb!!!!???</li>
    <li> bought on sale for $20&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;long battery life,&lt;br /&gt;very easy to cut, especially from the side and rear&lt;br /&gt;but tips are very soft and not reliable</li>
    <li> I had bought a wireless Remington hair clipper from Target and although it worked fine, the battery wouldn&#x27;t last a whole haircut. Then I bought a wired Philips clipper on a deal and realized that I was creating a mess near and under the bathroom wash basin.&lt;br /&gt;And then I returned it to buy this. Now I cut my hair in the tub and only need to give the finishing touches near the basin. It&#x27;s a lot more neat!&lt;br /&gt;Now about the clipper itself - I have started cutting my hair only a few months back and find it very easy with this Philips Norelco clippers. I use 4 different numbers between 2 and 7 to get a haircut that is better than what I used to get at Great clips or Supercuts previously. And I think the battery lasts me about four haircuts. As I get better at it in time, it should last me another couple more - not that it matters really...</li>
    <li> Excellent Hair Clipper for the price&lt;br /&gt;the clipper is sharp and nice Trimmer.  rechargeable battery seems to hold it charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend you to buy this Hair Clipper</li>
    <li> The rotating head and the way it changes sizes is very convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it didn&#x27;t do a great job on neck hair that I wanted to remove completely.  My wife has to go over it several times and then use a razor.</li>
    <li> Very good machine in a very affordable price, nothing better I can say. Its easy to use, now I do my own haircut completely</li>
    <li> Would NOT recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The features of this product make cutting your own hair easy, but the blades and motor were a little too weak for my very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to trim my goatee and hair. I started with the goatee. A little trial and error I found the right trim setting. The clipper is lightweight and easy to use. It does a good job of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wish it that they would have added a bag to store all the accessories. I guess a freezer bag will have to do.</li>
    <li> it is Philips..good value for money, everything is OK, especially the price..i have cut my hair three times by myself..</li>
    <li> Got it and I couldn&#x27;t wait, I figured I would cut everything at the longest setting (9) then step down the sides in layers with gradual smaller settings.&lt;br /&gt;No matter how many times you make a cut it doesn&#x27;t get longer, that why I set it for the longest cut.&lt;br /&gt;Love the haircut, no more $18 haircuts + Tip.&lt;br /&gt;My wife said it was the best cut I&#x27;ve had ever!&lt;br /&gt;One more time and it paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...Still works great 12/09/2013, however I paid 39 for it, I now see it&#x27;s 99...so my review was at the 39 price.</li>
    <li> I have had a cheap corded clipper which always stuck my hairs. I bought this clipper when it has a $10 coupon to give it a shot. This clipper is awesome, the blade is sharp and never stuck, the clip is soft and easy to use. I love the cordless and whole washable feature, so that I can just use in in my bathroom and take a shower right after the haircut. The battery is powerful, and for one charge I can use it for more than 4 times.</li>
    <li> very ergonomic,not very noisy, effective at what it does, charge retained for a very long time, versatile, definitely a keeper !</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a very short time ago and albeit I have utilized it only a couple of times it looks to me that it is wonderful. I do recommend it to anyone who needs a hair clipper that indeed does the work which it was made for......5 stars again.</li>
    <li> This is a huge improvement over regular clippers. I can cut my own hair evenly an easily in minutes. It&#x27;s light weight, holds a charge well and is so simple to use. I clip my hair every 2 weeks now because I enjoy use this so much!</li>
    <li> Still working our the how too&#x27;s but it is a great tool for self grooming. I will be using it for years and saving lots of money at the same time. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am handicapped and have only one arm available. The rotating head on it makes it so easy for me to use when I am cutting or trimming, all I can say is thanks NORELCO</li>
    <li> I can cut my hair with 5530 by myself.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to adjust hair length.&lt;br /&gt;You can have you hair cut at any time anywhere.</li>
    <li> It says Do-it-yourself, but did not see any feature that helps to do hair cut ourselves, except that the clipper position can be turned 360 degrees. I donot see much advantage with that feature. Any regular clipper can be used to do that 360 degrees job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving one star bcas it cuts the hair well, blades are good.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper.  I stopped going to barber shops about couple of years ago and my wife started cutting my hair.  I used triditional corded hair clipper and replaced with this because it was on sale.  I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one so that I don&#x27;t have to keep switching the guide.  Here are the pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No wires&lt;br /&gt;Powerful (I thought it would be weak since it is cordless)&lt;br /&gt;Lighter than regular clipper&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to switch the guides around (only need to do it once)&lt;br /&gt;Swivel head&lt;br /&gt;Can also be used with wire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit louder than i expected&lt;br /&gt;No storage case</li>
    <li> DIY hair cutter. easy to use!</li>
    <li> LIVING IN A WORLD WHICH IS BECOMING MORE EXPENSIVE EVERY DAY AND ON A LIMITED INCOME, THIS CLIPPER REALLY SAVES ME MONEY AND TIME.</li>
    <li> Bought two of those. One for my dad and another for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;It is a &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; clipper but my mom uses this to cut my dad&#x27;s hair. It works. I hope there is a cape to prevent the hair and a scissors with it. Then it will be a really complete set.</li>
    <li> it can not work now,and i let it alone.i don;t konw why it can not work with very short time</li>
    <li> We purchased this hair clipper to replace a Walmart one that finally died after a couple of years of use.  At first I was totally in love with it - the cordless feature is extremely useful and I liked the wide array of lengths that you can get using the three different guides.  They took a little getting used to - I gave my son a hair cut that was too short the first time.  But after a little practice I figured out how to cut at the length that I wanted and taper down.  The result is a smooth, beautiful hair cut.  And my husband uses it on his beard too with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this clipper seems to have a major flaw.  After only being used half a dozen times, now it seems that the small cutting blades get very easily jammed.  When that happens the entire thing locks up and lets out the worst screeching sound I&#x27;ve ever heard.  Then you have to stop, make a note of the length setting you have selected (because you&#x27;ll lose it), remove the guide, clean out the blades, and put it all back together again.  And then thirty seconds later repeat the process again.  And again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were it not for this it would absolutely perfect.  But because of the jamming they&#x27;re almost totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows if there&#x27;s a fix for this problem please let me know!</li>
    <li> If you have a short hair style this is a solid product. It&#x27;s a difficult task to cut your hair if your looking for a $40 salon look but if you keep it short and simple this is definitely adequate.</li>
    <li> I have been using this set of clippers for 2 years now since I have started shaving my own head.  I am not ready to straight razor yet, so this has been doing the trick.  I got it at a decent price and it has held up well so far.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have never used one of these before, but it is so simple! It comes with different attachments, but I think I&#x27;ll just be using one on my husband.</li>
    <li> Tried this one on day one! was good experience, just make sure that you read manual before starting to shave :)</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 3 months. Till it was working it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;Wont suggest any one to buy this.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic little clipper.  It will cut anything and very versatile.</li>
    <li> I have a cheap pair of clippers that I bought several years ago while I was in college and I was looking to upgrade from them. I searched Amazon for a while and stumbled upon these. Since I cut my hair around a 1&#x27; or 2&#x27; I figured these would be good. Oh, how wrong I was. I absolutely hate these. They don&#x27;t cut anywhere near as well as my cheap several year old pair. I&#x27;m going to be looking for new clippers again shortly. Strongly advise against these.</li>
    <li> Clipper seems to &amp;#34;hack&amp;#34; hair more than clip it and its swivel head can be rather awkward especially after owning a cordless Whal with just one comb that adjusted for longer or shorter length of cut.  Just too many attachments.  I like Philips Norelco but this is not a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some way to cut my own hair easily and with good results.  After reading some of the other reviews on here, I decided to give the Phillips Norelco QC5530/40 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper a try.  I had been having my wife cut my hair, but we would just argue about the results.  I did my first self haircut today and the Norelco gives a really good haircut.  Yeah its not like going to the salon, and having a professional cut it for you, but the results are good.  Make sure you have a way to see the back of your head while you&#x27;re doing your haircut.  Nice to have the different size combs/guides as well as the rotating head.  Being able to adjust the angle of the clippers to make it more comfortable is a big plus.  I keep my hair short, so I mainly used the small comb.  With the different size combs you are able to give yourself a pretty even haircut.  The clippers are light-weight and since they are cordless, easy to use.  They charge really fast and will have plenty of charge for you to finish your haircut.  I like the self sharpening blades that do not require oiling.  I also like the fact that you can rinse the clippers with water.  I&#x27;m sure practice will make perfect.  For a first try results were good.</li>
    <li> It worked great at the start, powerful with long lasting battery, cordless performance with a long comb attachment (which is why I bought it), the waterproof feature made it awesome to clean too. Now after less than 1 year, it started making a really weird squeaking voice and get much less powerful for clipping, I have to turn it off then slightly tap it with my hand and it works fine again for who knows how long. I have a feeling that water caused it to do this over time.&lt;br /&gt;Such a disappointment because I had the old version of this (non water-proof) and it worked great for 3 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product one year ago. It works nice.&lt;br /&gt;I come back to write this review, because a few days before, I broke the comb.&lt;br /&gt;I call the support and get a new comb free.&lt;br /&gt;Nice Customer support.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do anything fancy with this thing, but this product works well.  Combs are a little flimsy, so treat them carefully.  UPDATE:  Combs are VERY fragile.  The large one will break in normal use.  Replacements are outrageously expensive - IF you can find them.  Changing my rating from 5 stars to 2 due to poorly designed combs and price gouging by Norelco for replacement parts.  They wanted $20 for one large comb.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is really handy to use.&lt;br /&gt;A little larger than i thought, though.&lt;br /&gt;like it very much!&lt;br /&gt;....................&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, it can also cut the mustache. Great!</li>
    <li> My only pet peeve with this product is the ambiguous length adjustments. To me, they aren&#x27;t that much different. On the other hand, the battery life is prety decent. If you leave it on, it will give you a continuous 40 minutes of use. The combs are a bit on the cheap side, but it&#x27;s overall a recommended product.</li>
    <li> All of the other reviews about this product making a screeching sound are dead on. The clipper head is 1 piece and can&#x27;t be taken apart and cleaned so all of those little hairs jam up inside of it and stop it from moving back and forth. This prevents the clipper from cutting. BUT WAIT!! This also causes the motor to freeze and burn out because it can&#x27;t move the clipper head. This is nothing but a cheap item mass produced in Hungary and way over priced here. I figure it is worth maybe 30 bucks tops. With the major problem as noted, I would not recommend this to anyone. Steer clear and save yourself from a financial loss and landfill contribution.</li>
    <li> Hair clippers work well.  I wish that we had these when I was in the military, especially out in the field where we sometimes resorted to old style hand powered clippers to shed our curly locks to keep the bugs out.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. The only challenge is finding the right settings for the cut you want. Since it cuts by raising the hair with the comb, try a &#x27;dry run&#x27; first to see how much it will cut. It will help you to pick the right setting if you&#x27;re concerned about cutting too much. I use #7 on the front/top, #5 on the sides/back, and #3 on the lower back. I get a full haircut in minutes.</li>
    <li> I bough this about one year ago. I was great at the beginning, but now it doesn&#x27;t get charged, and doesn&#x27;t work even when it is plugged. I used it around 10 times before it broke, and now I have to throw it away.</li>
    <li> After owning this trimmer for less than a year, and using it only once every other week, the attachments are no longer fully adjustable. If I try to raise it to the longer settings, instead of the comb raising, the whole comb pops out of the zoom ring. If I fuss with it for ten minutes or so, it will mysteriously work again, but then shortly it begins misbehaving again. There are two tiny legs on each comb which are supposed to lock them into the zoom ring, but the lip on them is so faint, that it quickly wears away to uselessness. When I first got it, I quickly learned that the combs were very sensitive to how much pressure you pressed with while trimming. If I used the same normal force that I used on my other trimmers, the length settings would change mid-cut. I learned how to use a deft touch to sideskirt the issue, but with this latest glitch with the comb, the trimmer is useless.</li>
    <li> overall, nice concept and does a good decent job but I do find myself going back to my old buzzer to get a cleaner cut/shave.  i attribute it to the flexible guides that another reviewer mentioned as well.  There&#x27;s just too much variance with the flex guides.  I use it more for the #3-4 cutting levels where a closer shave is not needed or noticed.</li>
    <li> If you allow the conceit that hair clippers designed for the home market have the commercial heft and market dynamism necessary to ever be classifiable as \\&quot;game changers\\&quot; , then this hair clipper is such a specimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I long ago gave up on trying to elicit from any hair stylist in any price range any interest in my hair. To say that it has a will of its own would be like saying Jocelyn Wildenstein has had some plastic surgery. It&#x27;s out of control and who can blame anyone with a  professional reputation at stake for withholding their energy and talent from something which, with only the briefest glance of their trained eye, can be immediately classified as \\&quot;destined to be  train wreck\\&quot; ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cut my own hair, and, like people with normal hair, earnestly wish each every time for a good outcome. Consequently I have had very many of these things over the years, usually Wahls as I recall, and sometimes ConAir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why this is much much better than those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no little colored clipper heads to lose, corral, contain, break, become annoyed with  or be radically over charged for.  Instead, there is clearly labeled and easy to use dial that raises and lowers the clipper head and is an effective rebuttal to the \\&quot;multitude of clipper heads\\&quot; approach.  There are just two clipper heads, but for everything but the closest trim, the main one will do .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper head itself rotates 180 degrees (or more perhaps) . What this means is when you do the OTHER side of your head, you don&#x27;t have to hold your arm at an awkward, Yogi-like angle. The clipper head rotates (instead of your arm) and the result is it&#x27;s nearly as easy to accurately cut the hair on your non-dominate side as it is your dominate side. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s built-in battery driven / rechargeable and the charge lasts for at least two or three haircuts, not less, meaning you aren&#x27;t going to be stuck in the middle of a hair cut with no juice. What&#x27;s more- there&#x27;s no cord to get in your way, or markedly increase the footprint of the clipper, or tether you like a wayward cow to a circle of radius 4 feet about your outlet, or cramp your arm&#x27;s approach to your hair or knock the lamp off your dresser as you reach for the back of your hair with your clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges very quickly and plugs directly into the wall, no cradle or anything like that is involved. You don&#x27;t  have another electric cord to label and keep somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well built, well designed and I expect it will last years. You never need to oil it; the lubrication is self contained. The space I have dedicated to my hair clipper just got cut by 2/3rds. That alone is almost worth the price of admission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, you clean this thing by holding it under running water (after it&#x27;s turned off) . That&#x27;s right, the manufacturer designed this thing to be cleanable with running water. It comes clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is unlike other heads on clippers. It comes on and off very easily, but it&#x27;s not immediately obvious how, by which I mean, you have to read the (very clear) instructions, otherwise, like me,  you&#x27;re likely to apply too much pressure trying to get it off in some way  it doesn&#x27;t really come off, but looks like it might. If you&#x27;re applying pressure, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head rotates so that as you go around your hair, you can always have the same angle of attack. Just exactly how to rotate the head is hard to describe and  for me, it was counter-intuitive. I got it wrong the first time; here&#x27;s what I can offer by way of advice: if it seems not *quite* right, rotate the head the OTHER way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at it this way; I save a lot of money cutting my own hair. This clipper makes that process more effective, easier, less time consuming and a heck of a lot less cluttered. It&#x27;s just a cleaner faster crisper process. The difference in pricebetween the rock bottom regular style  hair clipper and this one is a fraction of what I&#x27;m saving overall. If it were 100 bucks I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not worth it, go coach. But for 20 bucks or so more, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I liked it but the best cut you can do is a buzz cut or a  long trim.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great clipper.  I received it 5 days ago and have already used it twice.  I love the settings.  My old clipper had attachments for each cut length and the smallest was 1/8\\&quot;.  This one has two attachments but it adjusts 9 positions for each.  Using the fine attachment, I can go 8 settings down from 1/8\\&quot;! I haven&#x27;t tried the big attachment (pictured) so I cannot comment on that, but the small attachment does not have the flex feature - it is fixed in place.  It&#x27;s quiet, well built, loaded with everything, even including a hand-mirror to check the back of your head.  It&#x27;s designed for self-cutting hair.  Great clipper Phillips!</li>
    <li> Excellent deserves acquisition device&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and makes shaving Shi fun&lt;br /&gt;Peripherals gives you the advantages of multiple selections&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all convinced</li>
    <li> I have a short hair cut and I hate having to pay $15 for a 5 minute hair cut. I took a chace on these and man they are awesome. They are so sharp and they cut great on the first pass. You can cut and fade you own hair and not worry about screwing it up. Just make sure you don&#x27;t go to short work you way down to the lenth as they are not what the barber says the lenths are. Hard lesson learned but I was still able to make it look good. I highly recomend these.</li>
    <li> Its very light weight compare with my old corded clipper. Easy and smooth to operate. Save $$$ on hair cut. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of getting my hair cut and paying 20 dollars per visit. It has paid for itself and then some.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am quite delighted at how this clipper works.  The first cut took about 2 hours, but that&#x27;s because I was being extra careful, using mirrors to ensure that I trimmed as evenly as possible.  I used the 9 trimmer setting for the top, 3 for the sides and back, and 1 for the bottom back of head.  Using the highest setting first, followed by going to lower setting helped get the best taper effect.  I am sure that the next trim will be faster and even better.</li>
    <li> The clipper works but there&#x27;s a major design flaw with the contour comb that is easily fixed.  If you read some other reviews they state that the comb is only even at the lowest level.  This is because the contour comb changes the hair length depending on the angle.  If you read the product description it says \\&quot;2-D Contour-&lt;br /&gt;Following Comb \\&quot;.  If it were at least well designed this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded a customer photo that illustrates the difference in height as the comb moves.  With the parallel lines added you can clearly see the difference in height.  The higher the angle, the shorter the cut, which messes up the hair length.  The difference in height is only around 6-7mm but that&#x27;s a lot and more than enough to mess up your haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By fixing the comb angle it&#x27;ll cut hair to a consistent length.  If your combs are already used, wash the combs with rubbing alcohol and hot water to clean off hair oils.  A clean surface will help the glue stick better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution:&lt;br /&gt;1.  pull out the end of the small spring that holds the comb in the neutral position - you want the comb flat and don&#x27;t want it putting pressure on the comb while you glue it.  The spring is not used anymore so you can cut it or pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Superglue the rear of the comb to the base so that it&#x27;s flat and hold it tight while the glue sets.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Superglue the hinges until you see that it&#x27;s full of glue.  The plastic is clear so you can see the hinge filling up with glue.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Enjoy!  Obviously this will void the warranty on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the middle comb is slightly flexible so if you press too hard it&#x27;ll bow in at the middle.  This can also mess up the hair length.  You just have to not press too hard.  If the comb was made of stronger plastic and it didn&#x27;t have this horribly designed contour comb, I would have rated it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the review: Charge life is good, I didn&#x27;t run out of juice but I only ran it while actually clipping my hair, not just constantly on.  I used to use a corded clipper and the hardest part was cutting the back and top-back of my head.  I had to hold the mirror with one hand and angle your other arm just right.  The swivel head fixed this issue.  I noticed that I had to make a few more passes to get my hair even vs. my corded clipper but the ease of doing the back is worth the trade off.  Combined with the comb design flaw, it bumped my rating down to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any other clippers, if you want medium length hair on the top you still have to use scissors and use clippers on the rear-sides.</li>
    <li> nice and easy to use. saved me a lot of money from going to salon.</li>
    <li> It is an interesting design but I thought it would have been even cooler, the lengths of the cuts are determined by the heads installed, there are 3 heads so you have to change between them. The only thing missing is a setting to do the ears. I would have liked it if they could have put all the settings into 1 head so no need to swap heads.</li>
    <li> Works just as described and my husband loves it! It use to take more than 30-45 minutes with letting the hair clippers cool down and cleaning them if your hair is longer! This Philips Norelco takes just takes minutes and cleans off with just water! The battery lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t heat up during use!</li>
    <li> I am really cheap, being a student on a budget, so I grabbed the Philips Hair Clipper for the price of a haircut. Best of all, its wireless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really good, gives a pretty clean shave (yes shave!). Like many of the previous reviewers, my biggest problem with this clipper is that no matter what setting you put for the length, the plastic is too flexible, so if you press it, you basically get a size 1 cut all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to clean up! And piece of advice: Get a friend to do your back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Fast, Cheap, Convenient&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Its a SHAVE!</li>
    <li> I really liked this clipper at first.  The swivel head is a great feature.  But after about 5 haircuts the mechanism that allows you to adjust the depth of the cut stopped working.  The clipper kept cutting but it&#x27;s impossible to adjust the depth !  This renders the clipper useless.  The clipper supposedly has a two year warranty but I&#x27;ve been unable to locate any information on how to get it honored.</li>
    <li> nice product, though it is not the best product for my needs, I like it. would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> this item is good for me  i love it so much  the price is suit for me  i lke it</li>
    <li> very usefull Commodity,I love it,verygood!It will becoming easy with using it cut my hair.Do it myself hair cliper.Practical tool.All my Family can use it.</li>
    <li> I bought the product feeling confident if it doesnt work, or if it breaks after a while, I wont be stuck in despair.&lt;br /&gt;The norelco customer service is so customer oriented, i some times worry about their profit margins.&lt;br /&gt;For another clipper i got, when a clipper attachment broke, Norelco replaced the entire unit worth $18 and even upgraded it to a $50 model.&lt;br /&gt;No questions asked. Just one phone call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I confidently ordered this when my hair was a little messed from my last attempt with the above mentioned clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Some parts of hair was long and some short. It wasnt too bad. My friends still told me it was a good haircut. But i knew that the lengths were different. Thats because with other clippers doing a self cut is hard. you always need some one else to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not with this one. This cut my hair more or less evenly and fixed the mess. No help needed.&lt;br /&gt;The swivel is a great feature. Especially for the back of the head and the back corners where you need to otherwise twist your hand like a kungfu master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachment had a plastic piece dislocated when the package arrived. And i still give it 5 stars, because I know the customer service will help me if I cant use the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summary. Just Buy It</li>
    <li> real good. i did all products. with 2 words. but you want 20 plus heading, no deal. i will not be doing any more of these.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair clipper on a whim, (That, and I accidentally clicked on a $10 off coupon a couple weeks before and it was about to expire, so I said \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;), and I&#x27;m glad I bought it! In addition to the money I save from not going to the barber as often, using the QC5530 is easy enough for a novice like me to operate with ease.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re totally petrified about messing up your hair, follow the advice of the experts and start on the highest level, then work your way down to the height you want, because this thing cuts EVERYTHING it touches. I doubt you want to wait a week to start over.&lt;br /&gt;A bit of practice and a second handheld mirror (and a friend to help you along, if you need one) and pretty soon you&#x27;ll actually look forward to getting your haircut!</li>
    <li> Love this hair clipper so much. It has a very sharp blade. After all, it is all what matters in a clipper. I can rotate the clipper head into any direction I desire, helping me to reach out the back sided of my head. It is good! And I can use it wireless (I mean I don&#x27;t need to plug into the socket. Have to charge it first though).that is a lot of freedom! And design is so modern! Neno design! Looking great. My friend thought at first that it might be worth more than 100$. haha... I paid only 34$ for this clipper anyway. What a bargain!</li>
    <li> May work fine on real short cuts, but cuts very uneven with longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is still the FlowBee.</li>
    <li> The best do-it-yourself hair clipper I have found, there is a learning curve so start slowly and for me it works best when my hair is washed first. The price of haircuts is going up with everything else so this paid for itself after just two uses.</li>
    <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
    <li> This served me well for around 3 years. It worked fairly well, but I had to rate it low as the plastic arms holding the guard broke under regular and fairly infrequent usage. I was not amused having to look like I got in a fight with a lawnmower and lost until I got another trimmer to buzz off most of my hair. Weeks later my hair is getting close to normal again.</li>
    <li> I had no experience with this sort of tool, so it was a bit hard to figure out what would happen. The instuctions were not helpful. I managed to cut my son&#x27;s hair but much shorter than I intended to. Hair grows.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for well over a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are the easiest I have used to cut the back of my head and to trim it so it looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if it had a 3rd razor that was in-between the two available sizes.</li>
    <li> I bought it to cut my own hair to help save a buck. I was a bit nervous on the first go at it but after an hour and half of holding my breath, it came out just fine. What a relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do the buzz cut which obviously will be easy for this little clipper but the fine fading and layer details. And this thing gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great on a single charge and lasts longer than you&#x27;ll need in a single sitting. The kit comes with more than you&#x27;ll need attachment and is great for maintaining your 5 o&#x27;clock shadows throughout the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since separated from my barber but I have no regrets since it is much more convenient and cost efficient now that I can cut and trim as I need every month or two.</li>
    <li> After the price of my haircut went up 25% at my local haircutter, I decided to do it myself.  Tried it this morning and these hair clippers worked great!  The fact that the head rotates 180 degrees made it much, much easier.  Plus, I can now cut my hair every week or so and keep it short the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The clipper body itself is pretty good. Blades keep humming away, and I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and I doubt I&#x27;ll be seeing a defect its shearing ability anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that the plastic comb snapped on me, and the cost to replace one of them (from the philips website) is half the cost of the entire product. So I&#x27;ve resigned myself to using the shorter comb and giving myself a very short buzz (honestly it&#x27;s easier) because I&#x27;m a scrooge that doesn&#x27;t want to pay the markup they demand to replace a plastic headpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can rotate the head, but I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t really use that feature.</li>
    <li> Update, changed my rating from 4 to 2 because of it&#x27;s not so good experience. Try it many times not a self cutting tool It cuts deep patches of hair very easily. Also t&#x27;s very messy.It might work if someone does it for you but on your own, forget it  . I bought the remington  HAIR CUT HAIR VAC CLIPPR. It does a better job and no mess.</li>
    <li> This machine is easy to use it, very fast to cut your hair, and very fast for clean it.. It is waterproof and the battery have a long time to use..</li>
    <li> The legs of the combs are thin and could be broken if pressed with some strength, which is inevitable during hair-cutting! This could cause a patch of hair to be shaved off!</li>
    <li> Had this item for 2 years.  Worked well except comb would slip until finally a tab broke now it won&#x27;t stay in.  Vibrates out and there went my beard.  Replacement combs found somewhere, but expensive.  For some reason now to buy a new one of these is almost 3 times my original order.  Have to be looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get it, be gentle with the combs.  Good product otherwise.  Charges nicely.</li>
    <li> This is bit old model but I bought it because of the 29mm comb over the newer version. The build quality is really good and serve the purpose very well.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, bought a more advanced one with lower price in somewhere else after the blade broken (it break so easily).</li>
    <li> Very good hair set.Works quietly ,and cuts hair very evenly.Comftable to hold in the hand,light weight,charges fast as well!I would recommend this to friend.Buy without hasitation!!!</li>
    <li> Seldom do I review anything from Amazon. This handy little hair clipper is an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing the clippers, I got my hair cut whenever my wife went to see her stylist; about every 6 weeks. Typically we&#x27;re booked for an hour, of which it took the stylist just 5-10 minutes to cut my hair with electric clippers and scissors to trim around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these clippers I&#x27;m able to cut my hair more often, which means less annoyance with my hair, having reached that age where I can&#x27;t stand hair over my ears, not to mention the hair now growing from the tops of my ears. It takes about 20 minutes to give myself a haircut that&#x27;s every bit as good as the $22 cut from my wife&#x27;s stylist. Having retired recently, we appreciate saving the cost of a stylist, which leaves more money for travel and entertainment. In just 4 uses, these clippers have already paid for themselves twice over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does however take some planning to minimize the mess and I&#x27;ve come up with a system that works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before cutting my hair, I charge the clipper and lay it out with the attachments, a neck duster brush, a glass of water, a comb and hand-held mirror, next to the bathtub. Just before cutting my hair, I shower, wash my hair, dry off and comb my hair to stand upright. To cut my hair, I sit on the side of the tub with my feet in the tub, so the hair will fall into the tub when cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having cut my hair with these clippers several times, I find it best to cut the top first with the large attachment, set on 8. It&#x27;s best to cut front to back, left to right, back to front, and right to left to ensure an even cut, rotating the cutting head as needed for ease of use. Since the sides are shorter, it&#x27;s OK to run the clipper over and around the crown, since the long setting won&#x27;t cut any hair shorter than the setting. When there is no more hair falling into the tub at my feet, I use the mirror and a comb wetted in the glass of water to comb my hair upright and check for any tufts that might have been missed. But that&#x27;s never been a problem when cutting the hair from every direction. There is however a single hair every once in awhile that needs another pass of the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the top is cut, I change to the smaller attachment and set it for 3-1/2. To ensure the shorter hair on the sides blend into the longer hair on top, I cut from bottom to top and when reaching the curve of the crown, continue upward in a straight line.  If I were to follow the crown curve around to the top of my head, it would leave an obvious step where the 2 lengths meet. In this way, the sides and top blend naturally. Once again, rotate the head as necessary for ease of use, and go over the sides from bottom up, front to back and back to front for an even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difficulty with self administered hair cuts, is trimming around the ears and the back of the neck. My wife makes quick work of the fine trimming, after removing the length adapters from the trimmer and cutting with the bare cutting edge. For the detail work, the [[ASIN:B0001KBP7G Neck Duster #64 Long Handle]], comes in very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once done, use toilet paper to pick up the cut hair from the floor of the bathtub and flush it down the toilet. The remaining hair is easily washed down the drain with the hand held shower attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, I shower and wash my hair again to rinse the last of the hair down the drain. Washing my hair again after cutting has an additional benefit I appreciate. For whatever reason, my scalp often broke out after a haircut with the stylist. Since cutting my own hair and washing before and after cutting, there has been no recurrence of scalp breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The method I use to cut my hair makes a hair cutting cape unnecessary. I do not advocate cutting hair they way I do with conventional plug-in clippers, for obvious electrical safety reasons.</li>
    <li> Gives a really great cut, with less sound than most buzzers. Which for me is good for a late night cut with the roomies passed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of confusing to figure out at first, but the combs are easily adjustable and are precise. 1/2 size lengths are nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL HOW YOU HOLD IT. Your hand can move the comb adjustment dial, and make your hair much shorter than desired. Slipping from a #5 to a #1 is no bueno. Then again, all dial buzzers are prone to mistakes like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Before these I had a heavy clipper, these are light weight and easy to handle, I have only used them one time but so far I love them Nothing negative. I would recommend them</li>
    <li> I tried several shavers before because I just hate to go to the barbershop. Well, this is the best one so far. A lot of different hair length to be chosen. Can use it for great hear, beard, head...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve to agree with the other negative reviews. It would cut the hair much shorter than you&#x27;d like to. Even when using the large comb, it&#x27;s possible to cut the hair too short. The hair length setting doesn&#x27;t help. If the angle isn&#x27;t correct, it could cut it too close and mess up pretty badly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather spend $15 at a salon for getting a decent haircut rather than spending time and money on this product to get a terrible haircut.</li>
    <li> Bought it half year and have not used it until yesterday. What an awesome product, light, easily adjust, cordless and less pieces.</li>
    <li> Very simply... we love this clipper. It satisfies all our requirements to get the job done, which is cut the hair fast without too much hassle. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Make sure you figured out how to use it. Initially, I thought it would not work for me, but after playing a bit, I figured out that you can set any depth with a proper adjustment. If you think it does not give you enough depth, try to rotate the head and you will see that it works.</li>
    <li> Great so far! Convenient, comfortable handling.Many length to choose from; attach and detach combs easily. I am a happy costumer!</li>
    <li> If you are like me and think going to get your hair cut is a waste of time...look no further. It&#x27;s idiot proof and you really can shave your head without the assistance of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight criticism might be that the lowest grade doesn&#x27;t get close enough, but it is still a very sound product overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> With the right angle swivel I can cut my own hair without making too much of a mess out of it. A Great way to save a few bucks each month not to mention the wasted time waiting for the barber chair.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was tired of the time and money to get my hair cut.  I keep it short, no fancy curlicues or anything, and this is totally a great product!  It was a little hard the first time, I was so worried about turning out like something from the Three Stooges with my scalp showing like a lawn mower went over it.  But once I got the hang of it, it&#x27;s been a pleasure to do.  At first my kids said it looked bad, but now that I have a good feel for how to use it, and settle on the various lengths across my head, they don&#x27;t complain.  They don&#x27;t compliment me either, but it&#x27;s progress!</li>
    <li> Has multiple settings and the charge lasts awhile (use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair once a month), only need to charge it every 3-4 months.  Cut close, but sometimes it can be difficult to get the clipper adjustment to lay flat since it is flexible, but much easier than the plug in versions.</li>
    <li> One of the substandard item of Norelco. 180 degree is nothing specila. I set the trimmer length to my chice, but the trimmer trips hair to its choise. Wast of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always owned a corded hair clipper so this was my first foray in to the world of portable clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is good, it&#x27;s nice to hold and the swiveling head does actually come in useful (I didn&#x27;t think it would). The plastic guiding columns are fairly good, but I&#x27;d have preferred they be more stiff so as to not bend if I&#x27;m applying too much pressure by accident. Also, the mechanism to raise/lower the guiding columns is quite clever and I prefer it to the &amp;#34;lever&amp;#34; style mechanisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the clipper while in the shower. I didn&#x27;t soak it, but it did get quite wet and it coped well. So I decided to rinse it under a tap and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 is because I cannot think of anything I would change about it. Also, I would definitely recommend the product to someone else.</li>
    <li> Actually I love this product so much that I already bought two of these, I am cutting my own hair very short just like 1cm and this is the best that I can find from the web and bought two of these from amazon. One is a backup just In case I damage the first one. I bought two because I am afraid that they may not sell this product in the future. Its very easy to use and better than the previous product that I tried.</li>
    <li> The most awesome Hair clipper. Chargers fast. Cordless and easy to use. It is quite too and cuts very well This is my first hair clipper ever and I thought I would end up ruining my hair, I was wrong. It is just great and very natural. I like the way that you can rotate the head so it is easier to reach and naturally cut the hair at the back of your head. It is easy to clean too though one should be careful when switching combs. They same fragile.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The quality of the packaging is dreadful, that was surprising. It should have come with a bag or case to store all the items together.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this unit.Hair Clipper really does a nice job!Fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this unit.Hair Clipper really does a nice job!Fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Really very nice! The angle is very convenient, is also very easy to adjust.Is the change that beard razor is not very convenient, the need for a separate removal of the circular sets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my hair and how it&#x27;s cut and this clipper has far surpassed my expectations. It is very well-made, feels solid and is reasonably quiet when being used. The clipper came with the large comb already attached, like in the photo. I started cutting using the highest hair length setting (recommended) to get a feel for how it worked. It takes a little getting used to, but after a couple of uses I felt comfortable adjusting the settings and pivoting the cutting head to get the cut I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for cut hair falling all over the place. I started by cutting over the bathroom sink - big mistake. The hair went everywhere and was a pain to clean up. I now cut my hair in the shower using a mirror hanging on the shower head. Then I shower and collect the hair in the trap to dispose of later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this clipper. It is easy to use, saves money, is very adjustable and gives me exactly the cut I want. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use all the settings, but I love being able to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim is awsome on every level.  Some say they have broken attachments - so use them Correctly!  I have not had ANY problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Norelco didn&#x27;t have such stiff wires!  Hard to do charging or activity with sub-standard wires!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clipper I&#x27;ve seen. It has many levels of trimming from .5 mm to 10 and more.</li>
    <li> This clipper works well for its intended use, but I&#x27;m writing this review because I just received excellent customer service from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it almost 2 years ago and it worked great for a while, then started making a screeching noise and shutting off every time I tried to use it. I just called Norelco to ask what to do. They asked me for the serial number, which I didn&#x27;t have. Then they asked for my address and said a new one would arrive in 7-10 days. And that was that!</li>
    <li> The rotating head is a great feature. You have to get the feel for which guard cuts the hair the way you like.</li>
    <li> Very like, cheap and fine, I will recommend to my friends, thank you for your service has been seriously, thank you!</li>
    <li> A complete beginner but needed something to cut my bedridden husband&#x27;s hair with.  Very light in weight and does have directions even tho&#x27; he got buzzed a little shorter than I wanted.  A definite purchase if no other option.  Practice makes perfect they say.</li>
    <li> I love the swivel head. No more contortions to shave my hair line on the back of my neck. Cool length attachments too.</li>
    <li> One nice feature of these clippers is that the head adjusts 180 degrees.  But nearly every haircut I&#x27;ve given and I adjust the head, I inadvertently change the guard length setting and I only realize it after I&#x27;ve taken a nice chunk out of someone&#x27;s or my own head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for more than a year and I&#x27;ve had no problems. It makes it super easy to cut my own hair. The attachments are a little flexible which makes it comfortable, and gives you an even cut. Ergonomically designed so it is very easy to hold. The wide range of cutting lengths makes it very easy to blend the hair on the back of my head.</li>
    <li> It does the job well and is easy to handle. It is a very nice cordless clipper at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now and they are really good so far.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Its adjustable clipping system avoids clutter of unwanted clips for each size&lt;br /&gt;Rotatable head eases to go around the ears and back&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge long enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
    <li> after 3 years I broke one of the combs, contacted to Philips customer service, they send me replacement for free.</li>
    <li> Ugh, I&#x27;ve only had this device for a couple months before the flimsy plastic head broke during a routine trim.  I contacted Philips online support and was told the plastic head is not under warranty and I must purchase a new one.  So I did, shipping took WEEKS, and sure enough, it broke again one month later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice device, but do yourself a favor and pre-purchase a few extra heads.</li>
    <li> The package appeared new and sealed.  However, when I opened the box, I looked at all the components and the small clipper head had hair clippings in the grease used to lubercate the cutter.  It was never listed other than a new unit.  I was surprised and wrote Amazon and no reply.  It seems they ask us to rate these buying experiences but never do anything with our response.</li>
    <li> I used this clipper to cut my hair for four times now and it is the best clipper I have used. It is small but has juice in it, so it cuts my hair with ease. I also cut my 10-months son&#x27;s hair with it and it was really easy. Nice clipper.</li>
    <li> good machine,it is very convient to get my front haircut by myself.I love this machine very much. But cut the back hair is better by other people.</li>
    <li> The flexible head is a good idea in theory, but it simply does not cut as well as a fixed head design. It literally took three times as long to cut my hair, multiple passes over the same spots required.</li>
    <li> I like it very much ,cheap and nice. It is the gift for my son ,he is two years old.</li>
    <li> I‘ve never cut my hair myself before, the first try was good, actually it was much better than I thought, I love it.</li>
    <li> Initially I could get a hold of how to use it properly, so had an uneven cut for my husband making him look funny. But now I have become an expert in using this one. My husband loves to have a haircut from me. I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Ergonomics - Excellent. 180 degree rotating head is NOT a gimmick. Fully functional and really works to improve functionality of clipper. Fully adjustable cutting length dial so it eliminates the need for many different sized combs. Latest technology Lithium-ion recharge system; no annoying cords. Charges quickly. Fairly small; fits in the palm of your hand. Well constructed from quality materials. Well built. And here is the surprise, \\&quot;where is it made?\\&quot; How about Hungary!! OK it&#x27;s not the US but it&#x27;s also not Asia for a change. I say congratulations to the exec&#x27;s at Philips for thinking out of the box. This clipper is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this cutter is really what i want, easy use, easy clean&lt;br /&gt;i have used it once and i hope it works well in the future</li>
    <li> I wanted a Philips Norelco because I think they are the best products for your money.&lt;br /&gt;I have cut my own hair with this trimmer and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable to whatever length you desire with several attachments.</li>
    <li> PRO  Love the adjustable guard which allows setting the height without having to constantly replace adaptors.  Also it is washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON Unlike traditionally designed clippers, the angle of the cutting head is even with the handle.  This makes it awkward to handle as the hand comes too close to the hair.  I have to adjust the way I hold it to gain better control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if they tilted the head like traditional clippers, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I want to start my review by disputing the negative reviewers that say the clipper guard is not adjustable. These reviews are what had me initially on the fence about buying this product. I ended up just purchasing it anyway since it went on sale. The guard adjusts perfectly fine! It did take me literally 5-10mins to figure it out, however. The instructions are not intuitive and it&#x27;s not clearly marked on the clippers itself. How do you adjust the guard once it&#x27;s clicked into place? There is a nob you turn at the base of the clippers that makes it go up and down! Oh my god, I don&#x27;t know why it took my so long to find it. Again, contrary to other reviews it is quite stable and does not move settings when you press it hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to my official review. This thing is pretty amazing. For the money I spent, you can&#x27;t really beat it. The adjustable head makes for easy swiveling and do it yourself clipping. I shave my head down to a 4 and can do it myself in about 5 minutes. I have to go over some areas repeatedly to make sure it&#x27;s all clipped to the proper length, but that&#x27;s no big deal. It doesn&#x27;t require any oiling so that&#x27;s another perk. Will it stand the test of time? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but I hope it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good do it yourself clipper, this is probably a great item for you. The price is hard to pass up too. I paid mine off after one use relative to getting it professionally cut.</li>
    <li> quality product. you just have to get used to holding it at different angles.  easy to clean and attachments work well.</li>
    <li> I had so many problems with G370/60. It would not charge after the initial charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter QC5530/40. Plain awesome. While it does the hair clipping job fairly easily (depending on your hair type and length), I use it consistently to trim my beard. It just works and it is very well built. The size selection is straightforward and the quality is excellent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon regularly provides about a $10 coupon that can be clipped and applied to this purchase. This is an amazing price for an amazing performer. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was really worried buying this because I don&#x27;t know the first thing about hair clippers and my husband is SUPER picky. But after the first use, we were both in love with it! High quality, efficient and handy! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My father and I are now at home his hair is very practicalMy father and I are now at home his hair is very practical</li>
    <li> just wanted to leave a note saying how much i like this product. probably most satisfying purchase I have made lately. Runs fairly quiet. Has plenty of power, easy on the scalp. I have only had this product for a little while, but so far, awesome. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Initially was really happy with this hair clipper, but it did not lasted long, suddenly stopped working after 6 months.</li>
    <li> After my previous Remington&#x27;s battery refused to keep a charge, I had to change and found this one. It&#x27;s a more versatile and solid clipper and with the swivel function easy to use. Don&#x27;t know if the battery will be any better over the long term but so far I think this was a better choice.</li>
    <li> The only gripe I had was that the clipper seemed to slow down after about 10 - 15 minutes of use. It was nice not to be plugged in which allowed for much better freedom of movement. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Effective,convenient and stylish..The whole package is great and in affordable price.. I would definitely reccomend it! I will just mention my only concern: it may not be possible to trim hair and leave them longer than 2inch long.. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what else they could do to make this item work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of a disability getting to a barber can be difficult. This clipper is well thought out, well constructed. Cordless is nice as no cords in the way...or chance of electrocution near water..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this without other assistance....so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start off with the highest setting and work your way. Take it slow. Suggest you use with clean hair. Remove buildup of hair in the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having someone help...esp someone who has a feel for cutting hair would be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other cutting devices that I use besides this as well.</li>
    <li> I intended to buy this to cut my own hair, because I am not a barber and I only cut the hair of the person who cuts his own hair. And this is my great friend.</li>
    <li> I bought these to cute my three year old&#x27;s hair.  I&#x27;ve only used them once, but they were great.  I wanted something without a lot of different pieces because cutting my son&#x27;s hair is challenging enough without switching out guards ever other second.  I had to go over his head a few times to get everything even, but I&#x27;m please with the results.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever owned. They do a great job and the charge lasts a long time. Cordless is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Used the clipper a day after it arrived. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this unit. The numbered adjustment helps a lot. Now I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber to spend time and a fortune every month.</li>
    <li> little noise. I tried to cut hair by myself. And I am satisfied the result for  the very first time.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair and she loves how easy it is to change settings on this and that we don&#x27;t have to drag out and extension cord when she cuts my hair outside. I love the fact that it is sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
