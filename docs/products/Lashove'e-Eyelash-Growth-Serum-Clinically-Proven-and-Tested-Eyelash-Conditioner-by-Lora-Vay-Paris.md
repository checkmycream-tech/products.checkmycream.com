<li> I&#x27;ve been using prescription products to help with lashes for several years decided to check out other options</li>

<li> I have used this product for 6 months with absolutely NO results.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>

<li> I had been pulling them out for 15+ years, and now there are sparse sections in both areas and my lashes are not nearly as full and lengthy as the used to be.</li>
<li> I have noticed that my lashes are just a little fuller than before.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday , sometimes twice a day, no results.</li>
<li> About effectiveness, I can see my eye lashes growing longer than before I used the product; however, with a week past</li>
<li> My only problem with this product is that it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
<li> It was difficult to even get enough product on the brush to apply.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s hardly anything coming on the wand when I take out of the tube.</li>
<li> I may switch back &amp; try to be really careful not to get it on my skin &amp; just put it at the base of the lashes.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I took the chance and spent $99.00 on the product.</li>
<li> least me and my cousin don&#x27;t have any)!  </li>
<li> Not good @ all!</li>
<li> I bought this expensive product because of the promised results.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> I have shaken, and scrapped, what I can from the tube and used it as directed for just shy of 30 days.  </li>
<li> I like the product it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>

    <li> First off, the bottle came nearly empty, though there is supposed to be a months supply (and for nearly $100 there should be!).  It was difficult to even get enough product on the brush to apply.  I have shaken, and scrapped, what I can from the tube and used it as directed for just shy of 30 days.  My \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; shots, show no noticeable improvement.  I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed in this product, as it does not come close to delivering on ANY of it&#x27;s promises.</li>
    <li> I was using Revitalash &amp; it was causing my eyes to burn, the skin around my eyes got sensitive also. I switched to Lashovee to see if it was better. I have using it for a month now &amp; have maintained what I got from using Revitalash but they haven&#x27;t grown any longer or gotten any fuller. My friend who is still using Revitalash says she may have to cut her lashes, they are growing too long! I may switch back &amp; try to be really careful not to get it on my skin &amp; just put it at the base of the lashes.</li>
    <li> This growth serum works.  I have big beautiful lashes again.  Thank you !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lash serum applies smoothly with no color. Most importantly, it did not cause an allergic reaction, which is amazing because my eyes are very sensitive. I will definitely keep using this and update with my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I took the chance and spent $99.00 on the product. Lashovee shows no results after using it for 2 months. Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 6 months with absolutely NO results. The only reason I continued to use it is because I bought the 3 pack and have all this product (mistake #1). I don&#x27;t know who &amp;#34;clinically&amp;#34; proved this product but they are mistaken or are a part of this company. Just another scam.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lashovee for several weeks now,  Twice a day, and have yet to notice any lash growth. I will continue to use this product until it&#x27;s finished, but I am not encouraged for long lush lashes!:(</li>
    <li> I feel like I see growth &amp; fullness to my lashes.</li>
    <li> Has not made my lashes longer.</li>
    <li> Purchased two bottles ... both bottles were almost empty.. got bacterial infections from the product.. Not good @ all! Better products out on the market..</li>
    <li> This is the most safe clinaclly tested FDA approved.   i did alot of reserch,   and no side effects my lashed grew in 2 weeks longer, thicker, and darker</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I have super sensitive eyes -- it&#x27;s so bad that I can&#x27;t even cut an onion without them burning and in so much pain that I can&#x27;t open them for five minutes. I&#x27;ve accidentally swiped corner of my eye with this wand and nothing happened, so based on my experience I am confident saying this is a very gentle serum. I have suffered from an OCD-like condition called trichotillomania (&#x27;trich&#x27; for short). To me, this condition is a lot like biting your nails -- but instead of biting your nails off, you pull your hair out. For me, it was always my eyebrows and lashes. I know this sounds weird, but I own it. Anyways, I have recently been able to stop myself from doing this and my lashes and browns have grown back. I had been pulling them out for 15+ years, and now there are sparse sections in both areas and my lashes are not nearly as full and lengthy as the used to be. I used to have beautiful lashes when I was younger and I want them back! But, I also don&#x27;t want to use a product and *think* they are better, but have it all be in my head. So, I&#x27;ve been applying this eyelash growth serum to only one eye&#x27;s lash lines and brow and leaving the other alone so I can see if there really is any difference. I have included images of these before shots. When looking at the image, the side that has been treated is on the left. After three days of using serum so far, I personally can actually see an improvement, but it&#x27;s not yet to the point where I feel it would accurately represent a before/after. I am going to continue using this serum on the one side only for the four weeks as the instructions recommend and will update this review with after images. Luckily, I was without brows and lashes for so long that having one side look a little different for four weeks won&#x27;t bother me and hopefully be beneficial for others! Hopefully my selfies will get better with my next update and that I won&#x27;t look cross-eyed ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on purchasing this lash growth serum for my honest, unbiased review.

Not all Lash Serums are created equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinally Proven Eyelash Conditioner for Eyelash Growth by Lora Vay.&lt;br /&gt;Intensive Eyelash Legnthener - 52% average increase of all panelists tested&lt;br /&gt;100% of women tested experienced a significant increase in the appearance of eyelash fullness and length.&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes appear thicker, fuller, darker, longer, and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;Increases the look of density up to 82% in only 4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, and you want to do so twice a day. It dries fast and is not sticky at all. It caused no irritation as I could barely tell it was there.  This comes in a 5ml container that looks like a mascara tube. Overall I would say this is an ok lash serum. I have noticed that my lashes are just a little fuller than before.  I will say that if you are looking for quick results then this is not for you, but if you are in it for the long haul give it a try and stick with it and you will see results. Disclosure: product was provided for review, thank you</li>
    <li> DId not like this product. Made my eyes itch and it did not work like Latesse.  It was pretty pricey for this type of product.  I  would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> While it has not removed the tear stains from my dog&#x27;s face it does make her smell fantastic and her fur is so soft and smooth.  Great seller.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s hardly anything coming on the wand when I take out of the tube. After 4 weeks I still haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This product is good for sensitive eyes and I can confirm that. I have very sensitive eyes but applying this product did not make them irritating. About effectiveness, I can see my eye lashes growing longer than before I used the product; however, with a week past and they only grew just a bit longer. Indeed I do see improvement but not to the point of my satisfaction. I will continue using it for 3 more weeks (as recommended by the instruction) and see if the changes are significant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using prescription products to help with lashes for several years decided to check out other options so I read and decided on this product but I really didn&#x27;t have any luck. I went back to prescription.</li>
    <li> Never wrote a review. But feel that I have to tell those of you who consider buying this product. Used this for 2 months, no result whatsoever. Total waste of money. Very upset.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use, started the same day it arrived.  Hope to alleviate the use of mascara, as I don&#x27;t have full use of&lt;br /&gt;my hands.</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s clinically proven but my eyelashes have no change and it&#x27;s been well over four weeks. I&#x27;m still applying it, being hopeful, that it will work any day now. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I use this product whenever I remember to put it on.  Even so, my eye lash still grow longer(little) and thicker(a lot), especially lower lash.  One thing I really like is  that it have no side effect(at least me and my cousin don&#x27;t have any)!  But remember to apply at the roots of your eye lash to have any result.  My only problem with this product is that it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday , sometimes twice a day, no results. I bought this expensive product because of the promised results. I have had none.</li>
    <li> This product has some natural ingredients and so far I find it safer to use. It didn&#x27;t burn my eyes like some other eyelash that I got, its too early to tell the results, it works fine for me though.I just did apply it once a day in a thin coat after I clean and dry my face. I have been trying different kind of eyelash growth serum and this one seems work well for me. I like the product it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. In some weeks to come  I will update of some results with picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough. So far so good. I have noticed a difference in my lower lashes. Wish I had taken before pics to compare.</li>
    <li> I read on the internet that this was the top rated product for eyelash growth, so I did a test.  I used this product on one eye and another product on the other eye.  This product was a great big zero!  Really cannot recommend it at all.</li>
