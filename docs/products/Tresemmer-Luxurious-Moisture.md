      <li>Oprah recommended it once, but I loved it first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>butylene glycol,- used as a good emulsifier (thickener) or lathering agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>

      <li>Regardless of how lovely its smells.</li>
      <li>very rich ans luxourious</li>
      <li>Have been using this for a long time and it is among the best.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a nice pleasant scent, and my hair looks and feels like I am 30 years younger after I use it in the shower.</li>
      <li>Tresseme Moisture Rich Shampoo for Dry or Damaged Hair is an excellent conditioner</li>
      <li>This shampoo also had a strong perfume smell that irritated my scalp.</li>
      <li>A huge bottle for cost effect hair cleaning.</li>
      <li>a great shampoo that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth.</li>
      <li>The conditioner (white bottle) is also great for tangled hair like mine.  </li>
      <li>I figured the smell would go away once I dried my hair and, in the spirit of fair play, I should give the shampoo a fair chance.  </li>
      <li>With the original stuff, my hair was always silky smooth out of the shower.</li>
      <li>It also lathers easy for me (which is rare for me).</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair feel clean and silky.  </li>
      <li>---they seemed equal to the ends (I did also use a conditioner like always) but for the most part---it looked pretty good from root to tip.  </li>
      <li>Pair this with the matching conditioner and you have some nice, soft, shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad..</li>
      <li>Okay, first things first.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair so soft and natural, smells good, and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Also contains Coca Butaine as a mild agent to lessen scalp irritation</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to this brand.</li>
      <li>New and Improved is not always better ...</li>
      <li>This product dries out my hair and doesn&#x27;t really make it feel clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Super fast ship which is the basically the only &#x27;service&#x27; 2 be rated in this case,&lt;br /&gt;which was Outstanding!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more convenient to buy larger sizes, since we use a lot of shampoo in our family.</li>
      <li>Thank You much!</li>
      <li>So once my cleansing conditioners run out-I&#x27;m looking to this on a more regular basis.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be more moisturizing than it was, but overall okay for regular shampoo</li>
      <li>Vendors should send exactly what they display in their advertisement picture.  </li>
      <li>I wish they didn&#x27;t sell these at my local Costco because now I am stuck with this huge bulk shampoo that doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
      <li>It is not overly scented, cleans and rinses out easily, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Then I figured I&#x27;d go one step up and get the extra moisture rich TRESemme</li>
      <li>I select this vendor because they displayed the older version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a great value and lasts about 4-6 months in my family of 4.makes your hair so soft without all the added oils and smells great.the only complaint I would have</li>
      <li>I am going to have to rewash my hair, (new and improved my *%$^#).  </li>
      <li>I let my hair air dry (which is pretty tricky, having unmanagable hair)!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only given four stars however, as my hair needs washing the next day to feel clean with this product</li>
      <li>What I got was new and improved, I am sensitive to smells, some perfumes will cause my sinuses to run for hours, well guess what ...  </li>
      <li>If you want to stick with TRESemme, get the original black bottle.</li>
      <li>and I order 6 bottles of the OLD version.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s been treated by a professional.</li>
      <li>but I have a sensitive nose to perfumey smells.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s extremely soft (and I don&#x27;t even use conditioner).</li>
      <li>The item pictured is the  OLD version of the shampoo</li>
      <li>personally would probably never buy this product again unless I really had to for some reason.</li>
      <li>, she&#x27;s got pretty long hair</li>
      <li>I used any old conditioner I could find.</li>
      <li>Instead, I would encourage them try TRESemme&#x27;s Curl Hydration shampoo, which made my hair feel soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I dried my hair, it is limp and full of static (at least I was smart enough to wait until the weekend to experiment).  </li>
      <li>It generally means the manufacturer has found a way to make the product cheaper.  </li>
      <li>What I usually use is L&#x27;oreal Advanced Haircaire Power Moisture Hydrating Shampoo and feel that it works ten times better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>First of all, it rinses out of my hair unevenly every time I use it.</li>
      <li>(normally I prefer to wash my hair every other day to prevent splitting ends).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> New and Improved is not always better ... It generally means the manufacturer has found a way to make the product cheaper.  The item pictured is the  OLD version of the shampoo and I order 6 bottles of the OLD version.  What I got was new and improved, I am sensitive to smells, some perfumes will cause my sinuses to run for hours, well guess what ...  I am going to have to rewash my hair, (new and improved my *%$^#).  I figured the smell would go away once I dried my hair and, in the spirit of fair play, I should give the shampoo a fair chance.  I dried my hair, it is limp and full of static (at least I was smart enough to wait until the weekend to experiment).  Vendors should send exactly what they display in their advertisement picture.  I select this vendor because they displayed the older version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Headed back to the shower to rewash my hair and then go shampoo shopping.</li>
    <li> I thought for the price, this shampoo did a really good job.  I could def tell a difference while washing it from my usual shampoo.  I was looking for a shampoo that would not leave my scalp so dry and this had done it.  Pair this with the matching conditioner and you have some nice, soft, shiny hair.  I am not sure how this works on longer hair since mine is on the shorter end, but it really is not that expensive to try out.  They also have different types of their shampoos for your hair type so choose accordingly.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be more moisturizing than it was, but overall okay for regular shampoo</li>
    <li> This product dries out my hair and doesn&#x27;t really make it feel clean. What I usually use is L&#x27;oreal Advanced Haircaire Power Moisture Hydrating Shampoo and feel that it works ten times better.&lt;br /&gt;I personally would probably never buy this product again unless I really had to for some reason.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of shampoos, and this one is number ONE. I have extremely thick, wavy and normal to dry hair. When I use this shampoo (compared to others) I actually feel it&#x27;s Cleaner, when I wash it out. It also lathers easy for me (which is rare for me). I let my hair air dry (which is pretty tricky, having unmanagable hair)! But, my hair takes a nice shape after I use this shampoo and it&#x27;s extremely soft (and I don&#x27;t even use conditioner). So this is def. a great shampoo that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change (if I could) is the scent. It&#x27;s not bad..it&#x27;s ok/nice but I have a sensitive nose to perfumey smells.</li>
    <li> It made my hair extra volumizing and fluffy</li>
    <li> I have dry dry hair. Born that way.  It worked like any ordinary conditioner that doesn&#x27;t work.  It has alchole in it which makes hair dry. Try Suave or Organix instead.  Doesn&#x27;t work any bit.  It&#x27;s really \\&quot;dry Rich\\&quot; If that what you want.</li>
    <li> this is a great value and lasts about 4-6 months in my family of 4.makes your hair so soft without all the added oils and smells great.the only complaint I would have is I wish every bottle came with the salon pump that they included in previous orders.</li>
    <li> In desperate need of a new moisturizing shampoo, I decided to something new: TRESemme&#x27;s Vitamin E Luxurious Moisture Shampoo. Unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t work on my hair. Instead of moisturizing my coarse, naturally curly hair, TRESemme&#x27;s Luxurious Moisture shampoo dried it out. This shampoo also had a strong perfume smell that irritated my scalp. So, for these reasons, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend TRESemme&#x27;s Luxurious Moisture for people with coarse, curly hair. Instead, I would encourage them try TRESemme&#x27;s Curl Hydration shampoo, which made my hair feel soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! It makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s been treated by a professional. It leaves a nice pleasant scent, and my hair looks and feels like I am 30 years younger after I use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> No results  when I used it but it lathers on good. My hair still seems like it was no change.</li>
    <li> Listen to the 1 star reviews ladies. For the longest time I had dry, stiff hair. I used any old conditioner I could find. Then I moved to a new house, bought a new bottle of just plain old TRESemme conditioner (black bottle) and it&#x27;s worked wonders. My hair is smooth. Then I figured I&#x27;d go one step up and get the extra moisture rich TRESemme conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...are they f***ing kidding me with this stuff. Extra moisture? Try bone-dry. First of all, it rinses out of my hair unevenly every time I use it. I can feel patches of dry hair in between globs of conditioner as I&#x27;m rinsing it out. With the original stuff, my hair was always silky smooth out of the shower. Every day I&#x27;ve used this for the past week, my hair is fluffy, frizzy, and unmanageable again. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. If you want to stick with TRESemme, get the original black bottle. It works.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo forever.  Oprah recommended it once, but I loved it first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the price varies dramatically every time I buy it, even at the grocery store. Not sure why.  I can get it for $3.00 one week and it&#x27;s up to $10 another time.  The conditioner (white bottle) is also great for tangled hair like mine.  I just tend to buy in bulk when the price is good.</li>
    <li> creamy, hair shines.  disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t add any volume</li>
    <li> My hair is on the dry side...Blame it on being over 40- the weather, who knows.  It also will tangle quite a bit some times.  Anyways, we&#x27;re getting towards the end of summer, and I&#x27;m getting tired of the cleansing conditioners out there--they never seem to balance my hair out so I decided to try to go back to shampoo.  I saw this because there was a teenager in front of me at the check out line who bought so I thought -well, she&#x27;s got pretty long hair so I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I must admit for my hair---this one is a winner!!!!  I&#x27;m very happy with it---manageable and seemed balanced.  When I say this I mean the roots aren&#x27;t looking drab-greasy--dull-no life---they seemed equal to the ends (I did also use a conditioner like always) but for the most part---it looked pretty good from root to tip.  So once my cleansing conditioners run out-I&#x27;m looking to this on a more regular basis.  Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper this way too.  Happy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ThermaSilk shampoo for years.  However, when they discontinued my product, I had a heck of a time finding a replacement to give that silky feel.  TRESemme manages do give the same feel, but for half the price I was paying.</li>
    <li> Basic product, nothing extra 2 add there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super fast ship which is the basically the only &#x27;service&#x27; 2 be rated in this case,&lt;br /&gt;which was Outstanding!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and its corresponding conditioner both suck!  My hair never really feels softer after using them.  Your money will be put to better use if you buy Suave!  The Suave imitations of professional/expensive products are better than Tresemme.  I wish they didn&#x27;t sell these at my local Costco because now I am stuck with this huge bulk shampoo that doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> I am stuck. SULFATES NOT GOOD FOR YOUR HAIR! Regardless of how lovely its smells.</li>
    <li> this is good shampoo!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It smells great and is a great price.  The giant bottle lasts a long time too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot more convenient to buy larger sizes, since we use a lot of shampoo in our family. Works well for dry hair like ours.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a long time and it is among the best.  I&#x27;ve been loyal to this brand.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice price to begin with for size of container. This product makes my hair so soft and natural, smells good, and easy to manage. I would recommend this brand of shampoo to everyone. You also get more for your $. Thank You much!</li>
    <li> Really nice, leaves your hair clean and soft and the fragrance its wonderful</li>
    <li> I had extremely damaged hair from multiple bleaches to the point the hair no longer would takes dye. I use this shampoo about 2 times a week in combination with the conditioner, and my hair has improved greatly.</li>
    <li> very rich ans luxourious</li>
    <li> A huge bottle for cost effect hair cleaning. It is not overly scented, cleans and rinses out easily, and lasts a long time. For the price you cant get any better than this.</li>
    <li> Okay, first things first. I have a problem with the fact that the ingredients are all wrong! The ingredient list was the ONLY reason why I bought this item. I was so amazed by the different oils, then I received the item and looked at the bottle. Lo and behold, the ingredients on the listing was not on the bottle. I was very disappointed. I will try this shampoo in a couple of days. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t purchase the corresponding conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, I love how it makes my hair shine and look beautiful.</li>
    <li> Tresseme Moisture Rich Shampoo for Dry or Damaged Hair is an excellent conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Panthenol Vitamin B for making hair softer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Tocophenol Vitamin E to repair brittle ends,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. polyquaternium 10 - good detangling and conditioning ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. butylene glycol,- used as a good emulsifier (thickener) or lathering agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Fennel (foeniculum vulgare) (fennel) seed extract, for hair fungus and bacteria (dandruff) control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. hydrolyzed wheat protein - adds slippery feel to hair and smoothness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Also contains Coca Butaine as a mild agent to lessen scalp irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Propylene glycol- acts as a humectant to help moisturize the hair and to dissolve ingredients in water better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel clean and silky.  I&#x27;ve only given four stars however, as my hair needs washing the next day to feel clean with this product (normally I prefer to wash my hair every other day to prevent splitting ends).</li>
