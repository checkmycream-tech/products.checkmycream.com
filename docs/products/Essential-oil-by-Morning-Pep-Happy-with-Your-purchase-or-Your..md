      <li>This peppermint oil is highly concentrated, therefore although refreshing, the scent is very strong, and consequently just a few drops are necessary for all</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really helped relieve the headache&lt;br /&gt;until</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:9c5004d8d2a93fb76aa4cbc53c0973ef]] I can definitely say this is some good strong pure peppermint oil. I suffer from sinus congestion nearly all year round and after getting this, I put a little (and trust me a little is all you need) under my nose.  I can definitely say it works well for sinus congestion as the nice strong smell of mint helped clear me up.  It&#x27;s also great as a breath freshener, muscle relaxer in baths or mixed with other oils for massage and for helping alleviate headaches.  It works especially well with a diffuser.  There are lots of other uses for mint if you research online.  So far, I am satisfied with the quality of the oil.  This is a nice large bottle of mint at a good price at currently 7 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wow this peppermint smells fabulous. I never expected it to smell this good - it is like a lot of candy all in one place. It isn&#x27;t clear that this is safe for human consumption - so I wouldn&#x27;t put this in candy or food. This bottle must be a life time supply of peppermint oil. The bottle is amber to block light from degrading the oil or the lavender smell. The top is a normal straight bottle, there is no pouring spout or eye dropper. Simply leaving the bottle open on the counter works to diffuse the aroma. A free sample was provided for review.</li>
    <li> Peppermint Oil is my new Tea Tree Oil. I use it for everything! It feels wonderful on the skin and sore muscles, helps relieve nasal issues and smells fabulous when added to a diffuser. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this Peppermint Oil. It is potent and fragrant, cool and natural. My only complaint is that the bottle does not have a dropper type stop, so it can pour out very fast. I like adding a few drops to bathwater, but once I accidentally poured in quite a bit and it resulted in a very chilly bath (despite being full of hot water). It was not an unpleasant experience, but it works much better with just a few drops. The bottle is a good size so it should last you a while. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I was sent a complimentary 4 fl. oz. bottles of Morning Prep Peppermint &amp; Lavender Essential Oils several weeks ago in exchange for my honest thoughts. My original intent was to use the Peppermint oil in a facial mask, but  I had completely forgotten about it until I received a diffuser yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peppermint Oil has a strong scent that will definitely cure any sinus problems you might be having. It only takes a few drops at a time in a diffuser, so one bottle should last a while. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with the Morning Prep Peppermint Oil and I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t restate all of the wonderful uses for peppermint oil.  This particular one smells just minty enough...it is not overbearing.  I like having it on hand and I have used it for minor scalp dryness and irritation.  It feels good...it smells great and it has made my scalp feel so much better!  Now...the next thing I am doing with it is making my husband use it along with his other hair products to help his hair grow!  You will truly find about a million uses for this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product was sent to me by the manufacturer for my honest thoughts!</li>
    <li> This Morning Pep peppermint essential oil is great for both aromatherapy and pest repellent.  A few drops in a diffuser can make you feel energized, and cotton ball or sprayed peppermint oil is supposed to deter rodents, an environmentally safe way to keep mice at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly large bottle, much larger than many essential oils, which is great if you plan to use a lot of it.  The biggest drawback is that the bottle is completely open -- no dropper or otherwise controlled pour.  It&#x27;s difficult to get, say, five drops in a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of peppermint is definitely invigorating, and this Morning Pep version is a good way to buy a lot of it.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, nice product.</li>
    <li> So nice to find a quality product and great value. The peppermint is cooling and soothing.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, my disgusting neighbors moved out of their house, and with them went an exodus of rats into all of the neighboring properties, including my own. Since then, I&#x27;ve had to purchase a rat proof chicken feeder, reinforce all of the vents going underneath my house, and carefully clean up after spilled birdseed etc. to keep the rats at bay as much as possible. After reading that rats and mice do not like peppermint oil, I was excited to have the opportunity to test this large bottle. Though the rats have not completely gone away, given that I am using this outside, I sprinkled this around a lot of the areas where I notice they hang out, such as my fire wood pile, and they certainly have been hanging out there less. If you have a rodent problem indoors, I would certainly recommend peppermint essential oil like this one as a great strategy to keep them at bay. Though I received a sample for review, opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> very nice. It&#x27;s very strong. I love it. But I just with It comes with glass dropper.</li>
    <li> Poor quality and didn&#x27;t like this product. Would not recomment this sorry....</li>
    <li> This smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is a 4 oz glass bottle of pure, high quality Peppermint Oil at a price of (currently) $7, which is much cheaper than I can find it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is glass, dark colored to prevent light affecting the oil. Tightly sealed, does not drip or ooze if the bottle is tipped over. Designed for long term storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a fan of Peppermint Oil for many years, and I recommend it for (among other things) overcoming Jet Lag from international air travel. Just a whiff--like smelling salts--does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are MANY uses for peppermint oil, and at 4 oz for $7 you can afford to explore them all. This is high quality peppermint, very intense and potent, and wonderful. Stated to be 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several products from Morning Pep, including a Lavender Oil (also excellent) and Coconut Sugar, Almond Flour and other products. They have all been excellent quality, extremely healthy, and clearly made by Morning Pep with genuine attention to quality and an obvious pride in their product. I like the brand, and I&#x27;m not surprised that this Peppermint Oil has exceeded my expectations (and especially at this low price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. I really am impressed, and I&#x27;m happy to recommend this. Quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful as you research and comparison shop online. Have fun and stay healthy, everybody.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil is distilled from the leaves and stems of the peppermint plant (Mentha x piperita).  It is crystal clear and intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint oil has been used as a fragrance, a flavoring, and for medicinal purposes continuously from prehistorical times.  It contains a high concentration of menthol, which creates a cooling sensation and reduces pain and itching better than many commercial products.  Even a few drops added to a carrier oil is very helpful for dry, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also used in aromatherapy and may be helpful for digestive problems.  It has an appealing flavor and scent and can be used as a natural air freshener.  It is often used as an inhalant for stuffy noses and I find the scent helpful for nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is packaged in a 4 fl. oz. (118 ml) amber bottle with a safety-sealed cap and an attractive label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning Pep provided essential oil for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This peppermint oil smells amazing! This is a very generous 4 ounce bottle of peppermint oil, the company states that it is 100% pure and natural. I love using peppermint oil along with lemon, eucalyptus, and rosemary together in my diffuser during cold/allergy season, or added to a carrier oil to be used topically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Peppermint also has antiseptic, antispasmodic, and anti-inflammatory properties and will help soothe your airways making it easier to breath. Peppermint oil is the first thing I reach for when someone around here gets a stuffy nose! Inhaled straight from the bottle, or a few drops added to a diffuser will help to unclog the sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also add a few drops of peppermint oil and a drop or two of lemongrass oil to a small spray bottle of water and spray around baseboards, window ledges, and on counter tops. It works wonders keeping the spiders and ants away, plus it smells great! Mice also hate peppermint,... you can soak cotton balls in peppermint oil and place around the house to keep them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try adding a few drops to your favorite shampoo along with a few drops of rosemary and tea tree oil, your scalp will feel refreshed and tingly! It has a very strong scent so be careful not to use too much, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top of this bottle does not have a dropper cap. You will need to use a pipette or dropper to dispense drops of this oil. You can easily find them online or even at the pharmacy. This is a very good quality of peppermint oil, it smells great and there are so many different ways you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Free product sample received in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I had never used Peppermint Oil before, and I was not sure of any of its benefits, so this was a new discovery for me. Although I have not had the occasion to test for all of Peppermint Oils advantages, the few uses that I had tried out have exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning Pep Peppermint Oil comes in a dark amber color bottle with a twist off cap. It does not come with any applicator, so I have to use an eyedropper from another finished product.  Unfortunately, I do not own an eyedropper that fits the size of the Peppermint Oil, so the twist cap remains on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is all natural and Morning Pep uses the extraction method of steam distilled from the tops of the peppermint leaves. This peppermint oil is highly concentrated, therefore although refreshing, the scent is very strong, and consequently just a few drops are necessary for all applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint Oil has an incredible amount of medicinal usages, including IBS, and digestive conditions, however this brand is a Therapeutic Grade and NOT for internal use. Just to clarify, another term for Therapeutic Grade is “aromatherapy grade” or “clinical grade”, which means that this is suitable for the same usages performed in hospitals but NOT appropriate for a large amount of food consumption or food flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several different uses for Peppermint Oil; my main two are in a diffuser to refresh the air in a room, and as a bug, and spider repellent. To repel these crawling pests, I use just a drop of two on a cotton ball, run the cotton ball across the threshold or along the space of their entry, and leave the cotton ball along the side.  So far, this has proved 100% effective, and the crawling insects have not returned, and it has proved safe for my dog, parrots, and canaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have listed many other uses and remedies, and as each opportunity arises, I will try these treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) PEPPERMINT OIL FOR SCALP AND HAIR-&lt;br /&gt;As a hair treatment and used in the proper way, it can help address common hair concerns such as dry scalp, hair loss, hair growth, and more. Although Peppermint oil can work wonders, it is very strong and may be too irritating for people with sensitive scalps. Mixing it with a carrier oil is best but it also works when mixed with other essential oils to ensure that there is no burning sensation when applied to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Peppermint Oil helps to normalize scalp oil production, and reduces excessive oil on the scalp by using it as an astringent. It balances the scalp’s pH level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B)  Combat Dry Scalp and Dandruff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C)  Moisturizer – Peppermint oil mixed with other essential oils or a carrier oil for application directly to scalp and hair. Wrap your head with a shower cap and then a warm towel or heating device for 20 to 30 minutes to allow the mixture to penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D)  Promote Hair Growth – Peppermint oil stimulates the hair follicle by increasing blood circulation and oxygen supply, therefore, by massaging the oil into the scalp, hair follicles and roots are able to grow at their full potential due to the large supply of oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E). Stop Hair Loss – In addition to promoting hair growth, the stimulation can also aid with hair loss. The increased oxygen supply carried by blood and strengthens hair roots, and blood delivers nutrients that are essential to good hair health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Prepare Peppermint Oil for Use on the Scalp:&lt;br /&gt;A)  Dilute Peppermint Oil with Water – Mix 3-8 drops of peppermint oil with a cup of water.&lt;br /&gt;B)  Mix Peppermint Oil with Carrier Oils – Jojoba, olive, avocado and or almond oils are carrier oils that add additional benefits and lessen the harshness of peppermint oil. Add a few drops of peppermint oil to a few ounces of a carrier oil and mix before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) TOOTHACHES –&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint oil is very effective in relieving toothache and can cure dental carries. Dip a cotton swab on peppermint oil and apply it on the toothache area to decrease soreness in the area and the pain in the tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) INDIGESTION, FLATULENCE AND DIARRHEA – Pour 4-6 drops in the palm, rub over stomach and around the navel for relief&lt;br /&gt;4) Add a drop of Peppermint oil to herbal tea to aid in digestion and relieve heartburn.&lt;br /&gt;5) Massage several drops of Peppermint oil on the area of injury to reduce inflammation&lt;br /&gt;6) Apply Peppermint oil immediately to an injured area (bruise on foot or hand) to relieve pain, however, for a cut, or open wound, apply the Peppermint oil around (not on) the open wound.&lt;br /&gt;7) Rub several drops of Peppermint oil on the bottoms of the feet to reduce fever.&lt;br /&gt;8) Apply a drop of Peppermint oil topically on unbroken skin to stop itching.&lt;br /&gt;9) For poison ivy or poison oak, apply Peppermint oil on location neat or dilute with V- 6 Vegetable Mixing Oil.

    <li> This is either diluted with carrier oil, or very poor quality. I base this evaluation on two factors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have many bottles of peppermint oil from highly respected companies like Mountain Rose Herbs, so I&#x27;m very familiar with what it smells like, even different strains. This doesn&#x27;t have even a fraction of the overwhelming strength of peppermint oil. It smells weak and &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; It does the peppermint tingle when I put some on my lip, so I&#x27;m guessing real but diluted.&lt;br /&gt;2. Essential oils are highly volatile compounds. If you put a drop on an index card, it will before long have evaporated without a trace. No oily splotch will be left behind. This leaves a big oil splotch and also remains oily on my skin, a common indication of dilution with carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> I received this oil as a promotional offer...I suffer from congestion and took just a dab under my nose and it&lt;br /&gt;opened my sinuses right up...I love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot rave enough about this company in both the quality and care in their shipping and handling!</li>
    <li> Of all the essential oils on the market, I consider Peppermint to be the most essential of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint is useful for many aliments but the most common are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tension&lt;br /&gt;Nausea&lt;br /&gt;Depression&lt;br /&gt;Headaches&lt;br /&gt;Sinuses&lt;br /&gt;and overall stress reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally know that it helps with all of the above and seems to just help mellow me out in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few oils from Morning Pep and I think they are a high quality supplier of essential oils. The quality to price ratio is really fantastic as well which is a great bonus. 4oz is a lot so even with daily use this bottle should still last you a few months so its a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for testing it out and giving an honest review. Having said that, the price is very good and I will most definitely purchase it in the future at full price. 100% worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle, much larger than what most essential oils are sold. This one however, does not include a dropper so using it can be a challenge. It is easy to spill if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint is definitely a flavor that I find in items from all over the world. From baked sweets and candy to medicine, potpourri, and soaps, it is found all over the store and inside our homes. Needless to say, I have a bottle of 100% pure Peppermint Oil on hand at all times, because of it being so versatile and handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that when people are starting to learn and try essential oils that peppermint oil is one of the first ones most people try. The first time it was suggested to me was when I was feeling sick to my stomach at a conference and I didn’t want to leave and miss the speaker. A friend of mine put a few drops in my water and within a few minutes of drinking it, my stomach felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve also had some success with it treating my headaches, making my own natural toothpaste, sore muscles and of course in my kitchen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it is definitely a strong oil and a little goes a long way! Plus, if you have sensitive skin, you should definitely put it in a carrier oil (like coconut or almond oil) first so you avoid any skin discomfort. Plus by adding it to the carrier oil, it helps prevent evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are brand new to essential oils, use them for your cooking and baking, or are looking for ways to replace harmful products with all natural homemade ones, then I’d definitely recommend you try the Peppermint Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> Very fragrant, felt great. Nicely packed in bubble wraps. Per Dr. Mercola, Peppermint oil is derived from the leaves of the peppermint plant or Mentha pipertita.  The essential oil is often used as a home remedy for stomach problems, muscle pain, and headaches. Peppermint oil is often used in aromatherapy, or the use of essential oils to support health. Studies have found that aromatherapy is effective in relieving anxiety, pain, and vomiting, as well as improving memory. The aroma of peppermint oil has been shown to improve memory and raise alertness. According to findings, peppermint oil exhibits antiviral, antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, analgesic, radioprotective, and antiedema properties. A sample was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> This oil seems to be working just as well as any more expensive Peppermint Oil I have used.  I really like the larger bottle because I use a lot of it for so many differ things.  It does have many uses.  Thank you Morning Pep and Amazon for the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I enjoy placing a few drops of this lively, vivacious peppermint fragrance into my essential oil blends.  What a pick-me-up!  Adds a zing of freshness, and always a clearing note, to whatever I pair it with.  Even a few drops on a cotton ball placed in the old truck produces almost miraculous results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the label, Morning Pep suggested that a combo of this peppermint and their lavender oil will repel insects.  I combined these two with Morning Pep&#x27;s rose hip oil (as a carrier oil), and was happy with the results.  Maybe I won&#x27;t throw my can of mosquito repellent in the garbage, but I don&#x27;t think I will be using it very often--not if I can use this combination instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviewers suggesting applying this oil without diluting it.  That practice is usually frowned upon.  And I believe this oil is undiluted, so I strongly advise mixing it with a carrier oil or lotion before applying to the skin.  Plus, this product is not suitable to be taken internally--so don&#x27;t put it in your mouth as is, and don&#x27;t swallow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large bottle, but there are so many uses for peppermint oil--especially in summertime--that you&#x27;ll be glad this size bottle is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Morning Pep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a peppermint freak. Whenever a recipe calls for &amp;#34;your favorite flavoring&amp;#34; I reach for the peppermint. I use it in my home-made toothpaste and in my cleaning concoctions.  It&#x27;s a natural antiseptic and it smells much better than bleach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used it in a humidifier, but my teen has mild asthma and recently started using an aromatherapy difuser/humidifier.  I read that peppermint essential oil helps breathing, so she started using a few drops in her difuser before she goes to sleep and she seems to be breathing better and (therefore) sleeping better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to knock off a star because there&#x27;s no dropper.  However, that would add to the cost, and it&#x27;s a great price. I just use the dropper from an emptied bottle and it&#x27;s fine.  I think of it as buying a large &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; bottle of (say) window cleaner and pouring it into a spray bottle.  A little bit of trouble to save some money.  Works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try some essential oils for their health benefits.  I loved this!  The smell is amazing, I have really been struggling with nasal congestion and noticed a difference quickly after using it on my chest.  I have put it in a spray bottle spray around for freshening the smells in my house and am trying it to combat ants.  The size of the container was much bigger then some of the essential oils I have gotten in the past.  The only draw back to it that I could see was that it didn&#x27;t come with a dropper.  I will need to invest in more empty dropper bottles, but the product is worth it!</li>
    <li> A little dab will do you</li>
    <li> Great price and the scent is refreshing but not as strong as I&#x27;d like it to be.  I will be using this in soap recipes so I have a feeling I&#x27;ll need to use quite a bit more than with the stronger brand that I usually buy..</li>
    <li> I liked this peppermint oil&lt;br /&gt;I used it when I had headaches&lt;br /&gt;It really helped relieve the headache&lt;br /&gt;until I felt like taking a pain reliever.&lt;br /&gt;This peppermint oil is very potent so&lt;br /&gt;mixing it with a carrier oil might be the&lt;br /&gt;best thing to do. I also made a body scrub&lt;br /&gt;with this peppermint oil and lavender oil plus&lt;br /&gt;bath salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this peppermint oil&lt;br /&gt;because you can use it for a number of things. It also&lt;br /&gt;comes in a nice 4 oz so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review</li>
