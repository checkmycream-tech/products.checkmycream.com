<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good full haïr , Nice</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because their  shipping time was amazing and i am able to style the manikin&#x27;s hair the way i would my hair.The number one reason i love this manikin is because of the texture of the hair</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a mannequin with hair that matches thick, coarse, afro hair that is relaxed or pressed out then this is the one to get.  There are questions in the comments about what type of hair this mannequin has and how it can be styled. This mannequin has yak rather than human hair. A yak is a long haired cow found in places like Tibet. You can wash or heat style this hair as you would human hair with a similar texture. I use heat protectant spray and set heat tools at about 400. The results are very pretty and there is no singed/burnt hair smell. Keep in mind this is super coarse hair so it will not be bone straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mannequin doesn&#x27;t slide all the way on to the stand. I think the hole in the bottom of the head is a little small. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a manufacturer&#x27;s flaw specific to my mannequin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shedding. I know this is normal for new mannequins and stops eventually but it is still annoying.</li>
    <li> This hair shields  like crazy when I comb it I wish that I would of know this... I hope this continues doing this..because if it does this head will be bald</li>
    <li> Practiced sew in extensions. Cool&lt;br /&gt;Hair. Can practice braiding. The stand isn&#x27;t great and the mannequin is too small otherwise.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my Celebrity Yolanda Cosmetology head. I would advise especially for a beginner like myself to purchase this item. The texture of her hair was exactly what I was hoping for. I truly enjoy my cosmetology head and my skills have truly advance. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just learning how to cornrow, so I took a chance and visited Amazon in order to do research on cosmetology manikin&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m so glad I came to Amazon, because Yolanda is a gem!  The item arrived lightning fast to my home and when I opened the box, she was nicely packaged and I could start using her right away.  The hair texture was perfect for someone like myself that is just learning to cornrow, because it has the texture of real African American hair!  Thanks Amazon for offering such a great product, I know that I will be putting \\&quot;Yolanda\\&quot; to alot of use!  Thanx a million :D</li>
    <li> Great product for practicing braids. She sheds a lot but this is normal with mannequins. I love the hair texture. I will purchase more</li>
    <li> Good and sexy like real african american hair</li>
    <li> I love this manikn...it came on time and with the swivel stand it even better this hair texture is thick and great for braids</li>
    <li> Hair has the texture of African American or ethnic hair and was useful in learning to braid and do sew in weave. Would recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this manikin so that I could learn how to braid hair because I have so many younger girl cousins who always ask me. Although the hair isn&#x27;t true afro texture (more like blow-dried natural hair) its similar to the hair that my cousins have when blow-dried.  I was a little nervous about what the doll would actually look like but I am pleasantly surprised! There is some shedding but its nothing too bad. The hair is also uneven but I don&#x27;t really care about that very much. Overall, I love the quality of the doll and it is serving its purpose!</li>
    <li> Luv it! Great for practicing flat twists and all kinds of braids</li>
    <li> I washed the hair today. And put conditioner in it. Made the texture more manageable! And softer. Love it</li>
    <li> I am african and this manikin does help practice braiding and the texture is similar to my texture of hair, so it is good for practice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mannequin to practice hairstyles before I tried them on myself.  I am not good with styling my hair and I am trying to learn some new skills.  I am pleased with the purchase, the hair reminds me of my hair blown out and before flat ironing (my hair is relaxed).  The hair is 100% yak, so I was concerned if I could hot curl the hair and actually achieve a curl.  I was very happy to see that the hair curls very well with a curling iron and actually holds the curl.  I have experienced very little shedding, truthfully, I experience way more shedding from my own hair.  I&#x27;m attaching photos of the curls that I tried out on the mannequin (don&#x27;t judge because I am not good with styling or curling yet).  The curls came out very thick and fluffy, so I am happy so far.</li>
    <li> Great for learning to style hair.</li>
    <li> Love the hair it is perfect for braiding and yes you can wash blow dry and use a curling or flat iron on it it feels like african american hair if you have that type of soft strait hair!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Just what I needed to practice braiding! The stand that is pictured does not come with it! I would buy this again! Recommend it to anyone who wants to practice braiding</li>
    <li> good for the purpose i bought it for but i think is sheds to much</li>
    <li> I love this product. I purchased it to use for learning to braid. The hair was the perfect texture. It was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great mannequin to practice African American  hairstyles on. Great hair texture...perfect for hair braiding.</li>
    <li> This mannequin is okay, but only if you want to practice braiding or weaving on it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for heat styling. I knew when I bought it that it was made of \\&quot;yak\\&quot; hair (I don&#x27;t know what it is) and I knew it wasn&#x27;t human, but it doesn&#x27;t seem synthetic either.... Anyways, it&#x27;s a decent length and the texture of the hair is great for braiding.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this head thingy and YouTube and a hairstylist who messed my scalp...I now know how to braid my hair. This thing is a really good way to practice braiding. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> Sheds a lot. But ok otherwise.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product!! Easy to work with exspecialy for braiding, I learn how to put in extension in less the an hour,,,</li>
    <li> Helpful tool; product is as described. Bought for my 14 y/o daughter to assist in hair-braiding and styling her own hair.</li>
    <li> Ship in two days which was awesome just bought this for personal use of the knowledge of learning how to do my hair braids and such I like it</li>
    <li> I love this manikin, it was everything I expected it to be and more. Even though it does shed a little I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> GreaT mankin Hair.... It feels like a real person hair..... I love how the hair feels...... I&#x27;m learning how to do hair and I&#x27;m happy that I got this Manikin the hair lenth is just right....... Only down fall is lot of hair fall out so comb it out comb it threw then you should be ok after........ And I paid for the one day shipping and got it like 5-6 days later...... No money back or no prize, discount of hair nothing...... This the first and last time I&#x27;m buying something from this seller again</li>
    <li> I give it four stars out of five because it sheds a lot. But it works for what I want it to work for. I just want to learn how to braid. Also it has a few strands of grey hair as well, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this to learn how to braid styles for my daughter&#x27;s transitioning hair. It has been a quality tool and is well made. I appreciate how affordable it was. The seller was prompted and the packaging was fine.</li>
    <li> I love braiding Yolanda hair ...it does shed a little and has quite a few gray hairs but who cares. As long as I can practice braiding on her then it doesn&#x27;t matter. Quick shipping also....Great job!</li>
    <li> The hair is uneven but a nice length and of sheds but I do like the texture and it holds braids very good. That&#x27;s all i&#x27;ve done so far since this is my 1st time using it. Besides the shedding I&#x27;m  pretty satisfied so. When I try other styles or try a flat iron I will do an update</li>
    <li> Good quality hair, didn&#x27;t really shed too much.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a stand to put Yolanda on table.  I was really surprised that she didn&#x27;t come with it.  my daughter likes to fix her hair....so far the purchase is working out</li>
    <li> Great product and good construction. Timely shipment as well.</li>
    <li> I NEED SOME TO PRACTICE HAIRSTYLES ON BUT I DIDNT WANT THE HAIR SILKY I NEEDED THE HAIR TO BE SIMILAR TO AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR AND THIS DOLL WAS PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEED WHEN I ORDERED THIS SHE CAME IN WITHIN A FEW DAYS THE HAIR DOES SHED A VERY LITTLE BIT BUT ITS NOWHERE NEAR NOTICABLE</li>
    <li> I love my manikin!!  Like it so much that I have renamed her. She is called MiMi now.  I have been able to pratice many natural hair styles that I wanted to learn.  Since I have been natural for about two years I wanted to relearn some of the protective hair styles that I use to do a long time ago and learn some of the newer styles that are on Youtube. I want to show off for the summer.  MiMi arrived on time, well made and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping , the doll is just perfect PERFECT nice coarse hair and styles well</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected and I like it.</li>
    <li> It has extremely durable hair.  It colors and cuts nicely, but really smells like animal hair for sure, definitely YAK hair. Its also really frizzy. I expected more curls but if you look at the picture closely its all frizz.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:96bf3dd2caf64048a96b5d8232f77a00]] Yolanda! Yolanda! 100% YAK Hair. lol This Girl is great for practicing natural hair techniques such as braiding, corn-rolling, adding hair extensions etc. I can&#x27;t tell you if she can be straighten, flat iron  or curled or what will happen after she has been washed; however, I saw other reviewers pics and read their reviews... and come to a conclusion that you are able to do so. Lastly, the hair parts really easy and the hair holds in place a the part lines. Check out my video for the visual review (I am visual person myself) and let me know if it the video was helpful and please hit me up if you have any questions about Yolanda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;As always... Bring it to you 100% and Raw\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;RawAngel7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002ZNJI80 Celebrity Yolanda Cosmetology Yak Hair Manikin]]</li>
    <li> I loved this product though i wasnt happy with the lining of the hair .the texture is good and the money was worth it</li>
    <li> Bought it for my aunt and she loves practicing on to braid,press and curl.</li>
    <li> The hair started to shed the same day i took it out of the bag and just over all it didnt do much for me so i gave it to my daughter to play with</li>
    <li> HAIR LENGTH IS NOT 21 INCHES LONG!!! VERY MISLEADING. OTHER THAN THAT, OKAY PRODUCT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME SHEDDING. WE&#x27;LL SEE HOW IT GOES AS I USE IT MORE OFTEN.</li>
    <li> The hair length varies but it works for me! Their are some grays amongst the hair, but I&#x27;m mainly practicing my braiding so the grays don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> My oldest granddaughter has made so many styles on this I can&#x27;t remember them all.</li>
    <li> the hair does come out but not alot but i would prefer it to  take awhile before hair strands started falling out. i don&#x27;t use this all the time</li>
    <li> Over good quality, hair placement is baby doll like makes for difficult parting otherwise, okay.. Maybe I&#x27;d try human hair next time</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this Manikin!!  After reading some of the negative reviews I was a little skeptical about ordering this manikin.  I ordered 3 different ones for my daughter and two nieces and I absolutely love this one.  The texture is very authentic.  It is thick like natural Black hair that has been blowed out.  I play with it as much as my daughter, practicing what I might do on her own natural hair.  Reviews are good but sometimes you have to be your own judge.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Pretty good texture of hair to practice braiding, only thing is- the stand placement is that of a barbie doll, each strand is pretty much aligned to lay a certain way rather than move how you like and kay how you like when you part it. It does affect the braiding somewhat, but not too much if you&#x27;re at least intermediate at braiding. Also sheds a bit, but that&#x27;s normal for a new mannequin. Haven&#x27;t noticed any thinning or bald patches. . But i think there was some dead lice near the scalp area. Freaked me out.</li>
    <li> I found this mannequin to be exactly the texture I was looking for to practice hair braiding. Great product.</li>
    <li> Is what it says on the tin.</li>
    <li> very good hair for practicing braiding ..i love it</li>
    <li> Bought this because i needed another mannequin for school its perfect i use her to braid and practice my sew ins. I also use her to practice straightening hair with the blow drier md flat iron great product</li>
    <li> Perfect to learn Hair braiding...</li>
    <li> My wife love it...... It&#x27;s just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I thought it was more of african kind of hair but it was hard to grip the hair and i had trouble trying to braid it but it does the job and it is good for training. It&#x27;s not good for somebody learning to braid hair for the first time.</li>
    <li> Very pleased and excited with Yolanda.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Manikin this morning around 10:00 am. She ws rapped very carefully, and neat. Iam glad to have this manikin. The shipment only took 2 DAYS!! And her hair is a tad bit longer than the picture, and she has a very nice texture and its made for natural hairstyles!!! I tried a bantu knot and put a tad bit of shea moisture on it, its in the picture..hope u enjoy Yolanda alsoo!!</li>
    <li> The was a little too straight, and too thick. But, it was okay.</li>
    <li> Its o.k.  I have practiced braiding and curling on it so far, with no problems.</li>
    <li> She actually arrived earlier than the estimated time!! When I opened the package she was beautifully wrapped in plastic, everything was where it was supposed to be. Her hair is actually the length shown above. Yes, it does have grey hairs, but I really don&#x27;t care. I curled it just for fun, and her hair actually holds the curls pretty well. I have not used it wet, nor have I straightened it yet... But so far she is perfect and I would definitely do it all over again if I had to. No regrets, she is absolutely FLAWLESS!!</li>
    <li> Hair was pretty full and right texture. Got this manikin for my daughter to practise on. She Absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> The picture is pretty accurate. I think the hair may be just a tiny bit shorter than the pic but it&#x27;s not that much off. The hair is also thicker looking in the pic but again not by much. The texture is softer than what you would think. It is similar to the feel of freshly washed and well conditioned natural hair that has been blown out. The the placement of the follicles seems more babydoll like (in rows if that makes sense) than random like real hair which can make it a little difficult to part but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. There is some shedding when first using but it stops. However, I would not suggest overmanipulation or pulling the hair tight. Overall, I liked this product and would purchase again if needed. PS Make sure when ordering you also purchase a stand if you don&#x27;t already have one. I forgot to order one and the neck is too short to hold between your legs LOL</li>
    <li> I told my Fiance that I needed a manikin to practice on and we looked at several brands and read dozens of customer reviews.After reading a lot of mixed reviews about this manikin, I decided that I still wanted to see for myself what this would be like to work with. I am so very happy that I did. It was adequately packaged, and delivered in a timely manner. When I opened it, I was very pleased to see a pretty manikin with a full head of hair. I saw reviews about an abundance of gray hairs, but I had very few in my manikin. Grays are perfectly normal to expect when purchasing a manikin with human hair or a human synthetic blends especially YAK hair. The grays don&#x27;t bother me at all as I intend to bleach and color her hair after a while. The texture of the hair is good and similar to hair types I can identify with and I am pleased that it is excellent for practicing braiding and sew-ins!I admit that her hair was a bit uneven (highs and lows) when she arrived, but I flat-ironed the hair and its more even and it falls better.I&#x27;m not bothered at all by this. Handy-dandy scissors can help for those obsessive persons who require perfectly even tresses. I have experienced minimal shedding and I can say that it is good so far.Altogether,for the price of this manikin I am certainly getting my money&#x27;s worth and I&#x27;m very, very pleased. Also its better if you get the manikin holder too, it makes styling a dream. I will update after coloring, shampooing and heat manipulation.</li>
    <li> I WANTED TO TEACH MYSELF TO BRAID, SO I STARTED LOOKING FOR MANNEQUIN HEADS. AFTER READING MANY OF THE REVIEWS ABOUT THE HAIR SHEDDING AND NOT AS LONG AS THE PICTURE, I WAS A LITTLE HESITANT. HOWEVER, FOR THE PRICE AND TYPE OF HAIR I NEEDED, I TOOK A CHANCE. YES, IT SHEDS A LOT.....BUT, I&#x27;VE NOTICED THAT AFTER COMBING AND STYLING MULTIPLE TIMES (EVERY DAY ABOUT 4 TIMES A DAY, DOING BRAID STYLES FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW SINCE I GOT IT) THE SHEDDING IS VERY MINIMAL. ALMOST LIKE IT HAS TO BE USED ENOUGH TO GET THAT SHEDDING STAGE OUT OF THE WAY. IT WILL ANNOY YOU AT FIRST,BUT IT DOES CEASE IF YOU&#x27;RE USING IT REGULARLY.  NOW, PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT GREY HAIRS.  PERSONALLY, I JUST NEEDED HAIR TO BRAID, COLOR DID NOT MATTER. MY HEAD DID HAVE MAYBE 3-5 GREY HAIRS THROUGHOUT, BUT NOT A BIG DEAL TO ME AT ALL. IT WASN&#x27;T AN ISSUE AND IF YOU REALLY HATE THEM, YOU CAN CUT THEM OUT AND IT WOULDN&#x27;T AFFECT THE HAIR. THE SKIN TONE WAS A LITTLE DARKER THAN THE PICTURE, BUT I DIDN&#x27;T CARE. IT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE HER FACE AND SKIN TONE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY INTENTIONS. IF I NEEDED A MAKE-UP DOLL AND REQUIRED LIGHTER SKIN TONES, THEN I MIGHT BE A LITTLE MAD, BUT AGAIN, MY PURPOSE WAS STRICTLY LEARNING TO BRAID AND THE HAIR WAS MY FOCUS. THE HAIR REALLY IS A GOOD MATCH TO AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR THAT&#x27;S BEEN BLOW DRIED OUT. SO, IF THAT&#x27;S THE TYPE OF HAIR YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR, IT&#x27;S PRETTY CLOSE. THAT&#x27;S REALLY ALL I CAN THINK OF AS FAR AS THIS GOES. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO SOMEONE WANTING TO LEARN HOW TO BRAID. ONCE YOU GET PASSED THE SHEDDING PHASE, IT&#x27;S A GREAT TOOL TO HAVE. NOT ONLY DID I TEACH MYSELF TO BRAID, BUT I AM NOW MOVING ON TO LEARNING TO HOW TO WEAVE. I&#x27;VE HAD THIS ITEM NOW FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD I GOT IT. THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE TOO. BASED ON OTHER REVIEWS TOO, I PURCHASED A HEAD CLAMP STAND. IT&#x27;S HANDY JUST IN CASE, BUT I HAVEN&#x27;T NEEDED IT AT ALL. I USED IT ONCE JUST TO TEST IT OUT AND FOR ME IT WAS EASIER HAVING THE MANNEQUIN HEAD BETWEEN MY LEGS. BUT, I FIGURED BETTER TO HAVE IT, THAN NOT. SO, OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT FIND. IF YOU&#x27;RE ON THE FENCE BECAUSE OF THE SHEDDING PROBLEMS, TRUST ME...IT GETS BETTER WITH USE AND IT REALLY IS A GOOD FIND FOR NOT A LOT OF MONEY!!! GOOD LUCK, I HOPE THIS HELPED SOMEONE!I FIGURED BETTER TO HAVE IT, THAN NOT. SO, OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT FIND. IF YOU&#x27;RE ON THE FENCE BECAUSE OF THE SHEDDING PROBLEMS, TRUST ME...IT GETS BETTER WITH USE AND IT REALLY IS A GOOD FIND FOR NOT A LOT OF MONEY!!! GOOD LUCK, I HOPE THIS HELPED SOMEONE!</li>
    <li> I love practicing new braid styles on her. I have had  zero problems with shedding.</li>
    <li> nice hair just for brading and u can flat iron it curl it and moreeee dbvfdhvkfdjdjvgkaDGVHBSDHV JCGDUSFKSDH&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;FNBVF&lt;br /&gt;BVDFHBVD&lt;br /&gt;VHUSDF</li>
    <li> Ok so this head comes with a thick, full set of hair and as some others have stated there are some gray strands hidden amongst the black hair. The texture of the hair is very much like 4b or 4c (very kinky coily) hair that has been blow dried to stretch it hence it looks straighter but still has that Afro texture to it. I haven&#x27;t gotten much hair falling out just a normal amount like if u combing a child&#x27;s dolly head. Am pleased so far with my purchase but if things turn sour I will update this bcuz I only used it like twice so far.</li>
    <li> The hair sheds, it is thick, and itches my skin. Do not place it on your lap. It is easy to braid and style.</li>
    <li> i like her. after reading a million reviews on different heads, i opted for yolanda because my sole purpose was to practice braiding. She is really perfect, the hair parts very nicely, the texture is coarse and i like that. the hair really does shed, it sheds like crazy to be honest. but for some reason, it doesnt affect the amount of hair on her head. shes fine. a million grains on the floor but her head is still in tact.</li>
    <li> She has etnic hair.. perfect for hair braiding/weaving. I dont think you should purchase this if your practicing flat ironing or curling hair. Her hair is thick. Not too long. &amp; shpping was fast. Only bad thing is it sheds. Not alot though</li>
    <li> This product was awesome. I didn&#x27;t know how to braid my son&#x27;s hair but thanks to Yolanda, I&#x27;m doing great.</li>
    <li> Hair is amazing for cornrowing not sure about dying or anything else. I only bought it to practice cornrowing. It gets the job done. Hair does shed a little tho</li>
    <li> This is ok, a lot of hair for braiding and corn-rows. and a lot of shedding if i may add</li>
    <li> This Manikin has a lot of hair, it very thick and very close to black hair. I have only practice doing braiding, weaving and extensions on it. I have not tried press and combing or curling yet. The one mistake I made was cutting the manikin hair with shears. I should have used a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the hair. It feels like African-American blowdried straight. its easy to work with. It has a lot of grey hair but thats ok with me. I got it to learn how to braid. I havent tried to curl yet, but I think it would be good and the curl wil hold since its not too thin or silky.</li>
    <li> I received my mannequin acouple weeks ago the hair is nice and thick alittle shedding but nothing bad</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to do hair so this is perfect for an inspiring beautician. My younger kids were a little creeped out by it lol</li>
    <li> Got this to practice braiding, good texture close to black hair, kind of like permed hair, great buy, came quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Im always braiding her hair! I LOVE YOLANDA! This is exactly what I needed! I first ordered whitney thinking the ethnic hair would be what I needed to do braids but its too good of a grade hair. I sent her back and now im in love. Im practicing sew-ins and this is perfect. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student and this manikin was purchased for my hair coloring class.  I had a fantasy hair project and I knew I wanted to include braids of some sort with my fantasy colors.  The hair took the color wonderfully and braiding this texture of hair was a breeze.  I am used to braiding curly textured hair, which holds braids wonderfully and this manikin proved itself to be very similiar to that texture.  I would not suggest this manikin for flat ironing techniques as I tried to straightening a section of the hair and it did not turn out well.  It did not fall out, but it did not straighten the hair either.  If you buy the manikin and have a problem with the number of gray strands in the hair, remember, this hair is human and can be colored with semi-permanent, permament, or demi-permanent hair color so you can color it any color you like.  Just in case you don&#x27;t know, if you want to go lighter than the current black color, you will need to lighten the hair first, then color it to your desired color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can figure out how to include a picture of my final results, I will.</li>
    <li> I love my mannequin, everything I expected. This mannequin texture of hair is great for practicing any braid styles.</li>
    <li> Yolanda&#x27;s hair texture is very good for the beginner with afro hair who needs a lot of practice. Despite being slightly different from my hair texture, i prefer it because it is very managable and does not tangle easily.  The hair length is perfect as it is about the same length as my own hair. The hair is also easy to part and does not tangle easily. it has a 4a to 4b texture. The cons are it sheds a bit, has grey hair and you will need a tripod to hold it into place but overall it is a great mannequin and I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Mannequin to get better at doing sew ins and braids. It ordered it on January 9th, and Received it on the 11th! 2 days and it was already here. This is an amazing mannequin to practice african braiding techniques and styles. I am Jamaican, but of Predominately African Decent and this hair texture was very close to mine. I will keep this for a while. The only cons is that it shed all over the floor and my bed, you can&#x27;t run a brush through it without it shedding, but I really don&#x27;t care that much. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this mannequin.(:</li>
    <li> I literally just taught myself how to braid a month ago thanks to YouTube channel and I was reading the reviews on this mannequin and decided to give it a try. First off, I ordered this head on April17th and it came in the mail April 19th using regular delivery and I don&#x27;t even have amazon prime. This shipment came fast. The doll hair feel so real. It&#x27;s like washing your own hair if you are African American and blowing your hair out yourself. There are quite a few gray hairs throughout the head but nothing that&#x27;s really a bother. The hair length you see is exactly the same. I&#x27;ve already braided the whole head up and the braids was easy to take out. The hair was still straight after taking the braids out not like real hair where it&#x27;s all wavey and crinkly. So it&#x27;s easy to start a new style again without the hassle of trying to comb out the waves. The hair does shed some. I decided to not buy the stand you really don&#x27;t need it but if you put the doll head between your legs make sure you have sweat pants or pajama pants just some kind of pants on because the hair is extremely itchy on your legs trying to hold the doll. I&#x27;ve found out the hard way. Other than that this doll is excellent for braiding. I love Yolanda HeHe! You most definitely should give this doll a try for braiding especially if your trying to learn or just learned how to braid and need more practice doing different styles of braids. Great buy for a great price!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend is very pretty, I bought her for a lot of practice styles I have no problems.</li>
    <li> I love it, the texture is very similar to coarse hair, fantastic to try hairstyles on and it was very affordable, I only wish the hair was a little longer</li>
    <li> The hair is in MUCH better shape, its soft, and doesn&#x27;t tangle. Her skin tone is darker more like chocolate. :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still practicing but I love her hair! Its like African-american hair blowed and pressed. It doesn&#x27;t frizz and its not nappy. I haven&#x27;t done anything but braid it, I don&#x27;t mind the grey hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review if she starts shedding or anything.</li>
    <li> The hair should be good but it looks shedding</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my in laws and their daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Love her!!! Great for learning how to braid African American textured hair!!!!</li>
    <li> The hair sheds a little bit, but it is okay for the price i bought it for. The manikin looks just like the picture. It is a little bit darker in person.The hair texture is amazing for those that are learning to do hair or braid. Packaging was good as well.No complaints.</li>
    <li> I received my mannequin fast. IT was just as described. It has the thickness and texture I needed to practice for my licensure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair moves and acts like human hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a very nice mannequin head</li>
    <li> I bought this Manikin for my niece and she LOVES it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good facial quality and very nice hair</li>
    <li> So worth it! Hair isn&#x27;t as long though as it says.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters to learn how to braid... the hair is really thick and better than the picture...  however, it shreds tremendously.</li>
    <li> Nice density of hair but the hair is too coarse.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves styling hair and Yolanda has become a family member. The hair texture is great for braiding. It&#x27;s thinning now but I feel that we&#x27;ve gotten our money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted, I am very satisfied that I was able to get this.this piece is very lovely.</li>
    <li> I brought this mannequin head for my 9 yr old daugther for christmas, and she loves it. I was supoose to get it after christmas but it arrived christmas eve, which was great! The hair does shed some, but its nothing major. I recommend this mannequin head for various styles ESPECIALLY braiding. But most of all, my daughter was very satisified and that makes me a satisified customer. The price was in my range and I feel it was worth every penny I spent for it.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses it every day to practice braiding &amp; sew-ins.  Durable and realistic for her.</li>
    <li> The hair is great for learning how to braid and weave. I have not noticed any shedding and would definitely recommend it for someone learning to braid.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition. Good match for ethnic relaxed or natural hair that&#x27;s blown out.</li>
    <li> This celebrity Yolanda cosmetology yak hair manikin arrived on time, was exactly as we expected it to be, looks just like the photos and works great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the texture of hair it wasn&#x27;t like human hair as explained ...its basically a barbie type head and hair  ...I bought it and it sits in the box in the garage</li>
    <li> Great head of hair to learn how to braid and do styles.  Sheds just like your weave would, its is course enough to hold a braid and is similar to my hair when it is unpermed and blow dryed so i like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to my 9 year old daughter can learn to braid on ethnic hair she loves it to pieces. It&#x27;s a lot better to learn than a regular doll here and it&#x27;s very thick and feels a lot like our African American hair she loves it</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed.  Though there is some shedding, that is normal.</li>
    <li> It is fantastic only one thing, which an over sight on my part. I need to order a stand/support which I will do.</li>
    <li> I love my Yolanda doll,,  yes she sheds a bit but it&#x27;s not overbearing and she does have a few grey hairs but I don&#x27;t mind ,  I learned how to braid which was the initial goal</li>
    <li> I purchased this doll so that I could learn how to braid my daughter&#x27;s hair and...it&#x27;s okay. It really doesn&#x27;t have a coarse texture but it is thick enough to make grabbing and braiding easy. She does shed a bit but after many months of use, I don&#x27;t see the shedding as a problem any more. The whole &amp;#34;extremely coarse&amp;#34; description, though, is extremely exaggerated.</li>
    <li> i guess its a good starter bc of the texture of the hair.  the texture kind of makes it easier to practice braiding, but its much harder on actual hair.  im ready for a new one</li>
    <li> Wonderful for braid styles and net weave application..</li>
    <li> I purchased this mannequin head because I wanted to use it to practice braiding styles on kinky textured hair.  This mannequin&#x27;s hair is NOT kinky.  She has more of a chemically-relaxed texture, albeit very frizzy.  I wanted more of a coarse texture similar to 4a/b or a looser texture with some curl to it.  I assumed because the hair was afro-textured that it was coarse.  The hair is wispy and I don&#x27;t find it firm enough for braid/cornrow extensions.  I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;jagged\\&quot; nature of the hair either.  If you&#x27;re looking for a coarse-haired mannequin, Yolanda is not it.  Furthermore, she has many grey hairs and sheds quite a bit.  Unfortunately, I missed the return window, so I&#x27;m making the best out of it.  It&#x27;s not horrible for braiding, just not what I wanted.  I think Naomi would have been closer to what I wanted:  [[ASIN:B000NJE4UA Budget Naomi Afro Manikin 20\\&quot; Brown]]</li>
    <li> As a cosmetologist and salon owner, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Yolanda enable me to master AfroAmerican styles as if I was styling on a client including braids. Excluzia Hair by Patti Mason~Miami</li>
    <li> The hair was good.  It was a good level of ethnic hair.  It was kinda short/ just at the shoulder.  But I really like it.  It will help me learn to braid.</li>
    <li> its worth the money. good for braiding and weaving. Hair is really itchy on skin so make sure you have a tripod</li>
    <li> I received in a timely manner. I really like it, it has a lot of gray hairs but that&#x27;s not a breaker. It&#x27;s excellent for practicing braids, it&#x27;s really close to African American hair. I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the hair so I washed and conditioned it. There was a lot of shedding, I hope it stops soon. I plan on doing braids and sew-ins on her. If she holds up I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This Yak Hair Manikin was disappointing. It was not as picture or stated. The length of the hair was approximately 6 inches all around.</li>
    <li> Great texture. True Ethnic hair. A lot of hair. hair is not falling out. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Ordered on a Wednesday and received on Friday with free shipping. I’m really satisfied with this manikin. It very much resembles the texture of my own hair when it’s relaxed and blown out. I haven’t noticed issues with shedding and my only gripe with the manikin is the gray hairs. I dyed the hair because I did not like the grays. My use for the manikin is to teach myself how to cornrow. Hair is very thick but no way is this hair 21 inches. All in all it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for braiding. Love it</li>
    <li> Hair is perfect for braiding! It was definately what i expected! It does shed alot but this mannequin was exactly what i needed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 10 yr old daughter who is now into hair and wants to learn how to braid. Yolanda hair texture feels like natural hair that has been blown out so it&#x27;s super easy for my daughter to grip when trying to braid. She sheds but nothing major. Perfect for learning how to braid.</li>
    <li> For the price...it was a good buy but it sheds way toooooooooooo much</li>
    <li> My 9 year old is gonna love it!</li>
    <li> I like the hair texture because it most closely resembles my own tightly coiled hair. I use the head to practice braiding and have only noticed minimal shedding. It does seem to have quite a bit of uneven patches. However, since I only use the head for practicing braiding it does not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mannequin head .</li>
    <li> the hair of dis manikin is made of good quality,so natural just like real hair,am a natural hair braiding student in a cosmetology school,dis manikin help me to learn a lot,if u want to learn how to braid,twist,dread-lock or corn-row,dis is the best manikin for u,i bought one of dis manikin and bought 2 for 2 friends,they saw mine and they so love it,if u buy dis manikin u will never regret,and the delivery was so fast.i so love it,i highly recommend dis product.tanks Amazon u are great........</li>
    <li> This hair is solely for braiding. I did try to flat iron it only to be met with shedding and some melting, not much but some. I was hoping this was pack hair yaky but it is not. Even tho it did hold a nice curl.... I will only braid her hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this mannequin; it is exactly what I was looking for.  The hair texture is perfect for practicing corn rows and other types of braided styles.  I would have given it 5 stars but it sheds like crazy.  It flat irons and curls nicely too.</li>
    <li> Great length, not the best for curling (iron)&lt;br /&gt;Sheds but is beautiful when blow dryed</li>
</ol>
