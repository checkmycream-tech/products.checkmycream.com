      <li>It holds on to your hair until you wash it out, and that makes for the best conditioning experience.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>or just want the best all around conditioner for shine and beauty?&lt;br /&gt;then</li>
      <li>It looks just as good after sleeping on it!!  </li>
      <li>It curls perfectly on the ends, and stays curled.  </li>
      <li>my curls are coming out perfect!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect.  </li>
      <li>This is the best conditioner I have ever tried!  </li>
      <li>smells great!</li>
      <li>really great for curly frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells great and it hydrates well.</li>
      <li>Love this product great on frizzy and curly hair</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d like to be able to use them!</li>
      <li>I am madly in love with this conditioner!</li>
      <li>I have never written a review before, but this product is so amazing I had to share my experience with it.  </li>
      <li>I have never used anything that made my hair look so nice...</li>
      <li>the product odor is actually not bad, nothing great</li>
      <li>Ouida Climate control conditioner is actually the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, leaves your hair with a great volume balance, and a beautiful natural shine.</li>
      <li>It took about 4 washes to get the right technique for my hair, and the results are remarkable.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>But, even on the foggiest of days, this works better for me than anything else ever has.</li>
      <li>Maybe a squeeze tube shape would be better?</li>
      <li>I love the gel.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love all Quidad products.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes, the miracle of all miracles happens, and my hair even looks good the next day!  </li>
      <li>and it honestly was barely wavy and still frizzy.</li>
      <li>works great for tight kinky curly hair.</li>
      <li>great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>Everyone has their own opinion and their personal favorites.  </li>
      <li>, right?  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with curly or wavy hair, even baby fine... and give it a few tries and figure out what the best method for your hair is.</li>
      <li>My hair is baby fine, thinning, has natural waves, and is about 4\\&quot; below my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>What I love about this line is that not only does it work miracles, but it doesn&#x27;t drip!</li>
      <li>and this keeps it so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it should be noted that I live in San Francisco where the fog reigns supreme, and sometimes the weather wins.  </li>
      <li>you really you need this!&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
      <li>She has very curly hair.</li>
      <li>Ouidad does has a leave in conditioner, but using the climate control conditioner as a leave in works better for me than their other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible as the other reviewer posted.</li>
      <li>Never in my life did I think I&#x27;d wake up with decent looking hair unless I&#x27;d had it blown straight,</li>
      <li>Made my normally Curley hair very frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and stays on your hands and hair without dropping off like so many other conditioners do!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and I&#x27;m still not quite sure how I feel about it.</li>
      <li>My hair ends up soft with defined waves and curls and I have more good hair days than bad ones when I follow this routine.  </li>
      <li>I have to be careful not to use too much because it can my make hair look dull when I do, but actually I&#x27;m happy to use less since this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>After washing my hair, I condition the lower half of my hair with Pantene Aqua Light conditioner, then I use Bumble and Bumble \\&quot;Prep\\&quot;..</li>
      <li>And let me tell you about my hair - wavy on top, tight curls underneath, coarse, and always, always frizzy.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner helped my hair considerably.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>Overall though, the actually product is worth it.</li>
      <li>I normally buy this from a local retailer, but they quit carrying it.</li>
      <li>I put about a nickel sized amount, sometimes a little more in my hair while in the shower and then comb it through with a wide tooth comb.  </li>
      <li>I have very frizzy and dry hair</li>
      <li>While it may seem expensive, you never have to use more than a tiny amount -- and it really works!</li>
      <li>Generally, there&#x27;s a little bit of frizz (more in my eyes than to others), so I was looking for something a little heavier to mix in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure this product was worth the $15 yet.</li>

<li> I have long, thick hair, and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in frizz in my 2b wavy hair after using a bottle of this conditioner.</li>
<li> same as any other conditioner...</li>
<li> and I blow dry.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Out of the shower, I use about a quarter size of one of their gels and let my hair air dry.</li>
<li> Any volumizers made it look like hay, and there was an area that always looked dry and frizzy, wouldn&#x27;t curl at all.  </li>
<li> I apply a small amount of Ouidad&#x27;s \\&quot;Clear</li>
<li> I have naturally curly 3C hair, and I usually just leave some Herbal Essence Moisturizing conditioner in</li>
<li> After carefully watching the \\&quot;how to\\&quot; video on Ouidad&#x27;s website, I gave it a go.  </li>
<li> My hair shows off its natural waves, is fluffy and stays fluffy,</li>
<li> After putting rollers along the bottom every night or morning, it would be flat and not hold any curl after a few hours...</li>
<li> We lost our power for eight days and had no hot water.</li>
<li> Every now and then, I decide to try some other line of hair products for my thick, wavy, frizzy salt and pepper hair, but I always come back to Ouidad.  </li>
<li> Usually in the morning, I wet my fingers and fluff from the roots out, but thats all.  </li>
<li> The only explanation I&#x27;ve ever come up with as to how I was cursed with this hair is that I must have killed someone in a past life and this is my karmic payback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Climate Control Conditioner.</li>
<li> Moisturizers weighed it down and made it look oily.  </li>
<li> Or a bottle that can stand upside down?</li>
<li> I have been using this for about 2 months, and no build up or weighing down whatever.  </li>
<li> the Botanical Boost weighed my hair down slightly.  </li>
<li> I just use a little bit with the herbal essence and I leave them in and blow-dry my hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a total game change for my hair.  </li>
<li> heavy or greasy.</li>
<li> Rather a heavy product.</li>
<li> Sounds pretty bad</li>
<li> The bottle shape is not one that can be stood upside down, so I often have to tip it and bang the bottle on a shelf in the shower to get the thick conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
<li> And no more rollers.  </li>
<li> no static</li>
<li> I like and use several Ouidad products, however the smell of the new climate control shampoo and conditioner are just awful - please change the scent of these</li>
<li> Nothing could make it look any worse.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the formula is so thick that it is often difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
<li> I had a terrible allergic reaction to the fragrance.  </li>

    <li> This conditioner smells great and it hydrates well. Unfortunately, the formula is so thick that it is often difficult to get out of the bottle. The bottle shape is not one that can be stood upside down, so I often have to tip it and bang the bottle on a shelf in the shower to get the thick conditioner out of the bottle. Maybe a squeeze tube shape would be better? Or a bottle that can stand upside down? Overall though, the actually product is worth it.</li>
    <li> Ouida Climate control conditioner is actually the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, leaves your hair with a great volume balance, and a beautiful natural shine. the product odor is actually not bad, nothing great but it&#x27;s not terrible as the other reviewer posted.</li>
    <li> I love all Quidad products.  I normally buy this from a local retailer, but they quit carrying it.</li>
    <li> I find that Trader Joe&#x27;s $3 salon conditioner does just as well as this.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try on my curly hair which tends to get knotty. It did not detangle at all and I don&#x27;t feel it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and I&#x27;m still not quite sure how I feel about it. Still notice some frizz after use. I&#x27;m not sure this product was worth the $15 yet.</li>
    <li> I like and use several Ouidad products, however the smell of the new climate control shampoo and conditioner are just awful - please change the scent of these, I&#x27;d like to be able to use them!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this conditioner.  I have naturally curly 3C hair, and I usually just leave some Herbal Essence Moisturizing conditioner in and I blow dry.  Generally, there&#x27;s a little bit of frizz (more in my eyes than to others), so I was looking for something a little heavier to mix in.  This stuff is perfect.  I just use a little bit with the herbal essence and I leave them in and blow-dry my hair.  my curls are coming out perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Made my normally Curley hair very frizzy.  I&#x27;m a product junkie but this has made curbed my addiction and sent me back to B&amp;B for Curley Hair.</li>
    <li> do you swim? color your hair? or just want the best all around conditioner for shine and beauty?&lt;br /&gt;then you really you need this!&lt;br /&gt;never heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> We lost our power for eight days and had no hot water. We drove to my sister-in-law&#x27;s house to shower since she had power. I used her shampoo and the conditioner! Wow! She has very curly hair. I don&#x27;t, but with age, my hair tends to frizz with the slightest humidity. This shampoo and conditioner helped my hair considerably.</li>
    <li> I am madly in love with this conditioner! It&#x27;s a total game change for my hair.  And let me tell you about my hair - wavy on top, tight curls underneath, coarse, and always, always frizzy.  The only explanation I&#x27;ve ever come up with as to how I was cursed with this hair is that I must have killed someone in a past life and this is my karmic payback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Climate Control Conditioner. I put about a nickel sized amount, sometimes a little more in my hair while in the shower and then comb it through with a wide tooth comb.  I do not rinse it out.  I have to be careful not to use too much because it can my make hair look dull when I do, but actually I&#x27;m happy to use less since this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.  Ouidad does has a leave in conditioner, but using the climate control conditioner as a leave in works better for me than their other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the shower, I use about a quarter size of one of their gels and let my hair air dry.

But, even on the foggiest of days, this works better for me than anything else ever has.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this shampoo and conditioner.  I love the gel.  I had a terrible allergic reaction to the fragrance.  It smelled \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot;.  It is going back.  Everyone has their own opinion and their personal favorites.  This just isn&#x27;t one of mine.</li>
    <li> Rather a heavy product. Using it took curl out. Would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Every now and then, I decide to try some other line of hair products for my thick, wavy, frizzy salt and pepper hair, but I always come back to Ouidad.  While it may seem expensive, you never have to use more than a tiny amount -- and it really works!</li>
    <li> really great for curly frizzy hair. not the cure all still looking for that product</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever tried!  I have very frizzy and dry hair and this keeps it so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product great on frizzy and curly hair</li>
    <li> I love the smell but it did not work well on my hair.  I have naturally curly hair and it honestly was barely wavy and still frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair, and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in frizz in my 2b wavy hair after using a bottle of this conditioner.</li>
    <li> What I love about this line is that not only does it work miracles, but it doesn&#x27;t drip! It&#x27;s creamy and stays on your hands and hair without dropping off like so many other conditioners do! It holds on to your hair until you wash it out, and that makes for the best conditioning experience.&lt;br /&gt;This smells great! Like you are getting your hair done at the salon!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but this product is so amazing I had to share my experience with it.  My hair is baby fine, thinning, has natural waves, and is about 4\\&quot; below my shoulders.  For some time, no matter what product I used, from the most expensive to the cheapest, it would be flat and dry looking. Moisturizers weighed it down and made it look oily.  After putting rollers along the bottom every night or morning, it would be flat and not hold any curl after a few hours... and the ends would be stringy, even the day after I washed it.  Any volumizers made it look like hay, and there was an area that always looked dry and frizzy, wouldn&#x27;t curl at all.  Sounds pretty bad, right?  I read about this product, and decided to try it.  Nothing could make it look any worse.  After carefully watching the \\&quot;how to\\&quot; video on Ouidad&#x27;s website, I gave it a go.  It took about 4 washes to get the right technique for my hair, and the results are remarkable.  My hair shows off its natural waves, is fluffy and stays fluffy, no static whatever, no frizz!! And no more rollers.  It curls perfectly on the ends, and stays curled.  It looks just as good after sleeping on it!!  Usually in the morning, I wet my fingers and fluff from the roots out, but thats all.  I have also noticed when I comb it, the comb \\&quot;glides\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; through my hair.  After washing my hair, I condition the lower half of my hair with Pantene Aqua Light conditioner, then I use Bumble and Bumble \\&quot;Prep\\&quot;.. the Botanical Boost weighed my hair down slightly.  Then I apply this product about 1/2 way up my hair when sopping wet, then when dry,(so far I have only air-dried) I apply a small amount of Ouidad&#x27;s \\&quot;Clear Control\\&quot; pomade about 1/2 way up my hair.  I have been using this for about 2 months, and no build up or weighing down whatever.  A seller on ebay sells it for just over $14.00... quite a bargain.  I have never used anything that made my hair look so nice... and I&#x27;m not young. I have even gotten COMPLIMENTS!!  I would recommend this product to anyone with curly or wavy hair, even baby fine... and give it a few tries and figure out what the best method for your hair is. This product deserves 10 stars!!</li>
    <li> same as any other conditioner...</li>
    <li> works great for tight kinky curly hair. does not cause drying out or breakage. great for everyday use. I recommend Ouidad for everyone with curly hair.</li>
