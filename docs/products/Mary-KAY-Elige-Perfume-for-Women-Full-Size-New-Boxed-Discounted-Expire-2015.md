    <li> My wife has used this perfume for most of the 35 years we have been married.  She loves it and can&#x27;t bring herself to change to &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; perfumes.  I&#x27;m so thankful that I can still buy it for her through Amazon  and &amp;#34;Jubujub&amp;#34;!  Will keep ordering as long as she wants it and I can get it!  Thank You. Packaged very well and arrived withing 2 day window.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for years and its my favorite EVER!! I will always buy it as long as it&#x27;s available. Mary Kay should never have discontinued it!

    <li> This is my signature fragrance.  So thrilled I found it on Amazon, Mary Kay should have never discontinued this fragrance. I receive more compliments with Elige than any other fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found this perfume here,  I love it and whenever I use it I get tons of compliment.  I hated when Mary Kay told me it was discontinue, I don&#x27;t know why.... But I am glad to have found it here....</li>
    <li> My mother loves this stuff.  Unfortunately, they no longer make it!  I searched all over and am SO GLAD to have found it on Amazon.com (thanks guys!).  I purchased it for Christmas.  I think she&#x27;ll be surprised.  It smells really good on her.  (Hope she&#x27;s not reading this.  lol)</li>
    <li> I ordered Elige perfume because I received a lot of compliments when I wore Elige&lt;br /&gt;I hope Mary Kay will have this perfume after 2015</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase.  It arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this perfume to anyone…Wish it would come in a powder.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it wouldn&#x27;t be as much as it is.</li>
    <li> So glad I can still get this!!  It&#x27;s the real deal. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and it makes a great Christmas gift when I can save the day and get it!</li>

    <li> I love the sent of this perfume.  I am only sorry that it is discontinued from Mary Kay company.</li>
    <li> This perfume is watered down and does not smell like the real Elige.  I still have the body shower gel and the perfume doesn&#x27;t come close.  What little smell it has lasts about 5 minutes.  This was a terrible experience and I will not buy from this site again.</li>
