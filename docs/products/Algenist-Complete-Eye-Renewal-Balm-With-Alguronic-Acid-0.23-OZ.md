    <li> Creamy and moisturing.</li>
    <li> So far it isn&#x27;t bad.  It is helping some but not as fast as I had hoped for.  It is worth the money if you aren&#x27;t looking for instant results.  I did notice that it does decrease puffiness with just a couple of days of use though.  Not sure on long term results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! Glad I found the eye cream to use . Good line of products</li>
    <li> Teeny tiny jar but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m liking it so far-doesn&#x27;t burn my eyelids like one I had been using. Can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference but let&#x27;s give it some time.</li>
    <li> I use the full sized pot at home and bought this smaller one specifically for travel. It holds enough for a two to three week trip (for me), even using it twice daily. Also, this pot is plastic, so it weighs less than the larger (glass?) pot.</li>
    <li> I was sincerely hoping this cream would work.  Unfortunately, my eyes teared and underneath my eyes, the skin puffed out.</li>
    <li> I love it.. Only have used it for a few days but it looks like I would buy it again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. I was using Clinique but wanted a change. This works very well,,, moisturizing but not greasy. does not irritate my underye skin.  And I do think my wrinkles are improved-- i have been using it for a few months...small jar but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very cooling makes my eyes feel great.</li>
    <li> Algenist&#x27;s Complete Eye Renewal Balm really works.  It really does.  It is part of my daily skin care.  The .23 oz size is perfect for travel.  It fits easily into my TSA - approved liquid carry on bag.  It does not leak or expand with air travel.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a plastic baggie and completely unsealed. All the contents had sloshed to one side of the jar, and the jar looked like it had been opened.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but felt sad paying this much for a sample</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is dactyl what I needed.</li>
    <li> works on my fine lines!  love it.  not greasy and no smell/odor.  I will be ordering bigger size next time.</li>
    <li> I tried a smaller sample size and love it.  Next I will order the larger one.</li>
    <li> Algenist Complete Eye Renewal Balm works great on my eyes. I don&#x27;t have any dark circles or swollen areas around the eyes. I would recommend all Algenist products.</li>
    <li> great for sensitive eyes great moisterizer</li>
    <li> I like this product seams to do the job.</li>
    <li> One of my friends loves this eye cream and so I bought it.  It&#x27;s been great, and the crew that sent it to me gave great service and a nice note to boot!</li>
