      <li>great for over the facial mask I also purchased!!!!!</li>

      <li>This mask conforms to my face almost perfectly when I pull it into shape to meet my hairline and chin, with just slight gapping above the ears.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This bottle did not come with the dropper.</li>
    <li> This is fun to put on and scare your husband with. You look like one of the engineers from Prometheus or a Cathedral Ward Guard in Bloodborne. Besides that it works great to exacerbate the effectiveness of any creams or masks you put underneath. Great buy, now I don&#x27;t need a costume this year for Halloween!</li>
    <li> This is great it.  It holds a mask in place on your face so you can move around and do other things without worrying about the mask coming loose and falling off.</li>
    <li> Very helpfull to keep moisture from single use masks..but kind of small, had to add rubber band around back of my head</li>
    <li> Use this over your sheet mask of choice and it&#x27;ll allow you to walk around and complete any chores or tasks while getting a facial! It&#x27;s a great invention and I use this regularly. While it&#x27;s nice to relax and use a sheet mask, sometimes I don&#x27;t have 20-30 minutes to lay about. This Mask cover allows you to go on with your life. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps the face moist, easy to use.</li>
    <li> If you are a constant user of sheet masks, this product is a must have. Many sheet masks fit each face differently, and though most fit my face, some are too big, or slip right off if I do not lay down while I wear them. The Daiso mask cover allows me to wear any sheet mask I want, and carry on about my business while wearing it. I no longer have to time out of my day just because my mask may fall off. It also does a great job of preventing evaporation!</li>
    <li> The mask cover is clearly designed for someone with a palm size face. Nice material (silicon) , thin and easy to wash, but provides no flexibility. Hard to breath due to the the size, inflexibility and the material. It took weeks to arrive, but it was nicely packed. For the price, impracticality and the long wait, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Finally, a Daiso Japan product that actually worked!</li>
    <li> An awesome addition to the paper face masks allowing them to stay moist a bit longer and to move around while wearing them (the real bonus here if you ask me).</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because it is as described and as pictured.  I trimmed the max to make it larger and more comfortable.  It is not comfortable enough to wear all night.  It is intended to be worn for short times.  I ordered and extra on eBay for $2.38 but it will take a month to get to the US.  It is thick enough so that it will hold up for quite some tie.</li>
    <li> If you use sheet masks, you need this. Typically, a sheet mask dries out in about 20 minutes; for those who want to squeeze out a little bit more from their routine, this is a nice tool to have.  It&#x27;s a soft plastic that&#x27;s easy to trim according to your face shape; do take some caution though, as it could possibly rip once stretched out over the face.  It&#x27;s easy to wash and quick-drying too!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the cotton facial masks and it works well to keep them in place.  I have a small face, so small that I can only wear certain brands of eye glasses, this mask is a very tight fit around the eyes.  As I&#x27;ve worn it more it has stretched out, but be warned that if you have an average size face its going to be a very tight fit.</li>
    <li> Smaller than anticipated and my face isn&#x27;t big.  Probably used a small Asian model for this pattern.  Now if I could get a woman size larger would be happy.</li>
    <li> Sure, you&#x27;ll look sort of like Hannibal Lector while wearing this along with your face mask, but it allows you to go about normal tasks without your mask falling straight off of your face. Multi-tasking while moisturizing. Daiso has it covered. Buy it from Amazon if, like me, you live nowhere near a wonderful Daiso Japan store.</li>
    <li> shape and size didn&#x27;t quite fit as well as I would have liked - a bit on the small side and only covers half of my forehead.  But wonderful to keep a sheet mask hydrated for a long time.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  I put s sheet mask on and then this over it.  I felt snug but not too tight.  It felt like it was pressing and holding the sheet mask in place.  Yes it was a little tight around the ears but not uncomfortable.  Wore it for 30 mins and I think it helps push the essences from the sheet mask into my face.  Took it off and the sheet mask was still moist that I wiped my neck, legs and arms with it.  This fit up under my chin and just felt great.</li>
    <li> product is good for my skin</li>
    <li> great for over the facial mask I also purchased!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like that it holds a sheet mask on so I can do stuff, but it rides up and gets in my eyes. Since it&#x27;s sliding up a mask covered in solution, it sort of squeegees whatever is on the sheet mask into my eyes if I&#x27;m not paying attention.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have if you&#x27;re into sheet masks. Keeps all the masks from drying too quickly and keeps them in place. It is made of silicon and it is easy to clean and re-use.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful addition to any AB skincare routine. They are meant to be worn over sheet masks to keep them moist longer. It easily doubles the amount of time the mask stays wet.</li>
    <li> Even though the mask cover does not fit well, it is an EXCELLENT buy! It is very useful in preventing any drips and messes. Usually I will have to lie down for 30-40 mins while I have a chunky mask on my face, like homemade mung bean/honey mask or a pineapple/peach mask. BUT now I can wear this cover on top and continue to do whatever I was doing!! The material is super soft and easy to clean. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! If you are someone like me who loves using face masks at home - BUY IT. You wont regret.</li>
    <li> Fits so well.  I am slightly worried my facial skin is suffocating</li>
    <li> very good. I put lotion mask on my face and this is good at securing it on my face while I move around. love it so much. very useful.</li>
    <li> First time using it tonight and I like it but it&#x27;s just too small . I don&#x27;t think this will fit anyone&#x27;s face to be completely honest . Especially not the face of a man. But it&#x27;s still worth the buy for the price . I&#x27;ll use it every night I just wish it was larger</li>
    <li> It works for what it&#x27;s used for, but I find it uncomfortably tight and seems to press into my eyeballs. Probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for people with a high browbone or nose bridge.</li>
    <li> Very good and it fits my face perfectly.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Highly effective.  Somewhat uncomfortable because it&#x27;s a bit small for my face, but once the mask is on for a minute the ear loops can be removed.  Highly recommended for lotion masks.</li>
    <li> This is a totally weird invention and makes the sheet-mask wearer look even more like a serial killer, but you have to admit it gets the job done: my mask underneath stays firmly stuck to my face and doesn&#x27;t dry out too quickly. I feel ridiculous wearing it, but sacrifices must be made.</li>
    <li> For smaller face, its a little tight for me.</li>
    <li> I used it almost every day! Very convenient and helpful! Love it. Thanks a lot! :)</li>
    <li> Love this. I had my sheet mask on for 30 minutes and when I removed this, the sheet was still moist!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover every inch of your face, but it covers most.  The part covers the skin between my nose and mouth is really think so the mask dries early.</li>
    <li> Very nice and cheap! Can help the paper mask stay on the face.</li>
    <li> Was expecting it to be a bit thicker, it too thin but it&#x27;s good for the price and could be use for facial treatment.</li>
    <li> It DOES keep the mask/moisture much longer. Love it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it is a little tight, so it pressed the area under one of my eyes like wrinkled. And I don&#x27;t think I have big face:).</li>
    <li> I love this strange but effective mask cover/holder.  It holds the sheet masks to your face and they don&#x27;t dry out so the serum has time to penetrate.  Very stretchy, fits well.</li>
    <li> Love this mask... Genius invention. Great quality for price. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> If you use cloth masks you will love this one. it will keep your mask from drying and make it easy to move and do things while taking care of your skin.</li>
    <li> Good ideal, keeps my mask on will doing other things.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I am able to walk around and do things with this mask on. Isn&#x27;t too inhibiting.</li>
    <li> Love it keeps face products on longer , I put vitamin serum n argan oil on every night n morning n most of the time I use at night for 4 hrs to Continue the benefits of Mt skin care regimen as far as serums oils moisturizer ect. Even the tiny wrinkle I had between my brow is fading :) so far so good</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person who always finds their sheet masks falling off, this is for you.  While this seems a bit weird, its very comfortable and useful.  Now you can treat your face without the hassle of worrying about your mask dripping, evaporating, or falling off.</li>
    <li> This is a popular item these days that I gave it a go. It really keeps it in place so I can move around without worrying about it falling off. I think you might be able to find cheaper though!</li>
    <li> Does what it says! Keeps sheet masks on extremely well.</li>
    <li> somewhat disappointing because this was too small for my face. the product in itself is really nice and works well&lt;br /&gt;AND is a great help keeping your skin masks on and not letting it drip everywhere or fall off, etc. but sincer asian people have smaller heads and faces than western people usually, then it leads to problems. this fits perfectly and stays in place when there is no wet mask underneath. But as soon as you put it over with a wet facial pack or mask, the silicone is pulling too much for my face size so it starts slipping everywhere and covering my eyes if i barely move. or the chin part comes up suddenly. i think that would be a negative for anyone that uses it with face masks.... the way it slides everywhere and becomes so slippery. but i think it&#x27;s worse when your face is bigger than average for an asian or westerner</li>
    <li> I love the idea, but the thing just doesn&#x27;t fit. My ears hurt a lot when I have it on due to the very tight hooks. Plus, the actual sheet mask that I&#x27;m wearing keeps sliding off because the mask cover is too tight that it drags the sheet down. I have an average-size face, no where near a big face for this to not work on me.</li>
    <li> Great when you want to stay active during facial. Makes it easier to do my facials more often rather than having to put them off because things need to get done!</li>
    <li> i love it and its funny to wear but does work for making your skin glow and feel plump</li>
    <li> you must need it! Worth the money  makes the mask absorb more and more!</li>
    <li> My wife is very satisfied with the facial masks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more molded than it looks (the chin is a good cup shape that actually fits over a chin) and is thick enough that it won&#x27;t easily tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably does what it says on the tin, but this mask is much too small for my face. If I put the ear loops on, the mask stretches and compresses my face super-flat and pulls my ears forward. It&#x27;s not comfortable at all and not really usable for me. The ear loops seem to be &amp;#34;customizable&amp;#34; as you can cut out small sections of them to make the loops bigger, but I don&#x27;t think that would solve my problem at all--the mask is just not wide enough to wrap around my face.</li>
    <li> I like the product but you tend to get warm under mask and begin to sweat...I use mine with the collagen infused face mask to seal in the moisture.  I placed the mask in the fridge thinking it would help but it doesn&#x27;t.  No way you could sleep in this unless warmth doesn&#x27;t bother you.</li>
    <li> The concept is great.  If you use sheet masks, and knows that it can fall off your face, or dry out quickly and something like this would be really helpful.  The problem with this is that it&#x27;s design for &#x27;dainty&#x27; faces.  I don&#x27;t have a big face or big nose, and I have trouble with the loops that go over the ears.  It&#x27;s way too tight, and the loops are so thin, I fear it may break.  The mask itself can be slightly bigger as well so its the same size as the etude sheet mask.  After a while, it hurts my ears. I end up taking the loops off and just use the mask to prevent the sheet mask from drying out.</li>
    <li> Love this does the job! Great price for prone shipping.</li>
    <li> Way too tight and hurts behind the ears. I have to gently stretch the ear flaps so they wouldn&#x27;t hurt. The whole process too about 45 min</li>
    <li> Although I definitely look like a serial killer while wearing it, it does a great job of holding on poor-fitting sheet masks, or keeping masks moist for longer. I will say it pulls a bit behind the ears - it would not be comfortable, for me, to wear it for more than about 45 minutes, and even then I&#x27;m usually a bit sore.  It also is not a perfect fit for my face - a little small around the jawline (more for a heart-shaped face).  But it definitely does the trick, and I have bought a couple as gifts for friends who are learning the wonders of sheet masks. :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Pretty comfortable &amp; fits well. Came on time, good price. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Silicon mask is a genius idea! I use it on top of my other masks (sheet mask, cream mask, mud mask) during bath and I noticed a significant difference in the efficiency of absorbing product.</li>
    <li> This mask looks freaky- but I have dry skin &amp; I use this to infuse my moisturizer into my face. Works great &amp; helps dewrinkle!</li>
    <li> This works, but it&#x27;s too small.  First let me say that I am not a large person. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2, Asian, and around 110 lbs, and I don&#x27;t have a giant head.  This mask fits lengthwise fine with room to spare, it&#x27;s the width that is too narrow.  There is approximately 2 inches or more on each side that it doesn&#x27;t cover and since it is narrow, the ear loops are also tight.  I tried wearing it as it is, but it would cause the back of my ears to hurt because of the pressure on it.  If it was wider, I would give it 5 stars.  In order to make it work without hurting my ears, I just looped hair elastic bands through the ear loops to extend it and loop the hair bands over my ears.  If you want to try this, all you have to do is get the hair elastic band and place it underneath the loop and take one end of the hair band, feed it over the loop and under/through the other end of the hair band, pull it tight and now you have an extended loop with the hairband that you place over your ear.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I bought one for my niece also!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any lotions or product under it yet.  I&#x27;ve only just tried it on for size twice, so I can&#x27;t speak for its durability.  I&#x27;m an American of European descent (Irish, Scotch, German and English) and I&#x27;ve got an oval face, hairline neither high nor low.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 9&amp;#34;, if height has anything to do with face size.  At any rate, I&#x27;m not a petite Asian.  This mask conforms to my face almost perfectly when I pull it into shape to meet my hairline and chin, with just slight gapping above the ears.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I did not have to add loops to hook them over my ears.  My only regret is that this company does not make (or if they do, I haven&#x27;t found it) some kind of chin strap that hooks onto the ears to complement this face mask because my biggest concern as I age is the skin along my jaw.</li>
    <li> This sheet mask cover is life changing. I can move around instead of just sitting down while I have a sheet mask on my face and the mask stays moist to continue hydrating my face. It is a great product, but I gave it 4 stars because it fit a bit awkward. I had to use scissors to cut it to fit a bit better, but no biggie, it still works great!</li>
    <li> Good quality but a little tight after I put on my face. By the way, my face is not that big.</li>
    <li> I really like this!  It helps keep my sheet mask in place, they always tend to slip in me.  The only thing keeping it from a 5th star is that it tends to get uncomfortable around my ears.</li>
    <li> I love it. my paper masks work better with it!</li>
    <li> I use this mask twice a week over my tissue masks and serums for 20 mins.  ..... I love this mask .I bought 4 more for my friends to try and they love it to :)</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose, it keeps the moist of the sheet mask from drying out too fast. I like it, I used it every time I put on a sheet mask and it is easy to wash.</li>
    <li> Great experience. Acceptable delivery time line.</li>
    <li> Does what I wanted it to do and if anyone found it in my house they&#x27;d think I was a serial killer. Two birds, right?</li>
    <li> If you are doing the Japanese lotion mask with cotton cloth this helps keep the cotton in place. I have wide cheekbones so it is a bit tight around the eyes of I do not place this perfectly on my face. Very durable and works great!</li>
    <li> Love this for helping the paper mask to not dry out to quickly.</li>
    <li> ......mine had a little tear in the left ear side. I am afraid it wont last long. VERY THIN</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could have something to cover all my diy face masks  with [[ASIN:B00260T94K Selena Multi-layer Cotton Puffs - 80 sheets]] and it works amazing O.O&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a silicone mask and it fits really good :D and more importantly keeps all the face mask stuff from getting into everything and keeps moisture in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good and durable face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to keep my sheet mask in place while I&#x27;m on the move and about in my house! Nice and snug and secure and I&#x27;ve seen an increase in my skin since having one! Love it!</li>
