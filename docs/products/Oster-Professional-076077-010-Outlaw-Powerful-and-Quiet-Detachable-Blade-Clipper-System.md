    <li> Was delivered on time n works perfectly on my husbands sensitive skin! Great brand for the price n was delivered undamaged. Thank you!:)</li>
    <li> They work well and are quite but they don&#x27;t have a fan so the blades get hot to the touch, which I&#x27;m not a fan of at all!</li>
    <li> I had a pair of the Andis Mvp and I had to keep replacing the cord on them. So I bought these and I love the they run smooth and fast I am a barber and they don&#x27;t get hot and the fit in ur hand pretty good. the don&#x27;t have that loud fan like the 76&#x27;s do. u will not be unhappy if u buy these and its a great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with them I&#x27;m not a barber but I do cut a lot of men and kids cuts on a daily</li>
    <li> Good luck finding replacement parts for Oster outlaw clipper!!!</li>
    <li> Love them they are so quiet. But my blades do heat up faster, good thing I have extra blades. Worth the money though.</li>
    <li> Great but they still get really hot after 10 min</li>
    <li> There so much lighter and u get better results out of them I think is made a wise choice getting these</li>
    <li> I used these clippers  about a little over a year. The osters worked great the problem for me is the cord split and there not replaceable. I found out the cord is not made  in the USA , I work In a busy salon and we do lots of fades, later on I founded out my co-worker after I bought them had the same problem with the cord. The clippers are lightweight and this is what I was looking for, the price is reasonable .</li>
    <li> The clippers is very quiet, fast and strong. But the blade becomes hot fairly quickly. While cutting. Also it is not ergonomical.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper for a professional barber.  Best price anywhere. Quick shipping.</li>
