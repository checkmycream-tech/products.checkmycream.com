<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These bottles are so pretty! They are made of a blue glass. To me, it looks like a sea glass. They come with the roller ball inserts. The inserts fit perfectly into the bottles so there is no leakage. The ball is secured tightly in the insert so that there is no chance of it falling out. It also comes with lids. The lids aren’t the best, mine are a bit scratched up. But, they screw on tight to the bottle. I would definitely recommend these for someone who is interested in making their own perfume or mixing essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Loved finding roller bottles with metal ball rollers for my EO blends. Just what we needed! Plus they&#x27;re pretty. ;)</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE METAL ROLLER BALLS!</li>
    <li> Received these yesterday and they are perfect for what I want.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles I bought them for my essential oils. This is my first time using my oils and I am so happy I got bottles that work perfect. I have the prime shipping so they came very fast. The roller balls roll extremely easy. The bottles came without any flaws. I will definitely order them again.</li>
    <li> Great for mixing oils.</li>
    <li> WHEN I received my order of roller bottles one of the six was broken,I decided to keep the five because I needed them in a hurry.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC set of blue glass roller ball bottles! I LOVE this type of bottle. I like making my own natural perfumes from essential oils, so these are super handy for it. I have several in smaller sizes, but was immediately drawn to these for the cobalt blue shade and large size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look of the blue glass is stunning! They&#x27;re a lovely deep frosted cobalt blue that is gorgeous to display.. The tops are easy to attach and detach, making for easy filling and refilling. The stainless steel roller balls roll very smoothly making for easy worry-free application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large 10ml size is perfect for mixing a nice batch of my favorite scents, and are large enough to even label! The black plastic tops screw on tightly and easily with no worries of leaks. I love the feel of them even. The frosted texture feels nice in my hand, and adds to the general pleasure of using them! These will be saving me a ton on perfume! Highly recommend checking these out. Very pleased. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m use them daily. Very handy &amp; work great</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> great roller bottles and I love the blue!  Made my 17 year old a blend today and she is loving it!</li>
    <li> One bottle is broken as they are packed all together in one bubble bag nothing separating the bottles.  Not going to return order for one broken bottle but  still not happy.  Will see how they wear with oils in them and how the rollers work.</li>
    <li> These are really nice!  Good price.  I&#x27;m buying another set!</li>
    <li> These little bottles are great.  Perfect for essential oils.  I really like the stainless steel roller balls.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to make an essential oil concoction once these came in the mail. I&#x27;ve ordered before from a different retailer, same style roller bottle, and they were great! Price was a little steep so I chose these for a second batch. Upon arrival, I noticed they were dirty on the inside and not very well packaged (all the pieces were loose in a big bubble wrap bag). I gave them a wash in warm soapy water and upon drying I notice that these aren&#x27;t in fact &amp;#34;frosted blue glass&amp;#34;. They are painted blue and I&#x27;m pretty upset about it. They&#x27;ve done a great job to trick you into thinking they&#x27;re frosted blue glass because it&#x27;s a matte finish. Be careful which you choose. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone</li>
    <li> These are high quality rollers - no leaking and pretty, too!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Others have had problems with OTHER (different CO) roller balls, but not with these.  Graet product, and based on other Essential users, a very good price too!  Just wish a smaller size was available, no worries.</li>
    <li> One of the rollers doesn&#x27;t roll smoothly.</li>
    <li> Enjoy mixing roll on mixtures in these....</li>
    <li> Easy to fill and they don&#x27;t leak.  These work for me.</li>
    <li> These leak of you don&#x27;t screw the cap on extremely tight. Don&#x27;t even think about not using the roller on these, because it will leak everywhere!</li>
    <li> Work great! Metal balls make for a smooth, generous application  (vs plastic )</li>
    <li> Love these bottles with the metal roller ball.</li>
    <li> Love the frosted glass! Makes beautiful gifts! The only thing I&#x27;m disappointed about is that the plastic caps are all scratched up. In the bag the bottles, roller ball caps, and plastic lids, are all together. So the plastic lids are scratched up. So that&#x27;s why I took away one star. The other thing, and I know that since the lid is plastic it makes it difficult to get the lid twisted on straight. I typically have them a little crooked. So I&#x27;m not sure I would keep this away way but upright. Other than that, they are super nice. Perfect for different essential oil blends! The lids just kind of sucks... (See picture of slightly crooked lid, and it scratched, for reference). I&#x27;d still buy these again, the frosted glass is really pretty.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Arrived quickly and are excellent for my wives essential oils! Will be ordering more in the future for sure.</li>
    <li> These are great bottles. Just right for your purse or pocket. Believe it I fill it with my favorite essential oil plus a carrier and keep in my purse to use on my fingertips so I can turn the pages in my books.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for what I needed, caps fit well and snugly. I&#x27;m ordering a larger quantity now!</li>
    <li> Great bottles for essential oils. Well made and functional.</li>
    <li> These do not perform as described. Metal ball falls out of applicator, spilling contents when in any position but upright. Cannot be used. Very disappointed. One star for pretty blue bottles that are a good size.</li>
    <li> I like the bottles because they are thick glass.  I do not like the rollers on the bottles.  When I fill them with my oils and a carrier oil, I can&#x27;t get them to roll.  I have to pry the roller from the bottle and just pour out the oil mixture. I have tried everything to get the rollers to work, but they won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I purchased these glass roller bottles to mix and make new EO&#x27;s recipes for my on personal use. I noticed that other reviews stated that the lids fit crooked and were scratched.  I gave it 4 stars because the lids were scratched but I have had no problems with the lids fitting straight or the rollers themselves. I do not mind paying the cheeper price for these as long I as I am using them for me personally. If I were buying glass roller bottles for gifts I would spend a little more money and hopefully find glass roller bottles and lids without the scratches.</li>
    <li> Good quality with metal balls. Wish it was a little darker blue but not complaining. Still pretty.  Upon further inspection the glass is actually blue but not really etched. The etching is actually a coating that I can scrape off with my fingernail. Changing my rating from a 5 to a 4</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC essential oil bottles - everything glides like silk.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be getting more of these!</li>
    <li> Perfect for mixing all my EO&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Yes, non leaking, easy to use, smooth roller. Great buy and worth it will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Love these roller bottles!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of roller bottles for essential oil blends. I was excited to try this brand because of the metal ball. The bottles arrived looking tattered (lids were scuffed and some of the bottles had smudges and scratches), and now that I&#x27;m using them, the blue is coming off, and about half have lost the roller ball. I&#x27;m stunned at the good reviews. There is a MUCH better brand that is often on Amazon for comparable pricing.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use with essential oil mixtures.  Just what I was looking for.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Great little bottles with fluid, well fitting metal rollers. My only reason not to give 5 stars is because when you put the black caps on, they look crooked.  They are secure, so it&#x27;s just a very minor appearance issue.</li>
    <li> Great Delivery and product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Like the frosted glass and the metal roller, much better than the plastic.  Have purchased this item twice, first time one of the bottles was chipped and the second time, some of the rollers did not work as well as others.  Overall still an okay product.  Haven&#x27;t found anything better for the price.</li>
    <li> Great little roller bottles. I use them with essential oils and it gives of just the right amount of oil. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My first order was damaged but was replaced by Amazon.  These are perfect size roller bottles to use with essential oils and a carrier.</li>
    <li> When I received this in the mail today one of the bottles was completely smashed.</li>
    <li> The bottles are pretty but the caps come a little scuffed up so giving them as a gift wouldn&#x27;t work out. The roller ball is metal but the fit doesn&#x27;t appear to be tight enough and instead do getting a nice even roll against your skin, it comes out unevenly and drips. Not terrible if it sits in one place all the time but if you want to carry a roll on in your purse or bag this one will leak if it&#x27;s not upright.  Will try another brand next time.  Three stars are for the seller for an easy transaction and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with the bottles leaking.. which is positive. The negative..using a full strength oil like Frankincense has caused the plastic part holding the metal ball to expand and the ball frequently jumps out. Wish the entire top was metal.</li>
    <li> These are really scratched up... roller ball takes a long time to losen up to wear it will even roll at all.  Then it became so lose, that it dripped oil.  Be careful.</li>
    <li> Great price and the rollerball doesn&#x27;t fall out</li>
    <li> Works well for making oil roller balls</li>
    <li> These bottles are painted not frosted. One of my EO blends caused the paint to come off all over the place</li>
