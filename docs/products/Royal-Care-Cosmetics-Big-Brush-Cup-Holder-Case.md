      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted to fit all my brushes at a good price, I&#x27;ve had it for a month now with no issues.</li>
      <li>All my brushes in one place, makes applying makeup easy &amp; organized.</li>
      <li>Fine</li>
      <li>but that is fine.</li>
      <li>so I had to squeeze them together in order to get them to fit, when I travel.</li>
      <li>If you bought the whole brushes, buy this one, easy to manage, the brushes are safe and sound on these case, and it doesn&#x27;t need a lot of space.</li>
      <li>I got this to put my brush kit I got from Amazon in because the plastic folding pouch they came in was not cutting it!</li>

      <li>It was also delivered right away!</li>
      <li>The price was right on this one!  </li>
      <li>This is a very convenient brush holder for your counter with the benefit of being able to travel well.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say much more.</li>
      <li>This holder case is the PERFECT size for about 5-6 large brushes with room for small eye shadow, brow or lip brushes to fit in as well.</li>
      <li>Would be nice for personal use but doesn&#x27;t fit my needs as a makeup artist.</li>
      <li>so this is super helpful</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I wanted something that would stay together while traveling it never seemed to clasp right.</li>
      <li>They are great to travel with and take up very little room in the suitcase.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonable price for a quality product that now sits on my dresser keeping my brushes together.</li>
      <li>Much better then the traditional roll out or fold over brush holder.</li>
      <li>Also, it makes my brushes smell funny.</li>
      <li>I just thought that the cup holder was going to be a bit bigger, since there were so many reviews saying how spacious it was.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I needed in terms of storing my brushes for travel.  </li>
      <li>Love it and may be getting a 2nd one soon.  </li>
      <li>I love that it holds several brushes and even the tall ones.</li>
      <li>I love the size and quality so much, that I intend to buy a second one for my remaining brushes.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as pictured and very sturdy I haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
      <li>This is a good brush holder for all your small brushes</li>
      <li>Its nice and sturdy, the only thing Id want is for the different sides to be more noticeably different.</li>
      <li>All the brushed Doesnt fit</li>
      <li>Its tall enough to fit my Sedona lace and MAC brushes.</li>
      <li>and is really easy to open and close, and will keep your brushes away from dust and soil, clean enough just for your face use.</li>
      <li>so far.reasonable fast delivery.</li>
      <li>like I said its really roomy, and I will be ordering another one.</li>
      <li>the other dayand all I can say is that I love it!!!its very roomy</li>
      <li>, I needed to make room for the cosmetiqueta, will be a full set of brushes, small can lose, important to be brushes crossbar.</li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Plus, there is still a little more room for about a 10 inch brush.  </li>
      <li>Quality was as I expected for a cheap holder like this</li>
      <li>and I was thinking ohh nooo, but the seller sent me a new one immediately</li>
      <li>No funny smells and super fast shipping - 2 days.  </li>
      <li>Sigma offers one, but for what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think $30 justifies something like this which I will only be using in action here and there.  </li>
      <li>I was so nervous this was not going to be large enough, however I am excitingly surprised!</li>
      <li>Big enough to fit all the essential brushes.</li>
      <li>I am thinking of ordering a few more just to store my daily brushes and one for my shorter travel brushes.</li>
      <li>Much smaller than other similar products and doesn&#x27;t hold many brushes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for travelling with makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> love this product, it helped my issue of having to dig to the bottom of my make up bag looking for brushes</li>
    <li> Great brush cups!  My daughter and i both have one.  They are great to travel with and take up very little room in the suitcase.  You can bring all of your brushed along.  Also, you can put your eye liner and pencils in too!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for length wise.  I have two brushes that are about 9 inches long and this is perfect.  Plus, there is still a little more room for about a 10 inch brush.  I absolutely love this case and can&#x27;t wait to use it for traveling.  For now, it will be used as a brush cup holder.  Love it and may be getting a 2nd one soon.  We may get one for my sister-in-law because she&#x27;s a make up fanatic!  Definitely recommend and it it doesn&#x27;t have a Nast smell either.  It also came 3 days ahead of time which was a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed in terms of storing my brushes for travel.  You&#x27;d be surprised at how hard it is to find a full sized brush holder out there!  Sigma offers one, but for what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think $30 justifies something like this which I will only be using in action here and there.  The price was right on this one!  It looks nice, has a lot of room, the material seems like it will wipe clean (a must for any cosmetic storage unit) and will be accompanying me on lots of trips from now on!  Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The brush cup holder case from royal care cosmetics was good, but I was expecting a brush biger than this one.</li>
    <li> i travel a lot and i have a good amount of brushes so this is super helpful and i keep it out even when im not traveling to hold some of my brushes</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush holder. Just what I was looking for. It helps me keeps my brushes organized and it also convenient for when on the go.</li>
    <li> i ordered the sigma kit which came with a cup holder case like this but i returned the set because in my opinion it was overpriced. i came across this case and it is the same one as the sigma one at half the price. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fine so far.reasonable fast delivery.Quality was as I expected for a cheap holder like this but that is fine. o</li>
    <li> I decided to buy the Royal Care Cosmetics brush cup holder case specifically for the price. I also wanted to be sure to buy a cup holder that was not going to be too big or too small. I checked the dimensions and thought they were ideal. What I really like is that you can use both cups, one for storing eye brushes and the other for face brushes. This size is perfect and holds all my brushes. That was one of my biggest concerns. Then when you want to travel, you can just put the cups together and snap it closed. The brushes will be protected for traveling. Now I have a way to keep my brushes together where I can grab whatever I need, instead of having them all over the place. I know that I won&#x27;t lose them.Very reasonable price for a quality product that now sits on my dresser keeping my brushes together. I think it&#x27;s a great idea. The cup holder is sturdy and good quality. I am really pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this thing is a lifesaver!! I got this to put my brush kit I got from Amazon in because the plastic folding pouch they came in was not cutting it! this was PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Exactly what I expected! Can&#x27;t wait to use this! The leather is a nice touch and the snaps seems strong</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient brush holder for your counter with the benefit of being able to travel well. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this.  Holds tons of brushes and pencils and great for storage or traveling</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush cup holder. What a terrific way to stay organized, especially for someone like me who travels quite a bit. I love the size and quality so much, that I intend to buy a second one for my remaining brushes. Love this!</li>
    <li> I wanted to have my brushes stored so that they wouldn&#x27;t get a lot of dust in their hair. It fits about 5 of my big brushes, but the lid captures some of the hairs, so that they get bended in different directions! I don&#x27;t think the diameter is 7 cm inside, it must be from the outside. Also, it makes my brushes smell funny. I would probably have bought a more expensive and bigger one...</li>
    <li> It is exactly as pictured and very sturdy I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I can&#x27;t really say much more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received mines the other dayand all I can say is that I love it!!!its very roomy and you can use it as too makeup containers. Which I loved. I immediately wiped it down and started to put my makeup brushes in.. like I said its really roomy, and I will be ordering another one. If youhave travel sized brushes I recommend ordering the small one</li>
    <li> Loved it, will buy again when on sale.</li>
    <li> I love that it holds several brushes and even the tall ones. Also after cleaning your brushes you can store them in here to avoid dust settling on them. I am thinking of ordering a few more just to store my daily brushes and one for my shorter travel brushes.</li>
    <li> This looked like a nice brush holder when it arrived and it was actually larger than I expected. I wanted something that would stay together while traveling it never seemed to clasp right. I later realized that the clasp was actually broken and I think it&#x27;s too late to return it!</li>
    <li> If you bought the whole brushes, buy this one, easy to manage, the brushes are safe and sound on these case, and it doesn&#x27;t need a lot of space. and is really easy to open and close, and will keep your brushes away from dust and soil, clean enough just for your face use.</li>
    <li> Just what I want as looking for! Nice for when you get to your hotel,you can use it to split up your brushes from face to eyes and keep them upright on a counter!</li>
    <li> This is a good brush holder for all your small brushes it&#x27;s not a good&lt;br /&gt;fit for my larger brushes.</li>
    <li> No funny smells and super fast shipping - 2 days.  Its tall enough to fit my Sedona lace and MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shiping, tks!</li>
    <li> This cup holder is made well and hold all my brushes, also looks nice on my vanity. Love it, Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is ok if you only have about 6-8 brushes because the circumference is very small. I purchased a diff brush holder that was great but because it was sold out, i bought this one. It gets the job done, however I will need about 5 or 6 of these for my makeup brushes. I have about 40 brushes that i travel with for makeup gigs and what not.</li>
    <li> The best. When I&#x27;m not traveling, I split my brushes between the top and bottom halves of the case. When I&#x27;m going somewhere, it&#x27;s never been easier to bring my brushes along.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! I have an array of different size brushes, this item works out perfect for me. All my brushes in one place, makes applying makeup easy &amp; organized. Even during cleaning brushes- open &amp; you have two sides to work with. Spray daily brush cleaner close and go! Def. A Must Have.</li>
    <li> Good quality for a really good price! It was also delivered right away! I encourage every mua and women who travels a lot to buy this brush cup holder.</li>
    <li> very good product, I needed to make room for the cosmetiqueta, will be a full set of brushes, small can lose, important to be brushes crossbar. Price and recommended use</li>
    <li> I love this brush cup it&#x27;s a good quality belt it fit a good amount of brushes ,you could use it as a two part or just one for traveling I love love this product I give it 10 +</li>
    <li> Much smaller than other similar products and doesn&#x27;t hold many brushes. Would be nice for personal use but doesn&#x27;t fit my needs as a makeup artist.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted to fit all my brushes at a good price, I&#x27;ve had it for a month now with no issues. Way better than paying 30+ at this other place I found it at.</li>
    <li> I just thought that the cup holder was going to be a bit bigger, since there were so many reviews saying how spacious it was. I haven&#x27;t used it to travel yet, so I just use the &#x27;cap&#x27; side to hold my brushes since it has a bigger diameter.</li>
    <li> It was a little smaller than I expected but it&#x27;s still an excellent brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I had was that my brushes (foundation, powder, bronzer and blush) were too big and fluffy so I had to squeeze them together in order to get them to fit, when I travel. I ended up using it for my eyeshadow brushes instead.</li>
    <li> I am a pro makeup artist and I&#x27;m always looking for ways to organize and condense my kit. I ordered 2 of these and they are a pretty good size. I like that they help to keep my station more organized when I&#x27;m working so I work a lot quicker. When I set up to work I open them up so I have 4 cups. I keep my faces brushes in one cup, my eyes &amp; lips brushes in another, my pencils in another, and I use the 4th cup for my dirty brushes. Works out great for me! I have to mention that I was a little weary when I first received my order cause there was damage to one of the button of one of the cases and I was thinking ohh nooo, but the seller sent me a new one immediately and I&#x27;ve been using them daily for over a month now and have had no issues. I love them!</li>
    <li> This holder case is the PERFECT size for about 5-6 large brushes with room for small eye shadow, brow or lip brushes to fit in as well. I was so nervous this was not going to be large enough, however I am excitingly surprised! This will be perfect for travel since it can be used for travel and for holding the brushes wherever you are. The snaps are tight, to ensure security and the leather is in between a matte and shiny matte finish. I can&#x27;t wait to travel with this!</li>
    <li> Great at what I use it for. It only unsnapped once, but that&#x27;s most likely because I packed it in my bag very poorly. Its nice and sturdy, the only thing Id want is for the different sides to be more noticeably different. Sometimes I forget what side is &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; and I open it incorrectly.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my makeup brushes.i love it.its easy to pack to travel with and holds about 15 regular size brush.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Much better then the traditional roll out or fold over brush holder. This is easier to travel with and sits on a vanity without taking up much room while using and is easy to store!</li>
    <li> This holder looks ok, but I can&#x27;t use it!!!! It has a horrible smell , and I do not dare to put my brushes there.</li>
    <li> Both of the buttons on my brush holder have broke. Hasn&#x27;t been a week :/</li>
    <li> All the brushed Doesnt fit</li>
    <li> Big enough to fit all the essential brushes. Love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I was able to get on without this before. A must have if you travel a lot or even if you&#x27;re just at home.</li>
    <li> I have way too many brushes to fit all of them in it but it&#x27;s a perfect way to keep the ones that have been used all together. Especially if I&#x27;m doing a freelance job &amp; don&#x27;t want my brushes getting mixed up.</li>
