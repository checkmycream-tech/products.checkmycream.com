      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>The instructions were easy to read and it was pretty easy to use!!!    </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve ever been to a salon for threading, you&#x27;ll know that this is a MUCH more sanitary way of threading.</li>
      <li>This is a tool that I wish I had years ago:)</li>
      <li>I could not believe the smooth results!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but I like to make sure</li>
      <li>There is no pain and my skin is so smooth after each use!</li>
      <li>but now I love it</li>
      <li>Again, if I had finer hair it might have worked better than it did for me.</li>
      <li>When my skin finally recovered from the traumatic waxing experience, I made an appointment for threading at the spa where I have my facials done and loved it!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I listened to my friend and got this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to remove unwanted hair from my face, legs, arms, and I&#x27;ve become a pro at shaping my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Again, if I had finer hair it might have worked better than it did for me.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>REASONS WHY I LOVE IT:&lt;br</li>
      <li>Salon quality for sure :)</li>
      <li>The threader is amazing because it makes you feel like you&#x27;re your very own professional which is huge for me!</li>
      <li>I received it two days later (don&#x27;t you love Prime?!!!).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone!!!!!</li>
      <li>i am sooo excited that now i can do this at home - i finally got my own - followed the easy instructions and NOW AM THREADING ON MY OWN!!!    </li>
      <li>however it did not take long for me to get the hang of how to use this and the best part</li>
      <li>Money doesn&#x27;t come easy these days, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Karmissie threader.   </li>
      <li>It is so easy to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;*It&#x27;s easy &amp; convenient</li>
      <li>So while the Karmissie does remove hairs, it&#x27;s not as easy as it feels like it should be.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use so</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The product grabs fine hair rather easily - it twists around the string and gets pulled out with no problem.</li>
      <li>and I love being the first to introduce it to my family and friends!     </li>
      <li>This product is great for what it is... gets hairs that are too fine for the laser and too numerous for the tweezers, and doesn&#x27;t make you break out like waxing.  </li>
      <li>, you&#x27;re looking at HUGE chunk of change.</li>
      <li>I think if this product were $20, it might be worth a shot to give it a try, but it&#x27;s going to be over $100, it better be an indispensable beauty product (i.e., Clarisonic, etc).  </li>
      <li>Plus, salons are not always available here in the US.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I even sent a testimonial to the Karmissie website.    </li>
      <li>and I am now free of peach fuzz all over my face.  </li>
      <li>Compared to going to a salon, the unit price of at home threading is much more economical.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels like a babies bottom and looks so incredibly smooth when I apply my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll fall in love with it as well and love me even more for giving such a fabulous gift.</li>
      <li>is that it really works!!!</li>
      <li>I must say don&#x27;t try to use it without watching the super easy step by step DVD that comes with the kit.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you know exactly where the thread pulls on the hair (where the X) and the direction it pulls.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Your skin feels so smooth and clean right after!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Enter the Karmissie Lux Deluxe Threader Kit (previously known as the Sun Maita Threading Kit if you&#x27;re Googling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be thinking that you&#x27;re going to get an awesome machine for $125 (current price), right?&lt;br /&gt;Well...</li>
      <li>I received the Karmissi Threader Kit as a special birthday gift.</li>
      <li>I was super excited to learn about the Threader</li>
      <li>Finally SOMEBODY GOT IT RIGHT!!! :)</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this kit was the powder, and the creams it came with.</li>
      <li>Thanks Karmissie for making a fabulous product!</li>
      <li>The angle at which I have to hold the device, how it seems to &#x27;slide&#x27; from the area i want it in, the thread used loosens quickly and</li>
      <li>All of the various methods had their upsides and downsides as I&#x27;m sure most of you already know.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very interested in trying a home treader since I go to the salon to get my face threaded every month.   </li>
      <li>I know that if Neiman Marcus is selling it online that they must have tested it carefully first so believe the 5 star reviews that you read below because if any product deserves 5 stars this is it!</li>
      <li>it worth</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth $125.  </li>
      <li>Who doesn&#x27;t have some kind of facial hair or peach fuzz they want eliminated?  </li>
      <li>I think she&#x27;s starting a threading business of her own.....</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost for me.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty thick pain threshold, so I didn&#x27;t need the numbing cream so much, but that Chalk is ABSOLUTELY wonderful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Little fishy, right?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is going to save me a lot of time and money. No longer do I need to get professional hair removal. Wish someone thought of this years ago!</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical but it works just like the real thing.  It does take a bit of practice though.  I gave the girls a call when I couldn&#x27;t get it to work and the inventor walked me through the whole thing.  That&#x27;s what I call customer service. It&#x27;s good to see a company that still cares about their products once it&#x27;s sold.</li>
    <li> I use this product everywhere and it works great! I used to wax but it was messy, painful, and often left bumps and irritation on my skin. I used this product b/c I saw it on facebook and I love it. It&#x27;s super easy and clean, it works really well (especially for the finer facial hair which is usually hard to get), and no more skin irritation! It&#x27;s a lifesaver! Definitely worth it! (Also makes a great gift)</li>
    <li> I used to get threaded on my Asia trips, although it&#x27;s great for my skin, it&#x27;s extremely painful! Plus, salons are not always available here in the US. I was super excited to learn about the Threader, although skeptical, I gave it a few tries and it actually works!     You have to get used to the way it holds and runs on your skin. Make sure you know exactly where the thread pulls on the hair (where the X) and the direction it pulls. I like using the scissor method where you hold the two ends of the legs, I think it gives more control especially when you first start using it.     If it&#x27;s your first time, USE THE NUMBING LOTION (wait 5 min), it&#x27;ll make the experience less painful. Like tweezing, after awhile though, it doesn&#x27;t really hurt anymore.     Anyways, make sure to at least give it a few tries, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! After a few months of using it, I can actually do it for other people (and charge them for it LOL)</li>
    <li> i am sooo excited that now i can do this at home - i finally got my own - followed the easy instructions and NOW AM THREADING ON MY OWN!!!    Thank you so much for making this happen - it is a savior for \\&quot;furry\\&quot; people like me :P</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve stumbled upon the Karmissie Lux Deluxe Threader Kit, you&#x27;re probably very skeptical about all these glittering reviews of the product. As of October 29th, 2010 there are 17 reviews (not including mine); of those 16 are five star and 1 is four star. If you delve a little deeper into those reviewers, you&#x27;ll note that every single one of them only has one or two reviews total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little fishy, right? I thought so too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when my Braun epilator died on me after five years of faithful service I wondered what else was out there. I had tried almost all of the usual hair removal suspects (except home electrolysis - those machines look scary and generally unreliable) including waxing, epilators, and even some of the chemical solvents. All of the various methods had their upsides and downsides as I&#x27;m sure most of you already know. Compared to the mess of waxing, the burn of chemicals and the general pain involved with epilators, threading sounded like a great alternative. In theory threading is awesome - it irritates the skin less so no more red bumps, it helps prevent ingrown hairs (I&#x27;m not really sure how on this point), and much like with other hair removal systems, eventually the hair follicle will hypothetically become damaged and no longer grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Karmissie Lux Deluxe Threader Kit (previously known as the Sun Maita Threading Kit if you&#x27;re Googling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be thinking that you&#x27;re going to get an awesome machine for $125 (current price), right?&lt;br /&gt;Well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Karmissie is actually simple piece of plastic which holds two twisted strands of thread. The most expensive looking thing is the box that the threader comes in. For $125 you get: the threader, about 40 pieces of string, chalk (to help you see the hairs), topical numbing lotion, after-use soothing lotion, instruction booklet and instruction DVD. The idea behind the Karmissie is simple; the device uses a scissor-like motion to move a pair of intertwined string up and down your skin. This motion \\&quot;lassos\\&quot; the hairs between the string and pulls the hair out by the root, very similar to a Bellabe (which costs about $12 by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you didn&#x27;t read the product description very closely, you&#x27;ll notice that it talks about removing peach fuzz. Well here&#x27;s the thing, the Karmissie is primarily meant to be used to remove facial hair and not much else. So that means brow-shaping, jawline hairs and various peach fuzz. Underarm hair, leg hair, and other areas?  Well hypothetically the Karmissie could remove hair from those areas, but you&#x27;d have to be a contortionist. The device itself is pretty large and the scissor motion used to grab the hair requires a bit of space to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So lets break it down - Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is muddled on this one. I&#x27;ve been using the Karmissie for about a week now, both to get the hang of the product and to let my hair grow a little. The product grabs fine hair rather easily - it twists around the string and gets pulled out with no problem. Thicker hair however, needs to be lengthy before the Karmissie can actually grab enough to yank out. This brings up another fundamental problem: hair needs to be pretty long before the Karmissie can work. If you have stubble growing in from a recently shaved or waxed area, you need to allow those hairs to grow (and thus become visible) before the Karmissie can remove them. Secondly, it takes some time to use this machine. Even after a week of use, I was still spending several minutes in an area and even then my skin never felt as smooth as using a razor. So while the Karmissie does remove hairs, it&#x27;s not as easy as it feels like it should be. People with fine hair will have more success with this product than people with thick hairs like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth it?&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this machine is overpriced by at least a hundred dollars.  While I understand that the idea is that buying the Karmissie to use at home is cheaper than going to the salon to get threading done by a professional, that does not make the materials used to make the Karmissie suddenly ten times more expensive. And honestly, when you pick up and use the Karmissie you do not know what that $125 is paying for because the machine does not \\&quot;feel\\&quot; expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased the Karmissie from Amazon I really, really wanted to like it. On paper, it had it all - easy to use, no mess, no chemicals and no irritation. If the Karmissie could have produced on all of those promises, it *might* have been worth the asking price, but even then it&#x27;s a big \\&quot;if\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Karmissie two stars because the product does work on some levels. Again, if I had finer hair it might have worked better than it did for me. However the limited target functionality (face only) and the incredibly inflated price tag knock it down a star from a general \\&quot;three-star passing\\&quot; grade.eaper than going to the salon to get threading done by a professional, that does not make the materials used to make the Karmissie suddenly ten times more expensive. And honestly, when you pick up and use the Karmissie you do not know what that $125 is paying for because the machine does not \\&quot;feel\\&quot; expensive.    Conclusion  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  When I purchased the Karmissie from Amazon I really, really wanted to like it. On paper, it had it all - easy to use, no mess, no chemicals and no irritation. If the Karmissie could have produced on all of those promises, it *might* have been worth the asking price, but even then it&#x27;s a big \\&quot;if\\&quot;.    I give the Karmissie two stars because the product does work on some levels. Again, if I had finer hair it might have worked better than it did for me. However the limited target functionality (face only) and the incredibly inflated price tag knock it down a star from a general \\&quot;three-star passing\\&quot; grade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very interested in trying a home treader since I go to the salon to get my face threaded every month.   A friend recommended trying this product and I must say it is very easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to pay $25 at the salon anymore.  It&#x27;s totally worth $125.  You can thread in your own home and if you need to thread more than once a month it&#x27;s great.  You can also thread other areas besides your face.  I use it on my armpits and legs as well.      Great product.  Easy to use. and worth the money especially if you thread at the salon.    Love it.</li>
    <li> Takes a bit to get use to but now that I have it down it&#x27;s awesome and addicting.</li>
    <li> I saw this at a trade show too!  The lady made it look supereasy to use, but then I saw a guy demo it too and thought . . . oh, it can&#x27;t be that bad.      Takes a little practice at first, but I have to say, I&#x27;m converted!  It was supercool when I first started to get it . . . the chalk totally makes a difference and it&#x27;s actually pretty convenient to have this at home.</li>
    <li> I received the Karmissi Threader Kit as a special birthday gift. I am not a do it yourself person and have always had my threading done professionally however it did not take long for me to get the hang of how to use this and the best part is that it really works!!! I travel a lot and have little time to catch up on beauty treatments so because it is small I can take it with me! I liked it so much I even sent a testimonial to the Karmissie website.    Now I am on Amazon.com because I am sending it as a gift to my daughter for her birthday and will be buying another for my closest friend for a holiday gift. This is one of the best new products I have used and I love being the first to introduce it to my family and friends!     I know that if Neiman Marcus is selling it online that they must have tested it carefully first so believe the 5 star reviews that you read below because if any product deserves 5 stars this is it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I listened to my friend and got this product. This threader is really great and works wonders for me! It&#x27;s really easy to use so don&#x27;t feel like you won&#x27;t know how to use it when it gets to you. I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it and officially own one. I am looking forward to purchasing and introducing it to family and friends. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I just received the threader kit about a week ago and I can&#x27;t stop raving about it!!! Waxing has been causing my upper lips to become rough and a little discolored (They are a bit darker than the rest of my face). hopefully if i continue with the threading the discoloration will go away.     The instructions were easy to read and it was pretty easy to use!!!    I am definitely going to be ordering the threader for my sister for xmas :)</li>
    <li> I thought threading is a nice methode to remove hairs. So I bought this set. Unpacking that thing I realized that the price is extraordinary high for this simple pice of plasitc. Next problem: it does not work at all. The threading joint does not follow a straight line, it goes into a diagonal direction, so there is no chance to catch any hair. For me it is an uneffective expensive toy.</li>
    <li> I asked for and received this as a birthday present in Nov 2010.  I&#x27;m just now order replacement threads and lotions for the first time.  Yes, $125 is a lot of money, but it&#x27;s lasted me for 15 months and I&#x27;ve used the threader regularly.  Compared to going to a salon, the unit price of at home threading is much more economical.  I&#x27;m a veteran of waxing, plucking, and lasering.  This product is great for what it is... gets hairs that are too fine for the laser and too numerous for the tweezers, and doesn&#x27;t make you break out like waxing.  It takes a few tries to really get it down (I squeeze the arms to use it, I find the button is really clumsy), but now I can use it while watching tv and not really paying attention.  Reviews that complain it doesn&#x27;t go in a straight line: no, it doesn&#x27;t.  And you have to pay attention to which way the thread are moving in relation to the direction of hair growth.  Not rocket science.  You have to pay the same attention to waxing.  Reviews that complain it wont pull hairs that aren&#x27;t visible: same as waxing and tweezing, but I&#x27;ve found the threader can get to hairs before waxing or tweezing could.  I recommend it, especially for the face.  Well worth the cost for me.</li>
    <li> It works, and is very easy to use. I wished I had bought this earlier. I would still go to the threading salon for eyebrows because it may be more difficult to use on the eyebrow area (thought it can be done), but for the rest of the face, this tool is a must have and can save you hundreds of dollars!!!</li>
    <li> I want to thank the inventor of this product!!!!!  It is so easy to use and when I am travelling all over the world and can&#x27;t get beauty treatments I have been saved!  There is no pain and my skin is so smooth after each use! I highly recommend it to anyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m NOT the girl you would consider to be very skilled at doing anything in regards to facial products such as threading, tweezing, the list goes on but I absolutely LOVE this product! I must say don&#x27;t try to use it without watching the super easy step by step DVD that comes with the kit.  Those who attempt on their own are probably those complaining about the product.  Once you watch the DVD and actually follow the correct directions, you will seriously be amazed by your own abilities to do you eyebrows and thread whatever else you want to! I use to go to Ziba to get my eyebrows done which I stopped doing not only because it was getting costly ($15 a visit about twice a month) but because the ladies started misshaping my eyebrowns. The threader is amazing because it makes you feel like you&#x27;re your very own professional which is huge for me! It comes with all the things you need to make sure your skin isn&#x27;t dry and splotchy afterwards and comes in a cute box (which is a big plus for me). It&#x27;s also so small and easy to take with you on the go. I am absolutely recommending this to all my friends who haven&#x27;t already bought one! Thanks Karmissie for making a fabulous product! Finally SOMEBODY GOT IT RIGHT!!! :)</li>
    <li> What a find!  I stumbled into this product by chance.  Initially I was intimidated by the whole concept of threading but now I love it and it gets easier with use. I like that my skin stays intact.  I am telling my friends about it.</li>
    <li> I could not believe the smooth results! Make-up just glides on now.... After trying expensive dermatologist-prescribed hair removal creams for the face to painstaking plucking, this is the most expedient and effective hand-held device to own - next to a Blackberry or i-Phone!  Seriously!!!!  Who doesn&#x27;t have some kind of facial hair or peach fuzz they want eliminated?  And a one time cost to take care of a life time problem?!?  This is a tool that I wish I had years ago:) Easy to use one - especially once you get used to the first initial few bursts of hair pulls, but the results are completely worth it!  Genius!</li>
    <li> My friend purchased this device and gave it to me as an early Christmas gift because I had said how awesome the product sounded.  If-it-worked.  That&#x27;s right, for a hair removal device that costs upward of $120, the basic expectation is that the thing works.  Well, good luck learning to use it.    First, the plastic threader is an inappropriate size for facial hair removal.  Second, it seems like one would need quite a bit of heavy-duty practice to (maybe) be able to use the thing properly.  Otherwise, it is not a very accurate or precise way to remove hair.  I think the product might be ok for overall removal of hair on your face, but not eyebrows.    I think if this product were $20, it might be worth a shot to give it a try, but it&#x27;s going to be over $100, it better be an indispensable beauty product (i.e., Clarisonic, etc).  Money doesn&#x27;t come easy these days, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Karmissie threader.   As a side note, I will agree with some of the other reviewers here that the initial reviews (some 20 of them) appear highly suspicious.  After using the product, I simply don&#x27;t believe that any of those glowing reviews are real.  Perhaps friends/family of the business?  Make a better product, and you won&#x27;t need to do that! I&#x27;d ask for a refund if this hadn&#x27;t been a gift.</li>
    <li> I tried out this product cause my friend recommended it to me. I love it. It works really well for me at home. Threader works really well especially for target area and fuzz hair. I typically dont like waxing because the pulling i think damages the skin&#x27;s elasticity in the long run. I get laser hair removal for my major areas, but its impossible to laser all the fuzz on the legs and arms so the threader actually works wonders for me. I&#x27;d totally recommend using this. If you&#x27;ve ever been to a salon for threading, you&#x27;ll know that this is a MUCH more sanitary way of threading. Plus you make your money back after a few uses. Its costs me at least $15 each time I go to a salon for threading.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw this product on Amazon!! I always try to find salons that offer threading by where I live and it&#x27;s actually very difficult to locate skilled beauticians who know how to thread. Once you start threading, you will not go back to any other method of hair removal...IT&#x27;S REALLY AWESOME!! I don&#x27;t have to go back to work from my lunch break with big red marks all over my face! You think that&#x27;s embarrassing, it&#x27;s even more embarrassing when you have a noticeable mustache! Karmissie&#x27;s (very cute name BTW)Theader LUX is easy to use if you think of it like a pair of tweezers that pulls out more hairs at a time! I definitely recommend it to everyone to try! It&#x27;s very addicting indeed and satisfying to get all the little hairs!! Your skin feels so smooth and clean right after! I would say that you definitely can&#x27;t skip the CHALK POWDER.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I saw this at a beauty expo a couple months back. I was able to talk with the creator of the product and she actually did a demonstration on my brows. I&#x27;ve never seen it done so fast and look so great! I bought the product immediately and patiently waited for my hair to grow back.  In the meantime, I threaded my arms,legs, happy trail, anywhere I could find hair. It&#x27;s amazing! Not only did it remove the hairs, but it also left my skin with a clean finish (guess that&#x27;s the exfoliation part!). It was awesome on the areas where I am prone to ingrown hairs too. -So over those embarrassing bumps!    I have a pretty thick pain threshold, so I didn&#x27;t need the numbing cream so much, but that Chalk is ABSOLUTELY wonderful. It literally makes grabbing difficult easier than help me find those small hairs I overlooked with the naked eye.    I highly recommend this product! Before I used to quickly shave my upper lip if I saw a little stubble before heading out, but now I grab my Threader. It&#x27;s almost as fast and doesn&#x27;t leave an obvious stubble once it starts to grow out. I use to fear my stubble was showing after a few days of not reshaving, but with the Threader it takes longer to grow out and grows finer and thinner.     I&#x27;ve ordered another for my sister because she keeps taking it to sleepovers with her friends. I think she&#x27;s starting a threading business of her own..... Just kidding! But she could. Salon quality for sure :)</li>
    <li> I started seeing threading salons pop up in the malls and people lined up to remove their mustache but when I saw this Threader device with a whole system I can use at home, I knew I had to try it.  Comes with great instructions and DVD that made it very easy to use.  It took me a couple times to get the hang of it and I am now free of peach fuzz all over my face.  My skin feels like a babies bottom and looks so incredibly smooth when I apply my makeup.  Best investment I&#x27;ve made!</li>
    <li> awesome threader kit that you can use at your own convenience at home.  can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> Threading is an effective ancient method of hair removal.  The Karmissie Threader has taken this ancient method (still practiced today) and revolutionized it for individual use in modern times.  Genius.  THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT OUT THERE ON THE MARKET.  Even though I didn&#x27;t purchase mine on Amazon, I just had to write a review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOP 5 REASONS WHY I LOVE IT:&lt;br /&gt;*If used correctly, it precisely removes ANY and ALL unwanted hair, right down to the root.&lt;br /&gt;*According to my dermatologist, it&#x27;s suitable for ALL skin types and conditions (i.e., vs. razors/waxing).&lt;br /&gt;*The \\&quot;Feel Less\\&quot; Lotion:  My backup for more delicate skin that is sensitive to any discomfort felt during any hair removal method.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s easy &amp; convenient (Yay! No trips to the salon or handling the thread with my fingers when I do it myself).&lt;br /&gt;*It has EVERYTHING a beginner/veteran user needs in ONE kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little patience and a bit of practice, you&#x27;ll be a master in the art of threading in no time!  Thank goodness for instructional videos!  Happy Threading!!</li>
    <li> So I never write reviews -- mostly due to the fact that there isn&#x27;t enough time in the day and also because there aren&#x27;t too many things that excite me enough to mention. But alas, the Karmissie Threader...God&#x27;s gift to mankind if you ask me. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about threading. My friends are addicted. I&#x27;m beginning to see a ton written about it and have you noticed threading salons popping up all over local malls?! Up until the beginning of this year, I was a virgin to threading.     I finally tried it after much encouragement from friends and after a horrible breakout from waxing (I was a pizza face for about 2 months as a result!!). My facial skin has become very sensitive with age and waxing is no longer an option for me. When my skin finally recovered from the traumatic waxing experience, I made an appointment for threading at the spa where I have my facials done and loved it!! I wasn&#x27;t willing to go to the mall to have it done -- weird if you ask me. I don&#x27;t need the family of five, doing their weekend shopping, staring at me while I have hair removed from my upper lip. Just not cool. The whole process was quick and relatively painless. I noticed that my hair took longer to grow in, was finer and major plus, no skin irritation!! I&#x27;d have to say the only drawback to threading is the price -- $45 to have my face done, which included brows, upper lip, cheeks, and chin area. That may not seem like a ton of money to some but I like to make sure I&#x27;m well maintained, and when you add $45 every 4-5 weeks on top of all the other things I like to do such as: facials, mani/pedis, hair cutting/coloring, bikini waxing, etc., you&#x27;re looking at HUGE chunk of change. Not to mention the time involved making it to all these appointments!    I live in San Francisco, and if you&#x27;re unaware of it, the cost of living here is extremely high. Additionally, I work anywhere from 40-50 hours a week and go to school, so time is of the essence for me. After almost 7 months of threading, as much as I loved it, I started to have a little trouble justifying the expense and the time involved with it. Then, amazingly, my prayers were answered!!!! After complaining to a friend about the ridiculous amount of time and money shelled out on vanity, she told me about the Karmissie Threader and I was sold. We ended up hanging a couple of days later and she did a demo for me and I was blown away! I went home, got online, saw how reasonable the price was, and ordered one right away. I received it two days later (don&#x27;t you love Prime?!!!). I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and continue to be impressed by it. I&#x27;m able to remove unwanted hair from my face, legs, arms, and I&#x27;ve become a pro at shaping my eyebrows. With Christmas around the corner, I&#x27;m going to pick up a few more for those of my friends who have not discovered this awesome, awesome device. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll fall in love with it as well and love me even more for giving such a fabulous gift. Does anyone know the creator of this product?!!! Because I&#x27;d like to give him/her a hug for making my life so much easier...</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a few things I found a little difficult to do with this product. When I read through the reviews I understood there was things to get used to and practice was needed. But once I began using it, there was no way there would be getting use out of it. The angle at which I have to hold the device, how it seems to &#x27;slide&#x27; from the area i want it in, the thread used loosens quickly and even re-tightening doesn&#x27;t help remove hair. The only good thing about this kit was the powder, and the creams it came with. The feel a little less cream works great and the powder helps pick up more hair then when not used. I tried both to see if it was how they claimed to be. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this. Just because it didn&#x27;t work with me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work with someone else.</li>
