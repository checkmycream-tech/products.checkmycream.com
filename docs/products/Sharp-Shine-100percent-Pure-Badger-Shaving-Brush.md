I never would have guessed that! Pretty soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my husband tried this for the first time he used just his usual gel shaving cream and it worked excellent! He was very surprised in the difference the brush made after applying the gel. It really made a difference in lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was very impressed with the Shaving Brush. This will be an essential part of his routine from now on.</li>
