      <li>If purchasing for a gift, I would suggest being sure the person in question enjoys a flowery scent.</li>
      <li>What could be better?</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
      <li>I am going to order more as Christmas Gifts, that&#x27;s how much I love them.</li>
      <li>love the scent of KAI</li>
      <li>I love Kai.</li>
      <li>It was quite strong and overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this is a great trial packet and good product.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry.</li>
      <li>I have read review of those who said the scent is to strong and stays on them all day all day.  </li>
      <li>I found the lessened scent to be more appealing than when first put on.  </li>
      <li>They were a huge hit, packed perfectly,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>Not only does my hair smell great, but my hair shines and feels like silk.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely and the selection in this gift was well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
      <li>While I appreciate the fact this company is organic, does not test on animals, and is free of detergents, this scent is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product states a \\&quot;light intoxicating blend of gardenia and while exotics\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Smells  light, not over powering, almost like gardenias.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews it seemed to fit my needs; \\&quot;light, not over powering, etc.\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>In reading all the reviews I was really excited to try it</li>
      <li>Clean feeling and fragrant but not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong fresh Gardenia scent which I happen to like.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s down to my waist and washing it</li>
      <li>Great little travel set</li>
      <li>Oh well, it was worth seeing the expression on her face when she received it as a gift.</li>
      <li>I saw all the good reviews for Kai and was intrigued but not ready to pay so much for full size.  </li>
      <li>Really nice product, and for those who are not sensitive to smells then go for it.</li>
      <li>The gardenia is extremely evident and does linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love the rest of the products, too, especially the perfume.  </li>
      <li>The floral scent is intense, and really nice, but it hangs in your hair all day long and over night.</li>
      <li>For some strange reason, scents do not stay on me for more then an hour.  </li>
      <li>The products are very high quality with organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I like the smell of gardenias but this is way too much.</li>
      <li>but the smell was really musky and</li>
      <li>every two days was too much..</li>
      <li>I was not expecting that since the conditioner does not seem substantial at all, it&#x27;s really liquidy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs into the hair</li>
      <li>Smells good but a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t light, as some of the other reviews say.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner and also for scent layering products in Gardenia.  </li>
      <li>sure if I&#x27;ll buy the full size of all products (sooo expensive)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are old or from a smoking facility.</li>
      <li>Will last for at least a couple more trips.</li>
      <li>The scent has a gardenia base and the body wash leaves a light scent on your skin (not overpowering) and is a nice accompaniment to the Kai roll on.</li>
      <li>but apparently it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> lots of Gardenia but not old ladyish and leaves my course, graying, dull, dry hair really soft and shiny which is VERY hard to do.  </li>
<li> product wears off in less than 3 hours, so depending on your view of the scent this could be a pro or a con.  </li>
<li> I was a little unsure to try the Shampoo and gave it a try</li>
<li> Unusable waste of money</li>
<li> Unfortunately that was not the case.  </li>
<li> Feels expensive on the skin.</li>
<li> A little costly, too bad they never run a sale!  </li>
<li> but these 2 sets smelled bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells good but a little goes a long way. A bit overpowering, but did last all day</li>
    <li> Easy to carry. Smells great. Feels expensive on the skin. Will buy it again. Will last for at least a couple more trips.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased and received this product.  My intent was to try out this fragrance.  Based on the reviews it seemed to fit my needs; \\&quot;light, not over powering, etc.\\&quot;.  Unfortunately that was not the case.  While I appreciate the fact this company is organic, does not test on animals, and is free of detergents, this scent is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product states a \\&quot;light intoxicating blend of gardenia and while exotics\\&quot;.  The gardenia is extremely evident and does linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Organic, No Animal Testing, Sulfate, paraben, phthalate, and phosphate free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Overpowering in flower scent, pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product wears off in less than 3 hours, so depending on your view of the scent this could be a pro or a con.  I found the lessened scent to be more appealing than when first put on.  If purchasing for a gift, I would suggest being sure the person in question enjoys a flowery scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great and light perfect for summer! Hair products are great and love the body wash. Great little travel set</li>
    <li> Really nice product, and for those who are not sensitive to smells then go for it. For those of you who get headaches easily, especially scent induced ones, you should not buy this product. The floral scent is intense, and really nice, but it hangs in your hair all day long and over night. I had to wash my hair with something else to get the smell away. Other than that, this is a great trial packet and good product.</li>
    <li> Like the scent and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Perfect sizes of all the products you need when traveling..and the body lotion is a great size to keep in my purse..easy to refill them too!</li>
    <li> The products are very high quality with organic ingredients. I especially love the lotion. The fragrance isn&#x27;t light, as some of the other reviews say. It&#x27;s a strong fresh Gardenia scent which I happen to like.</li>
    <li> love the scent of KAI but these 2 sets smelled bad I don&#x27;t know if they are old or from a smoking facility. Unusable waste of money</li>
    <li> Clean feeling and fragrant but not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. This was a gift for my daughter. I wanted to share my discovering with her. She loved it.</li>
    <li> The products work well but the fragrance is too overwhelming. I like the smell of gardenias but this is way too much.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance!  Nice bag, too.  I&#x27;d tell anyone who loves the tropics to buy it!  It would also make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, great set for travel or to try this out.  The scent has a gardenia base and the body wash leaves a light scent on your skin (not overpowering) and is a nice accompaniment to the Kai roll on.</li>
    <li> I love Kai.  I have read review of those who said the scent is to strong and stays on them all day all day.  That&#x27;s the part of Kai that I like.  For some strange reason, scents do not stay on me for more then an hour.  Kai stays with me and I love the scent.  This kit is perfect for traveling and a good price.  I am going to order more as Christmas Gifts, that&#x27;s how much I love them.</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of this. In reading all the reviews I was really excited to try it but the smell was really musky and just not what I pictured at all. It was quite strong and overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner and also for scent layering products in Gardenia.  I saw all the good reviews for Kai and was intrigued but not ready to pay so much for full size.  This was a perfect option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SUPER impressed with the shampoo and conditioner.  It smells aMAZing...lots of Gardenia but not old ladyish and leaves my course, graying, dull, dry hair really soft and shiny which is VERY hard to do.  I was not expecting that since the conditioner does not seem substantial at all, it&#x27;s really liquidy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs into the hair but apparently it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the rest of the products, too, especially the perfume.  A little goes a long way and the scent is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy the full size of all products (sooo expensive) but I will definitely invest in the shampoo, conditioner and perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these Kai Travel Gift Sets recently for family traveling overseas. They were a huge hit, packed perfectly,&lt;br /&gt;and were just as advertised. The scent is lovely and the selection in this gift was well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order! It&#x27;s the perfect traveling case and just enough of everything to cover all your needs!</li>
    <li> Great assortment &amp; nice travel bag</li>
    <li> I love the Kai fragrance and was happy to have this travel size to take with me on vacation.</li>
    <li> Great value and suoer gift.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product with a wonderful clean scent!  A little costly, too bad they never run a sale!  Oh well, it was worth seeing the expression on her face when she received it as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is most amazing fragrance. Smells  light, not over powering, almost like gardenias.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like over powering fragrance, and this is perfect.You won&#x27;t regret it.I bought the travel size&lt;br /&gt;because  it&#x27;s convenience when I travel.</li>
    <li> My favorite products in travel size!  What could be better?</li>
    <li> I love Kai. I use all their products. I was a little unsure to try the Shampoo and gave it a try and I love this! Not only does my hair smell great, but my hair shines and feels like silk. I find I only have to wash my hair every three days now and that&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s down to my waist and washing it every two days was too much.. I bought this travel size and wont leave home without it!</li>
