    <li> I am very happy with quality of product. My hair is clean and healthy without using any other products with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this  for  a friend. She enjoyed it. I&#x27;ll try  it for myself  next time.</li>
    <li> Chaz Dean needed to have this scent as part of his line all the time, not just for a summer.</li>
    <li> Great product but over time there is a buildup.  I use it in an unconventional way and have fabulous results.  I have short hair.  For the first week or so, I used it per the instructions and no matter how much I rinsed, I had a buildup and my hair was weighed down.  So, I used a clarifying shampoo to get the residue out.  After that, I used my sulfate free shampoo (Wen has sulfate in it) and use just a wee bit of the Wen as a conditioner.  It is great if used as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! One of my favorite Wen scents - so yummy smelling! Wen products always make my hair feel softer - and I have frizzy, curly hair. I love Wen and have been using for a long time. A bit pricey, but my hair feels so much better using Wen.</li>
    <li> love it, my hair is super soft</li>
