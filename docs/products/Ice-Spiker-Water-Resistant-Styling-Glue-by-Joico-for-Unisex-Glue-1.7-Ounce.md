      <li>I WOULD LOVE TO DO MORE BUSINESS WITH THE SELLER.  </li>
      <li>I love this jel.</li>
      <li>Smells great , washes out pretty easy.</li>
      <li>For how strong this stuff is and how well it holds up in the rain, I&#x27;m blown away at how quickly it washes away with shampoo and warm water.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ways to style my hair, but this is the only one up to the task.  </li>
      <li>and I have no idea how to style hair; it pretty much just tells you to apply the glue to dry or damp hair and shape it like you want it --</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair up, but it still looks natural.</li>
      <li>Very strong hold, but I was unable to keep my hair straight up using only this product</li>
      <li>MAJOR FACT - IT DOES NOT HARM YOU HAIR IN ANY WAY.  </li>

    <li> Super hold. Does what it says it does and does it all day long.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son. He has a lot of cowlicks. His hair is cut with a little &amp;#34;Dip&amp;#34; in the front that I like to spike up. This stuff works great. Use a very small amount. (Like the size of a pea ) I&#x27;ve tried other brands that caused a lot of flakes in his hair. Yucky! This did not leave any residue or flakes.  It goes on white but is invisible.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb! There is no other gel that works as good and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY hair product that works for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many different ways to style my hair, but this is the only one up to the task.  The BEST part is that it washes out easily!!!  For how strong this stuff is and how well it holds up in the rain, I&#x27;m blown away at how quickly it washes away with shampoo and warm water.  I buy the tubs of this stuff for home and the 1.7Ounce for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is the best Styling glue for shorter hair. Smells great , washes out pretty easy. Works better when hair is dryer...</li>
    <li> This can hold your curly hair in Honolulu, so it could work anywhere!  Easy to use and non-itchy.</li>
    <li> I have a flat top, and this stuff works great.  It last a long time since you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on youtube video. It is effective and the scent is decent.</li>
    <li> I love this jel. It is extremely thick so I don&#x27;t need to use that much, but it still holds really well. It keeps my hair up, but it still looks natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff holds your hair in place.  One could sit on the front of an airplane &amp; the hair will stay where you put it.</li>
    <li> My son wanted to spike his hair like some of his friends.  We had tried sprays/gels without luck.  This stuff actually works and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that will hold my straight thick hair all day and allow me to style or spike it. It is the only stuff I have used for years. Just like Elmer&#x27;s glue and a little goes a long way. Get it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! JOICO ICE SPIKER WATER RESISTANT STYLING GLUE IS ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET. MAJOR FACT - IT DOES NOT HARM YOU HAIR IN ANY WAY.  GREAT PRODUCT.

    <li> Very strong hold, but I was unable to keep my hair straight up using only this product (I have hair down to my cervical vertebrae). Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, the instructions are very minimalistic and I have no idea how to style hair; it pretty much just tells you to apply the glue to dry or damp hair and shape it like you want it -- probably works like that for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair gel for a long time. It gives a awesome spike that holds for hours.</li>
    <li> I borrowed this from my friend for my wedding. My hair didn&#x27;t move all day!! This is the only styling product that holds my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different gels, welding creams etc and nothing holds like this stuff does; your hair isn&#x27;t going anywhere, even during a hurricane.</li>
