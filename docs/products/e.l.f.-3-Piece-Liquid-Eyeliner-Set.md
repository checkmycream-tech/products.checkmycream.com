      <li>They are nice quality and a good amount for the price you pay!</li>
      <li>Good for kids and makeup play time, dressing up or Haloween</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve been a fan of ELF products for some time, I have shied away from trying this one thinking that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for just $1 (on the ELF website/Target).</li>
      <li>Not at all good, doesn&#x27;t stick for</li>
      <li>Fun for going out, great quality for the money.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love e.l.f. make up.</li>
      <li>Ok product, but it seemed watery when I put it on.</li>
      <li>I love this trio.</li>

      <li>My favorite of these three is the clear one with the sparkles.</li>
      <li>Super excellent for such a low price, but requires frequent reapplication.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>You can apply the dark liner first and the glitter liner can be applied right on top of that because it goes on like a clear gel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an older gal</li>
      <li>Not for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite eyeliner of all times, I use it everyday in either black or midnight.</li>

<li> This is my favorite eyeliner of all times, I use it everyday in either black or midnight.</li>
<li> I was shocked: it is very pigmented, easy to apply, does not smudge or budge, although it does not claim to be waterproof.</li>
<li> and it has a strong tone while I use the other two as glitter because they have very subtle colors</li>
<li> It is difficult to apply and the black smudges and fades and rubs off too easily.</li>
<li> I start with a natural pink eyeshadow, then I spread the stardust lightly all over my eyelid and spread a few glitters of the copper randomly then finish off with the black line.</li>
<li> I only use the black one as eyeliner because it&#x27;s black</li>
<li> Glitter sucks but used to glitter on eyeshadow.</li>
<li> so that was a little disappointing.</li>
<li> the price is terrible these sell for .99 at target :\</li>

    <li> Not the greatest.  Good for kids and makeup play time, dressing up or Haloween</li>
    <li> great liner but the price is terrible these sell for .99 at target :\</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve been a fan of ELF products for some time, I have shied away from trying this one thinking that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for just $1 (on the ELF website/Target). When I finally did try it I was shocked: it is very pigmented, easy to apply, does not smudge or budge, although it does not claim to be waterproof. This is my favorite eyeliner of all times, I use it everyday in either black or midnight. Copper is a very pretty golden shimmer. Highly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I CAN BE A SPARKLY STAR PRINCESS NOW</li>
    <li> I love e.l.f. make up. It goes on super easy and is easy to remove at night. You don&#x27;t need to reapply it throughout the day and it does not bleed. The glitter is the best. You can apply the dark liner first and the glitter liner can be applied right on top of that because it goes on like a clear gel. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Glitter sucks but used to glitter on eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The copper really doesnt look copperish, more like gold glitter, and the glitter is a bit large.  Yet I still like it.</li>
    <li> Not at all good, doesn&#x27;t stick for more than an hour&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if it is the eyeliner or something else I ordered</li>
    <li> WHAT? I really wanted to like this product. It is difficult to apply and the black smudges and fades and rubs off too easily. The gold is beautiful but burns if it gets in your eye. Not for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> My favorite of these three is the clear one with the sparkles. I&#x27;m an older gal and this one just goes great with everything without me looking like I&#x27;m trying to be a teenager.</li>
    <li> the silver and the gold liners have no color to them, just the glitter so that was a little disappointing. Good product overall though</li>
    <li> I love this trio. Easy to apply, lasts all day and removes easily. Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Love it. They are nice quality and a good amount for the price you pay!</li>
    <li> Fun for going out, great quality for the money.</li>
    <li> I love them so much. I only use the black one as eyeliner because it&#x27;s black and it has a strong tone while I use the other two as glitter because they have very subtle colors and they can&#x27;t be used as eyeliner. I start with a natural pink eyeshadow, then I spread the stardust lightly all over my eyelid and spread a few glitters of the copper randomly then finish off with the black line. It makes me look like Cinderella. And the price is so good, three for 6 bucks!!! I LOVE THEM!!</li>
    <li> Ok product, but it seemed watery when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Sweet Jesus this eyeliner goes on smooth</li>
    <li> Super excellent for such a low price, but requires frequent reapplication.</li>
