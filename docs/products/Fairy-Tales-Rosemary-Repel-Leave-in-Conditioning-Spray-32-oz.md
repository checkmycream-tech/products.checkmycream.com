<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This conditioning spray is lovely and the price of this refill is excellent.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this spray. Especially when used with the fairy tales shampoo.  She is 6 &amp; we both love the scent.  It leaves her hair soft and shiny (she has curly, easily tangled hair).  I found it at Shop Rite once, but havent seen it sold anywhere else but online. Its pricey but its a good product. Plus it keeps the lice away.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it in my girls damp hair after washing. You can never be too careful when trying to ward off lice! Plus the smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> I really believe this product works. I spray on my kids hair every morning before we go out. My daughter spent over an hour watching a movie with a friend on an iPhone, head touching head the whole time, and what we didn&#x27;t know is that her friend&#x27;s head was full of lice. My daughter never got it. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Ok, so whether this actually keeps the head lice away or not is unknown.  However, thus far we have not had a re-occurring case of it.  I spray this on everything...bed linens, my daughters coat, head, clothes, and backpack.  Everyone comments on how nice it smells, even the children in her classroom who see me spraying down all of her stuff.  I would definitely recommend this product, in fact I will order more when mine is out.  Of all of the Fairy Tales Products this one carries the most \\&quot;Bug intoxicating and deterring\\&quot; aroma.  I love it, it smells nice just to spray around the bedroom before bed and I will bring it with me camping.  This is a must product!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had had this stuff when I was in India.  Smells great and the kids are bug free!</li>
    <li> I usually order this product right from Fairy Tales website but thought I would use Amazon due to the cheaper price. I love this product but when it arrived my shipping box was saturated. The shippers did not tape the cap and the cap opened and leaked everywhere. I ended up with half the bottle missing. Otherwise, great product!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this spray for two years now and so far have not had any lice! My two girls (5 and 7) like the smell of it and I like that it is made with natural ingredients rather than chemicals. This bottle is the refill so be sure you have a spray cap to screw onto it or keep the original bottle to refill.</li>
    <li> After one of my kids brought lice home from school we started to use this product.  We absolutely love it, however over a third of it leaked out of the bottle during shipping.</li>
    <li> Super value over what you pay in the salon or big box stores</li>
    <li> We use this every day. It has a nice smell and I think it prevents lice!</li>
    <li> Makes hair look greasy &amp; not crazy about the smell</li>
    <li> I recommend this products to others. Love how it cleans the hair and it is so soft. I hope it does it&#x27;s job by keeping the bugs out of my child&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Have used this product on my kids for two years.  Like the smell, the conditioning for my kids&#x27; hair, and the hope that we avoid lice in the house.</li>
    <li> My kids play Tball and I used to cringe every time they put the team helmets on after they had been on numerous other children; worried we would end up with lice.  Now I use this leave-in conditioner and no longer worry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure that this product works to repel lice. But it works nicely as a detangler for my girls&#x27; hair. If it has the added benefit to prevent lice, that&#x27;s fabulous. It has a nice, subtle rosemary smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a friend recommended it.  It has a pleasant smell, is a natual repellant instead of chemically enhanced, and it leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair in great condition.  Bought the leave in spray as well and LOVE it.  I plan to buy the conditioner too after the positive experience with these products.</li>
    <li> This brand of shampoo and conditioner are wonderful. First they smell fabulous!  So fresh and light floral. The shampoo leaves the hair super soft. The leave in conditioner makes the hair feel a bit residual but I think it has to to repel lice. We have not been reinfested so I say it works.</li>
    <li> Terrific product. Doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp &amp; repels lice wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Great smelling product.  We went through an episode of lice and now this mama is lice patrol.  We spray this in our kids hair daily and no return of the lice.</li>
    <li> Been using this product on my foster kids for over a year now and have not seen any lice in their long hair.</li>
    <li> We had 2 children bring lice home recently and went into an all out war trying to get rid of them.  Finally we brought in a professional lice removal service who showed us how to do a proper comb out (using the Terminator comb) and an enzyme type product to loosen the nit glue.  That combing technique made all the difference.  She did mention that some of the ingredients found in this product were known repellants for the live lice, and may prevent a re-infestation in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are spraying it on the girls hair in the morning to help style hair before school.  The smell is not great, but not bad either.  The product leaves hair feeling a little slick when wet, and a little tacky when dry, so works well as a styling product.</li>
    <li> has a very strong smell my girls run from me when I try to put it on them and I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference on the conditioning I was mainly buying as a preventative for the lice that spreads in schools</li>
    <li> After reading online that 34% of school aged kids have lice at any given time during the school year, I decided it was time to take preventative measures. I talked to a few people I knew and discovered that most of them weren’t doing anything to prevent lice, but those that were all said that they were using Fair Tales products . I can’t yet speak to whether these products actually work for preventing lice because my kids have not been exposed since we started using it (not to my knowledge anyway), but I can say that I love that this product is all natural. I can also say that I like the smell and the way it makes our hair look. Even IF it doesn’t actually work to prevent lice, I’d buy it again for those reasons alone. I just wish it was cheaper because at these prices I may not be able to afford to buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> Great product and an excellent price!!! Lice definitely stay away!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> We use this on everyone when playing outside. Applied along the hairline it seems to keep biting insects, ie mosquitoes and blackflies, away from tender kids. I also use it to keep ticks at bay. So far we have been very pleased to avoid the more toxic bug sprays.</li>
    <li> Top of bottle was not taped shut and had popped open during shipping. The package was completely saturated to the point the bottom was falling apart. I couldn&#x27;t believe Fedex still delivered it. Amazon CS took care of it. After talking to the pediatrician and reading other reviews, I opted not to re-order. Other than picture day, my kids now go to school with gelled or moused hair kept pulled back and we do head checks at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to order, I would place it as an individual order. Then if there is a shipping problem, other items won&#x27;t be ruined in the process.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent way to keep lice away during a long hot school year in the South.  Smell is not too bad.</li>
    <li> We use daily with both our daughters.  I find the conditioning spray works better than the conditioner.  It&#x27;s easy to use and helps rectangle hair too!</li>
    <li> Great product. My daughter&#x27;s hair is clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> Well I have been using it every day on my daughter since preschool and she has not had lice yet (even with some of her fellow classmates with a chronic history of it).  I also spray it on my hair and shirt every day.....I work in a school as well.  We go through one big bottle a year.  Also it is okay as a detangler even with my daughters curls.</li>
    <li> Great detangler while protecting against lice. All natural, smells good and worth the cost! I would highly recommend this to anyone who has to struggle to brush their daughters hair!</li>
    <li> So far so good....I spray this into my girls&#x27; hair every morning before school.  Great product and smells nice too!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  After dealing with those pesky critters, we started using this everyday.  It&#x27;s been 2 years.  We also  use the conditioning spray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray for several years, both for school and for outside play.  I even put it on their shoes and clothes to keep the bugs away.</li>
    <li> We use this in the morning to smooth out my girls&#x27; hair when styling.  This is not a stiff gel or styling product really.  It can be used in the place of water.  The primary purpose is to apply the scent and deter lice.  So far, no outbreaks yet.</li>
    <li> With a lice outbreak happening in our daughter&#x27;s kindergarten (school is very clean... just a couple of repeat offenders made for a quick outbreak) and we feel much better sending her off with this in her hair (and in a pony tail).  Smells natural, took her a day or two to get used to it since it&#x27;s not perfumed with artificial garbage.  Well worth buying the super size version (better value) and using daily.  An ounce of prevention, in this case, is WELL worth it... getting any critter in your kids&#x27; hair and the subsequent scrub down is first world problem nightmare.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Fairy Tales Shampoo, Conditioner and Detangling spray for 1 1/2 years now. My daughter has super thick, coarse hair and this works great. Last year in school we got 6 Lice Letters from school. Fortunately, my daughter never once got lice. Unbelievable. I tell everyone I can about this product. It does have kind of a medicinal, herb like smell. Duh, it&#x27;s rosemary after all. I have gotten used to the scent and my daughter doesn&#x27;t complain about it at all. Wish the conditioner was a little thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my two young girls hair for over a year.  No lice to date, even though they have been over to friends houses that have active lice issues.  This is one product my young school age girls can&#x27;t live without!</li>
    <li> we use it daily to hopefully keep the lice away</li>
    <li> I am a grown adult and I love this product for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling and I am able to comb my hair easily when it&#x27;s wet. It is light enough that my natural waves still come through when my hair dries. It also smells WONDERFUL. I have received many compliments on the scent of my hair and I have to believe it is this product. Also, I don&#x27;t have to worry about lice!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and my girls loved the scent.  We didn&#x27;t get lice from their classmates that had lice.  So it worked.  The only thing is I wished it came with a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this product, feels good on my girls hair although they don&#x27;t love the smell initially, it does smell good later on. I spray it on my hair before I go out at dusk to the park to repel the mosquitoes, seems to help. So far no lice :)Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> You have to get used to the smell, but now, I kind of like it. I sure hope it keeps my kids from getting lice. I can&#x27;t say they love when I spray it on them in the morning, but they&#x27;re used to it.</li>
    <li> This is a good weapon for head lice for children who go to daycare. It smells good and easy to spray and wash off. Also you can use it as a hairspray for your child.</li>
    <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller. Quick delivery &amp; product was as described. I use this conditioning spray on my daughter every morning &amp; this bottle lasts me about a year. Great value compared to buying the small bottle at my salon!</li>
    <li> We use this on our daughter who has long blonde hair. Every year there seems to be a head lice episode at school and my daughter has never come home with them while other children have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the fairytales products for years and I&#x27;m very pleased. Smells great!  Only downside is a couple of the items have leaked during shipping.</li>
    <li> I got the spray awhile a few weeks ago...and I just received this refill for when I use up all that is in the spray. I recommend for you to get this as a refill of if you have a spray nozzle thingy...then I guess you can use this one, but it&#x27;s pretty heavy if you use just this bottle. But I love this protect...I have only been using this product for a few weeks and it makes my hair feel incredibly soft and smell good...and knowing that it&#x27;s keeping the lice away makes this one of daily hair product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works for keeping the lice away (I am very hopeful it does as a battle this summer with the critters), but it does work well as a spray conditioner. The rosemary smell is somewhat strong at first, but in minutes after it dries, the smell goes away. I never want to battle lice again, and with the price of lice shampoos (for repeated washings week after week), this is a bargain.</li>
    <li> Awesome preventative!</li>
    <li> Both of my kids are in preschool.  I spray this in their hair every morning (i have to use a detangler anyway...why not use one that does double duty?).  I love the scent. No complaints.</li>
    <li> After a bout with lice, I now use this prodict on my childs hair before sending her off to school. I am hoping it will keep the critters away. My only complaint is that the scent is very strong, and while not really unpleasant, it is not our favorite. I guess the lice don&#x27;t care for it either as it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday on my son before he goes to school. He doesn&#x27;t have long hair but I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to buzz him if he got live either. So far so good. It smells nice too!</li>
    <li> ...there have been several lice scares at both my 5 and 9 year old children&#x27;s schools, but so far my kids have not had any problems.  Smells nice and natural and seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> Great product my kids all use it and my daughter especially she got lice this yr from school and it was awful she has long thick hair and this helps out now</li>
    <li> My kids use this every morning as their detangled and I swear it works! The two times my girls have gotten lice both occurred when they weren&#x27;t using this spray.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! My daughters never leave home without a spritz of Fairy Tales! We also love the smell, although, I could see why some people wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> So far this has kept the lice away! We have been using it for a little of a month! Lice is always a big issue at school so I always use this in my girls hair! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it makes thier hair a little greasy looking!</li>
    <li> Our daughter wears it every day since the one time toward the end of the school year, in a rush I forgot to use it and sure enough she caught head lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has ever had to with head lice or nits (eggs), it&#x27;s unpleasant a hassle as imaginabe. For the job it does &amp; it works, the Rosemary smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this spray for over a year now. I do believe it has helped my daughter stay lice free during the school year, although there were cases reported in her class. I also love the smell. The product is really excellent! The price is good for the size, too. The description should have said that this is a refill package though. It has no spray nozzle ... Luckily I still have the old spray to refill it to ... So, just keep that in mind when you are ordering the product.</li>
    <li> Here it is a couple of months later of using this product on a regular basis. At the time of purchase my daughter had the rid x system done twice and the prescription lice treatment done twice. All times we spent HOURS washing clothes and checking her hair. It just kept coming back. After the second prescription treatment we ordered the two small bottles of the shampoo and conditioner. we also ordered the small bottle of conditioning spray. We would wash and condition, then the next day before school spray her hair. Its amazing she never has had lice since. Great size to refill the little bottle.</li>
    <li> It really helped when my daughter had lice and helped keep lice away after she was rid of it, we are still using it just to protect her from ever getting it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this through Amazon, but directly from the retailer, however, after almost two years of using this product and their shampoo religiously on my daughter, we are dealing with yet another lice event.  Not just that, but her hair started thinning out.  Combing is the only way to get rid of lice and continuously checking hair.  I hoped this product would work but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I started to use this when my son&#x27;s school mates keep getting lice and i refused to have to go through that craziness. I spray it in his hair every morning before school. I follow the directions and make sure I get it on his neck and shoulders too, and so far we haven&#x27;t had to deal with lice, knock on wood. The scent is strong but does dissipate about 10 minutes later. Also this is a really great leave in conditioner, I&#x27;ve used it on my hair that&#x27;s down to my waist many times and it really helps with tangles. Also this bottle will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Haven&#x27;t had any issues with head lice while using this product. We use it every morning before school. Makes hair very soft. Only complaint is the smell but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> As soon as the word lice was in the subject of an email from the school, this was going into my kids hair. So far, we have made it through several cases of classmates having lice. Grossed out but this stuff works.</li>
    <li> Smells good and really does work to repel.  When four cousins slept together all but one got lice.  I attribute that to the fairytales.  I work at a preschool and I use this as a preventative.  Spray my hair while it&#x27;s still wet before I use any styling products.  It keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This works, because we do not have a lice problem, but it is definitely drying to the hair :(</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. Smells wonderful. Keeps hair free of lice at school and sports events where kids share a batting hat. The best is it conditions the hair with natural oils. I recommend this to every parent that has children.</li>
    <li> We swear by this product and we use it all year round.  As a plus we noticed it repeals some outside bugs flying bugs too!</li>
    <li> We have no had any repeat occurrence from the dreaded lice bugs since using this product. I spray it in the hood of their coats and on the inside of their winter hats before leaving for school each morning.  They also get a quick misting on their heads to prevent any little critters from taking up residence.  Definitely worth the money we spend preventing them from entering our home rather than all the time, tears, and effort once they make their way in.  I wish we had known about it beforehand!</li>
    <li> i bought this item expecting to receive a spray as it is defined as a spray, however it is just the bottle no spray! i do not want to pay the expense to return the item so now i have to go out and buy a spray bottle and incur an additional cost to be able to use this product.  they should not advertise it as a spray but instead a refill bottle.  very disappointed and would not purchase from them again as i would not trust that what i receive is what was advertised.</li>
    <li> We have 3 girls with different variety of hair types (tight kinky curls all they way to almost completely straight).  We use this every day for detangling while brushing in the morning. It smells great and it works.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Smells great. Works very well! It&#x27;s a staple in our house.</li>
    <li> My kids never leave the house without wearing all Fairy Tale&#x27;s products. All natural and smells really great too.</li>
    <li> This spray is an essential part of our morning routine before school and summer camp. The product has greatly reduced our lice exposure!</li>
    <li> My child came home with lice a few months ago, and after learning that her school has a VERY soft policy about letting kids with lice return to school, I feared her getting it again.  I have sprayed her hair with this every morning, in addition to pulling it back into a ponytail, and so far, so good. She&#x27;s not crazy about the scent but I do not find it offensive.  Kind of smells like shaving cream, so it is a clean scent.  Her hair is thick and  waist-length and the detangler works well on it.  I also like the informational pamphlet enclosed which provided a lot of practical tips for parents for preventing lice.</li>
    <li> Lice are everywhere and so far my children are lice free. I use the shampoo and then the hair spray every morning. Nice scent and it&#x27;s organic so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re dousing your children with chemicals.</li>
    <li> The best in Lice prevention. We use every Fairy Tales products, gel, leave in conditioner and hairspray. We love that it&#x27;s all natural, organic and most of all, very effective!</li>
    <li> Great item, shipped fast!</li>
    <li> We battled with lice coming home from the kids schools 3X&#x27;s in one year! we would treat, kill, comb and they would come home about a month later with lice! We started using this product after we treated for the third time and we have been lice free for a year! Spray a little on every morning when combing their hair and you are protected!</li>
