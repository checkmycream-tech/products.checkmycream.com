<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I often work third shift and find it annoying trying to sleep in the day with all the light filtering in my room.  A friend suggested a sleep mask and I found this beauty....I know no one else sees the awesome zebra print but just like cute pj&#x27;s this is sleeping in style. Super silky material inside makes me feel like a million bucks while I&#x27;m catching z&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s cute.  I originally bought this to be part of a gag gift and didn&#x27;t end up including it.  I use a sleep mask regularly so I decided to go ahead and try it out.  The material is somewhat stiff and doesn&#x27;t fit the contours of your face.  The headband, while adjustable, is pretty skimpy.  Basically, it&#x27;s cheap.  It would probably be okay if you&#x27;re trying to catch a few winks on a flight, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for nightly use sleeping in a bed.  Others have higher opinions, so your mileage may vary, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good, durable sleep mask, spend the extra few bucks on something else.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I can&#x27;t sleep if there is any light and these are amazing! Blocks the light great and is soft but not static feel.</li>
    <li> The satin is cool and soothing against the skin. Has adjustable band for perfect fit. I can&#x27;t sleep without it now! It does an amazing job blocking out light to ensure a better rest.</li>
    <li> For being the cheapest sleep mask when I bought it, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent.  Adjustable band (though maybe not good for small heads), smooth and not plastic feeling cloth.  Stayed in place overnight and worked like it should.  Probably not the best or nicest, but you get a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is amazingly smooth and really nice. Love that it has an adjustable head strap which keeps it from being too tight on the eyes.</li>
    <li> For the price...it&#x27;s OK.  It&#x27;s a bit smelly out of the bag, like plastics....and it&#x27;s super thin.  Attached strap is really cheap, so I don&#x27;t see it lasting very long.  I think I paid $5 for it, so you get what you pay for in this instance.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask works fine, like most others. It prevents light from getting through but the material is not as soft as you would think against your face.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted a sleep mask to block out the nightlight her sister needs and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.  When this mask arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality!  It is soft, thick, and well constructed.  I also love that the straps are adjustable since I needed to make it fit a child&#x27;s head.  And my daughter loves the zebra print.  It&#x27;s perfect!  I would definitely recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews. I hate this thing. It is very stiff &amp; uncomfortable. The adjustable strap is very thin. This is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing sleep masks for years, this brand and style has been my favorite for the past 5 years! It really does block out the light, it&#x27;s super soft, and adjustable which I love! I can&#x27;t sleep without my mask! :-)</li>
    <li> OK. They do not fully block the light...but it is sufficient. The pattern is cool though.</li>
    <li> Bought the Swissco Zebra patterned Sleep Mask to sleep a little later on days off work.  First of all, light gets in around the nose area. Quite a bit, in fact. Poor fit there.  Next, light, even DIM, indirect light, gets through the mask materal, and brighter light is worse.  If the nose area is loose fitting for a Guy, it must be even worse for a Woman.  Because of the Satiny materal, the thin elastic bands, and the non-contoured shape, it moves around if you shift  side-sleeping positions.  Lastly, the elastic bands will never hold up to long term use, or washings.  The Zebra Pattern is catchy.  But the mask sucks.  I believed the reviews here, that it was effective, and a good value, and all that other Baloney. But, now I belive those glowing reviews are Company plants.  Those reviews conned me into wasting 5 bucks that I might have otherwise spent on a better quality/ better performing product.  I sleep mostly on my sides. And change positions  during the night, so for me ANY mask is going to be a difficult thing to keep from being annoyed by.  But THIS product is annoying, just sleeping on your back.  Save your money from impulsively buying a BARGAIN item, that will either stay in a drawer, or go in the trash.  Mine stayed in a drawer, til I transferred it to the trash.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really liked the pattern and the design on the sleep mask. However, what I didn&#x27;t really like was the material that it was made out of. It was kind of on the hard side, which made it not so flexible when I would put it on my face.</li>
    <li> Extra item to go with my daughters sleeping bag</li>
    <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> mask is nice and tick and comfortable; the band however wasn&#x27;t very elastic and after one week of wearing it, it seems very loose and doesn&#x27;t hold mask in place.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to sleep with a sleep mask.  This one is adorable and she loved it!  The price is great also.</li>
    <li> Very stylish, for bed time!&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it, very soft, but the material is kind of cheap, great for the price though</li>
    <li> This is a cute sleep mask but it shifts too much and really doesn&#x27;t keep out the light as much as I wish it would. Luckily, I don&#x27;t need to use one of these too often so it&#x27;s fine for what I need it for but if you use a sleeping mask all the time don&#x27;t get this one. Pay the extra money and get a good one.</li>
    <li> For only $5, this mask is great. it&#x27;s lightweight and blocks out the light really well. It&#x27;s the first sleeping mask I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I like it a lot. The cheetah print is cute, too! The strap is a little tight, but it&#x27;s adjustable. I find it very comfortable! A great buy!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this mask!  She says it&#x27;s very comfortable to sleep in and isn&#x27;t tight around her head like some masks tend to be.</li>
    <li> Fits nicely and is comfortable, and construction is about what you&#x27;d expect for a $4.00 item from China. Let&#x27;s be reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER-  *** this thing SMELLS.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really terrible, actually. REEEKS. I hand washed it and let it air dry, and it still smells like complete crap. And considering it&#x27;s proximity to my nose when I wear it, this is a noteworthy concern. I tried to give it to my cat to shred for her amusement, but she rejected it. To the garbage this will go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a sleep mask so I can&#x27;t compare it to much... But this feels great on your eyes at night, just like a pillow for them to rest. I&#x27;m a male, so I use the zebra print on my eyes and the black satin showing, hehe. If I know anybody looking for very good value on a sleep mask, I would recommend them to get this one.</li>
    <li> This mask fell off when I slept and the elastic part stretched out. Go spend the extra dollars, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This was not much more comfortable then a 1.00 one that we had previously, it looks better but thats a bout it. Shipping took FOREVER - come on Amazon just over two weeks?</li>
    <li> The sleep mask was for my 11 year old daughter... She loves it.  She shares a room and hates the TV light in her face.  She sleeps like a log now!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know sleep could be so peaceful. I have terrible sleeping habits and sleep in the daytime sometimes and this mask darkens it like it is night time. Didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.</li>
    <li> Blocks light and is super comfy</li>
    <li> Lets light in around the nose like most masks, doesn&#x27;t bother me. Strap is VERY flimsy, and no matter how I adjust it, this has fallen off all 3 nights I used it. Cute though.</li>
    <li> I bought this so my nocturnal boyfriend can watch tv and have lights on while Im asleep. (I sleep with the door open for the ac to get in) Its very comfy and keeps most light out. It also fits well and is adjustable. If I roll around too much one night, it will start to slide up and eventually come off. Also a little light seeps in from the bottom of the mask, but not enough to cause problems.</li>
    <li> It got here pretty fast but it also deteriorated even faster. What do I mean? Well... the band thta is used to attack it to your head and keep it there while you sleep started unraveling the same day. Today the left side of the band is hanging on for dear life. I will admit that its very comfortable but I know it won&#x27;t be here for long. I give it two more days before it completely pops! This sucks and I will unfortunately have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves sleeping in pitch black, where I like to leave the hall-light on ;) We found a middle ground in this cute little sleeping mask! LOL&lt;br /&gt;It works great and is made of durable material. The only thing she noticed is that it does tend to stretch out every couple days and if she doesn&#x27;t fit it back to her head it ends up coming off in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;But for the affordable cost, I think this product is worth 4 stars. :)</li>
    <li> Bought it for my 12 year old daughter.  She loves it! Totally recommend.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Good quality, great price!</li>
    <li> Great add on price. Good quality. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, or slip off my face. Not annoying to wear either.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is wonderful!!  Great quality at such a cheap price, I sleep soooooo good with it, better then a sleeping pill!  Very highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this, not only does it block most of the light out it has an adjustable strap and does not fall off. Only light the goes through are the little spot near the nose but most shows more than this. It delivered promptly and early! The fabric feels fab on my skin and no rough edges. Also looks very sexy. The price is perfect. I will order more!</li>
    <li> I purchased this needing a good sleeping mask since I go to bed a lot earlier than everyone else in the home. It&#x27;s very plush, and does a great job keeping the light out. I also adore the zebra striping. The only complaint I&#x27;d have about this is that it does make around my eyes a little sweaty after long wear, but other than that, its great!</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few masks- this is comfortable and great quality. Amazing price with the add on item option too.</li>
    <li> this mask worked great for a few months until it started to get loose and then it was time to replace it</li>
    <li> I always use a sleep mask while traveling, as well as at home.  So far I have ordered 3 of these masks (love the animal prints) and I love them.  Compared to other sleep masks, they are light and silky, not bulky, do well in the washing machine, and are reasonable priced.  A must have if you like a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> Light and comfy, perfect</li>
    <li> nice and soft on the eyes, but the one scrap give little support to the back of my head</li>
    <li> This sleeping mask is very good. Doesnt feel like is tighting my head and wont let light bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!</li>
    <li> it was nice for a starting sleep mask. I have since lost it and bought a better one that blocks the light by your nose.</li>
    <li> I love my mask its soft and not bulky at all. It helps me sleep when my husband want to have the light and tv on at night. Recommend buying.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask works good as long as you keep your eyes closed. If you open your eyes while wearing it you can see some light coming through at the bottom where it touches your nose.</li>
    <li> This is a good, cute sleeping mask for the price. I would give it four stars because it&#x27;s not really padded, but still blocks out light. It has a pretty strong chemical smell - so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells and get headaches easily, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. (I&#x27;m going to try washing it and putting a bit of lavender oil on it.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. I had to wash it with a bit of soap and water before wearing it because it smelled like crap.</li>
    <li> My wife relies heavily on a mask to sleep at night (she&#x27;s a light sleeper) and is very particular when it comes to the feel of the mask and the usability of the elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask passed all of her requirements phenomenally, would definitely purchase again if she ends up losing it</li>
    <li> This mask does not block any light.</li>
    <li> This slides off during the night.  I am using it until I find a decent one.  Will keep looking, any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I bought this to have two when the other is in the wash. I love these masks, comfortable and satin so it doesn&#x27;t add to your wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Looks good and very functional, my wife enjoy it along with zebra slippers</li>
    <li> Just as described.. I think the nose cut out could be more defined.. because you can still see a lot of light it doesn&#x27;t go with the shape of your face very much.</li>
    <li> Our bedroom gets the east sun and this mask provides me with a couple of hours additional sleep. Plus it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local dollar store... It&#x27;s very stiff and tight fitting. And I don&#x27;t have a large head haha. I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money, I&#x27;ve found other eye masks much better than this for cheap. Definitely don&#x27;t pay $5.00 for it though... Just go to the $1 store if you want to see for yourself.</li>
    <li> It came off my head while sleeping all night ( side sleeper) but is very comfortable and great for taking naps.</li>
    <li> elastic was very thin</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t block enough light. It fits poorly around the nose area, letting in light. The strap doesn&#x27;t fit my head and is a flimsy elastic. It never stays on my head the whole night, unless I wrap it into my hair. For 5 I dollars guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The part that covers the eyes is perfect for me, not uncomfortable on my eyes or making my face sweat. I just wish elastic was more durable.  There are multiple individual strands sewn together to make the one band but these individual strands break very easily. Otherwise 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great SIMPLE sleep mask. I don&#x27;t need something that blocks every last speck of light. I don&#x27;t need something with gears and whistles and fancy adjustments. I just need something ~comfortable~ that will give me the feel of a darkened environment when I&#x27;m sleeping. This does the trick. Other masks I&#x27;ve tried have been too heavy, too thick, too stiff, too complex, too loose, too tight - or just plain uncomfortable. This mask stays in place and blocks enough light to let me sleep peacefully. The strap is easily adjustable and it stays in place even without being super tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found an additional benefit to an eye mask - my chronic dry eye and allergies aren&#x27;t as bad when I&#x27;m wearing it. Apparently, my eyes have a habit of not closing all the way and the mask keeps air and allergens out of them during the night. Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this isn&#x27;t the kind of mask that will last forever. It&#x27;s cheap and simple - and that means it&#x27;s likely to wear out. The strap tends to stretch out a bit, making you have to adjust it tighter and tighter to keep the same fit. Eventually, it will probably stretch beyond usefulness. Also, the stitching at one end is getting loose on mine, so the strap will one day likely come undone entirely. It&#x27;s a toss-up which of these things will happen first. I bought a second to have on hand, so when this one DOES wear out, I&#x27;ll have the next one ready. At such a low price, it&#x27;s actually nice to swap out for a new one every year or so.</li>
    <li> The rubber band snapped off the mask literally within minutes after trying it on. 5 bucks down the drain. Also, its made out of polyester, not cotton so it not that comfortable and there is some light leackage on the bottom of the mask. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband.  He loves wearing it.</li>
    <li> they work great, my husband even started using it.</li>
    <li> I love the print and the material is really soft. I cannot wear this overnight because it slips off when I sleep. I was only looking for something to block light in the morning since my husband gets up much earlier than I do so it does the trick for that.</li>
    <li> it does not block out all the light! a lot of light comes through under the nose.... but as long as my eyes are closed, I cannot tell if the light is coming in. It is very comfortable and strips are adjustable! good for the money!!! I wish amount of light under the nose was minimal, because sometimes I do get awaken by that, haha.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Swisscom satin Zebra sleep mask. It is so soft and lightweight I forget I have it on. It blocks out all of the light which is great for sleeping during the day.</li>
    <li> loved the design and quallity</li>
    <li> Needed a sleep mask for when the sun comes pouring into my high windows of my apartment like a hellbeast-- the zebra mask got the job done. Got the goofy design because my gf likes it. Soft, faux silk texture-- good for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using this every nite to block out the morning light so she can sleep longer according to her. Cute for little kids, very light</li>
    <li> I bought this sleep mask for my daughter because she simply ADORES zebra print!  :)&lt;br /&gt;She absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long before the elastic band broke on one side but it was an easy fix with a few stitches with a needle and thread.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we were just the unlucky ones to get one that didn&#x27;t get a good stitch.....&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its great.....</li>
    <li> There is minimal cushioning and the straps are very thin.  Fairly comfortable</li>
    <li> Feels amazing! Super soft and dark on the inside so the light stays out. I love the way it looks! I even bought one for my mom. But after a week the strap stretched out on one side and looks like it might break. :/</li>
    <li> I mean I don&#x27;t usually sleep with sleeping masks but I thought it was kind of hilarious that I&#x27;m laying down and I can still see the sun peaking through my curtains because the mask doesn&#x27;t come down far enough to keep the sun out of your eyes. I have to sleep during the day so I can work 3rd shift and obviously the sun makes it kind of hard to sleep. This sleeping mask is cute but doesn&#x27;t really keep the sun out of your eyes.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and the receiver loved it</li>
    <li> i love the eye mask and the adjustable strap is very helpful. the only thing bad about the mask is that the material is a bit to thin. also they should have a different kind of material on the side that rests against your face. the satin makes my face really hot when im sleeping. but over all really good eye mask for the price</li>
    <li> it does what it says. its lightweight makes it nice for warm nights; no sweating .</li>
    <li> Omg mine came in yesterday I got it out of the mail today just now ahhhh its so pretty I love it</li>
    <li> Broke don&#x27;t block out light very well. But is cute</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid Chinese products for years. While there are many other cheap Made in China sleep mask for less than 1/2 of the price of Swissco Sleep Mask, I bought this sleep mask assuming it was a good quality sleep mask that&#x27;s made else where except China. Boy, I was wrong. This sleep mask is made in China! That explains why the elastic is already loosen up after only a month. The sleep mask was comfortable at first, but since the elastic is loosen up, it&#x27;s no longer comfortable. My bad for not checking with the seller the manufacture location of this eye mask before the purchase. Should have spent a little bit more to get a quality eye mask made in USA!</li>
    <li> It was a gift and she loved it!</li>
    <li> A little bit a light comes in by your nose but this product works great for what i use it for. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had a friend recommend a sleep mask that was much more expensive than this one. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would even be able to sleep with having a mask on my face so I thought I would try this one first since it was much more reasonably priced.  I had no problems from the first night and was amazed at what a difference it makes. I have wooden blinds on my bedroom windows that are lined but quite a bit of light still shines through.  This sleep mask helps block that out on weekend mornings when I can grab a little more sleep and it also works great when my husband stays up later than me reading.  This mask blocks his light and lets me fall asleep faster.  It is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> so-so  I find that it makes me sweat</li>
    <li> Got for a flight across the country. so comfortable and great fit</li>
    <li> I would like to start out by saying that my neighbors bough an outside light bulb that burns about as bright as the friggin sun itself. They never turn it off. Ever. I&#x27;m tempted to shoot it out with my son&#x27;s BB gun but I think they would replace it with the actual sun. This light also happens to shine right through my bedroom window and into my eyes. Not good times at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this sleep mask. It&#x27;s cute and surprisingly comfy for something literally strapped to your face. I use it every night and no longer dream off shooting out the neighbors light. However I would like to buy my own crazy bright light and set it up outside their window, not that I&#x27;m petty or anything.</li>
    <li> This is my first sleep mask so I can&#x27;t compare it with other products but I like it. It&#x27;s very lightweight and the adjustable strap doesn&#x27;t cut into my head. It isn&#x27;t contoured to fit snug around the nose so it lets in a little light, but the light is so minimal it doesn&#x27;t interfere with falling asleep. It&#x27;s very comfortable and for the price - how can you go wrong!</li>
    <li> Mask doesn&#x27;t fit my face at all. Slips off during the night. Also made of weird feeling fabric. It feels funny on my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love zebra print! I bought this item as a gift for myself for Christmas. I think I will love it!</li>
    <li> I needed something to block out the light since my daughter falls asleep with the TV on. This product works great and it&#x27;s very comfortable. For the price this was a steal.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for every night use or someone with a big head. I used this 4 nights out of the week for about a month and it broke</li>
    <li> I absolutely looovvveee Zebra and this mask is sooo comfy...i appreciate it to the fullest...cause i dont sleep at night i sleep in the day so its a big help...i have thick dark curtains but they dont help too much anymore...GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Very nice sleep mask love the silky material. Blocks out light very well and love the adjustable strap so it does not slip off your face.</li>
    <li> For my granddaughter. She loved it. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Fits well and doesnt slide around when I sleep.  The texture is soft and isnt hot.  Ths mask is large enough that I can pull it over my nose to block out the light that would otherwise peak through between my nose and my eyes.  fits the bill without being too pricey.</li>
    <li> Nothing to dislike, nice material, great design and colors.  Bought for my daughter and she loves it.  Came quickly too.</li>
    <li> These sleep masks are perfect! They block out light, they have adjustable bands, ensuring a snug fit, and they are cute! Perfect combination! I sleep happy in these :-)</li>
    <li> i like it and it does the job of helping me fall asleep in the dakr.  i do not like that it slips off during the night</li>
    <li> Silky soft against my eyes.</li>
    <li> Made of soft material, comfortable and the wife loves the pattern. Light does creep in from the sides but not enough to cause any issues.</li>
    <li> Satin is really comfortable! It&#x27;s flat too so it doesn&#x27;t move around too much. The strap is really stretchy and adjustable, but I haven&#x27;t adjusted it since the size is pretty good! 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Silky smooth. Adjustable elastic head band. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Good durable material, and fun to use</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I am very hard to go to sleep.If I see a touch of light I cannot go to sleep! This helps me go to sleep while my husband has his light on! IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> Gotten to help aid sleep and it works so well for that.  Nice print makes it look good too.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> It works just great, but the elastic hurts.  It has to be tight enough to keep it on your head, but I just cant find a comfortable way to wear it that doesnt hurt after a while.  I still use it though and when I need it, I&#x27;m happy to have it.  If anyone knows of one that doesnt hurt, I&#x27;m all ears!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for these fun little party favors.  I ordered these as a gift for my co-workers.  I was very impressed with the customer service, too.  These arrived quickly and are exactly as described.  Super good price!</li>
    <li> Love these. Very comfortable and do the job well keep out all the light and are adjustable.</li>
    <li> I like the mask and will find it useful but it is a little on the small side. Very attractive!!!!! Will be great for travel.</li>
    <li> Seems cheaply made sending it back.</li>
    <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t keep light out as well as I have experienced with other sleep masks, you will have to worry about light through the nose area but definitely a comfortable mask, the materiel was much softer than expected...</li>
    <li> I washed to make smell nice. Is pretty soft and easy to wear and adjust. Not too  bad and does the job.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask was only okay. It was cheap and comfortable enough, the strap didn&#x27;t cut into my head was really the only good thing about it. Otherwise, the satin wasn&#x27;t breathable and started to piece apart after using it for only a week. I&#x27;ve only had the mask for two months and then the strap broke. So all in all, if your looking for a really cheap mask, you&#x27;ve found it. Otherwise, I would invest a little more money to get something that will last longer.</li>
    <li> works great - soft on the face - my 9 yr old daughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft- not crinkly like some &amp;#34;satin&amp;#34; sleep masks. This feels like the real deal instead of that weird, cheap, halloween costume texture. Adjustable band. Only tiny complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t sit flush enough to block out all light. But it&#x27;s probably just my face. Haha</li>
    <li> Fits secure and love the satin fill and adjustable strap.</li>
    <li> Light seeps in around nose area.  Not happy with that.  Fabric feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> very soft and has an adjustable headband.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is so comfortable! And most importantly, it stays put during the night and blocks out all the light in the room. It&#x27;s a life-saver when my boyfriend gets up early for work and needs the light on.</li>
    <li> Blocks everything out, love it. Sleeping much better now!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! Love the adjustable strap :)</li>
    <li> I finally decided it was time for me to get a sleeping mask. I am very sensitive to light and am an extremely light sleeper so I needed something to help me sleep. This is the first sleeping mask I have ever purchased so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to...however when I received it, the strap was already loose (practically about to tear) and was all tangled up and would not straighten out (even tried ironing). It has fallen off a few times while I slept. It also covers up most light but some still seeps in through the nose area and can somewhat be seen through the mask. The only plus is that the satin is very soft. I am planning on purchasing a different one, which hopefully will be able to provide more light coverage than this one.</li>
    <li> Works well and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This mask wears comfortably and seems to stay in place. Blocks light amazing!</li>
    <li> Quality is what I expected; not good but not bad.  Overall, I knew what I was getting so I am happy....but it is really cute!</li>
    <li> OK, I got this for my wife, and she finds it to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it has left non-removable stains on our sheets in a fancy zebra pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you do decide to buy it, you better wash it (hand wash only) first to try to get some of the non-safe ink out of it. (or only use very dark sheets).</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but was good enough for the price.  I got this as an add-on for $5.  It still let light in from the bottom portion, but was better than not having anything.  Strap is adjustable so no issues with being too tight or too loose.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes it so much easier to sleep on the couch when the kids wake up too early blocks out light well and is soft</li>
    <li> very soft on my skin and fits perfect.  only problem, that is comes off by morning.  Great quality so far...</li>
    <li> I granddaughter, age 13, loves this sleeping mask. Despite window coverings, her room gets light at dawn.  She loves the silky feeling and the design. Personally, my favorite was the lighter, larger one that has Velcro closing.</li>
    <li> I have used many sleep masks but these are by far my favorite. They block out the light very well and when the elastic starts wearing out it&#x27;s adjustable!</li>
    <li> Its a pretty nice mask. The zebra print is very cute and the satin fabric, with the slight padding, is comfortable. The only problem I have with it is the elastic. If not wore higher up on the head it can dig into the ears and hurt. Also, over time the elastic stretches out loses it&#x27;s strength. This results in having to tighten the elastic strap more. The mask blocks out light pretty well but it lets in some light at the nose.</li>
    <li> Not a bad mask. It arrive quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I swear it keeps all of the lights out of my face when I&#x27;m in my rack on the ship and it&#x27;s so soft.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Works perfect.  Covers the eyes really well. Super soft.</li>
    <li> This is stiff and doesn&#x27;t breathe. When I put it on it felt like my face was starting to sweat. The material is not comfortable even after being washed. It is dark. It does not form to your face so if you are looking for total black out its not the one you want.</li>
