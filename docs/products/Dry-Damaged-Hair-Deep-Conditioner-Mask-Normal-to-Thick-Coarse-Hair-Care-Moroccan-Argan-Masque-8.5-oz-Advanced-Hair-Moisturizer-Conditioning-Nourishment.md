<li> You will not believe how soft and silky your hair will feel once it is dried!</li>
<li> I have noticed that since I have moved to California my hair is very dry.</li>
<li> Not only is it dry, but it tends to look dull and flat.</li>
<li> I left it in my hair a few hours before rinsing it out.</li>
<li> It is thick, long, and coarse.</li>
<li> My hair are dry, damages and after few months I get split ends</li>
<li> I used a lot less of this than any other conditioner.</li>
<li> I have long, thick, colored hair that requires a lot of moisture.  </li>
<li> It is very thick and moisturizes instantly.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> After washing my hair I let it towel dry for about 10 minutes because my hair is very thick.</li>
<li> Finally a product that&#x27;s helps my course thick hair!!!</li>
<li> If you have thick course hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always been told I have horse hair because of how thick and course it is.</li>
<li> I have difficult to manage hair.</li>

    <li> Hair is so soft afterward and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair outside of my normal conditioner. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This leave in is great!  I have long, thick, colored hair that requires a lot of moisture.  I also swim three to four days a week and the chlorine dries my hair out.  I use this product twice a week and it works miracles!  My hair is shiny, soft, and conditioned.  I leave it in for 15 to 20 minutes per use.  I also have very sensitive skin that is acne prone and this product does not cause me to break out which is a concern for me with products that contain oils.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes!!!!! Finally a product that&#x27;s helps my course thick hair!!! I&#x27;ve always been told I have horse hair because of how thick and course it is. It breaks because its so dry even though I&#x27;ve used conditioner as well as oils. I started using arga oil and coconut oil almost a year ago and it didn&#x27;t help it be more shiney but it didn&#x27;t help much with the softness. I opened the gorgeous jar smelled it (smells wonderful), felt it thwn read the directions. After the first use my hair smelt amazing but I didn&#x27;t notice much of  a difference. So I tried it again a couple days later. After the third use (about a week later) my hair was much softer and it seemed to feel hydrated and oh so shiney. I now use it once a week and am amazed at how well this has helped my hair! After spending hundreds of dollars buying salon products that didn&#x27;t help much this is now my go to hair product! It even helps my curls look more even and not so frizzy. If you have thick course hair you must give this a try!!!! I did receive a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with tightly naturally curly hair. This conditioner was nice but not the best that I have tried. It was very conditioning and left my hair soft, but it did not provide a lot of slip to detangling my curly hair which is necessary for me. The smell is nice and not very overwhelming. I left it in my hair a few hours before rinsing it out. I will try it again to see if it is able to lock in my curl pattern and update my review then. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I didn&#x27;t think I would see results after just one use!!!! I really love it. I will recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Non grease. Will work for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Wow! It made my hair feel so soft like a silk. I&#x27;ve tried many other hair mask but none of them gave me such a quick result. Plus, It smells so good! I definitely will repeat this hair mask.</li>
    <li> I received this deep conditioner hair mask and I really like it. I have noticed that since I have moved to California my hair is very dry. Not only is it dry, but it tends to look dull and flat. It seriously looked damaged and had become pretty unmanageable. After using this hair mask every other night for 14 days I can report that my hair looks much healthier. It is not so dry and damaged that it cracks anymore. I am having the split ends cut off that remain visible after a 2 week treatment and will continue to use the hair mask to keep my hair looking this great. I love the Argan products. I have many of them now and I am pleased with each of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is very easy to use. After washing my hair I let it towel dry for about 10 minutes because my hair is very thick. Then I get a palm full of the cream into one hand and massage it into my hair with the other hand. It is very thick and smells great. It reminds me of being in a salon. It appears to be professional quality. Once it is completely applied to my hair from top to tips I wrap my hair in my towel and let it sit. The directions call for 5 to 10 minutes, but I usually let mine sit between 10 and 15 minutes because I like to pamper myself and it feels good. After it conditions, just rinse the mask with warm water. You will not believe how soft and silky your hair will feel once it is dried! I let my hair air dry, I don&#x27;t need any extra damage from a blow dryer, plus my hair is so thick that I am honestly too lazy to blow dry it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance lingers in my hair, I get compliments at work about how my hair looks and SMELLS. I tell everyone that asks or comments about my hair about this product. It can almost sell itself. My mother and mother in law both want to use mine, but I am too stingy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was made in Israel, which means a lot to me. And it is backed with a satisfaction guarantee. If you don&#x27;t love what it does for your hair then return it and getyour money back, no questions asked.</li>
    <li> Excellent,  left my hair feeling soft and smelling great.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, &amp; gives you smooth hair, reducing frizziness.</li>
    <li> Great product for normal to thick hair. It repairs the damaged hair. I felt great difference after one use. It smells amazing. I love how my hair feel after applying it in my hair. My hair are dry, damages and after few months I get split ends so I was looking for a good product which I can use after my hair cut and I dont get damaged hair again. Luckily I got the opportunity to try this product and give my honest opinion. I am surprised to see how well this product works. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my daughters hair who has lots of it and very curly and dry.. i added some and massaged it in and let it sit for a few minutes rinsed it out and her hair was so soft and silky i love it... thanks for a great review product and at such a discounted price</li>
    <li> It really works. Give it a try and you can see the difference. Worth $20!</li>
    <li> I have difficult to manage hair. It is thick, long, and coarse. My hair also tends to be on the dry side so I need to replenish moisture quite often. This product doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. Which is very important to me because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells. I&#x27;ve used it twice since receiving it. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I would recommend this hair mask. I received this in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Used this just once so far and I am sold on it. My hair detangled easily and is very soft. I have naturally curly/wavy hair, and this was great for it! A little bit really does go a long way. I used a lot less of this than any other conditioner. It is very thick and moisturizes instantly.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this cause I damaged my hair from chemical straightening. This mask made my hair go back to its natural state after two uses. After the first use it helped it 50%.  I use this mask once every two weeks and it has made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
