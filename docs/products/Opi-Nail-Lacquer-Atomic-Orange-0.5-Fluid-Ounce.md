<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I read other reviews that said these were fake. The polish was just as described and exceeded my expectations. They are real OPI.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great color for summer because it&#x27;s orange but it&#x27;s rather very cool and calming to the eyes. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great color for Fall or for accenting hands with bright orange shade in any season. Resists chipping longer than most.</li>
    <li> Love this Orange polish Opi the best</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this color everywhere with no luck. I found it on Amazon and received it earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Happy fingers and toes!</li>
    <li> Really like this polish.....not only the color, but the fact that it dries so fast.</li>
    <li> We love the atomic orange - it needs 3 coats for full coverage.  It&#x27;s a bright (not neon) summery, melon-y orange color.  It&#x27;s been a week and it&#x27;s still not chipped.</li>
    <li> I love OPI. It doesn&#x27;t chip and it goes on so smooth. I&#x27;ve been looking for s true orange polish. I thought the Atomic Orange was it. Sadly this isn&#x27;t it. This color is a red orange, more red than orange.</li>
    <li> Atomic ORANGE??? Are they kidding? This doesn&#x27;t even remotely look like orange. I am especially peeved that I cannot return this for a refund. If I wanted coral red I would have ordered coral red. I also bought the yellow, which I love, but this is not what I ordered at all.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bright orange, but not tacky looking.  Perfect for summer.  Goes on smoothly, no drips, dries quickly to a high shine.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> When I first got my polish it was great, after using it three times it ran empty!!!  I bought this new, and feel i was giving a mostly empty bottle. Do not buy form them!!</li>
    <li> Great OPI color for summer. OPI always is the best coverage.</li>
    <li> Love the color and plan on ordering more colors in the near future.  I alternate this orange with a fuschia pink on my fingers and toes and top the look off with french white nail (tips only) and it the colors really pop.  Lots of compliments on the colors.  Packaging and shipping were great.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Atomic Orange polish made by OPI and I could not be more pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is just what you would expect based on the name.  I have been searching for the perfect orange polish for a long time - I had an orange polish I loved years ago and when it ran out I couldn&#x27;t find anything similar.  This is even better than that original polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how bright this color is, it&#x27;s great for the summertime.  And of course the quality is what you would expect from OPI.  A great product all around.</li>
    <li> Atomic Orange is the perfect name for polish.I originaly bought this to wear for halloween but it leans too cool more melon like,i do like the polish i think i will wait till summer to wear it as it is very bright almost neon.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a fan of OPI nail polish...I was so happy to see the big selection you had online! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Come on - it is nail polish!! All I can say is that it is a really pretty color to wear in the summer.</li>
    <li> The Atomic Orange shade is a little too red for my tastes. I wish I would have bought a more calmer and orange-r shade.</li>
    <li> I wish it was just a little bit brighter, but I suppose if it turned up too much more it would be considered a neon. Great thick color, needs only one or two coats max for full coverage.</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY, my favorite summer color</li>
    <li> OPI is supposedly a good, and expensive polish..However, it chips.  Every OPI I have owned has had the same problem.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Being as though Im a nail polish junkee this color was the perfect color to add to my nail polish display and the color is super bright so Im very pleased and the product was shipped fast and it came bubble wrapped and packaged nicely....</li>
