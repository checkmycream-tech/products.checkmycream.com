      <li>It covers well and washes out easy</li>
      <li>Work great for making it look like you have way more hair than you actually do.  </li>
      <li>so I bought light brown.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s actually fro my brother and he finds it very nice to use it.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know about other people saying it comes off easy</li>
      <li>I have ordered it for her in the past, and I found a better price through this company.</li>
      <li>I can get ready in an instant.</li>
      <li>I recommend that you wipe your face and brush your shirt frequently throughout the day or you could end up with embarrassing stains on them.  </li>
      <li>It covers up very well but makes your hair one solid color on the spot you spray it.</li>
      <li>So far there are no complaints.</li>
      <li>It does the job as far as covering</li>
      <li>Be aware of it getting wet because it does get on your forehead some.</li>
      <li>You have to be careful when using this product because it sprays out at high pressure.  </li>

<li> You have to be careful when using this product because it sprays out at high pressure.  </li>
<li> I buy this for my mom all the time, but I usually only can find single bottles.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed that you can wash out the spray and still have some left for the next day by using just water or maybe a little shampoo.  </li>
<li> The second day you will have less fallout from the product and it still works well.</li>
<li> Always used this item, but now I have two other sisters using it, so I bought the six-pack and gave it away.</li>
<li> I took a shot in the dark and did an amazon search</li>
<li> but it is still messy due to the over-spray....</li>
<li> but you can only use it on top of your head as the overspray is horrible for around your hairline that touches your face, neck or around your ears.</li>
<li> also if you touch your hair it will leave a mess on your hands .....</li>
<li> I had a few women at</li>
<li> Aside from being a little messy as I use plastic gloves to apply it It is a self esteem boost!</li>
<li> I mean you pay for one bottle 25 US$</li>
<li> Obviously that would be impossible to put in</li>
<li> The product is not good when sprayed it splatters all around.</li>
<li> I have used this product before and it is still disappointing....</li>
<li> Very disappointed and will not purchase again from there</li>
<li> Seller horrible to deal with</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s actually fro my brother and he finds it very nice to use it. So far there are no complaints.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great product with a cheap price next to the other product I have been using until I touched my head. It made my scalp a lil itchy and when I scratched It was all over my hands and under my nails. If you do not touch your head it could be good but you can only use it on top of your head as the overspray is horrible for around your hairline that touches your face, neck or around your ears.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because there simply isn&#x27;t anything out there better. Messy and will put a dark ring on your neck and collar by the end of the day, but the best coverage out there. I know because I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
    <li> This product works as a daily \\&quot;cheat\\&quot; for gray hair. It is not costly, easy to apply, and effective. Blah blah, blah, blah, blah!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is still disappointing.... It does the job as far as covering but it is still messy due to the over-spray.... these people need to work on that ...also if you touch your hair it will leave a mess on your hands ..... I wish they would improve on these items and then they would have a great product til then it is just an okay product !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a two tone color of natural hair, blonde/brown, which make it looks nice. Obviously that would be impossible to put in a can so I bought light brown. It covers up very well but makes your hair one solid color on the spot you spray it. Be aware of it getting wet because it does get on your forehead some. I had a few women at work check out my hair where I sprayed it and they said they couldn&#x27;t tell. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  It really does cover those pesky thinning spots.  I highly recommend this product.  Great for men and women.</li>
    <li> The best product bald spot gone just shampoo before bed  1 to 10 ,I give 10&lt;br /&gt;Super happy great look</li>
    <li> It covers well and washes out easy and it is great for the price.  I recommended it to my mom</li>
    <li> toppix is much better as it is organic and doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
    <li> Changed my life! I never worry about walking away from a crowd wondering if my scalp is showing! Great scent too!</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I took a shot in the dark and did an amazon search and it was there in bulk! The price was right lower the expected and the product works great since I have recently discovered my hair is thinning. Aside from being a little messy as I use plastic gloves to apply it It is a self esteem boost!</li>
    <li> But in Beirut/Lebanon ....Mr Izat Al Daouk the only importer of this product is selling it with 500% profit......I mean you pay for one bottle 25 US$.....&lt;br /&gt;I love the product I buy them threw amazon and than my cousin who lives in the US, ship them to me.....</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom all the time, but I usually only can find single bottles.  Thank you for selling this in a six pack!</li>
    <li> Damage after first use.  Seller horrible to deal with</li>
    <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t know about other people saying it comes off easy, that has not been my experience. I wear it to the gym all the time and it never runs.I like that it&#x27;s a spray, and not a salt shaker. I can get ready in an instant.</li>
    <li> Best price anywhere.  Very pleased.  couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> The product is not good when sprayed it splatters all around. Not as good as the ones purchased earlier! Very disappointed and will not purchase again from there</li>
    <li> Work great for making it look like you have way more hair than you actually do.  It&#x27;s actually a scalp color spray not a hair color spray.</li>
    <li> Always used this item, but now I have two other sisters using it, so I bought the six-pack and gave it away. 3 cans  for each sister. They were very happy!</li>
    <li> I find this product very useful in giving volume and root cover between hair color I cover up just the top roots and brush it thru the top of my hair for loads of volume...just be careful not to get your hair wet...</li>
    <li> You have to be careful when using this product because it sprays out at high pressure.  After some practice I&#x27;ve learned how to press the button just enough to control the spray.  It covers bald areas fast and effectively but over the day it flakes off onto your face and cloths.  I recommend that you wipe your face and brush your shirt frequently throughout the day or you could end up with embarrassing stains on them.  I&#x27;ve noticed that you can wash out the spray and still have some left for the next day by using just water or maybe a little shampoo.  The second day you will have less fallout from the product and it still works well.</li>
    <li> My mom has thinning hair, and she swears by this stuff. I have ordered it for her in the past, and I found a better price through this company.</li>
