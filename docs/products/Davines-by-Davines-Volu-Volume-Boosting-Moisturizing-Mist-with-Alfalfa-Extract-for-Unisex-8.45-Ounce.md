      <li>I cannot say enough good stuff about the Davines line of products.</li>
      <li>Love  live Davines products!</li>
      <li>This can&#x27;t be a coincidence - I&#x27;m 41 and the back top of hair was &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; - and after using this product for 2 months, the scalp has more hair there.  </li>
      <li>the spot that was thinning has more hair now!&amp;#34;  I HAVE to attribute it to this very natural product, as nothing else is different.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but it works really well for volumizing my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It has a distinct scent, which I happen to like</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

      <li>so I was a but leery at first</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to purchase again!</li>
      <li>The last seller I purchased this from skimmed product off the top</li>
      <li>I have fine, super straight, uncolored blonde hair and this product works wonders.</li>
      <li>I have a fine hair shaft, but a TON of hair, so my hair is easily weighed down with products.</li>
      <li>I was at a loss when Graham Webb Thick Infusion was no longer available at a reasonable price, but I think that this product is 100% better than the Graham Webb!</li>
      <li>Large bottle really lasts.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair that is perfectly straight.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I also use a moisturizing cream after styling with this since it can leave the hair a bit dry-looking, but it takes no time to diffuse, is left light, not weighed down at all, soft and manageable, and is a super product!</li>
      <li>It had a nice scent but not effective for my hair.</li>
      <li>Not only does it truly volumize - but makes my fine, shoulder length to past shoulder length straight hair look like I have twice as much!  </li>
      <li>A few pumps gives hair body an make styling easy.  </li>
      <li>Works well to give my fine hair a little boost.</li>
      <li>I recently went super short (12 inches off my hair) and the stylist used this during the styling phase.</li>
      <li>I have fine limp hair and this product is so helpful in giving me body.</li>
      <li>Volume Boosting is light weight so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky after a day.  </li>
      <li>My daughter had recommended I purchase this only through an authorized salon; however, I purchased through Amazon and feel this is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>My old hairdresser told me about it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like really like the price tag, but it&#x27;s the only product I use now</li>
      <li>Volu produces a soft lift that is touchable.</li>
      <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling a bit stiff, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>I never would have spent this much without having seen the results--</li>
      <li>A light spray in a few places, work thru your hair, then dry.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny and a little goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I love that I found it less expensive by ordering online.</li>
    <li> I love that I could get this cheaper on Amazon!  Great product.  Works well to give my fine hair a little boost.</li>
    <li> Hate this stuff. My old hairdresser told me about it so I ordered it. It made my hair sticky no matter how I used it. Horrible and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like this mist. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky, but it does volumize it. One less star for the high price.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT. I have very fine hair and it delivers awesome texture w/o making your hair sticky. I was at a loss when Graham Webb Thick Infusion was no longer available at a reasonable price, but I think that this product is 100% better than the Graham Webb! Worth every penny and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A girlfriend of my suggested Davines, so I tried it.  A light spray in a few places, work thru your hair, then dry.  Stays in place and still feels like hair! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love  live Davines products! Worth the price, lasts forever. I use all Davines products and have for about 2 years. People are always talking about my hair</li>
    <li> This has replaced the Kerastase volumeactive mousse I thought was my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of volumizers.  Not only does it truly volumize - but makes my fine, shoulder length to past shoulder length straight hair look like I have twice as much!  This can&#x27;t be a coincidence - I&#x27;m 41 and the back top of hair was &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; - and after using this product for 2 months, the scalp has more hair there.  I went back to my stylist to get a cut and highlight, and she said &amp;#34;Maggie, the spot that was thinning has more hair now!&amp;#34;  I HAVE to attribute it to this very natural product, as nothing else is different.&lt;br /&gt;And it smells  sooooooo good!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good stuff about the Davines line of products. I absolutely love the way they smell. The smell is soft and feminine, and not \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; like other products. I use  Volu for root boosting- it perfect for the job. I have a fine hair shaft, but a TON of hair, so my hair is easily weighed down with products. Volu produces a soft lift that is touchable. I also use Oi for glossing and control (I use it in place of mousse or gel) and it smooths my hair for the entire day. Both products leave my hair bouncy and touchable.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it&#x27;s not that easy to find so I selected to buy it this way.  It was here sooner than estimated and wasn&#x27;t tampered with.  The last seller I purchased this from skimmed product off the top so I was a but leery at first but I am very happy with this seller and would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product did not do what it claimed. I usually like davine products I will not buy this product again. Hair was not volumized at all</li>
    <li> My daughter had recommended I purchase this only through an authorized salon; however, I purchased through Amazon and feel this is the real deal.  It&#x27;s the best product on the market that I&#x27;ve found for my fine hair and the scent is wonderful.  I&#x27;m ready to purchase again!</li>
    <li> I think this is a keeper</li>
    <li> Love this volume boosting mist, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a long time.  It works great on my fine short hair.  Enough volume but not too poofy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Helps gives body in my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but it works really well for volumizing my fine hair. Also smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> The bottle is only 2/3 full when it arrives - not a good start. It has a distinct scent, which I happen to like but if you want something unscented this is not a good choice.</li>
    <li> I have fine limp hair and this product is so helpful in giving me body. Since it&#x27;s a spray it doesn&#x27;t weigh  the hair down like mousse or other heavier products.</li>
    <li> Way too sticky for my thin hair. Would not buy again. Maybe better for thicker hair and non colored hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my naturally wavy/curly hair that tends to go limp at the top (partly from a previously bad haircut)-- and I was amazed how it brought my curls back to life.  I had to try it: By spraying this in around the roots and scrunching, I now have curly hair beyond my wildest dreams.  This is my new go-to product and my new favorite.  I never would have spent this much without having seen the results-- but it&#x27;s worth every dime and I&#x27;m already a return-customer!  If you have hair that needs volume (and I can vouch for curls that need some zing), this is your product!!  I also use a moisturizing cream after styling with this since it can leave the hair a bit dry-looking, but it takes no time to diffuse, is left light, not weighed down at all, soft and manageable, and is a super product!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and gives my hair great body and staying power.  Just spray it at the root and style.  I wish it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling a bit stiff, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair that is perfectly straight. This is the only styling product I have found that actually gives me volume and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. A few spritzes at the roots is all I need.</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair. A few pumps gives hair body an make styling easy.  Large bottle really lasts.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of watermelon  it makes my hsir fuller than iit was I have limp hair</li>
    <li> I bought this to add some volume to my hair but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all. It had a nice scent but not effective for my hair.</li>
    <li> Volume Boosting is light weight so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky after a day.  Nice light fragrance, not overpowering.  Gives my hair lift and volume. I love using the the Davines Finest Oil/Non Oil for Wizards along with this product-gives me light volume and control for grooming. Keeps frizzies down!!  Love all the Davines products!</li>
    <li> I recently went super short (12 inches off my hair) and the stylist used this during the styling phase. After seeing what it did to my hair, I figured I would try it out on my own. I have fine, super straight, uncolored blonde hair and this product works wonders. I wake up, spray it at the roots and use it in correlation with a couple of Velcro rollers and blast it with the blow dryer for a few seconds. That&#x27;s all I need and I am good do go. I have tried other volume fillers, shampoos, gels, products, etc., in the past, but this is truly the first product that has actually worked. I don&#x27;t like really like the price tag, but it&#x27;s the only product I use now and I think it&#x27;s worth it. It smells great too.</li>
