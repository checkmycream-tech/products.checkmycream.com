      <li>Amazing.  </li>
      <li>The product came on time and was packaged nicely.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I would not recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It will be just as effective.</li>
      <li>Glad to find it at a fair price.  </li>
      <li>Kind of hit or miss.</li>
      <li>I think the idea is good, but I&#x27;m not so sure about the execution.</li>
      <li>Strips are nicely shaped to remove hair from any area under brow.</li>
      <li>Price was nice but delivered in smashed box.</li>
      <li>This particular product has done a wonderful job...</li>
      <li>Super easy to use and can be cut to fit your ideal eyebrow shape.</li>
      <li>Shipping cost more than the product...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok at removing hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for sevral years and havent been able to find them in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>Glad to find them online.  </li>
      <li>These strips are nothing more than scotch tape in the shape of eyebrow removers.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy this at Walmart.</li>
      <li>I tried this product when they used to sell it at Walgreens, as soon as I fell in love with it they stopped selling it.  </li>
      <li>and you may have to use more than one to get the precision that you need.</li>
      <li>Any more than that</li>
      <li>Ok, this one I do cheat on, but</li>
      <li>I would purchase again for sure.</li>
      <li>I must make sure not to get any vaseline or oil on areas I&#x27;m waxing.  </li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>We both love them.  </li>

      <li>I love these Eyebrow shapers and have been using them for years.  </li>
      <li>I think tape would work better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad i got this for about 3 bucks</li>
      <li>I love that I can use these strips instead of going to an esthetician to have my eyebrows done.  </li>
      <li>I love using these.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Works ok, doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, and sometimes takes off skin too.</li>
      <li>It would cost me more money attempting to return this item, so they are in the trash.  </li>
      <li>I just tried this for the first time today and it&#x27;s off to a good start, would recommend to beginners.</li>
      <li>It really didn&#x27;t remove any hair, but shipping was fine product not to happy that&#x27;s why the three stars product did not do what it says it does.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i am not sure if i am allowed to suggest another product for you, that has worked for me amazing, with perfect results every time,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>I would love to be able to easily and effectively clean up my eyebrows myself at home, but</li>
      <li>Cut the strip to the right shape, and warm it just before applying.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use...</li>
      <li>Now that I can do my brow at home easily without going out to the salon.</li>
      <li>It is so easy</li>
      <li>Very quick and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was easily to peel off.</li>
      <li>I made sure my face was clean of all lotions, etc and was conservative w/</li>
      <li>The strips took a bit to get use to using, but once I got the hang of it, it was easy to remove and sculpt my eyebrow hair.</li>
      <li>Fortunately tweezing (or even squeezing the hairs between strips or my fingers) is easy at this point because there is sticky wax on the brows to tug at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipment came quickly, too, I might add. :)</li>
      <li>They work so well and are so precise.</li>
      <li>The pre-shape design doesn&#x27;t fit all eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>The product feels like putting a piece of cheap tape and nothing coming out.</li>
      <li>My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon.</li>
      <li>but it saves me so much $$!!!</li>
      <li>Being able to cut them to the exact size and shape you need helps a lot.  </li>
      <li>But for me  still 100x better than tweezing, or hot wax.</li>
      <li>so much better than hot wax which I have gotten my eyelid burnt by proffesionals.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product Didn&#x27;t do any effect On my eyebrows at all I highly recommend Not to buy this item It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Only Amazon has them -work well</li>
    <li> What a waste. You&#x27;d be just as well off with scotch tape. I threw it away. Yes, it was that bad.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at my store and when they stopped selling them i became sad.  When I found them on here I was way overcome with joy!  These things work great, being that I&#x27;m too lazy to tweeze. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to shape their eyebrows without all the painful tweezing.  I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
    <li> As long as you wash your face free of the oils this product works wonders.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about all the time and pain involved with tweezing.  Less time with remarkably less pain.  This beauty product has a permanent spot on my shelf.</li>
    <li> I have found these to work extremely well. I am happy to have found them here as I can no longer find them in the stores. Just 2 days ago I had my brows waxed professionally and they didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as I have done myself with these strips. I also still have bumps and redness from the professional job and none of that with these strips. These strips wisk off every single bit of hair that I want removed quickly and with no pain or bumps. Inexpensive beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe to say I adore this product and have never had an issue with them not working though one must know how to use them and a couple of tries will be needed if you&#x27;ve never used them to acquire your desired shape. Then, it&#x27;s off and running to beautiful brows effortlessly, pain free, bumpless and bat those eyes!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to spend the time or money to go get my eyebrows waxed and I am not patient enough to tweeze! These shapers wok great and I have been using them for years.  This is one of my &#x27;must have&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> This particular product has done a wonderful job...This is the only product I use nowadays..I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think the idea is good, but I&#x27;m not so sure about the execution. I usually use Parissa mini eyebrow strips, which are great and easy to use (and are white and can be reused more than once), but I wanted to give something else a try and this seemed to be a good price for the amount that you get.    There are a few things I didn&#x27;t care for about these strips such as them being hard to see when you&#x27;re peeling them off their backing. I also didn&#x27;t care for the size and shape of the lower portion, which seemed way too big (at least for me) when you have to contend with eyelashes, lid and all of the rest.     Lastly, once you use it, you&#x27;re done - as in no retries. This is a bit frustrating, since the adhesiveness of the strips themselves isn&#x27;t all that great. Though I&#x27;m experienced with using similar strips and waxing in general, I found myself having to go through several extras just to get the job moderately done. Mind, this is with a dry yet freshly-cleaned, oil-free face and appropriate hair length.    Overall, I think this is good for beginners or for those who want a completely pain-free experience and don&#x27;t mind giving it a few tries. I can say that it didn&#x27;t hurt, there was no mess and the strips are pretty forgiving if you place things wrong. I found I liked the top portion more for its shaping purposes; however, I&#x27;m not sure this makes up for how many you have to go through or the shape and size of things alone - at least in my opinion.     Shipment came quickly, too, I might add. :)</li>
    <li> Really works and is convenient.  I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon anymore. The cold wax is more effective than hot wax.</li>
    <li> These do not do what they say they do.  Not at all.  Even if you follow the directions perfectly.  They don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> You might as well wax your eyebrows with duct tape - it is cheaper and will produce the same results as this product. This stuff pulls as much skin off as it does hair, so beware.</li>
    <li> If i could give this product a lower star rating i would! I Cant believe i paid for this crap. Didnt work and even though i did the skin test it made my face break out! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME&amp;#60; EFFORT PR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I read a bunch of positive reviews but they really suck! They look like little pieces of tape and they barely remove any hair. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> product disappeared from store shelves here.  Glad to find them online.  Very quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  I order it online because it is no longer available in stores where I live.  This product is AMAZING!!!!  The key to using it is to make certain that your face is clean and oil free.  When I clean my face and brow area, I will use a little astringent or alcohol on just to make certain the area is clean.  IT WILL NOT WORK IN THE RESENCE OF OIL&amp;#60; DIRT OR SWEAT ON THE FACE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for everyone who has negative reviews for this product, it is because they did not use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep these at my home and I have introduced them to my college-aged daughter and my mom.  They both love them, too!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well, barely removes any hair, and  you will have to recut the strips to fit your eyebrow shape.</li>
    <li> I think tape would work better</li>
    <li> These are best for quickly removing those tiny hairs that are super annoying to &amp; impossible to pluck with tweezers. While you won&#x27;t get every hair (you might have to do the same area twice to get some missed hairs), they are a much cheaper alternative to a pricy salon. My main gripe with these is that they leave an impossible amount of residue which can only be taken off with special oil (like [[ASIN:B00011JN56 Clean + Easy Calm Azulene Oil, 2 Fluid Ounce]]). Although these aren&#x27;t terrible, I greatly prefer [[ASIN:B001ET701I Nad&#x27;s Hypoallergenic Facial Wax Strips, 24 strips (Pack of 2)]], which remove lot of more hair in one try.</li>
    <li> I have tried similar products in the past, but wasn&#x27;t very satisfied. After reading the excellent reviews for this one, i gave it a try. I am disappointed. Even though it comes in precut shapes and is cold wax, it did not do a very good job on my eybrows. It left a lot of hairs. The shape of the precut wax strips isn&#x27;t very good neither - it didn&#x27;t match my eybrows very well. My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon.</li>
    <li> I also agree that it&#x27;s like scotch tape.  I tried several strips, peeling from multiple angles, and none of them worked.  Instead, I got a swelling eyelid the next day.  This product doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> i absolutely ADORE this product. I am very finicky about beauty products and have bought numerous hair removers- my eyebrows have been through hell and back! i have gotten them professionally waxed, threaded and plucked...and i&#x27;ve tried at least 6 different products at home. None of them worked as quickly or as efficiently as these. And of course, now they are nowhere to be found. I had to buy those stupid hair remover mitts just because i saw \\&quot;Bonus! free instant eyebrow shapers!\\&quot; haha      I will definitely be ordering more from amazon now that i know they are here!      ps- to everyone who said they are just like scotch tape- you either have really, really thick hair.....or you are not doing it right. directions come in a box for a reason. :-P</li>
    <li> I attempted to use these strips.  They are worthless... The pre-shape design doesn&#x27;t fit all eyebrows.  The adhesive doesn&#x27;t pull out hairs.  It would cost me more money attempting to return this item, so they are in the trash.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Did not take a hair off... waste of money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not returnable!!!!</li>
    <li> Works ok, doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, and sometimes takes off skin too. Kind of hit or miss.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I would not recommend this product. I ended up having to tweeze my eyebrows because the wax strips didn&#x27;t help a single bit. I&#x27;m only giving this 2 stars because the product was delivered earlier than the expected time, which is always pleasantly surprising.</li>
    <li> This was first purchase of a wax eyebrow hair remover so I have nothing to compare it to.  Strips are nicely shaped to remove hair from any area under brow. It could have used a little more \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; power.  It failed to remove as much hair as I would have liked.    Price was nice but delivered in smashed box. Vendor customer service was very good. I would try other of their products  based on my experience with them.</li>
    <li> I ran out of these and have not been able to find them again.  I thought of doing an www search and voila!  I will be ordering soon!  They are quick and easy and less painful than the beauty shop.</li>
    <li> The product does not work at all. It was a waste of money. That&#x27;s all I have to say about that</li>
    <li> just the one I was looking for!  use to sell @ walgreens ,but like light bulbs you can only find them here</li>
    <li> Value wise these are a 5 star item for me.  But I&#x27;ll admit that there is a steep learning curve, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t work 100%.  Sometimes it&#x27;s frustrating.  But for me this is far less time consuming, painful, or frustrating than tweezing with better results.  Tricks I&#x27;ve figured out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I MUST put vaseline on areas up to the eye where there is no hair (or you&#x27;ll tear off eyelid skin).  I can&#x27;t be lazy about this or I regret it every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2.  I must make sure not to get any vaseline or oil on areas I&#x27;m waxing.  So face must be freshly showered and completely dry.  And then no finishing oil until I&#x27;m complete done, and apply the vasoline  very thinly with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cut the strip to the right shape, and warm it just before applying.  A blow dryer works best.  After applying, let it cool for a second before tearing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Always pull the skin taught with the other hand while tearing off.  Having an assistant is probably helpful for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Don&#x27;t go over the same spot more than once.  Ok, this one I do cheat on, but I limit myself to 2x over any given spot.  Any more than that and it&#x27;s so raw I look like a clown.  Often with some bleeding.  If it doesn&#x27;t get the hair on the first two tries, then I have to tweeze them or try again after a few days.  And sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work.  Fortunately tweezing (or even squeezing the hairs between strips or my fingers) is easy at this point because there is sticky wax on the brows to tug at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s not perfect, and sometimes it is downright frustrating.. But for me  still 100x better than tweezing, or hot wax. And much faster, with much cleaner and well shaped results.</li>
    <li> It was so bad. It had already expired from about 1 year ago and did not work. amazon should really not sell expired products to customers. i am sueing next time.</li>
    <li> I love these strips!  Being able to cut them to the exact size and shape you need helps a lot.  I had been having a really hard time finding them in stores.  Glad I found them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for sevral years and havent been able to find them in stores anymore.I&#x27;ve read some reviews saying they&#x27;re like scotch tape..wow.As long as you follow the directions, esp. make sure you wash your face very well, these will never fail you! I have VERY thick, VERY wide brows normally.I have them done in a salon every few months but I love using these in between, they keep my brows perfect.I always do a little tweezing here and there but with my brows it&#x27;s a must.These little stickers remove (on one strip) ALL hair they touch w/ the exception of 1-2 here &amp; there and like i said, my hair is THICK.Just wash the area really good and you shouldnt have any problems!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this product ever since Wal-Mart quit carrying it. These are the best facial hair remover strips I&#x27;ve ever used...better than some salon eyebrow waxings I&#x27;ve had, and less costly. Just remember that after you apply, to pull off in reverse direction of how the hair grows. Otherwise you&#x27;ll get no better results than if you used scotch tape.</li>
    <li> These were way to expensive and I cannot believe that I bought these. You might as well as get a piece  of tape and try to use that. It will be just as effective. Which means not at all.  go with sally hansens. do not buy from here.</li>
    <li> These things didn&#x27;t work for squat.  They didn&#x27;t pull a single hair out and I ended up just throwing them away.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> These strips are nothing more than scotch tape in the shape of eyebrow removers. They may take off one or two hairs, but they don&#x27;t come close to doing what they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> This is a total scam! is a regular tape... nothing else!</li>
    <li> the worst ever took off hair one time does not do what it says it does, going back to hot wax or twessing dont buy waste of money and time really sucks</li>
    <li> so much better than hot wax which I have gotten my eyelid burnt by proffesionals. also, so much less to have to tweeze.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it also doesn&#x27;t remove all of the hair. I had to go behind and pluck my eyebrows (even longer hairs that should have been picked up by the strips). Save your money and buy wax instead.</li>
    <li> I love these Eyebrow shapers and have been using them for years.  Beats plucking any day and takes about 1/2 the time.  Other wax strips are not shaped and are much harder to use.  The other products tend to be messy too.  These strips are shaped like your eyebrows and are neat.  I&#x27;d refer this product to a friend in a minute.</li>
    <li> Does not work the way I expected them too, the instructions say you should have 6 weeks of growth. I don&#x27;t let my eye brows go 6 weeks so this product is not really for me.</li>
    <li> Ever since going to get my eyebrows done and ending up bleeding, I have been reluctant to go get them waxed again. These work pretty well though the contour is a bit off and you may have to use more than one to get the precision that you need. They take off the hair pretty cleanly and the cold wax job lasts long enough. Plus, they&#x27;re pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> These do not work at all. I have waxed hot and cold wax for years for my own touch ups inbetween salon waxings. This does nothing but pull off some debris if your skin is not spotless. Besides that the price is crazy high considering you will use 4 each time for both upper/ lower on both brows.</li>
    <li> Now that I can do my brow at home easily without going out to the salon. It was easily to peel off.</li>
    <li> I tried this product when they used to sell it at Walgreens, as soon as I fell in love with it they stopped selling it.  I can&#x27;t seem to find a place anywhere who sells it.  Its pain free and works really really well for something that looks like a sticker.  I don&#x27;t even get my eyebrows professionally done.  I use these shapers above my brow and tweeze underneath. They make my eyebrows look perfect!</li>
    <li> Is not easier to use. Hurt so much more and hurt so much worse.</li>
    <li> The eyebrow shapers do not remove as well as I had hoped.  They do not do as well as the hot was, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Bs and didn&#x27;t work at all and I still have them. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad i got this for about 3 bucks other wise I would have been pissed!!! This doesn&#x27;t work no matter how much or little hair you have....complete fail!!!!</li>
    <li> so much easier that plucking or shaving - only hurts for a few seconds if you put pressure on the eyebrow after pulling</li>
    <li> Worst item ever. Does not work. Seriously, its like putting packing tape on your eyebrows and pulling. If you&#x27;re lucky you can get one or two loose hairs to come off, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> This product looks like a cheap little sticker, but don&#x27;t judge too quickly.  It works wonders!  People tell me ALL the time that my brows look professionally done, like a supermodel&#x27;s or someone in Hollywood.    My only caution:  WASH YOUR SKIN CLEAN first.  It does not work well on oily skin.  Give a good scrub, pat dry, and the hair comes RIGHT off, with no pain.  Amazing.  Really.</li>
    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK! WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> No problems  at all will shop with them again.</li>
    <li> These strips remove very little hair. It kinda reminds you of tape against the skin.  I wish I never would have tried them then at least I could return them.  Works nothing like description!</li>
    <li> The shapers just don&#x27;t work at shaping my eyebrows. They certainly work, however, at ripping off my skin. Honestly don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s not an expensive product, but I regret purchasing them because I just threw out the entire package.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Pre-cut, you just pull the size off that you want, place them on your stray little hairs, rub, and gone are those little brutes quickly and painlessly.  Love them.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised that this works! It pulls the hair right off. You may need to practice a bit to get it to work. But its well worth it!</li>
    <li> din&amp;#34;t waste your money on this product.i bought this hair off thing so i don&amp;#34;t have to have my eyebrow wax every month. but i realize that this product doesn&amp;#34;t work spending $20 at the salon for waxing is worth than buying hair off</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! Didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be great but they hardly removed any hairs! I even let my brow hairs grow out more than I usually do! Make sure your brow area is very clean and very dry! They worked better! I guess I&#x27;ll keep searching!</li>
    <li> Really bad product. It wasn&#x27;t original and it didn&#x27;t work. Be careful. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I did not really like this item. The strips didn&#x27;t line up with my eyebrows. It only took a few hairs out at a time. I had to tweeze them instead. The price is right to try it but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> would give it zero stars if i could, it didnt work at all</li>
    <li> Buy a roll of scotch tape.  Cheaper and same effect. Was a total waste of money. I was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers Cold Wax Strips 18&#x27;s didn&#x27;t really did not work for me so I will not be buying this brand anymore</li>
    <li> I gave this a five star rating because they really work.  These wax strips are very easy to use and results last much longer than plucking and not nearly as painful.  I would recommend these to any women.</li>
    <li> Nothing in the stores works for me as well as this product...unfortunately it has been replaced in the stores w/useless products.  Glad to find it at a fair price.  It was at my door w/in 2 days. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I guess I am guilty of having too high an expectation, or maybe just stubborn hair. Either way I am not impressed. I still have to tweeze after using the strips. I made the initial mistake of trying to use the stipps repeatedly on the same area when the the strips didn&#x27;t get it all the first time....big mistake. I&#x27;ll use them to do an overall, but tweezing is still necessary.  Maybe I just didn&#x27;t hold my mouth right...</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE!!! IF YOU ARE READING THIS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!! It&#x27;s literally a joke and I still regret it. They will also not refund for some stupid reason. If I could give this half a star, I would..</li>
    <li> Let me just say, these are awful. They don&#x27;t take any hair with them, I&#x27;ve followed all directions properly and tried a whole sheet of them but none of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend said they were a waste of money</li>
    <li> they are hard to use, and they dont remove any hair at all...&lt;br /&gt;i am not sure if i am allowed to suggest another product for you, that has worked for me amazing, with perfect results every time,&lt;br /&gt;but here it goes nads check it out</li>
    <li> This product does not work for the fact that the sticky part on the strips are dried up and some have no stick to it</li>
    <li> These worked well for me.....sometimes took more than one to do the trick in some areas, but all around a great product!</li>
    <li> It does not work at all! Or if I used it wrong? Anyway I threw away the whole box. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love using these. It is so easy and I have to buy them online, anyway, because my town&#x27;s stores don&#x27;t carry them.</li>
    <li> Works ok...a little hard to use</li>
    <li> Did not really like it ..  it looks and feels just like transparent tape, cut out in shape of eyebrows !!..</li>
    <li> Love it, had been looking for it and finally found it on your website.  Just wash your face before use.  It removes the stray eyebrows and I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaping.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy this at Walmart. They stopped carrying it a while ago. So I had to resort to using the other wax strips that are just not quite shaped for the eyebrow. Thank goodness I found it again.</li>
    <li> I wish my local store carried this product. The strips took a bit to get use to using, but once I got the hang of it, it was easy to remove and sculpt my eyebrow hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there are times when I needed to use multiple strips to get the desired look I wanted, so I used the product up more quickly.</li>
    <li> this product did not work, it was a waste of money. i do not recommend it at all.  it totally did not work.</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely horrible didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair even though I tried several times very unhappy have used these products before with amazing results but you get what you pay for do NOT I  repeat do NOT waste your money</li>
    <li> Easy to use... Simple instructions no tricks on how to use it .. This product is amazing. Happy happy</li>
    <li> Doing things at home is always much simpler and cheaper. Using these wax strips gives you the control as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff with hesitation but the price was so good I figured it was worth a try.  I did check reviews on Amazon before I used it and after reading mostly positive I decided to go for it.  I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. I made sure my face was clean of all lotions, etc and was conservative w/ the placement for the first try - and wow - it worked nicely.  Just follow the directions and it should work for you.  Needless to say the shapers they have may not match your eyebrow shape exactly so you might have to shape the strips yourself a bit w/ scissors or just be careful in your placement on the brow.</li>
    <li> Ugh I hate tweezing!  This is the very first time I ever tried cold wax strips and I&#x27;m very pleased by the results.  If you follow the easy instructions inside the box, this is a relatively painless product, compared to tweezing.  It&#x27;s fast, easy, simple, lasts a long time (compared to tweezing) and is a great price and value.  I would purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> So convenient for college students</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work!!! It pulls the hair, it just doesn&#x27;t take it off... Maybe it works different for other people, but they did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Shipping cost more than the product... Not worth it for what the product is... Considering weight of product is feather weight</li>
    <li> This product does not live up to all its claim. It doesn&#x27;t work! It barely takes off the hair from my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It does not work at all. It is just like a cello tape. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.Also the shapes are weird.Piece of Junk.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 12 year old daughter because her eyebrows were really getting \\&quot;out there\\&quot;.  I didn&#x27;t want her to start trying to do it on her own, and get her brows all messed up and over tweezed, and manually tweezing took too long and hurt.  We found these and thought we&#x27;d give them a try.  NO pain whatsoever, easy to use, and got the job done wonderfully.  She has perfectly groomed mistake proof eyebrows.  I did it for her the first couple of times, and now she can do her own about every other month.  We both love them.  I decided to start using them myself!</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t remove any hair, but shipping was fine product not to happy that&#x27;s why the three stars product did not do what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the first time today and it&#x27;s off to a good start, would recommend to beginners.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, sadly, so these were very frustrating to use because it removed little to no hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you know you have thick hair!</li>
    <li> I used this product in the past, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for years.  I&#x27;d switched off to another brand, until I ran across these on Amazon.  They&#x27;re still the same low price I paid in store, and the same great quality.  I love that I can use these strips instead of going to an esthetician to have my eyebrows done.  I also like that these are &amp;#34;ready to use&amp;#34; strips in the sense that you just pull them off the backing and stick them straight onto your face.  The idea of using hot wax (and the possibility of burning myself) terrifies me.  No one wants to walk around with burns on their face, especially women, as we tend to be more self-conscious.  These strips are very easy to use, but do have a little bit of a learning curve.  Also, be sure to only leave them on for the recommended time.  Leaving them on any longer will result in red marks on your face and a constant &amp;#34;surprised look&amp;#34; as I like to call it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product. Figure I&#x27;d try it. It doesn&#x27;t work, so don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> thought this may be the solution to my eyebrow issues.  I would love to be able to easily and effectively clean up my eyebrows myself at home, but this kit.,.,,was not the answer.  the sticky strips didn&#x27;t even adhere to my face.  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these!!! I used to always purchase these at retail stores but they became very hard to find. I use these on my husband and myself. I will be so sad if these are ever discontinued. They work so well and are so precise.</li>
    <li> I bought this product according to the good reviews and its not worth your time and money. The product feels like putting a piece of cheap tape and nothing coming out. Dont buy this product!! Its very cheap!!</li>
    <li> I had a hard time with the product. Like the idea behind it, just didnt work out great for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Takes the hair off easily and has the perfect shapes. This product did not make me break out at all. I am very satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> Love these!!  They work GREAT!</li>
    <li> These may for some people, or maybe I&#x27;m just not using them right, but they did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It took me a few times to master but it saves me so much $$!!! Easy to use and does the job perfectly!!</li>
    <li> the shape of these is so weird. no eyebrow has that shape. it&#x27;s ok at removing hair. it has to be long for it to come completely of, doesn&#x27;t work well on the little hairs</li>
    <li> The product came on time and was packaged nicely.  They have no sticking power so they don&#x27;t pull any hairs out... I used these on clean dry skin too.  I was not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN. I SHOULD HAVE SEND IT BACK. HE DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. IT IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TAKE OF MUCH HAIR.</li>
    <li> This product does not remove much hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for years. As others have taken the time to post: you must have the area to be waxed clean and dry. I stretch my skin when I place above my eyebrows, then I press down the strip firmly. I wait about 1 minute, then I pull off quickly against the direction of hair growth---again, while holding my skin tightly (taunt). If I wait for too much hair to grow back, I usually have to repeat the process. In these cases, I wait one day before waxing a second time. Hope this helps. When I initially tried these strips, I wasted 1/2 a box before perfecting the method. Patience is required. Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through the whole salon hot waxing bit, and getting up close and personal with the mirror and tweezers. I thought I&#x27;d give these a try, but I was quite skeptical at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t live without them! The most important part is that you clean your skin very well, I usually do it after my shower and after I put astringent on my face. You want to make sure your skin is clean, otherwise the strip is useless because it won&#x27;t grip any hairs.</li>
    <li> It works with the long hairs but when it comes to the fine hairs it doesn&#x27;t pull hose out.</li>
    <li> I would like to return this product because it doesn&#x27;t work as i expected. Wonder if there would be a possible refund to this product?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and while i&#x27;ve tried many other eyebrow-scaping products this is the only one that I have had work consistently. I&#x27;ve only once ever had an issue and that was because I heavily exfoliated just before using these and the wax stuck just a little bit too well. Even still I was back to normal in a few days and I did not hesitate to use them again. Super easy to use and can be cut to fit your ideal eyebrow shape.</li>
    <li> Tried this once and I wasn&#x27;t happy but I plan to try again . I felt like it did not pull hair off .and not sticky enough.</li>
    <li> these brow shapers are amazing! I don&#x27;t know what I did before I found them. Actually I just went around looking hairy and scary! Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work even the slightest. I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all</li>
    <li> this product was horrible. doesn&#x27;t work at all. it&#x27;s literally just a piece of tape. doesn&#x27;t pull any hair.</li>
    <li> works great and easy to use!!</li>
