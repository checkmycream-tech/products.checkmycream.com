    <li> Sensei-Care makes removal of econ and wafer much easier and without the pain.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a must have for ileostomy and colostomy patients.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Good product works as described.</li>
    <li> I first used this in the hospital. My newborn was born prematurely (28 weeks), went through surgery, is about to go through another one, and was left with an ostomy bag. Words cannot describe how great this product is in quickly, and painlessly, I got all of her adhesive bandages off holding her ostomy bag to her stomach. Someone&#x27;s we&#x27;d have to change her bag , 2-3 times a day and the Sensi-Care made it soooooo easily to do so quickly may I add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were having an issue getting more from the hospital so I decided to see if anyone was seeking it on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t care how much it cost because it was THAT great of a product. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone trying to painlessly remove any type of adhesive even a bandaid on a child. You spray it immediately lifts the adhesive- no residue, no oils. We used this for months in the NICU and another few weeks at home. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Best remover - my skin is sensitive and this releases the adhesive nicely</li>
    <li> Works awesome, highly recommended to anyone who has to have frequent infusions or just hates pulling off band aides.</li>
    <li> It works better than anything we have used in removing adhesive from peristomal skin! A bit pricy, however.</li>
    <li> A little expensive but works fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that does not leave a residue and completely removes any wafer residue.  Does not sting even on excoriated raw skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Spray over the adhesive dressing, wait a minute and the dressing lifts off. Very skin friendly. Especially good for sensitive skin and kids. It is made with silicon so leaves very little residue. Takes the pain out of band aid and dressing removal.</li>
    <li> This product does work well, however it is way over priced for the amount you get. After 6 or 7 uses to remove tap bandages it way just about empty.&lt;br /&gt;Although easy to use I am swicthing to wipes or bottle as they work just as well and give about 4 times the use of the spray.&lt;br /&gt;So the product is given a 4 star but value is a 1 star.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great keeps you from getting skin tears, can&#x27;t hardly live  without it!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Works like magic. My daughter&#x27;s medical issues require us to use medical tape on her skin daily. This has been a lifesaver. No more tears, no more fuss. Spray it on and it lifts off like magic. Already been through 3 cans and I will keep ordering. A god send.</li>
    <li> The best adhesive releaser I&#x27;ve tried.  It works instantly and no waiting.</li>
    <li> works great, used to use adhesive remover but no longer needed when using this product</li>
    <li> I saw this product at a conference in Phoenix 4 years ago and fell in love with it.  Until now the only way you could get it is in the oversea markets.  I recommend it to all my ostomy patients.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove adhesive.</li>
    <li> I spray this on the adhesive wipes for extra help removing my mother&#x27;s barriers for her ostomy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC!!  I broke my knee cap a year ago and spent a couple of weeks in a nursing home. I had a LARGE wound from the surgery to repair the broken patella and it had to be changed every 48 hours. Never a fun process. The worst part is ALWAYS removing the bandage. ripping off the adhesive. Well, this stuff was new and had been given to my wound care department as samples and I was a guinea pig. I was AMAZED!. The wound care nurse was kind enough to allow me to keep a can of it. I have kept it in my med cabinet and guarded it jealously! Today I had a tough surgery and a lot of tape after in a tender place. I HATED the thought of removing these bandages. so, I carefully sprayed this tuff on and viola!! easily, with no pain and very little actually pull, off came the tape and life was a little better. I am SO happy to find it on Amazon. I&#x27;ll be keeping this in my cabinet from now on. it is THE least painful to remove sticky stuff. Get a can of this and try it just once. You&#x27;ll see what I mean and you&#x27;ll always have it on hand!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! It releases the tape over a dressing in 5 seconds.  And then let&#x27;s you put the same tape back on and hold. No more ouch!</li>
    <li> This adhesive releaser is EXCELLENT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a temporary Ostomy and because of this product my skin has healed....no more pulling tugging on the tape and wafer and NO MORE PAIN!!! Thanks and please don&#x27;t discontinue!! :)</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! It used to take almost 45 minutes to remove a tegaderm from my daughter&#x27;s chest. There were a lot of tears too. This product is a life safer!! Literally sprayed it on and the whole tegaderm was removed in 2 minutes. I am buying a ton of it!! Nothing else even comes close to working as well as this product.</li>
    <li> My husband is a baby when it comes to adhesive tape removable.  He will no longer remove a bandage without the use of this release spray.  Costly, but it works.  The wound care nurse at the hospital introduced us to this and we found it on amazon.  Hooray for amazon.  I am a faithful amazon shopper.</li>
    <li> Love this!! It&#x27;s such a life saver!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Works fine. Better than that smelly Detachol for sure!</li>
    <li> It was a &#x27;life saver&#x27; while I was recovering from surgery &amp; had to have bandages removed so often.</li>
    <li> Great! As it doesn&#x27;t sting like the alcohol based adhesive removers do.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my healthcare provider. It works very well in cleaning the adhesive off the skin.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for adhesive removal.  Only product my wife can use due to her crippled hands.  We&#x27;ve tried almost every product on the market, and this one works best for us.</li>
