<ol>
      <li>This mask is perfect.</li>
      <li>The size is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Well this one is working wonderfully.</li>
      <li>very good as advertised..</li>
      <li>Good product - great price !!!</li>
      <li>Delivered on time, good experience and would purchase again.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable with a great seal</li>
      <li>patient very satisfied</li>
      <li>The gel mask is nice, but you&#x27;ll never get it to stop leaking air.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best product of its kind I have used.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and the adjustable fore head piece is nice</li>
      <li>It may work better for others.</li>
      <li>I have used a CPAP for about 10 years and have always struggled to have a mask that fits with out leaving all the lines on your face, or making your hair look like you slept on the top of your head.</li>
      <li>the face mask will be better</li>
      <li>If I loosen the strap it feels better but the air escapes.</li>
      <li>The ResMed Mirage SoftGel Nasal Mask Frame is an Ok mask.  </li>
      <li>and I thought the gel mask would be even better.  </li>
      <li>Its really comfortable!</li>
      <li>This style of mask is so comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t shift during sleeping and you can turn over without worrying it might wake you.</li>
      <li>Comfortable with no leaks.</li>
      <li>The bottom doesn&#x27;t fit secure in the clip, and allows air to seep out , making alot of noise.</li>
      <li>the adjustment on the forehead pad is kinda cool, instead of a swivel its a screw mechanism.</li>
      <li>Gel mask is clearly more comfortable than old ResMed mask.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but it has a higher profile, meaning it stands out more from my face, than my last mask.</li>
      <li>It gives just enough fine adjustment on the head piece to allow it to fit comfortably without leakage.</li>
      <li>After months of aggravation and poor sleep, I purchased another Mirco and have slept wonderfully ever since.</li>
      <li>so far I like it better than the full&lt;br /&gt;Mask</li>
      <li>OK, this is the first mask I have used of a different design in 6 years.</li>
      <li>It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I hoped this mask would perform better than the simple nasal mask that came with the CPAP machine.</li>
      <li>Fast ship without the hassle!</li>
      <li>Additionally, after many adjustments, could not stop the air from leaking and whistling all night long.</li>
      <li>With this one I sleep pretty much without having to adjust it during the night.</li>
      <li>Seals well, pretty quiet, comfortable for a CPAP mask.</li>
      <li>The gel cushion while softer  is 2x as deep as the Micro and looks like it would be comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Now using my old, simple, nasal plug product and no noise and much better sleep.</li>
      <li>Its more sturdier and just feels less fragile that the original ResMed I have been using.</li>
      <li>My new go-to product.</li>
      <li>Not any more I can move around in this mask and have not had the problems that I have had in the past with air leaking.</li>
      <li>My mask was delivered early.</li>
      <li>With my old mask I was waking up a lot to re-position it.</li>
      <li>Been using a full face mask for a few years.</li>
      <li>came fast in a plastic bag by itsself but unfortunately doesnt fit and is now leaking as well.</li>
      <li>Once it is tight, it seals really well</li>

    <li> Very comfortable with a great seal</li>
    <li> patient very satisfied</li>
    <li> very good as advertised..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but it has a higher profile, meaning it stands out more from my face, than my last mask. Seals well, pretty quiet, comfortable for a CPAP mask.</li>
    <li> There seems to be a flaw in the mask. The bottom doesn&#x27;t fit secure in the clip, and allows air to seep out , making alot of noise. i&#x27;ve had this same mask, which lasted me several years, with another company, that&#x27;s why I say I think this one may be flawed.</li>
    <li> I have used a CPAP for about 6 years and have now used 4 different masks.  I purchased a second CPAP machine along with this mask for business travel and to leave at my second home.  I though it was the Mirage Micro as the look very similar and since it was newer, I used it on my home machine.  Unfortunately the cushion system is completely different.  The gel cushion while softer  is 2x as deep as the Micro and looks like it would be comfortable.  No matter how I adjusted it, moving the forehead cushion in and out, tightening and loosening the strap etc, it hissed and whistled and leaked air every time I moved my head. My final setting was to cinch it so tight that it left a mark on my face in the morning.  After months of aggravation and poor sleep, I purchased another Mirco and have slept wonderfully ever since.</li>
    <li> Been using a full face mask for a few years. Decided to try this partial mask. Have not used it long...so far I like it better than the full&lt;br /&gt;Mask. When I had my initial sleep test, I was told I was not a good candidate for a partial mask as I opened my mouth while sleeping. I have not had that issue with this mask.</li>
    <li> This style of mask is so comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t shift during sleeping and you can turn over without worrying it might wake you.</li>
    <li> Good product - great price !!!</li>
    <li> The ResMed Mirage SoftGel Nasal Mask Frame is an Ok mask.  I hoped this mask would perform better than the simple nasal mask that came with the CPAP machine. Unfortunately, this mask is bulkier and didn&#x27;t seal as well as the nasal mask. It may work better for others. It does work, but not as well as the nasal mask.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, good experience and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> came fast in a plastic bag by itsself but unfortunately doesnt fit and is now leaking as well. very uncomfortable to use im thinking the face mask will be better</li>
    <li> Mail order does not seem to work for CPAP materials.  It looked just like the mask I am using, but is very different.  I have tried to use it, but it will not seal properly.</li>
    <li> OK, this is the first mask I have used of a different design in 6 years. Its more sturdier and just feels less fragile that the original ResMed I have been using. This mask does NOT come with head gear! Oh Well! the adjustment on the forehead pad is kinda cool, instead of a swivel its a screw mechanism. Its really comfortable! Time will tell if I roll over and break the thing in the middle of the night! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the head gear didn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
    <li> The gel mask is nice, but you&#x27;ll never get it to stop leaking air. So you can lay there and listen to the wind whistle while wondering if you&#x27;re getting enough air....</li>
    <li> im mad it didnt come with the straps or clips</li>
    <li> Too soft and creates uncomfortable pressure points.</li>
    <li> Gel mask is clearly more comfortable than old ResMed mask.  As with most, if not all, Medical devices it is overly expensive.  My mask was delivered early.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and the adjustable fore head piece is nice</li>
    <li> This mask is perfect. I am an active sleeper and have had problems in the past with air leaking when I sleep. Not any more I can move around in this mask and have not had the problems that I have had in the past with air leaking.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.  Comfortable with no leaks.</li>
    <li> Thank-you ResMed for not letting me down. It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have used a CPAP for about 10 years and have always struggled to have a mask that fits with out leaving all the lines on your face, or making your hair look like you slept on the top of your head. Well this one is working wonderfully. It is so quite and that helps me stay asleep longer, I am not sure why this one fits so well and does not move when you sleep on your side but it is a keeper. My new go-to product. I would recommend this to any one struggling with your mask.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Mirage Activa LT and I thought the gel mask would be even better.  It is not.  The gel is hard, not soft and flexible like the Mirage. The mask leaks air badly and requires being tightened up to stop the leak.  Once it is tight, it seals really well but I have strap marks and indentations on my cheek and upper lip.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It presses down hard on my upper lip and is uncomfortable. If I loosen the strap it feels better but the air escapes.</li>
    <li> Was very optimistic, but it felt heavy on my face. And uncomfortable under my nose, possibly because of my mustache. Additionally, after many adjustments, could not stop the air from leaking and whistling all night long. Now using my old, simple, nasal plug product and no noise and much better sleep.</li>
    <li> Fast ship without the hassle!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product of its kind I have used. The size is perfect for me. It gives just enough fine adjustment on the head piece to allow it to fit comfortably without leakage. With my old mask I was waking up a lot to re-position it. With this one I sleep pretty much without having to adjust it during the night.</li>
