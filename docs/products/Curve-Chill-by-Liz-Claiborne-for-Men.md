<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> was a present for my brother, he loves it</li>
    <li> Smells good, very fast shipping, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> nice scent and pricing was great</li>
    <li> The cologne is not to strong and the ladys love it. The smell is not over powering but has a scent that does give the idea that you want to chill.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells good, however has poor longevity. It lasts 3 hours tops. I get a nice citrus, pepper mix from it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading other good revewes. Smells great &amp; long lasting. Im happy i ordered it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift.  He normally wears another scent of curve, but we both love this one too.</li>
    <li> The cologne I purchased was at a GREAT price, but when I received it, I notices that it smelled different than it does in retail stores. I thought it was just me, but every time I spray it on, it smells awful...</li>
    <li> Good Cologne!! Not My Favorite In The-Curve-Series Of Colognes,, But Still Good! High-End-Packaging, Not The Fastest -Delivery, But Not-Bad!! Still,, I Highly-Recommend ANY Of The Curve-Colognes!! ;-)Peace</li>
    <li> I just recieved this cologne it was a birthday gift for my husband. I like it because of the price and the 4.6 oz, better than the competitors however my husband says it smells rather feminine. I like smelling it maybe he will like wearing.</li>
    <li> This has a good fragrance but I am concerned that the scent only last a couple of hour before it disappears. Will not purchase once it is done.</li>
    <li> It is a fake cologne spray, it does not have any smell, I really regret that I orderd from here I would never ever order from Amazon anymore. That was a big mistake.</li>
    <li> The regular Curve has long been my daily stand-by.  Bought this one a whim when I saw a great price.  Wife *loves* it, even more than the regular Curve or any of my other more expensive colognes.  YMMV.</li>
    <li> It smells really good but the scent does not last very long.</li>
    <li> This is a clean and refreshing scent!</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchased</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let you know that the price on the Curve Crush was the best around and it came a lot faster than expected, too.</li>
    <li> I agree With W. Lee. When you first spray it on it smells great. but afterwards it kind of stinks and does have a funny base smell. I like Crush and love Wave.</li>
    <li> i bought this because they do not sell it in the department stores, they stopped selling it a couple of years ago. i had been looking for this curve chill and im glad they had it here. im going to buy another one in a couple of months just so that i wont run out.</li>
    <li> Got it right before the weekend so i can wrap it and put it under the tree..It smells great and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Got here in a good time and smells great</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances its awesome i would recommend this to fragrance for the rest of my days im just saying</li>
    <li> Smells great. One of my favorites. If you like the citrusy scented none-spice smell this one is for you. My wife loves it and I get plenty of compliments and inquiring questions from others that are looking for a new cologne. Last most the day and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like smell of this brand of Cologne</li>
    <li> Before buying it. However, I&#x27;ve liked the Curve line since it began and they were offering bottles of the original for women at a boutique for $15.  I got this because I wanted to see if it had improved or declined since the original for men. It&#x27;s strong when you spray it, almost like being maced in the nose directly. The smell is good once you have it on but the initial smell is, interesting.</li>
    <li> The iteam came very quickly and arrived before christmas even though it said it wouldnt and it also smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  When I wear curve, I get a lot of compliment from men and women that enjoy the smell also.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the way this smells we orderd it not knowing what it smelled like even tho it had good rating but we still took a chance yes I&#x27;m going to collect all the curves:) I do recommend it:)only thing is the smell don&#x27;t last all day but that&#x27;s no big deal!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Brings back memories!</li>
    <li> I first smelled this scent on a cruise ship and liked it...so did my wife.  Like probably a lot of people I was a previous user of the regular Curve.  I waited until I got home to buy it because I knew I would get a smoking deal on it from Amazon.  I read the single review on Curve Chill talking about how weak it was, and was a little worried.  I actually like scents that are subtle, so I thought this may actually work in my favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got instead was super strong, and stands in such stark contrast to the experience of the first reviewer.  If I spray more than about a quarter spray on myself I smell like I have been marinating in it.  And it lasts all the way until the next morning.  It is really strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude that the other reviewer got a bad batch, or perhaps I got a bad batch.  Either that, or its just all very subjective...each person reacts differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say, I have about 25 years worth of cologne in this 4oz bottle at the rate I spray it on.  So, I give it 5 stars for being a good value, but 3 stars for being too strong....a blended score of 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on Curve Crush, I used it for about a year and always received compliments on it long after I had put it on.  This is NOT the case with Curve Chill.  You can put on 15 sprays, and though it smells good (a lot like CK One) it hardly lasts for 5 minutes.  I would recommend something else, maybe something that stays on for more than a minute.  I can put it on right before I leave and by the time I get outside the scent is gone, no matter how close the other person is.  With Curve Crush, 2 or 3 sprays would leave me smelling good throughout the day.  Very disappointed. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great! At first it was overwhelming, but then I got use to it, and I got around to it. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments every time I spray some on.</li>
    <li> I have got compliments and it holds the smell for a long time. I actually ordered two more and was shipped fast. Great price and i&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> great product.  fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great manly scent, fresh makes a woman not want to stay away form her man.  It smells so so good!</li>
    <li> Good always genuine I am buying almost every two month same cologne 100% pure...</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; great service. I&#x27;m chillin:)</li>
    <li> Hey this would smell great if it were a bug killer. I get the familiar scent of raid mixed with cool water when I spray this stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, definitely one of my favorite colognes I&#x27;ve ever bought and it is also a really good price!! :)</li>
    <li> This fragrance is by far the best Curve one I&#x27;ve tried.  Unlike the Classic Curve or Kicks fragrances, this one is not so &#x27;strong&#x27; or &#x27;distinctive&#x27; yet still has a VERY enjoyable smell.  It isn&#x27;t overbearing and still holds it&#x27;s aroma hours after applied.  It also doesn&#x27;t get old or worn out in my opinion.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get tired of this cologne.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have never bought a perfume that has no smell after spraying it on. This is it!!! i was actually wondering if I had on any cologne after five minutes of spraying it on. DONT BUY!</li>
    <li> My boys were very pleases with the Curve cologne.  They love Curve for men brand. Great Christmas gift for them.</li>
    <li> I totally love the smell of this cologne and everyone in my office loves it too!!! The ladies absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Nice. Good price and the product is just as advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the fragrance that is given off by this cologne. I just randomly selected this fragrance because the price was decent and I loved the women perfume that Liz creates. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance, it smells great!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Omg just got this today smells so good. This is my favorite cologne now</li>
    <li> The chill was okay. I will try to order something else next time to see the other colognes they have in the same brand</li>
    <li> it smells really good use it every time.....you will always be smelling fresh and you will receive many complements .......a great collection of curve also recommend the curve crush another great addition to the family :D</li>
    <li> alright. not too great, but not bad either</li>
    <li> Bought for my hubby as it&#x27;s his favorite.  I like the way or smells on him.</li>
    <li> rapido y un producto de exelente calidad. era lo que buscaba y la empresa amazon me facilita esta y muchas compras mas de exelente calidad</li>
    <li> nice smell, great for a work perfume, the price was good also</li>
    <li> i really love it.t came in time and i appreciate it</li>
    <li> Very good as always...</li>
    <li> Simply love this Cologne it smells great.</li>
    <li> Love it, great smell.</li>
    <li> HE LOVED IT! I LOVED IT! And we&#x27;re Chillin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Ive been using the Curve Chill at least 6 years, i am more than glad to keep buyng it from amazon since is one of my favorites fragances.</li>
    <li> This product work ok but it&#x27;s kinda weak. I put about 15 sprays on and an hour later I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore. Maybe it&#x27;s the body chemistry.</li>
    <li> Get complaints on it all the time</li>
    <li> Curve always smells good, no matter what version i choose. It&#x27;s subtle and is not overpowering. the scent  remains over 24 hours. plus for the 4.2 ounce bottle and the incredible price makes it a bargain.</li>
    <li> The Product was a great buy. Item as described and was shipped fast! Would highly recommend seller. Great price. Packed well</li>
    <li> I love this smell!!!! it is so sexy and for the price it is well worth it. I hate spicy smelling cologne.. this is far from it. It smooth and I&#x27;m sure any woman would love to smell this on someone! lol</li>
    <li> My husband gets so many compliments when he have this cologne spray on. i had to buy my son some once he smelled it. Once he got his own cologne he said the girls at school talked about it even. This is great cologne spray.</li>
    <li> This is a cool mild smell that will always last.  When buying perfumes online I am most sceptic but this was the real deal.</li>
    <li> Curve Chill by Liz Claiborne for Men - 4.2 Ounce Cologne Spray is some good smelling cologne to have on.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product three different times from three different companies and this company is the one that finally got my order right. And the product also got to my house really fast. This was a gift for my brother and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Has more of a women&#x27;s perfume odor. I love Curve products normally, but this one does not fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Smells great! shipped fast</li>
    <li> I never tough that this &amp;#34; curves &amp;#34; would have this great fragrance, it smell clean winterish, very soft and yet so great</li>
    <li> Bought this for my finacee. He loves anything Liz Claiborne for Men. It smells light and it perfect for year round cologne. It smells very good on him.</li>
    <li> Smells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
    <li> My Son loves the curve Chill because, girls tend to hug him more when he wears it.</li>
    <li> Came in on time neatly packaged and in perfect condition smells clean and fresh. For when you just wanna \\&quot;chill\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great! and the price?!? just makes it that much better. . . Im 23. . . dont know if older guys would like this though. . .</li>
    <li> Smells great but a little weak shortly after sprayed. I think I will default to the original curve fragrance .</li>
    <li> Excellent,..thanks,..</li>
    <li> This is a fake and the smell will fade within 3 seconds don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I got a half oz. of this exact kind of curve at walmart and it was $11! So i got it to try and its pretty damn good it last a long time and when i got the package i thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be this big its going to last my whole school year and further. Definitely recomend this its $15.51 come on its ridiculously cheap!</li>
    <li> the sent is very light and easy on the senses, and last for hours, I will continue to order this and others....</li>
    <li> not one of my fav curve brands at all</li>
    <li> Excellent product I recommend it</li>
    <li> inexpensive but quite good</li>
    <li> Great product and Great service! I&#x27;m a happy Client!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. I melt every time he puts it on. This cologne smells AMAZING!!! I remember the 1st time I smelled it years ago at work on this older man and it was unbelievable! A co worker and I stopped him because we just had to know what he was wearing. I love it on a man! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne!</li>
    <li> Decent smell (not as good as the green bottle original) but that being said, can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Good to use as an every day cologne for work so you can save the nicer/high end for evening attire etc.</li>
    <li> you guys sold me a fake spray, this spray doesn&#x27;t last for 5mins, i am very disappointed with guys..I need to be compensated</li>
    <li> This product is sold for men.Should be sold for womens scents Like flowers not the products listed..The  not a good scent.</li>
    <li> I always used crush, But chill was a cheaper side step. Smells great, and last long for the price. Not to mention my girlfriend likes it, Great seller, had it shipped and here in 3 days. (florida.) Awesome!</li>
    <li> happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> My husband just loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> This was a new one for me. It smells ok but doesn&#x27;t really match my chemistry. It almost has a baby powder smell to it that isn&#x27;t overwhelming but it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I like the entire line of CURVE (wave) being my favorite. This is a great smell bit a little to strong for my taste. What i have come to like about the CURVE line of colognes are they are not like other colognes because they do not overwhelm the room or the moment.</li>
    <li> Curve Chill by Liz Claiborne smells great and is a \\&quot;steal of a deal\\&quot;... Chill is a clean citrus fragrance out of the bottle that settles on the skin with notes of citrus, floral, and musk.  Definitely, a good scent that has appeal.  There have been some comparisons to Chrome, but I am not sure I get that... Nothing new to the scent, but it does have appeal.  That is about the extent of the fragrance - I am a huge fan of the original Curve and Bora Bora, but Chill does not have the longevity of those two... Disappointing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reviews generally consider the following areas that are important to me: appeal and uniqueness of the scent (i.e. easy on the nose); \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), projection/sillage, longevity, appropriate season and event for fragrance; quality and/or uniqueness of bottle and packaging (i.e. easy on the eyes); and, the price/value of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not totally inclusive, my evaluation of Chill is as follows (scoring is out of 5 stars - 1 star is low, 3 is average, and 5 stars is best):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appeal/Uniqueness of Scent: 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow Factor:  3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appropriate season/event for fragrance: 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality/design of bottle and packaging: 4.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price/Value: 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Points:  27.5 points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Average Score: 3.93 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments:  As previously mentioned, Chill really does have a clean citrus musky scent, it just does not last on the skin or clothing.  Sweetie did mention that it smelled great (and it was about 4 hours following a reapplication) - it has potential Wow Factor... I like the design of the bottle, clear and \\&quot;etched\\&quot; artistry that is easy on the eyes.  I am a huge Curve (Claiborne for that matter), but I am disappointed in the longevity.  Great deal too... If you are looking for a pleasant scent that is not overbearing, this one is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Chill 3.93 stars, out of 5. If you are a Claiborne fan, add it to your collection - otherwise, spend your money on something that will last longer.  Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes...dd it to your collection - otherwise, spend your money on something that will last longer.  Ride the wave and don&#x27;t ask where it goes...</li>
    <li> I love this cologne . I purchased this for my husband as a gift . He love curve and this curve chill smells amazing . When He put it on your could tell it had a amazing smell to it . It was not to strong or to harsh . He got compliments all the time with this cologne and it does last on your body way longer then cologne&#x27;s usually do  . He is happy and so am I</li>
    <li> i like the smell of this cologne on my husband, not too strong and I will be getting this product for him.</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stay with you all day! Maybe for the younger crowd!</li>
    <li> Great smell!!! I have used this cologne for the past 6 years and I found it very pleasant and the smell lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a very &#x27;smooth&#x27; smelling cologne that I like. It is replacing my all time favorite &amp;#34;Chaps&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Tried a new Curve Cologne gift for my husband &amp; we both love it!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is slightly powdery and not appealing in my opinion. It smells cheap, which it is.</li>
    <li> Smells Great! I cant resist my husband when he wears this. i would definitely recommend this scent to any one.</li>
    <li> This Product was a gift, and the person that it was given to seem to enjoy the semll.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my hands down go to cologne. And you cant beat the price anywhere!!! Trust me i have tryed!;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the price, I would describe it as subtle and boring.</li>
    <li> Clean and shower fresh. Very casual, bordering on sporty. Young and a bit generic, but refreshing in the summer. Good for strictly casual occasions.</li>
    <li> just as expected...very pleased</li>
    <li> The bottle I received is a knock off. The bottle is wrong, the scent is off and is very week. Not as good of a deal as it seems.  Easy way to tell if yours is a fake is if the glass on the bottle is frosted or if it is only a sticker wrapped around the lower portion of the bottle.</li>
