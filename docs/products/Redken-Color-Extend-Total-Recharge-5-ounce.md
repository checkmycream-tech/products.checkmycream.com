      <li>This stuff is the best and as usual when you find something good, it gets discontinued.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy that Amazon carries it since I can&#x27;t find it in stores near me.</li>
      <li>(And any product that can do that, at the price of highlightling, is worth it!).</li>

      <li>I started using it years ago before I colored my hair just for how it made my hair style better; now it is a bonus that it helps my color last longer!</li>
      <li>my Redken Color Extend Shampoo and conditioner and the whole regime is worth it because it works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and like all Redken products, it really does the job.</li>
      <li>This really does seem to extend the life-span of my color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and a conditioner can just weigh it down</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if your hair is damaged from coloring and highlights like mine.</li>
      <li>Worth the money, I only use a couple sprays</li>
      <li>I was a natural redhead and now color it</li>
      <li>I use it between shampooing hair and applying conditioner and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Beyond that, this leaves my hair so soft and detangled after washing.</li>
      <li>The Total Recharge spray keeps my color looking like I just came from the salon, even my red coloring which can be notoriously difficult to keep from fading looks great.</li>

    <li> best thing for my hair to protect the color</li>
    <li> This product works well and it does help with my damaged hair.  Not much else I can say except it is easier to have it delivered than going to the store.</li>
    <li> Am really pleased with this product.  I use it between shampooing hair and applying conditioner and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I started using this when I bought some on a whim in a sample size in a beauty supply store. It&#x27;s great for adding some shine and revitalizing your colored hair. When my roots first start showing, I spray this on and it makes the grays less noticeable which is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. I was expecting for something better after reading the reviews and after using it didn&#x27;t think that it was an wonderful stuff, but ok!</li>
    <li> First shampoo and rinse then spray this on and leave for a couple minutes.  When you rinse you will feel how nice this product makes your hair feel!  Follow with conditioner...I&#x27;m using Redken Color Extend shampoo and conditioner.  After one use I could see this product was a valuble addition to my regime.  Highly recommend if your hair is damaged from coloring and highlights like mine.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and recently had trouble locating it.  Glad to finally have found it on Amazon.  Works great with protecting my hair from damage due to heat.</li>
    <li> When you spend the time and money to get your color done you want to get the most out of it by caring for the color. I use this between my Redken Color Extend Shampoo and conditioner and the whole regime is worth it because it works. My colors last weeks longer than it would without shampoo and conditioner for colored hair. The Total Recharge spray keeps my color looking like I just came from the salon, even my red coloring which can be notoriously difficult to keep from fading looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product, once a week per my stylists recommendation, for 3 weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My hair is shiny and the color is holding great.  I shampoo first, than spray this on generously, let it site for 2-3 minutes, rinse, and follow with a good conditioner.  As long as I continue to color my hair, I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! it makes my hair soft and smell good! I&#x27;m happy that Amazon carries it since I can&#x27;t find it in stores near me. Thank YOU!</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast. I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s actually helping my colored hair but it definitely helps with the frizzyness I occasionally have. I usually spray it and leave it in my hair maybe every other day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best and as usual when you find something good, it gets discontinued.  The color conditioner Redkin is replacing it with is lousy.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have summer item.</li>
    <li> This really does seem to extend the life-span of my color-treated hair. (And any product that can do that, at the price of highlightling, is worth it!). Beyond that, this leaves my hair so soft and detangled after washing. Honestly, I could completely forego using a conditioner when using this product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product has helped extend the color in my hair and is a great leave-in conditioner.  It is the best.</li>
    <li> I dont think I barely even use my conditioner,  between this product and the other Redken color care products I have! My conditioner will last forever!  lol This stuff is great!!! Seller ships fast! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this after washing and conditioning and leave it in. Instructions say to spray on hair but I find it&#x27;s easier to disperse evenly if I spray several pumps into my hand and spread over my hair. Most curl creams leave my fine hair looking unnatural, this encourages natural curl and smoothness. I was a natural redhead and now color it and I think this product helps keep the color from looking washed out.</li>
    <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. I&#x27;m a fan of Redken&#x27;s Color Extend line, and seeing as I color my hair red, I spare no expense to preserve my color. I love this product because not only does it provide a UV sheild, but it leaves my hair so silky smooth. It helps with frizz-control when I blow dry, and just makes it feel incredibly soft. Worth the money, I only use a couple sprays and I&#x27;m set!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best color protectant I have found. Can wash out or leave in. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling heavy and looks and feels like you just came from salon.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist got me using this as a leave-in conditioner on damp hair after shampooing and using my regular conditioner. I have very fine hair; a spray or two on the ends is all I need and it really makes my hair softer, easier to style and comb or brush. I use it every time I wash my hair; it&#x27;s not too heavy if you just use a little. I started using it years ago before I colored my hair just for how it made my hair style better; now it is a bonus that it helps my color last longer!</li>
    <li> This is a leave-in conditioner that I have used for years.  It leaves my hair managable and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Without this product after I shampoo my hair, my hair has no body. It&#x27;s a little costly, but it lasts a while</li>
    <li> I love this product!  About the time I need to recolor my hair, I just spritz this on and comb through and my hair cones to life!  I have very fine hair and a conditioner can just weigh it down but this actually feels like it changes the texture for me and livens up my hair.</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic! I used to use a detangler, but while on vacation my luggage was lost so I needed to find a replacement. I was in a country that I didn&#x27;t speak the language so I had to do my best to find a replacement. I took a chance on this product and it was a winner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and like all Redken products, it really does the job.</li>
