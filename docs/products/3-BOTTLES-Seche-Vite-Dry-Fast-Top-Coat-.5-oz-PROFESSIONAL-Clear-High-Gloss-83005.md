<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super fast drying top coat and works to strengthen nails! I have seriously strong nails for the first time in the Winter. Buy it, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great Deal! This is by far the best top coat I have ever tried. Dries SO FAST and makes your nails really hard so there are no chips.</li>
    <li> Price was assume when I bought 3 bottles of this item.</li>
    <li> Just delivered!!! I was skeptical. I&#x27;m now a believer! I gave 2 bottles away I was so excited. I broke my only remaining bottle. My mom ALWAYS ruins her nails. She has 10min of patience for her nails to dry &amp; literally they dry hard to the touch. You can sit under the dryer for 10min then go live your life! I&#x27;ll never use another top coat! It does coat super thick (LOVE) so do apply generously or you&#x27;ll swipe the under layers off. I also pay attention to coat the entire nail to the tip bc of all the reviews about peeling &amp; shrinkage. If I had to nit pick I&#x27;d mention that it does dull the shine of appliques &amp; rhinestones sometimes. I didn&#x27;t notice it until about 7 days later so that ain&#x27;t bad. My polish still looks shiny &amp; new! I&#x27;ve not had a problem yet except that I need more!</li>
    <li> This top coat is very strong.  In fact, it&#x27;s probably the best I have ever used. I will be ordering again when my 3 bottles are empty.</li>
    <li> I originally bought 1 bottle just to try it out and when I tried it out, I instantly fell in love with it. I definitely recommend this top coat for every girl, especially if you don&#x27;t have patience to wait for your nails to dry (like me). Def worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it was a AWESOME price!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IT gives nails a gel like finish!</li>
    <li> The only top coat I use--salons use this to seal color, increase shine, and prevent chipping.</li>
    <li> I will never paint my nails with Seche Vite.  It&#x27;s the best product on the market.  And this set of 3 is a great price.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and awesome product!</li>
    <li> As a professional Nail Tech. This is the quickest dry for any job.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! My favorite top coat!</li>
    <li> This dries fast and leaves your nails shiny.  I use it with Julep nail polish.  I love that is  3 free...  Or is it 4 free? Oh well...  This is just as great but twice the size of Julep&#x27;s top coat polymer. I saw a reviewer in their site reference this.  If and the Price is awesome...</li>
    <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! Super shiny, dries extremely fast and my manicures have never lasted longer. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with peeling so far. I&#x27;ll never use another top coat again!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite top coat.  Have you ever gone to bed before your nails were completely dry? One coat of Seche Vite will minimize, if not eliminate, the accidental fabric imprints.</li>
    <li> Works great. Has a strong odor though.</li>
    <li> This top coat peels terribly. Read: it PEELS not chips. I average about  4 days of coverage using this with gelous base coat various nail polish brands. I&#x27;ve used it with SH, Cover Girl, China Glaze, and Wet N Wild, for reference. After a few days it bubbles up on my nail bed, particularly on the inner corners of my thumb and pointer finger. SUPER annoying and frustrating after spending a long time on a manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars for it&#x27;s fast drying ability and amazing shine, nonetheless. Perhaps my technique is wrong, or I just need to use another brand of polish; I do wrap my tips and I&#x27;ve read that this polish needs to be applied to very wet polish. It also shouldn&#x27;t be touched up because that makes the peeling more inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m disappointed because this is apparently the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of topcoats but it&#x27;s not working for me. I&#x27;m willing to experiment with other more expensive polishes such as Essie, or OPI before trying another brand. But my initial few attempts have not impressed me at all.</li>
    <li> I listened to the reviews and bought 3 bottles....this is the kind of topcoat I was looking for....like the salon uses in those secret brown bottles.. Dries extremely fast (like a min?). Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it any more.</li>
    <li> It really is a FAST DRY top coat.  Usually within 5 minutes my nails are COMPLETELY dry, and that&#x27;s with a base coat and 3 coats of polish.  It also adds a nice shine to the nailpolish!</li>
    <li> Love this product despite the smell! A good deal for a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> The quickest drying top coat I have used. Looks just like I just got my nails done at the salon! Make sure to use in an open room so it is able to air out because of the odor and I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you are pregnant.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product dries quickly and leaves a beautiful shine to your nails!</li>
    <li> Best top coat, shiny and long lasting. Extends the life of your nail polish. It just smells strongly and it gets gooey quick, other than that fantastic top coat!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It applies smoothly and dry the nail polish quickly.  Awessome👍.</li>
    <li> Great price i love this top coat drys super fast and it last longer</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  Shipped quickly and safely</li>
    <li> Strong chemical smell. Chips easily compared to opi.</li>
    <li> why does other brands even bother making any other top coat, when this one exists?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will NEVER  use anything other then Seche Vite. Revolutionary!!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;ve seen this polish when I get my nails done, but it&#x27;s definitely not. Every time I use it my polish peels off within a day...</li>
    <li> This is the best quick dry top coat out there. Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> peels super easy within hours of applying.</li>
    <li> There is no better top coat than Seche Vite.  It was literally life-changing for me.  I recommend it to anyone!  Tip: buy at least two bottles - one for your reds and darker colors, and another for your sheers and nudes.  Using this on a nude color after using it over a red will result in streaking.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work. Next day started chipping. To be fair I do a lot  of housework, but OPI top coat works great! Price was good.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time (in 2 days)! All the three bottles were very securely packaged. I love this top coat. Its super shiny and dries very quickly and the best part is, it never smudges my nail art.</li>
    <li> Drys your nails very very fast no problem at all but i will say i got the restore dropper to drop in it to make sure it stays liquidity</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! Nail polish peels within hours. So frustrating</li>
    <li> Best fast-dry top coat that I have tried!</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite top coat of all time!  It dries super fast with an excellent shine... this is the only brand that I use.  The shipment arrived within the time frame expected.  I bought ONE of these at Sephora for the same price that it cost me for these three.  HIGHLY recommended.  I must warn that it does have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> My favorite quick dry top coat! I won&#x27;t use anything else. This topcoat gives your nails a great high shine. The smell is over powering at first so it is a good idea to use it in an open area. The top coat keeps your nails looking pretty great and chip free for more then a few days. The top coat does cause a bit of shrinkage to the polish, but not enough to keep me from using it. It also works with gems to keep them in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Great deal specially since it&#x27;s $9 in any store you go to. Highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product, and a great price for the quantity you receive.  Always dries super fast, clean, and smooth.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Dries super fast and a great deal</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for my polish to dry, this top coat makes things so much easier.  It has high gloss, dries quick and won&#x27;t pull the base color if it&#x27;s not quite dry yet!  I also feel like it helps preserve my polish.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging coz i live in the middle east ,, nothing leaking or anything and ofcourse the polish itself i am in love,,, takes a few seconds to shine and dry ,,,,</li>
    <li> Best Topcoat ever.  Dries within one minute.  Use in a well ventilated room or outside.  Very strong smell, but disappears quickly.  This is the only topcoat I use.  I don&#x27;t have patience for anything else.  Who has all day to do their own manicure  Best price I have seen.  At Beauty Supply store near by, it sells for $8 to $12 depending on if it is on sale.  Bought as stocking stuffers for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, as described. Thank you</li>
    <li> Life will never be the same again. Why did I not know about this before??? Order #2. I take it when I get my manicure :)</li>
    <li> I use it mainly to help dry my color coats. It dries incredibly fast - even thick coats</li>
    <li> Trust the reviews!! This top coat is AH-Mazing. Dries hard in minutes, lasts for days. No smudging or bleeding, doesn&#x27;t pick up color from the polish. Will be ordering these again!</li>
    <li> The best top coat EVER!!!! it drys so fast and makes my nails look so great! This product is #1 to me!</li>
    <li> Perfect, exactly what I wanted and received fast.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I always keep a bottle on hand.&lt;br /&gt;Works so very fast and gives my nails a clean shine.</li>
    <li> Best quick drying top coat..</li>
    <li> Best clear polish I have found. Makes my nail polish last a lot longer. It goes on like a gel. Really cool.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Dries fast on nails, much faster than other top coats I&#x27;ve used like Sally Hansen. This is a great product at a good price! I keep one safely nestled in my purse for quick fixes if a piece of polish pulls up, which is usually after a few days. Much longer than any other top coat I have used. It&#x27;s worth trying for sure! It&#x27;s just a little smelly when putting it on (when bottle is open) but that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. When the ladies at the nail salon see my fingernails (they only get my toes), they always ask if they are gel nails. Not so! Regular polish with this as a top coat. I use the base coat as well. Dries nails super fast, super shiny.</li>
    <li> Also a must.  It dries very quickly and feels so smooth.  A few things I don&#x27;t care for are that it makes my polish contract and that leaves my nails tippy (with the tips showing).  Also it gets thick fast in the bottle.  I have purchased the stuff that&#x27;s basically paint thinner and it helps.  In the end this is still my favorite top coat by far.</li>
    <li> 3 bottles for less than $12?! Ummm yes please! What a steal. This is my all time favorite top coat polish and when I saw that 3 bottles come for less than $12, I had to get it. I paint my nails constantly for work and 3 bottles at once is perfect. Drug store and nail shops sell them for $10 a bottle</li>
    <li> Very nice and shiny looking - but seems like my polish chips off shortly after applying when using it. I love the way it makes my polish look and the way it dries quickly, but every-time I use it seems like my polish is chipping off pretty bad the very next day.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! Nails dry in just 5 minutes and they last for over a week. Don&#x27;t forget to use two: one for dark color and one for light colors.</li>
    <li> Nails dry to a beautiful, hard, completely dry finish in just a few minutes!!!!!  Meant to work over polish, not alone.</li>
    <li> My daughter worked at a nail salon and told me this is the best top coat.  She is right.  It dries fast and is very durable.  The only drawback is when you want to remove your polish and have to scrub a bit harder to remove this.</li>
    <li> I like how my nails look with this top coat. Dries fast and help maintain my manicure</li>
    <li> Delivered by expected date. Packaged well. Best top coat ever. Best deal ever. I&#x27;m a happy girl. ;)</li>
    <li> Seche Vite top coat does what it claims to do : dries quickly while giving a clear finish.  My only qualm is that within a couple days of wear, I find that my nail polish has small cracks that start from the tips and quickly spread.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would immediately purchase this again, but it lives up to its speed and shine.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat!!! The price is right for the size and to me...this is the shiniest top coat ever, dries in a minute, very quick delivery! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It really does dry hard within 5-7 minutes. I will never use any other drying product again. If you are applying many coats, you can use this between coats as well. It does dry quickly- also in the bottle. It will thicken with a lot of use with the bottle top being open. I recommend also getting the Seche Vite thinner if you use this product often. It says to add a few drops, but I put a little more than that. If you do a lot of nail painting, go ahead and order more than one bottle at the time. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Will be Ordering more in the near future...thanks</li>
    <li> Yes I am satisfied at the price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to make new order in near future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Came extremely fast! Best deal ever!</li>
    <li> excellent product, great service</li>
    <li> Will always buy my Seche like this! Excellent deal!</li>
    <li> Dries your nail polish super fast! Love,love,love!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Superb shine, nails dry quick and my polish stays on for a week (7 days). I highly recommend this top coat.</li>
    <li> This topcoat is the best topcoat I have ever used! This is the second time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased. It has never gotten gloopy on me, the formula is so great, and the brush is wide and holds a lot of polish so there&#x27;s no annoying streaks when I apply it. It&#x27;s just smooth and shiny. I tried the Essie gel like top coat and it&#x27;s nothing in comparison to this seche viche that I paid 11.24 for 3 bottles! Definitely a steal and I will be buying again and again. No chips or anything. Long lasting shine. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great top coat !! It last a long time with the regular polish .</li>
    <li> Perfect polish distribution, high gloss, dries super quick, long lasting! Will never use another top coat! Great deal on this site! I can&#x27;t stop yelliiiiing! Lol.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best top coat around!</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish. If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
    <li> Wow, this top coat is amazing! The first fingernail I painted was literally dry by the time I painted my last one, I love this polish!!!!</li>
    <li> Superb product.  I always get compliments when I use this top coat.</li>
    <li> Great topcoat....I was disappointed because one of the bottles had leaked out and was empty.</li>
    <li> Hands down best top coat. Dries to touch in a minute. I like to paint my nails right before bed, and I don&#x27;t wake up with any nasty sheet marks on my nails.</li>
    <li> This is by far the absolute most best top coat you can buy out there. yeah the smell is strong but so is every other good quality nail polish. Always make sure to apply when nail polish is a bit wet (not dripping wet though). You&#x27;ll get compliments everywhere you go. Got the 3 pack to share with my friends. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Best topcoat around in my opinion. It&#x27;s affordable and it dries very fast. Plus it gives your nails a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> This topcoat is seriously the best I have ever used. I&#x27;m convinced a wizard created it. It dries super fast and super shiny.</li>
    <li> These were not real.  They didn&#x27;t come in a box, they came in a bundle.  I&#x27;ve used the real ones and they&#x27;ve worked right away, these didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Only top coat I use, quick and shiny!</li>
    <li> Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat is by far the best top coat I have ever used. The three pack is an excellent deal, it arrived quickly and individually wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> Dries so incredibly fast and lasts much longer than other top coats that I&#x27;ve used. Will be sticking with this.</li>
    <li> thanks your product is wonderful and keep up the outstanding work</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this from my beautician, but found it for less on Amazon!!  This is a GREAT PRODUCT!!!  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I feel this is the best top coat out there. It dries very quickly and adds a beautiful shine to my manicures. I know a lot of people have complained about shrinkage, but I find it isn&#x27;t that bad. It does tend to get thick towards the bottom 1/3 of the bottle, but some Seche Restore helps that.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a quick dry top coat for ages and finially I found one.  When you paint your nails even with two or three coats, and you put on the top coat on your nails, they will be dry to the touch in less than 10 minutes.  I can even paint my nails before I go to bed and wake up the next morning with flawless nails.</li>
    <li> best fast drying top coat ever made!  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Super cheap price! Product as described :-) Thanks!</li>
    <li> when they finally all arrived (separately) it was great</li>
    <li> I bought one bottle - tried it out and loved it!  So I ordered 6 more as stocking stuffers. It puts a glass-like top coat on and really does harden/dry 2 coats of polish in just a minute or 2. I&#x27;m very pleased - finally something that actually lives up to its promises!!</li>
    <li> quick drying top coat that lasts.  Sender is prompt</li>
    <li> I will only use this quick dry and I bring to the salon because the salon mixes their quick dry or use a less quality brand of quick dry.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE VERY BEST CLEAR POLISH I HAVE IN MY 43 YEARS OF LIVING; HARDENS NAILS LIKE A BRICK; SUPER-SHINY; 10/10.</li>
    <li> At fist wen I opened it, I was so eager to try it out and quickly slobbed on some base coat and polish and immediately without waiting for it to dry, I applied the top coat.(seche) I waited a couple minutes (maybe 2-3) and touched the nail. It was still wet and gely. I was upset because all the reviews I read, said it would be completely dry in about 2-3 min. I then used the top coat on an already dry polished nail, and then to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t even 3 minutes before it totally dried. My recommendation is that you wait for your polish to dry a little. (3 min.) and then put the seche on it. That is what worked best for me. Otherwise, it does what it is meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; My nose started to burn a little after smelling it for a couple minutes.  I just hold my breath and open the windows. (I did feel a little dizzy)&lt;br /&gt;Have to let your polish &amp;#34;semi-set&amp;#34; before applying topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Dries SUPER fast!&lt;br /&gt;No worries about kinks and bumps</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has cut down my nail time by hours.  I use Seche Clear as the base coat, two coats of your favorite polish then then one thick coat of Seche Vite.  Done!  No need to wait for the polishes to dry.  Just do all ten nails, one right after the other.  I used to wait about 30 minutes between coats and then sit for at least 1½ hours to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; dry.  Then I would sleep holding my hands in a special position so the nails could finish curing during the night.  There were lots of times that I would wake up with a blanket pattern on my nails. Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it takes about 30 minutes to cover all ten nails with the 4 coats and then I do sit for about an hour reading or watching TV to let it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; dry, which is not really necessary because the Seche Vite dries faster than that.  I do use nail protectors just as precaution when I sleep as well.  This top coat dries fast and very hard.  My nails do not chip anymore.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because of all the reviews and I am very, very pleased. I&#x27;m very skeptical when trying new products so 4 me 2 purchase this and take the time to write a review is a 1st. Definitely recommend this. Dries in less than a minute and lasts over a week. Very impressive.</li>
    <li> Really good, dry fast, but with a strong smile</li>
    <li> I will never buy anotther top coat, I have found the best!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Quick Dry&amp;#34; is right! This stuff dries soooo quickly. It leaves a sort of glassy finish so your nails are super shiny and a bit hard, like acrylics. It&#x27;s magical.  This is my absolute favorite top coat out of everything I&#x27;ve tried (mostly drug store brands, though a couple were higher-end). I&#x27;ve heard of a couple indies that are supposed to be amazing, but you really can&#x27;t beat this price.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of one tiny problem. It doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit, but it does affect some people. So, you know how if you paint your nails and then leave them for weeks, you can see a bit of unpainted nail because your nails have grown and you haven&#x27;t repainted them? Well, Seche Vite tends to cause &amp;#34;shrinkage,&amp;#34; which kinda looks like that. The polish sort of shrinks in toward the middle of the nail, causing some unpainted nail to peek through at the bottom (and sometimes the sides). It&#x27;s not severe, it varies depending on the brand of nail polish you&#x27;re using, and it&#x27;s less noticeable if you wrap the tip of your nail as well as just painting it on top. It doesn&#x27;t happen right away, though, so if you&#x27;re like me, and you never wear any polish longer than a few days, you probably won&#x27;t have any noticeable shrinkage. And honestly, it&#x27;s worth it. Because compared to most top coats you can find at this price, this one definitely wins.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! It dried so fast even with 2 coats of polish under it. I normally do gel nails myself but sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the time to wait for the light to cure them this polish looks like a gel top coat I am very pleased with this purchase! It does have a stronger smell than regular nail polish but nothing to bad</li>
    <li> It really does dry in about one to two minutes, I got three bottles for around $12 so it was totally worth it. I use this top coat any time I polish my nails.</li>
    <li> I was scared this was a sham because this bottle at my local drug store is $10. I was very happy with packaging and it arrived in about 5 days. New, clean, clear bottles. This was defiantly worth it.</li>
    <li> To be completely honest, I can&#x27;t tell whether or not this is *authentic* Seche, but it sure works like a charm. It&#x27;s nice and thick like Seche, and keeps my manicure looking fresh for almost a week. Seche has gotten so expensive at CVS (almost $10 per bottle) so 3/$12 is a steal.</li>
    <li> I have used many nail polish brands and this is by far my favorite top coat.  It is completely dry within 5 minutes and goes on thick, so even if you have sparkle nail polish, it is still smooth.  This product not only works the best, but it is less than half the price of other name brands.  This is more chip-resistant than any other product I have used also!  This is the perfect gift for yourself or anyone else that doesn&#x27;t have hours to sit and wait for their nails to dry.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s such an amazing product , it makes your nail polish dry fast and last for a long time</li>
    <li> Dries fast.  Does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Love this item. Dries my nails, after applying two coats of polish, quicker than any other top coat. Gives a lasting shine and great added protection to my nails. Prevents chipping of polish better than any other top coat.</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing product... longer lasting polish and super high shine... you wont use anything else once you try it!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product dies exactly what it says, drys quickly down to the base coat. The polish leaves a high shine on the polish and I have less chipping of my nail polish.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat out there! Dries quickly to a super hard and shiny finish, lasts way longer than similar products by Essie or OPI- I&#x27;ve found that other top coats take much longer to dry, leaving you immobile for much longer. I would even estimate that the Seche Vite top coat dries your nail polish (one base coat and two coats of color) in less than two minutes! Love the Amazon price for three (much cheaper than buying it at my local beauty store) and you can keep your extra nail polish in the fridge to keep it from getting sticky.</li>
    <li> I like this because it gives a nice gloss and dries really fast. It seems to be long lasting as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this top coat for years and I love it. It dries completely within an hour, but it&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; after about two minutes. Within an hour you won&#x27;t have any problems with indentation or anything like that. Yes, there is some shrinkage sometimes, but this is basically a given with fast-drying top coats. I really don&#x27;t find it to be very noticeable. The top coat is VERY shiny and gives it almost a gel-like appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to give a shout out to the company. I ordered 3 bottles but received one and emailed them right away. They replied within an hour and were EXTREMELY nice and apologetic and shipped out the remaining bottles immediately. Some may find this to be annoying, but I am just grateful I didn&#x27;t have to go through ANY trouble and they were so so nice and quick with their response. Very happy and impressed with my purchase, would definitely purchase again! :)</li>
    <li> Great product-would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Dries your nails in about 20 seconds. You can wash the dishes without smudging. A lot cheaper on amazon than buying from the drug store.</li>
    <li> Nails dry in an instant and gives you a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price best top coat there is very high shine helps prevent yellowing polish. From sun. This is used by professions</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite top coat. It dries my nails superfast and has a high glossy shine. Would definitely keep this in stock at all times.</li>
    <li> Love this top coat. Will probably have to order more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a no chip gloss finish. I got that! It dries so quickly also. The smell was strong but most polishes are.  I will purchase again and I recieved my polish quickly!</li>
    <li> Works well, in fact, it takes a file to get this off! So if you are looking for long wear this is the product for you. I was my hands a lot and this polish holds up better than anything else! A little filing and this comes off and you are ready change your color and repaint!</li>
    <li> It peels a bit after a few days, but better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
    <li> Best topcoat!! Worth it...</li>
    <li> I love this top coat! I use it on myself and my two girls as it dries so fast!</li>
    <li> Dries quickly &amp; like a rock. Nice glassy finish which is still nice after several days. I usually tell my clients to re-topcoat every other day, but I don&#x27;t think that will be needed with this. Maybe every 4-5 days, depending on how hard they are on their nails.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this when buying some nail polish.  On my next trip I took it along as my top coat.  I have had shellac and gel nail polish done which makes your nails really hard.  When you use seche vite it feels as though you have gel nail polish on.  It is the best product out there, and trust me I try everything. You will love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this top coat is supposed to be very long lasting, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to work any better than my sally hanson quick dry top coat. It&#x27;s definitely a great top coat, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be THAT outstanding compared to others.</li>
    <li> best top coat I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> It takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product, the base color does not come off on the brush when applying, dries quickly, recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of these bottles. I have purchased this product from this seller more than once and do more than one bottle at a time. This is my go to top coat. It literally dries in seconds and doesn&#x27;t smear the polish underneath. The only down fall is that it does have some shrinkage on the sides of your nails if you use to much!</li>
    <li> Love this and it is so shiny and makes the nail polish last a long time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this top coat (by far the best I have found and used) and was glad to see them sold in a larger quantity for less. Delivery was fast and exactly what I expected. Will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and good customer service</li>
    <li> Best fast drying top coat ever, and this is the best deal. It&#x27;s usually $8 just for one of these bottles.</li>
    <li> Love this product, Cant paint my nails without this top coat!&lt;br /&gt;Very salon like finish! especially if you do a nice thick drop per nail.</li>
    <li> Good clear polish if you can stand the smell.  It smells like spray paint or some other really strong lacquer but it fades as soon as it&#x27;s dry.  It does a descent job preventing chipping for a couple of days but not much after that.  If I apply more than one coat, after  day or two, I can practically just peel it off my nails, whether I&#x27;m wearing a coat of a different polish on underneath or not.  Overall, I would say it&#x27;s a descent product but I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
