    <li> Personally I don&#x27;t think it is worth the wait time in receiving. I ordered the week of Dec 10th and finally received Jan 18th. Seriously, that is a long time to wait for a product to be delivered. That said, the product is decent. It is pictured as shown. The flowers are fragile, but pretty.</li>
    <li> Its very pretty, but I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times and there&#x27;s about 3 flowers left on the headband. I have gotten a lot of compliments so that has saved me from writing a pretty bad review. If you are looking for a long lasting piece, umm keep looking... I&#x27;ll write a good review once I find a durable headpiece.</li>

    <li> The headband is a bit tight, and it&#x27;d rather cheaply made. (The flowers are pitiful and kind of squished.) but for the price it&#x27;s a pretty nice flower crown. (Compared to like $10 ones)&lt;br /&gt;And once worn it doesn&#x27;t look as poor of quality.</li>

    <li> It is really pretty and classy. You can wear it with anything and it seems really real. I loved one from urban outfitters but it was like $20 and i didnt think it was worth it. I am really happy I got this one instead, same quality but much cheaper!</li>
