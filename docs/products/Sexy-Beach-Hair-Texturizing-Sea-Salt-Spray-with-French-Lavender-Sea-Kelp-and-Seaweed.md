      <li>The smell is so refreshing and the texture is incredible.  </li>
      <li>It did leave my hair feeling great &amp; it smells lovely</li>
      <li>However, I love the smell of this spray!  </li>
      <li>I will be going on a business trip and will try the product there, so I&#x27;m hopeful my hair looks better then!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite summer product!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing</li>
      <li>I love that it is organic and good for you.  </li>
      <li>I think the salt provides some texture and tackiness so that the waves stay together better, so this basically acts--for me, at least--like a very light spray gel.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and light.  </li>
      <li>I just love the look of my hair in the end.</li>
      <li>I love how it made my hair look and feel.  </li>
      <li>But the spray is over the top.</li>
      <li>After using Sexy Beach Hair</li>
      <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>It is mostly water though, so</li>
      <li>I really love the results.</li>
      <li>and I have a lovely rash.</li>
      <li>my hair did have added texture and a bit more volume.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair look sexy instead of unkept.  </li>
      <li>It smells lovely and gives my hair lots of body.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product...light and not overbearing.</li>
      <li>I got this to add more texture in my hair and it looks great and natural.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and love sea salt spray to give me volume - do not buy this product.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you have baby fine hair, this would work.</li>
      <li>Holds my angel fine hair in place, now that is a feat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You should use a little at a time and it is a perfect result.  </li>
      <li>oh and it was transferred into my cheap Suave bottle</li>
      <li>Once my hair dries completely, I go ahead and spray some more to add more volume.</li>
      <li>I have wavy, fairly thick--in both volume and individual strands--hair, so I wasn&#x27;t sure this would do much for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and does have a pleasant fragrance, but when I use it and go outdoors, my hair tends to get frizzy and looks like it&#x27;s dry and damaged.</li>
      <li>I have hair with a slight wave and it works just great.  </li>
      <li>Makes my fine, somewhat curly/wavy hair very sticky though</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably make my own next time!</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, but it does next to nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few of these beach hair sprays and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I also use it if I want to put my hair in a sexy  updo to have a little more texture and hold -</li>
      <li>My hair is very, very straight</li>
      <li>I needed something natural to add texture to my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Tried soaking the pump in hot water to unclog it</li>
      <li>I first spritz it on to my damp hair.</li>
      <li>;).</li>
      <li>Very summery!</li>
      <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>The spray also has a lavender scent, which is pleasant enough though I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid some essential oils because of danger they can pose to cats.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And it smells, truly and totally luscious, as described in Lucky Magazine!</li>
      <li>I received twice as much.</li>
      <li>the whole beach wave look yet.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Do not spray on scalp, really, a spray on your head/hair product unsafe for your skin?</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>Ugh, I&#x27;m pissed I bought this without Really looking at it.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this sea salt spray.</li>
      <li>so I really don&#x27;t use it a lot.</li>
      <li>I really tried to like it</li>
      <li>Since I live in an area that has high humidity year-round, I think this product doesn&#x27;t get to &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; as much as I anticipated it to.</li>
      <li>Other than that the product is fine.</li>
      <li>I chose this one because it looked like a good price for the amount, but the amount was also less than I expected from the picture.</li>
      <li>Started to use it, very fine mist and hardly knew it was on my hair...</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s truly all natural!</li>
      <li>Bottled pretty and has a nice scent, however, it did nothing for texturizing my hair and too much made it feel dirty.</li>
      <li>No stickiness, just naturally soft hair.  </li>
      <li>very bummed that the pump was clogged after the second use!</li>
      <li>But... I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>so I think it will last a super long time.  </li>
      <li>My hair is long, straight, fine and pretty thin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s water, sea salt, few drops of essential oils &amp; couple extracts you can buy online easily.</li>
      <li>The bottle probably is the most expensive part:/ it doesn&#x27;t really work well either, you have to use quit a bit of it</li>
      <li>I spritz it on after washing and blow dry my hair as usual, and my waves have slightly more definition.</li>
      <li>IT doesn&#x27;t stick in your hair very flexible and doesn&#x27;t make it stiff and gross at all very natural!!! .</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m not sure if I will get a second bottle once this is done, but the spray definitely gives a nice extra boost to my hair.  </li>
      <li>This does make me a little hesitant about using long-term, and for now I make sure to use it far away from my little guy.  </li>
      <li>Careful not to use too much or it will get sticky.  </li>
      <li>It looks like I spent the day at the beach and holds up very well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I give this 5 stars! I really love the results. I got this to add more texture in my hair and it looks great and natural. I first spritz it on to my damp hair. I scrunch and style it a bit. Once my hair dries completely, I go ahead and spray some more to add more volume. I just love the look of my hair in the end. I definitely reccomend it and it&#x27;s a must have summer product. I take it to the beach with me every time. The scent is great and not too overpowering. Very summery! This is my favorite summer product!</li>
    <li> Since I live in an area that has high humidity year-round, I think this product doesn&#x27;t get to &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; as much as I anticipated it to. It&#x27;s not sticky and does have a pleasant fragrance, but when I use it and go outdoors, my hair tends to get frizzy and looks like it&#x27;s dry and damaged. I do like the product though. I will be going on a business trip and will try the product there, so I&#x27;m hopeful my hair looks better then!</li>
    <li> Holds my angel fine hair in place, now that is a feat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it smells, truly and totally luscious, as described in Lucky Magazine!</li>
    <li> This works well and I appreciate the short ingredient list - it&#x27;s truly all natural! It is mostly water though, so I&#x27;ll probably make my own next time!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of these beach hair sprays and this is by far the best.  It smells nice and light.  It does not have the bad chemicals that mess up my hair and make it even worse.  I have hair with a slight wave and it works just great.  It looks like I spent the day at the beach and holds up very well.  I also use it if I want to put my hair in a sexy  updo to have a little more texture and hold - i read this tip on some blog and it really works. It comes in a big bottle so I think it will last a super long time.  Careful not to use too much or it will get sticky.  You should use a little at a time and it is a perfect result.  Great buy! thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Do not spray on scalp, really, a spray on your head/hair product unsafe for your skin? I tossed the product rather than risk whatever it might do to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair; it usually gets weighed down by creams or stiff from sprays. This wave spray works the best! I use it when my hair is a bit limp...or dirty ;). Definitely does the trick!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product...light and not overbearing. Packaging is great and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the pump clogging.  My hair is long, straight, fine and pretty thin so I typically don&#x27;t use products as they weigh down my hair.  After using Sexy Beach Hair my hair did have added texture and a bit more volume.  About half way through the day, I pulled my hair up, which I typically have to do anyway.  I won&#x27;t use the product everyday but definitely something I&#x27;ll use occasionally to give my hair a little extra oomph for while.</li>
    <li> I needed something natural to add texture to my fine hair.  This fits the bill.  It smells lovely and gives my hair lots of body.  It can be a bit drying, but my daily conditioner ([[ASIN:B003B6JY7K Everyday Shea Moisturizing Conditioner Lavender -- 32 fl oz]]) keeps my hair soft.  The smell doesn&#x27;t aggravate my chemical sensitivities (I can handle essential oils).</li>
    <li> very bummed that the pump was clogged after the second use! Tried soaking the pump in hot water to unclog it but it didn&#x27;t work. Had to transfer the contents into another plastic bottle. Other than that the product is fine. Makes my fine, somewhat curly/wavy hair very sticky though so I really don&#x27;t use it a lot.</li>
    <li> Started to use it, very fine mist and hardly knew it was on my hair...good!&lt;br /&gt;Several days later the sprayer stopped pumping, made attempts to remedy by&lt;br /&gt;soaking tip, etc.. Nothing worked.....oh and it was transferred into my cheap Suave bottle&lt;br /&gt;to use sprayer.</li>
    <li> Ugh, I&#x27;m pissed I bought this without Really looking at it. It&#x27;s water, sea salt, few drops of essential oils &amp; couple extracts you can buy online easily. WAY overpriced for what it is. The bottle probably is the most expensive part:/ it doesn&#x27;t really work well either, you have to use quit a bit of it and if course it&#x27;s going to get on your scalp no matter what. The label states not to apply directly to scalp so obviously it&#x27;s known to be irritating. About 18 hours later, the middle of the night, my scalp was on fire and I have a lovely rash. It did leave my hair feeling great &amp; it smells lovely but I won&#x27;t be using it again. Also the label states it&#x27;s &#x27;Made for&#x27; rather then &#x27;Mady by&#x27; passport to organics, so who makes it?</li>
    <li> This met my expectations...it has a delicate scent, not too heavy.I had been using a more expensive one and with SBH I received twice as much.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this sea salt spray. The smell is nice, but it does next to nothing for my hair. I used No *8 before which is twice as expensive, but works so much better - I only needed a little bit and the bottle lasted me 2 years. I have used this since Oct and the bottle is almost 1/2 gone.  Not worth the money.  I have fine hair and love sea salt spray to give me volume - do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Bottled pretty and has a nice scent, however, it did nothing for texturizing my hair and too much made it feel dirty.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but I like the quality of the ingredients and it emphasizes curl in my hair. I do a little leave in conditioner with this and then crimp my hair with my hands and go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it a couple of stars for the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s all organic. It smells amazing but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I really tried to like it but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair anything. I have coarse, thick, and long Asian hair. Maybe if you have baby fine hair, this would work.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love how it made my hair look and feel.  The citrus smell is really nice too!</li>
    <li> IT doesn&#x27;t stick in your hair very flexible and doesn&#x27;t make it stiff and gross at all very natural!!! .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two sea salt sprays which gave my hair a lot of body, but this one doesn&#x27;t do it at all, it just makes my hair sticky and flat.  Additionally the pump failed the second time I tried to use it. I chose this one because it looked like a good price for the amount, but the amount was also less than I expected from the picture. Dumping the rest of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, fairly thick--in both volume and individual strands--hair, so I wasn&#x27;t sure this would do much for me. But... I was pleasantly surprised.  I spritz it on after washing and blow dry my hair as usual, and my waves have slightly more definition. I think the salt provides some texture and tackiness so that the waves stay together better, so this basically acts--for me, at least--like a very light spray gel. I spritz some on dry hair too if it&#x27;s looking flat or frizzy.   The spray also has a lavender scent, which is pleasant enough though I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid some essential oils because of danger they can pose to cats. This does make me a little hesitant about using long-term, and for now I make sure to use it far away from my little guy.  Overall, I&#x27;m not sure if I will get a second bottle once this is done, but the spray definitely gives a nice extra boost to my hair.  **I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.**</li>
    <li> My hair is very, very straight so I haven&#x27;t quite perfected the whole beach wave look yet.  However, I love the smell of this spray!  It is very refreshing!  I will keep practicing with it.</li>
    <li> I have used other products by this company so I knew I&#x27;d like the smell, and I do! But the spray is over the top. We want a beachy, tousled look. That does not equal matted, mulched up hair. This is a nasty unwashed matted beach hair look...not sexy.</li>
    <li> I have thick, unruly hair and this product works wonders!!  The smell is so refreshing and the texture is incredible.  It makes my hair look sexy instead of unkept.  No stickiness, just naturally soft hair.  I love that it is organic and good for you.  Another bonus with this product is that it refreshes the hair so you don&#x27;t have to wash as often.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
