    <li> We bought this so we could monitor my son&#x27;s breathing at home. It works wonderfully and comes with a sticker to show the reading windows like if it is good or questionable, or if it&#x27;s time to call the doc.</li>
    <li> This is a handy peak flow meter if you need one.  I tested at my doctor&#x27;s office one day and then immediately used my own and this little gizmo pretty much matched his precision instrument.  It gives you the rough idea you need when you have this affliction.  Good buy.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is asthmatic.  My son is now better able to manage his asthma as the color coded indicators let him know where he stands.</li>
    <li> it works great, and very portable. Has made managing my asthma a lot easier :)</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for a 10 yr old. It is very easy to use. I can&#x27;t assess the accuracy so I&#x27;m not able to comment on it.</li>
    <li> Excellent service.  Even with the shipping charge, I still came out a few $$$ ahead.  Neat little gizmo.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 18 year old son to take to College. He can hide in desk drawer (I hope he uses it).</li>
    <li> Perfectly as described!</li>
    <li> Very helpful in letting me know when I need to use my inhaler when I may just feel a little tightness; it lets me know it may be more than I feel. Helps me track my breathing issues.</li>
    <li> My wife had an old cheap meter that was giving inconsistent results. I bought this one for her and it is SO much better. Feels like quality. Gives you some peace of mind that it is working accurately.</li>
    <li> I have two other products that work well but got this one because of the lower price.  Its calibration is off and its design is poor.  Saving a few bucks was definitely not worth it in this case!</li>
    <li> Good quality, easy to use, easy to read, I like that you can keep the numbers/ranges marked on it so you know when to worry and they are easy to adjust as your child&#x27;s lungs grow.  I have one at home and one at the school.</li>
    <li> Cheap home lung function test that works. If you live with an asthmatic who is &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t like to admit when an attack is coming on, this is a perfect way to quickly and painlessly take a measurement. Your doctor should be able to tell you what number range puts you in the &amp;#34;danger zone&amp;#34; and requires a rescue inhaler or more drastic measures.</li>
    <li> Wish it came with better instructions. Other than that it was accurate.</li>
    <li> This seems to be accurate. It has a manual slide that you reset in one moment. It has color coding on one side so that once you know your peaks and valleys, you can set up colors to correspond with your good and not so good numbers. Seems to be easy to clean too. I researched about 8 online for an hour [i&#x27;m a bit thorough, yes] before choosing this one based on price + good reviews. Shipping was as low as could be also, under $3.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why all of these things have to be so expensive, but I guess that&#x27;s the rule rather than the exception with medical equipment. This was one of the cheaper ones I could find, and it seems to work just as well as any other. All I can compare the results to are the typical results I get at the allergist and it seems to be more or less broadly accurate. As they say, &amp;#34;close enough for government work.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from A to Z Wholesale late Thursday, 2/18, it was shipped Friday. 2/19 and received Monday 2/22.  The price and shipping were very reasonable.  Service was fantastic.  I am extremely satisfied.    The peak flow meter is very easy to use, compact in size and was sold at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The peak flow meter works well. Its convenient in terms of size, use and you can actually put it in your dishwasher(top shelf) and wash it.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well for me. Not expensive. serves the purpose. Easy to read and it comes with 2 charts to log your readings.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a peak flow meter</li>
    <li> The design of this peak flow meter makes it easy to use and comfortable to hold for a right handed person. The results I receive with it are repeatable. My readings on this meter fluctuate as I would expect based on the way I feel after being around my allergen triggers.  I have noticed that the color chart on the left hand side has faded after a few washings. I hand wash the unit every week. I found the dial on top to set your green range was difficult to turn and set although this could be viewed as a feature as it is unlikely to change by accident.  I would purchase this model again if I needed an additional peak flow meter.</li>
    <li> I have nothing in my experience to compare this to, but I am satisfied.  It is simple to use and was not outrageously expensive.</li>
    <li> My husband was given one of these peak flow meters at an emergency room and everyone in the family has fought over it.  Now I have purchased one for each of the asthmatics in my home.  They are the perfect size.  Other peak flow meters are so large that there is no way I can get my kids to carry them with them.  This meter fits easily in a purse or backpack for school, so it actually gets used!  It also makes keeping track of your green, yellow, and red zones much easier.  They are right on the meter which is very important as I have noticed when my kids and even my husband are having asthma flare ups they frequently aren&#x27;t thinking very clearly and can&#x27;t remember where their numbers should be or how much of their meds they should be taking.</li>
    <li> This meter works right from the box. Very easy to set up. Very accurate. Not too big so it&#x27;s good for travel and home use. Mouth piece not too large or uncomfortable. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great, dependable and affordable peak flow meter.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t shake down my peak flow meter (round hole) and this one could be pushed down with a finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t get this meter to go over a certain reading.  It is always the same or close 250-300.  I cannot fit my mouth securely around this type of hole, and I figure there is air leaking around it because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my hard to shake down meter - spouse has to shake it down for me - in order to get a reading that shows what I consider a reading that is more accurate - IOW, it varies, but not extremely so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again, nor recommend it.  What to do with it?  Who knows.</li>
    <li> This works pretty much as expected, results seem consistent and are perfect for monitoring asthma symptoms. My asthma is not well controlled yet, so tracking my peak flow gives my pulmonologist good information about how I&#x27;m doing at home. Seemed a little pricey to me, but much nicer than the one I use in the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I find the mouthpiece oval shape to be a bit of an adjustment vs a standard circle mouth piece but it works properly.</li>
    <li> Worked immediately and gave my wife the relief she needed to monitor. Simple to use as it should be. Bravo</li>
    <li> Works great wish my lung worked that good</li>
    <li> I received the Asthma Mentor Peak Flow Meter, my Dr recommended it for me to register the amount of air I am able to exhale. It works for what the Dr. wanted. Able to keep track to help with control of my asthma. Easy to use &amp; easy to read.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Very practical size, seems accurate.</li>
    <li> This is really easy to use, and easy to keep clean.  Also the light weight and low price made it a good choice.</li>
    <li> easy to use and it does exactly what it needs to.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use. While it does not match the exact readouts at my doctor&#x27;s office, I find it a useful tool for monitoring how well I am breathing by comparing its readouts over time. Recording this information also lets my doctor know how well I am doing on an ongoing basis. This is a good, inexpensive choice to keep track of asthma.</li>
    <li> This really works and I had a surprising diagnosis after using this to see if I had exertional asthma.</li>
    <li> Works well, matches the readings of my older meter, but is lighter, sturdier, more portable, and less likely to break in suitcase, tote bag, gym bag or purse -- what&#x27;s not to like??  VERY glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> This is a great device to have. Having asthma it is great to be able to check lung capacity. Shipping was quick and item is packaged well with a little plastic carrying case included.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to read, and seems to work as well and accurately as the one in my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> This replaced a previously owned one and works fine.</li>
    <li> I have asthma and recently moved to Washington, where pollen runs rampant.  I was having a lot of asthma attacks, which were made worse by anxiety.  As most people with asthma know, if you cannot calm down you can make an asthma attack worse.  This is a simple product that helps me keep my anxiety from making my asthma worse by showing my breathing levels were only slightly abnormal and that I could easily come back from an attack.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and it only goes up to 150 when she breaths in it. I can only get it to 300 give or take. But for what she needs it for it does work just wish it was more sensitive.</li>
    <li> What a help having this personal peak flow meter.  Took it with me to doctors appointment and compared it to his device...this was just as accurate. In fact, we tried it a few times and he was so impressed, he took down all the information about the product and where to order it. He commented what a great benefit it will be for parents of children with asthma to have this available to them. Very reasonable price and so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Okay item.  Delivery was good.</li>
    <li> good simple PFM with simple user instructions</li>
    <li> Economical and functional.</li>
    <li> I have several different meters.  This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He prefers using it, since it&#x27;s much simpler to read and the shape is easier for him to grasp. I had no problems with this company.</li>
    <li> I first looked at some of those fancy digital peak flow meters, and although they look cool, they are simply way too expensive. I had to go with this one based initially on price, but I was pleasantly surprised. The picture online makes it look a little large and bulky (at least in my opinion), but when it arrived it seemed smaller and sleeker than I expected. I do find the oblong mouthpiece to be just slightly awkward, but this peak flow meter gets the job done easily and accurately. The more expensive options may be snazzier, but if all you care about is actually measuring your peak flow, this meter works just as well as the most expensive options.</li>
    <li> Unit works as describes and includes decent packaging and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is very consistent despite being made of only plastic and springs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been very helpful in managing allergies and measuring athletic performance.</li>
    <li> It is just fine. Just what expected</li>
    <li> It is a great tool to be able to tell just how my breathing is doing and I can relay it to my doctor to help assess my progress.</li>
    <li> Its a plastic toy with no use, my son hates to blow through it. Also I am not sure if I can trust the indicator as well.</li>
    <li> exactly the same looks and model the doc gave me a few years ago. It is accurate measure of peak flow.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this for anyone suffering from asthma.  I even took it with me to see the doctor when refilling an inhaler prescription and updating my symptoms.  He was very happy that I had this and also felt it would be very beneficial for everyone to have on hand if they have asthma.  Bought one for my daughter as well.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old can use this with ease and it is so small he doesn&#x27;t mind taking it with him.</li>
    <li> Not state of the art electronics, but it works as well.</li>
    <li> Maybe the unit I received was defective, I&#x27;m not sure.  I&#x27;m fairly certain that if this model was working properly I should not be able to max out.  At my doctors office I normally hit around 650ish on a good week, i&#x27;m a little wheezy today and I still maxed it out.  The product felt cheap so i&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective unit or if the design and construction are to blame.  I feel strange returning an Item that I blew in to so I&#x27;m just going to pocket the lose I guess.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Comes with a sheet where you can record your scores. Very easy to clean and to use. Very good purchase.</li>
    <li> This meter is much more sensitive than the product sponsored one we had.  Sturdy feel to it.  Does not come in any case though.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the flow meter as well as the prompt delivery. The flow meter helps me know that my asthma is starting to get bad again.</li>
    <li> Never had an asthma attack until this year. I carry my peak flow meter with me everywhere. I feel so much better having it with me.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping!  Works great for my stubborn husband whose asthma is uncontrolled and currently waiting to get into a specialist!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to monitor my respiratory status</li>
    <li> My doc advised me to get a peak flow meter.. so I bought the first one I found on amazon.. I didn&#x27;t get the battery operated ones because I need one small enough to carry in my purse. I tested my dad on it and his reading was 580 which was good according to the chart. I tested it on myself and my reading averages at 350. I&#x27;m 24 so you can imagine how shallow my breathing is. I did test it on other family members, and their results were good according to the chart which lists the average reading based on weight, height and age I think. All in all it&#x27;s very useful in helping me figure out when I&#x27;m having an attack.. and I&#x27;m getting better.. slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about 2 weeks ago I used the meter and got a reading of 680 and thought that it was broken! (i hadn&#x27;t used it in a week and had been doing some breathing exercises) However.. the next day.. I was getting readings of 380... so all I can think is that it was an especially good day for me.. or maybe there was something wrong with it on that day? I have no idea..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really give a crap about brand.. but I would recommend this particular meter to others.. because it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used. Is it worth my money? I&#x27;m not sure I can put a price on my health. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.. and it only cost me $20 Canadian with shipping etc.</li>
    <li> If you need a peak flow, this is a large and easy to handle one. Solid, will last for years.</li>
    <li> Smaller, easier to carry than my other Peak Flows and accurate.  It&#x27;s terrific for keeping a checking on your breathing!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected ... But glad I made the purchase ...</li>
    <li> What is not to like about this device? It is easy to use, portable, doesn&#x27;t take batteries or electricity, and can be placed in the dishwasher to keep it relatively germ-free. The price was perfect, too. I just left a review on the finger pulse oximeter and many of my comments apply to this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve been having many more problems with allergies and asthma this year, it seemed like a good idea to have this tool to help me manage it. Having the peak flow meter (as well as the oximeter) I am so much more confident about being aware of my status and what I need (whether pills, inhaler, nebulizer or all three) to bring my breathing back to normal. With asthma, it&#x27;s easy to underestimate the degree of difficulty in breathing, maybe because I&#x27;ve gotten used to dealing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this device is a necessary tool for anyone who has frequent asthma episodes.</li>
    <li> I received the meter quickly.  The meter is exactly as described, came with explicit instructions(which was wonderful as our daughter was recently diagnosed as asthmatic and this is our first meter), and worked perfectly.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is very helpful for my grandson.  It has helped him see when he has difficulty before it gets to far.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I wanted to know when my asthma was peaking and my breathing lessened before an attack. I like this product due to ease of use and convenience. I use my unit every day and because I keep a record, know beforehand, what I need to do to keep my asthma in check. I recommend this product to asthma sufferers. It is great!</li>
    <li> This meter works great.  We have a 6 year old with Asthma and needed one of these to monitor how much meds to give him.  Our Dr. told us it would cost us about $50 to get a prescription one, so I ordered this from Amazon.  We just took him in for a check up last week and this meter matched the one at the Dr.&#x27;s office and we saved over $30.</li>
    <li> I have two of these for my grandson. One at his house one with me. It is very easy to use and to tell if there is a problem. easy to clean and dose not take up much space so can take in bag if needed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great price and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> If you have asthma you know how fast your supplies can pile up.  I don&#x27;t want to carry a suitcase around with me.  This is nice, lightweight meter.  It is accurate according to my large electronic household meter.</li>
    <li> For a person who has asthma this is a must product. Easy to use and can be a life saver.</li>
    <li> I got this to track my peak flow to try and anticipate possible issues with asthma and it has worked very well.  very low tech and absolutely no complaints.  Would buy again.  Have been using for a year with no problems.  Especially like the ability to mark yellow, red and green zones on the meter itself.</li>
    <li> Seems to act the same as in the Doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse practitioner.  I tested this product on myself and a few friends.  It seems very accurate. I recommend it.</li>
