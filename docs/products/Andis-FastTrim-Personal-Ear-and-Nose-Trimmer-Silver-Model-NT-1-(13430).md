<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A bit scary to use due to the noise and the weird odor. Does not work as well as expected. Frankly, I&#x27;d rather pluck.</li>
    <li> I got this to use as a nasal hair trimmer. I&#x27;ve experimented with different angles and pressure - It just doesn&#x27;t grab the hair. Booooo.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Speedy delivery.  Product seems good.  No problems at all thus far.  Had for about a week, so will keep watch.</li>
    <li> ...it gets hot and it hurts the inside of my nostrils when it does!! It&#x27;s like you have to race to cut all your nosehairs before tip gets toasty. Of all the things I enjoy racing to do, trimming nosehairs in a mad dash to avoid getting burned is not one of them.</li>
    <li> Yes, the price is right (made in China). Never really worked as well as the old &#x27;worn-out&#x27; trimmer it was to replace. I&#x27;ll list a few of the problems. Never cut well, I was hoping for a break-in period, not. If you cut close, you will have sore hair roots. If you place it on its bottom, water will drain into the battery area from the cutting area. This is because the seal is poor. Now, the seal for the cap holding the battery is equally poor, or missing. You will have rust on the contacts. After a year of dealing with all these problems, the bushing/bearings will start to make noise and turn to slow to cut well. More hassle. Remember the batteries will cost several dollars each as you replace them about every three months. To me, it&#x27;s SAD that a good company like Andis would place their name on this product.</li>
    <li> Unlike so many personal trimmers, this one actually does the job well.  It&#x27;s identical to the old Panasonic ER411 model (the only Panasonic that ever really worked), even the parts are interchangeable.  Agree with the other 5 star reviewer comments above.</li>
    <li> I compared all sorts and this one seemed to be the best of all of them.  We are very happy with them.  Small and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I think this works great for what it is meant to do.  It does not pull my hair of make me sneeze.  I&#x27;m new to the whole nose hair trimmer products, but it manages what I have.</li>
    <li> In order for this to cut any hair, you have to pretty much manipulate each strand of hair into one of the slits (like threading a needle) and then hope the blade cuts it.  If you run this around your O2 hole long enough and tilt it in all kinds of directions, you will end up trimming (although not always to an acceptable length) maybe 50% of the hair.  But your nose will tingle for a while if you like that sort of thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure Amazon would have taken it back, but didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble for this cheap item.</li>
    <li> Received the Andis trimmer in a timely manner.  It works much better than the Norelco I previously owned that only worked part-time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I felt I should add some comments on this trimmer. I bought this as a filler item, and figured it would wind up in the trash like all the other trimmers Ive tried. I was amazed at how good this trimmer worked, it cuts/trims super close, fits where it needs to fit, and doesn&#x27;t get overly hot(some cheap trimmers heat up quick in my experience and make use uncomfortable). The trimmer has a good weight and quality feel, as most of the andis products do(Ive owned two clippers over the years). This is a steal at the regular or the sale prices. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> All of my previous trimmers were the Sharper Image models which I thought were the only good ones on the market. I finally dropped my last one &amp; since the company is now gone I figured I would have to go back to the \\&quot;barely works\\&quot; kind. But no, this trimmer works great! It cuts close, it&#x27;s quiet, and because it only uses a single AA it&#x27;s small and light. Smaller is better for me due to travel. I also like the vented cap (which fits tightly) because I can let it dry after rinsing without having to keep the cap off. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have a light (I did like the excellent light on the Sharper Image trimmer). This trimmer is a real bargain for the price. I&#x27;m going to buy another one before I drop it.</li>
    <li> they do a good job for what they are I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This thing has one job and it does it poorly.  I can be holding one small nose hair in the blade and nothing happens.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not a lot you can say about this Andis Personal Trimmer other than it really works well.  Haven&#x27;t owned it long and purchased it as a result of the positive reviews here at Amazon.  Considering its price and performance there&#x27;s no reason I&#x27;d not buy this item again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This product works just OK.  It dosn&#x27;t have the same feeling of quality that most Andis products have.  Could probly buy a cheaper one that will be just the same as this.</li>
    <li> I have tried many similar products, this was the only one that actually did what it was supposed to do.  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those \\&quot;fortunate\\&quot; men that have more nose hair than your local yeti . I&#x27;ve gone through a few different trimmers with nose hair attachments over the years and while they haven&#x27;t been horrible, all of them have had various problems. They got to hot, they didn&#x27;t trim close enough, getting them to actually trim some of the hairs up there was nigh impossible, etc.    So it was with a bit of reluctance I decided to try another one, but when I saw the reviews and the price, I decided why not.     I cannot begin to express how pleased I am with this trimmer. It never gets hot and literally takes just a few seconds and a simple twist of the hand to get all the hair in each nostril. It&#x27;s as if someone took my entire list of complaints and engineered a nose hair trimmer just for me. Add in the fact that the cap has air vents to allow it to dry naturally after each rinse (and a quick dose under hot water is all it takes), and this is the perfect machine.     If you&#x27;re like me and have been fighting with nose hairs all your life, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. ^_^</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work and pulls hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 other battery-operated trimmers and was never really satisfied with either one. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this trimmer as it does a good job with both ear and nose hair, it&#x27;s easy to use, keep clean and the price is reasonable. I&#x27;m in the process of buying a second one that I can use when traveling.</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought 10 of this grooming tool.....!</li>
    <li> great product, especially for the price.  it&#x27;s nice to have hairless nostrils.  i feel very sexy and alive.</li>
    <li> Very skeptical, I&#x27;ve purchased very similar looking trimmers in the past that were junk BUT THIS ONE WORKS!! It actually cuts the hair instead of pulling it. Happy nose! Very pleased! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the second nose-hair trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one hurt worse than yanking hairs by hand~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t hurt.  That&#x27;s nice~!  I would buy it again, and suggest it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else is there to say about a &#x27;personal trimmer&#x27;?  It works well, and does not cause pain - &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer based on the reviews and feedback from other users.    I have been using the Panasonic nose hair trimmer for last 10 years. The Andis trimmer is louder when compared to the Panasonic.  The size and grip are the same as Panasonic.    My experience with the Andis was very disappointing. It worked for two weeks and then one morning it was dead.  I replaced the battery just to eliminate that angle, but it did not help.    Very poor reliability.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is exactly as promised.  Works even better than expected.  Was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Had a really great trimmer by Panasonic that gave out on me awhile back!  Bought another one by the same manufacturer and it was terrible!  Bought this one and it does a great job!  Highly recommend this product!  Don&#x27;t need bells and whistles...just something that does this awful job WELL!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer based on the good reviews, but it does not cut at all and gets extremely hot. Not worth the trouble to return, so in the trash it will go!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after looking in the mirror one day and realizing I had noticeable nose hair, which is obviously quite ugly in my book. Even my boyfriend commented on it one day that he noticed it too, so I knew I had to do something about it. After doing my research I came upon this little trimmer on Amazon. After reading the good reviews about it I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I discovered it works great! I used it for maybe 5 minutes total and all the little nose hairs are gone now, making my nostrils look a lot better, cleaner, and it even feels better too! This trimmer is also very easy to clean. When you are finished all you have to do is remove the tip by gently turning it counter clockwise, rinse it thoroughly under the sink, dry it off, and replace it back on by then turning it clockwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as ear hair goes and eyebrows, I can not say how well this trimmer works in those areas. But I can say that it definitely gets rid of the little unwanted hairs like it did for me and my nose. I feel much better now about myself after getting rid of those ugly hairs and would highly recommend this product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> All of my nosehairs are gone thanks to this little beauty. It took care of them like the champion that it is.</li>
    <li> If you are a member of the exclusive \\&quot;Hemorrhoids Club\\&quot; , then you MUST &#x27;ave one of these!  We understand, more than most how bloody (pun intended) important it is to keep THAT area well groomed at all times...as one never knows the day or hour, when a \\&quot;procedure\\&quot; will be initiated.  I, for one, DO mind a \\&quot;Tug-boat Annie\\&quot; LVN messing about back there with a straight razor...that she probably uses on herself.&lt;br /&gt;  Anyways, this right-sized tool is great for its efficiency and safety...it WILL NOT grasp nor cut/break the flesh. Heck, ya might say it&#x27;s even refreshing!  And...and, after you take care of the nether region (with due diligence), you can then attack the nose &amp; ear hairs...OR, reverse the sequence if-you-so-desire.</li>
    <li> My first impression was how light and cheap feeling it was, but that was not the reason I purchased it. I tried it and conclude that it&#x27;s OK, but did not meet my expectations. I suggest others search other options, as I will.</li>
    <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t given this product 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t had enough time to determine how it will hold up in the long term which is a primary concern for me for a product of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate for the ultra low price it gets the job done well and I haven&#x27;t had a single issue.  I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times and it hasn&#x27;t pulled a single hair (as opposed to cutting).  It also feels like it has a sturdy design and looks sleek (doesn&#x27;t matter in a nose hair trimmer but maybe some of you care).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it breaks after more than a year of use I would buy it again, less than that I would seek something else.  Time will tell but great product thusfar.</li>
    <li> I First time using a trimmer and it seems like it works well.  I will give it a few months to see if it breaks down or if it is still kicking :)    Fyi: Fast shipment as always...thanks Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> When you first open the package, please resist the temptation to stick it right in your nose and start shaving. You will come in contact with a very foul odor (and even after cleaning it, it will be hard to avoid). Take it apart and look at the blade; it will likely be covered in some black soot of unknown origin (it&#x27;s made in China, so wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was carcinogenic). Try your best to clean off the black \\&quot;soot\\&quot; or whatever the hell it is. It&#x27;s very hard to get it all off, and I&#x27;m afraid to take apart the delicate razor/plastic piece, so I&#x27;ll have to live with a small residual of soot stuck in between the crevices of the razor thing. Now to the shaving... it shaves pretty well, despite what other comments say. However, it heats up pretty quickly, and leaves a foul smell in your nasal passages. It doesn&#x27;t linger, thankfully, but it is unpleasant. It could be burning plastic, but who knows. In summary, get this if you&#x27;re bothered by nose hairs, but clean it thoroughly before using it.</li>
    <li> It get hot in few seconds and burned ..useless and don&#x27;t know why it got high review. I just got it and it going to be in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely little thing to have around.  Does a very thorough job, and at quite a good price.</li>
    <li> Got this item to replace my Panasonic which stopped doing a good job. This one works fantastic! I don&#x27;t have to worry about nose hair sticking out. It makes a very short trim excellent for those areas in one&#x27;s nose and ear. Highly recommend this item! Very satisfied and works 10x better that my old one!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that simply does what it&#x27;s supposed to.. In this case trim unwanted nose hair.. It does just that and it does it quickly with no pull or tug.. Good simple product.. Great price..</li>
    <li> Works okay, not great.  Can cut you if you hold it at the wrong angle.  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last, as I just bought it.</li>
    <li> It looks very similar to cheap ones that didn&#x27;t work very well for me...  this one is smooth as silk and does the job admirably!</li>
    <li> This trimmer has little power and is so large, it barely fits into the nostril. It does not cut close and does not seem to like coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is OK, but I found that it doesn&#x27;t cleanly cut all the hairs easily.  The rotary design of the cutter head isn&#x27;t as efficient as my old Remington which had a small linear head.</li>
    <li> I stayed away from this style of nose trimmer as I can remember a similar product that did nothing but pinch &amp; pull&lt;br /&gt;nose hairs off. After several purchases of the straight comb type trimmer I decided to try this product. Trimming nose&lt;br /&gt;hair with this style is different from the comb type style. I am very satisfied with the product as it has a very powerful&lt;br /&gt;appearance. It is quiet and efficient!</li>
    <li> Kills the single AA battery pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works fine for about 10 uses. Then the blade dulls and becomes more difficult to use.</li>
    <li> The body is a cheap-feeling plastic.  The motor runs fast with a fresh battery but seems to bog down quite easily.  We&#x27;ll have to see if longevity is a factor but with these things, it&#x27;s probably not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t drop it or use it every day and you should be fine.  Other than that, maybe look for something a little more pricey.</li>
    <li> It is cheaply made and only worked for a short while.  Spend the money on a better trimmer -- this is built to fail.</li>
    <li> Item arrived fast and was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Very good piece of equipment.  Comes with one battery, so it worked right out of the packaging.  I am impressed by the &#x27;heft&#x27; of it.  Even though it&#x27;s made up of mostly plastic, it is good quality, and the head rinses clean under the tap, which makes for added convenience.  I&#x27;m all trimmed up and presentable now.............I give it five stars!!!</li>
    <li> I have had 2 semesters of conversational Spanish.  When I was reading a beginning reader, I could only find about one out of four words I did not know in the dictionary.</li>
    <li> New to trimmers so I have nothing to compare this too.  However, it works great. Quick, easy, and no hair pulling.      It&#x27;s now two months later and it is still working fine.  However, the construction is a little weak.  A small piece of plastic broke off that helps turn the blades.  Since there are two of these it is still working.  If the other breaks off, I have no idea if it will continue working.    Reducing to 3 stars do to this.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. I was told it worked great and was easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I see the same molded-in markings on the Andis as were on the Panasonic that it replaces. The Panasonic lasted for several years and I&#x27;m sure that this is the same unit and will last as long. Now the negative: This is the worst of modern packaging (and drops what would&#x27;ve been a 5-star rating to just three) and really requires the use of a band saw for safe product removal. I actually sustained a 3/4\\&quot; bleeding gash from the packaging itself so be careful. Odd how I can build 50&#x27; boats from scratch and never get wounded any worse than I did from the Andis packaging!</li>
    <li> It has decent reviews but it just simply doesn&#x27;t work, I had an old Vidal sasoon brand, looks like the panasonic basic model, and it was 100% better, this is junk and it gets hot while and yet it doest cut. Not worth returning I&#x27;m just going to throw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I owned and really liked the old Panasonic model and used it for several years before it finally became dull. I ordered a replacement that was supposed to be a redesign but it turned out to be awful. I only used it for a couple of months before deciding to throw it away and find something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the validity of this statement but I read this model was based on the original Panasonic design. That being said, in my experience this model does as good a job as the old Panasonic and I am quite happy with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Still loving the Andis Platinum Personal Trimmer. It works great and I&#x27;m so happy to have found a viable replacement for the old Panasonic model. When Panasonic \\&quot;updated\\&quot; their old model with new \\&quot;features\\&quot; they actually destroyed the functionality. The Andis might not have the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; but it actually performs the function it was designed to perform and does it well.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I was pretty certain this is what I wanted and it works just like I thought it would. It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt and the only reason I didn&#x27;t get it 5 stars as I think it could be a bit more powerful so you don&#x27;t have to go over an area more than once.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Short and simply put ... I very much like this product   and would recommend it for anyone who wants to trim nose   hairs. High quality and good price.</li>
    <li> Not Perfect 5 Stsrs but as close as you can get. This small sized trimmer is easy to grip and control and surprisingly powerful as compared to others tried. Can do the job as advertised and uses only one AA battery that seems to last and last. \\&quot;Best for the money\\&quot;  A couple passes and the hairs a goner.  [[ASIN:B0009XH6NM Andis 13430 Platinum Personal Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> I have tried several trimmers, but I still think that the manual ones are better. This is on OK product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Works well and gets the job done.  Does feel a bit flimsy.  Not necessarily something I would associate with Andis products.  Hopefully they aren&#x27;t going the way of Whal trimmers.</li>
    <li> it worked good for me...</li>
    <li> Years ago Panasonic used to make a trimmer like this one.  It didn&#x27;t have a vacuum attachement or an LED screen to provide useless information, it just worked.  It trimmed close enough to use on a single hair, or just for a quick touch up.  Somehow through the years they lost thier way.  Thier trimmers stopped trimming and this whole vacuum thing came about.  Now, I don&#x27;t know about you, but unless you&#x27;ve got some kind of ingrown mustache up there, I have no idea why you&#x27;d need a vacuum attachement to your nose hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis trimmer is inexpensive, simple and most important provides a close painless detail trim just like the old panasonic that I used to use.  It&#x27;s easy to switch on with a nice great big slider switch right where your thumb goes and gets the job done quickly, easily and simply.  I highly recommend this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to a previous review that I read, mine has plenty of power, perhaps the reviewer should ask Amazon for an exchange as it sounds like his is defective.</li>
    <li> As a prior review stated, it just works. The trimmer gives a close cut and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> this thing done trims my nose hairs reallllly good. like a nose hair rocket, just rips em right out, great</li>
    <li> works great just the thing for nose hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a nose trimmer before but I use this one on my eyebrows for the fine hairs beneath my brow.  Works great.  Seems to be a sturdy product at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What can you really say about a nose-hair trimmer? It works well and is a decent value for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my ER 411, which I&#x27;ve dropped too many times.  It&#x27;s good enough, but takes twice the work to do 90% of the job that my Panasonic did.  Would have preferred to have known that it cuts only to 1/16\\&quot;, not flush.</li>
    <li> if u want to pull ur ear or nose hair and not cut it, then this item is for u!  if u want the one I ordered, check ur local dumpsite!</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer for my boyfriend to trim his nasal hairs and it worked great.  It took a few rotations up in his nostrils and the hairs were whisked away.  We were both expecting it not to work very well but were completely surprised that it worked as well as it did.  Neither one of us noticed whether or not it got too hot because it didn&#x27;t take very long for it to remove the hairs.  I would recommend this product to anyone who may be thinking of purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> Had to return for replacement!  Did not work when put batteries in it! Like Andis products so going to give it one more try!</li>
    <li> Since this item is an off-brand, I decided to take a chance and order it. I was very surprised at the quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;I have had at least four trimmers in the past including major brands, but this one out performs them all.</li>
    <li> Sturdy enough for the price, but no power.  Replaced original battery with a new duracell.  Still fuctioned like the battery was drained.  Like I mentioned before, what do you expect for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. It gets those little hairs out nice. Great product.  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Blade looks sharp,  motor works fine, but it does a poor job of catching and cutting my ear and nose hair or brows.  Surprisingly poor.</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first few times, however, it seems to be really weak nowadays. I bought this 2 years ago and have used it maybe 8-10 times. It&#x27;s very weak and hard to get all the hair even visible ones that you keep running the trimmer over. It also looks nothing like the picture, as I was expecting something less plastic and cheap looking. Wish that I had bought another brand as this really didn&#x27;t get to see a lot of use and is already dying or not worth using. . .</li>
    <li> The Andis 13430 Platinum Personal Trimmer works very well.  I got it to replace my shaper image trimmer that just was no longer functional -- it made the noise, but it did not cut my nose-hairs anymore.  The Andis 13430 Trimmer got the job done the first time.  YEAH !!</li>
    <li> It seems really good. Works well. I like it. It does not come with any batteries though. You should buy batteries too separately. Otherwise works fine.</li>
    <li> It does a pretty good job, I have yet to find one that is excellent.</li>
    <li> I am a senior woman and facial hairs start popping up in the most obvious places.  This is gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> It works as I expected it to work.  I have another make that does not work very good.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This tool is a toy. A cheap plastic toy at that.  I&#x27;d sooner rip my nose hairs out with a pliers than to jam this loose canon up my blowhole. It has all the finesse of a rogue weed-wacker. Yep, the top launches with the force of a Delta rocket into the recesses of your maxillary sinus region.  Hello 911? Ugh!</li>
    <li> I have not had any issues with hair pulling, but I noticed it got hot quickly. When it gets hot it also seems to slow down and struggle more. I added a drop of light weight oil I had from another trimmer and it fixed the issue.</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again but I&#x27;ll use it for as long as it lasts (which I don&#x27;t think will be much longer)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and and easy to clean. Small and light enough to carry in a bag while traveling.</li>
    <li> The noise hair trimmer worked well. Be sure not to knock it over though. Only used it once, then my wife knocked it off the sink and it hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
    <li> I have these sideburns that go all the way around my ear, I call them my football helmet lol. I quickly got rid of them&lt;br /&gt;no ingrown hairs or anything. Skin feels smooth. I don&#x27;t have to worry about waxing it now, huge relief.</li>
    <li> I used it for my nose, and it worked very well. Easy to clean.I really like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this trimmer; I use it for those pesky hairs that grow in unwanted areas on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of times it came in handy and I will recommend this item to others.</li>
    <li> Works just fine- replaces my old one which was getting dull.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it describes.</li>
    <li> Finally a machine that works</li>
    <li> Great product! It works precisely the way it is advertised.</li>
    <li> use it every so often and works great.&lt;br /&gt;been using it for years with no problems</li>
    <li> Works very well, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; you when being used. Seems to be good quality. Small and compact so easy to stash in a drawer or take in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Ah, the joys of being an adult guy.... what hair you had on your head in your teens has magically seemed to migrate South in places that it has no place going, including the nose. So over the years I have had three by Wahl, one by Panasonic, and now this one. The ones from Wahl are similar in build and cutting capabilities and I simply wore them out over time. The Panasonic looked nice, but the first time I used it, it nicked me a good one--- as it did a number of more times. Needless to say I ditched the Panasonic and decided to try this one. I guess you can say it is good, not great, and still leaves me looking for something better down the road. Good price and good performance would definitely make me a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> I have probably owned at least 3 different nose hair trimmers.  The ones I owned before this Andis were pretty terrible including Brookstone and Sharper Image ones for much higher $$$.  I usually resorted to just putting my nose hairs out by hand.  But this thing actually works!  I read the reviews on Amazon and figured for the price I would give another one a shot figuring it might be marginally better than the ones I have used before.  Anyway, what can you say about how a nose hair trimmer works except it either works or doesn&#x27;t.  And this one works!!</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this products ability to painlessly remove hair that i went to town on my nostrils. BAD IDEA. the short stubbly hair that grows back painfully prods the opposing inner walls of my nose. this is going to take some time to grow back out. in other new, the product works well. feels cheap and plasticy but who cares, it was 9$ and works great. lastly the head is removal-able for easy cleaning. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I use it to trim and again my eyebrows. My sister steals it from me to do the same. A great little grooming tool! Battery has lasted well over a year and it&#x27;s super easy to take apart and clean.</li>
    <li> Bought it in October and it works great. But one day, when my nose hair started to tickle my nose, I had to use it again. Clicked it on. Nothing. I was puzzled. This thing couldn&#x27;t have broke on me! I took out the blade, and pushed down the motor and suddenly, buzz, it started again! Oh happy day! I immediately put back on the blade and cap, turned it on, and.. was disappointed yet again. I super glued the motor back in, put back on the blade and cap, and magically it started working again! Finally, the day has come when I can breath fresh air once more. I stuck the trimmer up my nose, only to find it not cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am right now typing this in tears, not because of a broken nose trimmer, but because of a removed nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself and buy another one.</li>
    <li> Even after cleaning daily, this unit just stops for no apparent reason....battery change does not help! It just quits and stops.</li>
    <li> This baby has horsepower!  I&#x27;ve had others that seem to be wimpy and dull, which causes painful catches and pulls.  Not this one.  It cuts through cleanly and quickly.</li>
    <li> My hubby needed and now he all manicured !! :) Can&#x27;t figure out where the hair goes after it&#x27;s trimmed, but ??</li>
    <li> Ordered this and had it shipped to my friend, who was vacationing in the US. Got no problems with delivery whatsoever.    Used it the night I got it. Didn&#x27;t pull my hair. It has a battery included. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> You get older and the man upstairs exercises a sense of humor by moving the hair on a man&#x27;s head to his ears and nose. After you stop laughing, use this daily to counter the magic show. Easy to clean with rubbing alcohol. Good battery life.</li>
    <li> Biggest waste of money, cheap plastic, cheap material, pay a few more dollars for a good one. You will be more satisfied in the long run.</li>
    <li> Cheap and good. Easy cleaning. I&#x27;m curious how long it will last. Seems to be working fine. but ill update later if not</li>
    <li> Garbage . This isn&#x27;t even worth the shipping cost. It&#x27;s built cheap. It pulls the hair instead of cutting gently. Gets very hot when using</li>
    <li> not worth the money  at all ...i wish i didn&#x27;t purchase it..</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer.  Light weight and powerful. Very pleased with the performance, especially for the low cost of this unit.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works good.</li>
    <li> Results from the Andis 13430 Platinum personal trimmer are excellent overall.&lt;br /&gt;In nasal operations the blades have thus&lt;br /&gt;far not insulted any delicate mucosa while the actual trimming of the&lt;br /&gt;hairs produces a satisfying clicking sound that punctuates the smooth&lt;br /&gt;whirring of the high-rpm rotor assembly. In eyebrow operations, it is&lt;br /&gt;somewhat difficult to match the blade deck with individual errant Sputnik&lt;br /&gt;brows, especially since direction is reversed in the mirror. Even upon&lt;br /&gt;matching the brow hair with the Andis, the grooming effect is sometimes&lt;br /&gt;less than optimal. Often, I&#x27;ve found, individual eyebrow hairs truncated&lt;br /&gt;in their growth cycle, particularly when nestled against longer and more&lt;br /&gt;natural hairs, actually draw more attention than if they&#x27;d been left in&lt;br /&gt;their original curb feeler configuration. Perhaps there is a different&lt;br /&gt;procedure for eyebrows, but this wasn&#x27;t covered in my liberal arts&lt;br /&gt;education. I now rarely use the Andis for eyebrow work and have reverted&lt;br /&gt;to the traditional lateral spitfinger wipe-down methodology to tame&lt;br /&gt;renegade morning brows. In ear-hair operations the Andis performs well,&lt;br /&gt;though the volume is a bit shocking at first. It&#x27;s best to insert it there&lt;br /&gt;with the \\&quot;just-the-tip\\&quot; technique with a promise of dinner and a movie at&lt;br /&gt;a later date.</li>
    <li> I usually buy those cheap drug store trimmers at least once or twice a year, because they are crap. Well this one was fairly cheap and it works!</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement for another well known brand which quit on me. So far works well and clean easily under the running tap.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality, doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to have it turned upside down for the battery to keep its connection and keep moving.  I&#x27;m not going to stand  on my head to try to get a random hair.  I can&#x27;t return it because I threw the packaging away, but what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> very good product. works well. easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very effective and is easy to travel with. There is no assembly required. I have purchased more expensive trimmers in the past and weren&#x27;t as good of a quality as this one. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The motor seems to be strong, but it just doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job.  It seems to have difficulty reaching hairs because of the small opening for the blade.</li>
    <li> Great product for a real need. Does get warm after extended use. Very effective to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
    <li> This shaver does the job but is nothing fancy. not the highest quality. It definitely feels cheaply made. Essentially a throw away trimmer you can safely bring with you on travel. Would I recommend friends to purchase this item, probably not. But if you already had one I would say you&#x27;re not doing too bad. I noticed it seems to go through the battery quickly.</li>
    <li> Had to go in an adjust the connectors to make it work. Works OK. Many passes to actually trim well. Quality is lacking but eventually does the job.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer. Wish it came with a couple different heads though. One for eyebrows would be cool. Works good on nose hairs and ear hairs. Quiet and you don&#x27;t feel any pulling of the hair.</li>
    <li> For the money it is not a bad deal, more robust than the one sold on T.V. with a nice blade protector.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, IT DOES IT JOB WITHOUT NO CUT OR IRRITATION, FOR NOW IT&#x27;S FINE FOR ME. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He needed it desperately and uses it all the time.  He loved it!</li>
    <li> When turned curtained directions it shuts off or when it hits some of your nose hairs it might slow down or shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, but just barely. Recommend getting a different one.</li>
    <li> Not all that. My 10 year old Panasonic leaves this 1 in the dust when it comes to trimming them pesky ear hairs. This brand was shaped and looked similar to my old Panasonic,  so i mistakenly thought it was up to the task.  It trims to a visible stubble. I&#x27;ll leave it hanging around for a spare (maybe).</li>
    <li> This is the one you want.  You don&#x27;t have to spend more than this, and you certainly do not want to waste your money on a cheaper one from a dollar store.  If I were to guess, I would say this item is either made at the factory that used to make a similar-looking Panasonic model or else Panasonic dropped the item and this company just designed a new body for it.  It works great and I think it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This item is just like the Panasonic I got more than 16 years ago, but better.  It might be a knock-off but it really does the job.  I would say that the plastic is not as heavy and polished as the Pan...; it looks cheap, but this tool does a fabulous job.  I got a pair of clippers from Andis which are top notch; that is why I took a chance on their personal groomer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been working better for me than the comb style trimmer that I used to have as it&#x27;s easier to control and target.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it on eyebrows though as it would be too easy to make a mistake since there&#x27;s no way to keep a set distance.</li>
    <li> Product shipped fast and was great price but tip can get hot if used too long. Other than that seller provided a good product and great service.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. Worked once then stopped working. Tried other batteries. Is totally useless.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband. He says it gets pretty warm so he&#x27;s still getting used to it, but it works great :)</li>
    <li> Have bought 4 other nose trimmer&#x27;s and none of them does as good a job as this one,so it is a winner and also cost less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these kinds of products over the years---this is the best. Already has great reviews, can&#x27;t add much more except to recommend this to you.</li>
    <li> I have an older trimmer, which still works well; I wanted to get another for travel.  Very good product &amp; well priced.</li>
    <li> this trimmer does the job!! especially for the unbelievable price...I ordered it&lt;br /&gt;10/03/14 &amp; it was here 10/04/14 @ 11:55am super fast!!! &amp; yes I would buy it again &amp; again &amp; again lol seriously!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these personal trimmers. Most are mediocre. This one is great! It works great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works just fine. Easy and simple to use. Small and compact.to store.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend really needed this product for nose hair and ear hair trimming.  Sorry guys, it&#x27;s just a fact of life as we get older.  It works smoothly with no pulling.</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Good price.</li>
    <li> Works great - easy to use!</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t cost much to make its all plastic but it really works and is super easy to clean. With just a twist you can remove one piece and expose the blades. Rinse them off and let dry and that&#x27;s all there is too it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Why would you need a trimmer? There are some men whose hair is absorbed back into the head and then it migrates out of the ears, nose and eyebrows like a long flowing beard. Well, you could stick tweezers up your nose, squeeze and yank but no, I think I will use a trimmer. Maybe I got a bad Andis trimmer but it seems to me that a trimmer should work at any angle. When held lateral it works pretty well on the ears. The motor is weak even with a new battery. You can feel and hear it grabbing ear fuzz but no pain is involved. When held perpendicular, to use on your nose, it turns off.  If you don&#x27;t mind holding your head way back it works fine. I have purchased a different type trimmer that cost $5.00 more but works much better. Spend the extra $5.00 so you will be happy.</li>
    <li> Does a good job on nose &amp; ears, Im not so sure about eyebrows, it does get hot.  It came with a dead battery!!</li>
    <li> Great product!!, First, received from Amazon the next day, wow! I had not done any grooming for about 6 weeks so I was anxious to use it almost immediately. Works very well, no pain, no gotcha&#x27;s. Highly recommended for value and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Andis makes good products, they have a winner here.</li>
    <li> OK, you know how most devices with AA(A) batteries have those little springs at the end to ? Cheaper devices have a little bent piece of metal, like this one. And this means that if you don&#x27;t treat them super gently (say if you put them in a travel bag that bangs about), the metal bends and the device stops working until you reach in there with a tweezers or something and rebend the little piece. This isn&#x27;t that big a deal, but it really seems like something that any self-respecting cheap device maker should know better about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the thing does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Works good so far. My boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very light in weight, try not to drop it because its like plastic.trims nose hair close.very satisfied and fast prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Not a good item in my opinion. Large front is to large to get in to the back of my nose. Does not cut close. I&#x27;ve never been accused of having small nostrils. Cheap thin plastic. You get what you pay for. Low price... low quality. I should have bought The more expensive Panasonic (slaps fore head. I&#x27;d like to give it Zero stars.</li>
    <li> Iwas very pleasantly surprised by the performance of this product. For the price, it is exxellent. I would DEFINITELY recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works wounderfully just it&#x27;s advertised</li>
    <li> Broke within 6 months. Not worth the effort to file warranty claim for an add-on item. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> The Andis nose trimmer looks great but cuts horrible. I give it 3 stars because I&#x27;m patient!  It takes patients to trim your nose hair with this product.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive,  but seem to be effective.  Have only been using it for a week.  No  problem with heat build up.</li>
    <li> This product proves the old addage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. It is relatively cheap but, as a result, does not work anywhere close to effectively vis a vis more expensive (in some cases only slighly more expensive) makes of other trimmers. This trimmer simply does not do that good of a job at trimming. This reviewer recommends going with a slightly more expensive trimmer make (i.e., Panasonic) that are only a little more expensive but much more effective.</li>
    <li> great product, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> For $10, this is a bargain.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Quick, not too noisy, easy to clean.  Clips without pulling.  Battery lasts and lasts.  Fairly light.  What&#x27;s not to like?  No strange smells (as remarked by another reviewer).  I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times and it still works.  I haven&#x27;t compared this to more expensive units, though I do own a Panasonic version as well...seems comparable.</li>
    <li> The battery housing doesn&#x27;t fit the provided AA battery well and the result is power chopping off and on. The blades are crude and don&#x27;t always do their intended work. You can feel the battery slipping around inside its housing. Poorly designed low quality construction make this a non-starter for me.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use... even when working on the computer, no need of mirror!!! On ears is fantastic!!! Getting on form my father!</li>
    <li> hideous device. Must spin too slowly or something, Makes your nose burn.Too uncomfortable to use without fortitude. Not a good idea.</li>
    <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it feels safe. So far so good. Will post more if came across any issue.</li>
    <li> Works great! The price was right and it does the job I got it to do. Nose hairs be gone!</li>
    <li> This trimmer has the closest cut i&#x27;ve experienced. The blade cuts well and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair like i had felt with other trimmers.</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic trimmer that died on me after a couple use and I was  skeptical buying this product. For one it&#x27;s so quiet, does d job and doesn&#x27;t eat up the battery like my former Panasonic trimmer and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Just makes noise &amp; gets hot inside your nostril. They should rename this Andis Nostril and Anus Warmer.</li>
    <li> It has a cap, and runs quite a while on a battery.  I had another model that fell and broke.  I have dropped this one and there was no sign of damage.  It is well made.</li>
    <li> Does not trim very well.  I have had others that did a much better job.  Not horrible, just not what I am used to.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer.  It shaves close without pulling or scratching.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, and would order same one again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let &amp;#34;Platinum&amp;#34; fool you.  It&#x27;s a serviceable but poorly made item.  There are much better trimmers on the market for slightly more.</li>
    <li> After searching in vain for more than a decade for a quiet and efficient trimmer, recently I was fortunate enough to buy this one. I am conpletely satisfied with this trimmer and I recommend Andis 13430 Platinum Personal Trimmer with enthusistic conviction. I would have given more than 5 stars for this product. Please go and get one before they raise the price!</li>
    <li> Would not buy this again broke in the first month.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after buying a cheaper version that did nothing. It was a relief to have it actually do the right job. I would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> It got all the hair out of my nose</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  In the past I&#x27;ve purchased groomers that pull at my nose hairs.  Ouch!  This one doesn&#x27;t.  I really like this product as it does a very good job.</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems at all. I trim nose hairs,  eyebrows, and ears with it. I really like the eyebrow attachment. I&#x27;m not sure how I ever lived with out it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months now and it&#x27;s working great.  Much more powerful than the Panasonic that I had before with a useless LED light.</li>
    <li> It is working and cutting not pulling the hair. I won&#x27;t give it five star because i would have like it more  powerfull. But in this range price , I will recommend and prefare this one to new Remington; but not older Remington model.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I like it.</li>
    <li> not a solid product ,it has  on/off button not working properly. it looks like it is going to crumble if i push hard</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic Wet/dry nose and ear hair trimmer a few months ago. After about 3 months or so, it stopped working. And that was my second one, because the first one I had to return because it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. On the plus side to this Andis, it has no problem so far turning on and working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The pros to this product are that it works, it feels sturdy, light weight, easy to manuever, perfect size, and easy to clean. However, it just doesn&#x27;t get a close cut. Especially compared to my old Panasonic one. You have to go over the same place many times with this Andis to get every hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over all I am happy with this product. It works well, just takes more time to do so. And a note to anyone buying this, it won&#x27;t clip head on. It only clips from the side of the head, not the front of it. Once you realize this, it won&#x27;t take as long to trim.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched for anything that wasn&#x27;t made in China but then again that information can be hard to verify with Amazon products. I finally settled on this item and having had it for a few weeks I would give it a tepid rating of mediocre at best. It works, but then again so would a small propane torch, that being said I would certainly prefer this over the torch. The blades spin very slow so there is an occasional &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t completely stop but you can feel it when it isn&#x27;t rotating fast enough to properly cut. It works intermittently, there have been a few occasions where I thought it was broken but after a few tries it started working again. I expect it to fail at any time and expected this right out of the package. The cheap plastic construction and &amp;#34;just good enough&amp;#34; construction are what you would expect out of a mass produced, non-designer produced happy meal toy. Even with a battery (which the included one was just about doa, I would have rather it not come with one at all rather than waste that shipping energy) it still felt flimsy and inconsequential.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it works, but there have got to be many more solutions.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly. I bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  He actually loves it! It was very easy to install the battery and setup for use.  It comes with directions on how to trim nose hair, ear hair and even eyebrows.  You can easily clean this product by running the tip under water.  It comes with a convenient cap to protect it while not in use.  Effectively trims nose and ear hair and also is pretty inexpensive.  I like that it is eligible for amazon prime.  Would definitely recommend this trimmer!</li>
    <li> Pulls hairs rather than trimming them. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Title says it all, and it is convenient, too.  Used it several times so far and no problems.  Its small size is nice and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just fine. Fits well in your hand. Clips all those little hairs without a lot of noise or fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaces an old straight trimmer model I had that broke when I dropped it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a panasonic nose trimmer before and it felt solid and lasted for a couple of years.  The Andis 13430 Platinum Personal Trimmer feels light weight and cheap.  It slowed down significantly with little pressure on it.  I had it for about a month and have now put it in the mail back to Amazon because I didn&#x27;t think it would last much longer.  Just no confidence in the product after using it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Works great... NO pulled hairs.  This trimmer cleans up easy and cuts like a gem.  I would buy another one as a gift but, that would be weird.</li>
    <li> I had one before and it died after about a year and a half &amp; replacing the batteries did not work. But hey, this is so CHEAP and it WORKS quite well!! It is WELL WORTH the cost! It gets in areas of the nose that are hard to reach - because of the ROUNDED tip.</li>
    <li> A must for everyone!!</li>
    <li> Works fine but it lasted exactly one year--and the price is now increased by $1.00.  Probably should have given it only one star.</li>
    <li> Always, I mean always do nose hairs before butt hairs. I learned that the hard way.</li>
    <li> It just does not cut ear or nose hair. Use a scissors. Product died after very little use.</li>
    <li> Comfortable  with no pulling , easy to clean and manuever .  Cuts like a razor.  Gets a little warm on the  tip of it but no biggy&lt;br /&gt;works as well if not better than the others</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD,IT GETS THE HAIRS VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> the product is ok and doing just fine and was delivered in time</li>
    <li> Works much better than others we have tried.</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty worthless. It spins around and gets warm, but you have to beg and plead with it to actually cut your hair. Maybe other similar devices work better, but this one is not the answer to your problems.</li>
    <li> Use it frequently and it does not miss a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it any day of the week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheaper brands and more expensive brands of personal trimmers but none compare to this model. The others have always left my nose or face feeling like the hairs are being pulled out rather than cut. Not an issue with the Andis 13430 its quick and leaves you with no discomfort whatsoever. I would strongly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> it never works , i had to throw it away it was cheap S*** ! I would rather had spent my money on a better item</li>
    <li> My husband was hesitant to use this because it was styled different then his last one. He tried and he liked it.</li>
    <li> This product has been awesome thus far. I had Excellent Delivery time and excellent Product, I am Very happy with this product and very pleased at the price!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a stocking-stuffer 3 years ago. Since day 1 he has been pleased with how easy it is to use and how well it works. He had never used a nose hair trimmer before but now I don&#x27;t think he would want to be without one. We haven&#x27;t tried it for ears or eyebrows but it def works great for his nose!</li>
    <li> Very light weight trimmer. Great value to price ratio. It also trimmed my nose hairs very fast and safely. It also worked well on the ear hair. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works and feels solid. Can&#x27;t argue for the price</li>
    <li> My old trimmer was not very good so I purchased this one to replace it and am really pleased with it.  It works great.</li>
    <li> WORKS perfectly! And it has been very durable as well I do recommend it to anyone as a travel item too.</li>
    <li> Works well and trims where other trimmers did not. Very inexpensive but does a better job than the one I had costing much more.</li>
    <li> No, I did not like or keep this. It pulled my hair rather than cutting it. The only thing it cut was my nose! I&#x27;m back to scissors, now. I just use them more carefully now that I know that they are my best option. And you know? They work fine.</li>
    <li> Inferior quality product lasted  only for 1 week, don&#x27;t waste your money and time. I want to try a Panasonic next time.</li>
    <li> This product is well built, and works good to reduce nasal&lt;br /&gt;hair, and also hairs in the ear. The manufacture is even&lt;br /&gt;generous to include a battery.</li>
    <li> item arrived in good condition and in good time. I use it only to trim hair within nostrils, a job it performs well.</li>
    <li> This item works for everything it says it will. I love it because you can take it anywhere and always be ready if you spot a hair out of place. Easy to use and clean and sharp enough to do the work.</li>
    <li> I used this once.  Went back to use it and it didn&#x27;t work anymore.  Replaced batteries, etc and still did not work.  Will not be getting again and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> this was for my husband. He really like the way it works.  It is much better than the one he had before.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.I tried other trimmers in the pass but none can compare to this one. Andis always makes good prodcucts.</li>
    <li> Works for me. This is a replacement of one about 15 years prior. This tip constructions seems to be more precise than Remington or the side cutting type however every nose is different. The construction is cheap thus replacement. Obviously not to be repaired.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I even tried a known good battery, no go.</li>
    <li> After owning this trimmer for a few months, it didnt last. Buy the Panasonic, it works better and will last! The Andis only lasted about 3 months, You get what you pat for!</li>
    <li> So, who over 50 doesn&#x27;t need one of these? An occasional pass with these little fellas makes all the difference in appearance and they are easy and inexpensive. I can&#x27;t imagine why you would need anything more expensive or powerful or even waterproof! Who does that kind of stuff in the shower anyways? It should last me years as did the last one. It only died because I dropped it a few times and broke the on/off button.</li>
    <li> Ive had a few nose trimmers but these types are by far the best, I dont get any irritation even if i press a little hard into my nose and corners it never cuts me its farely safe, its powerful it gets all the hair needed, i  cut a few hairs on my ear and it cut smooth and close to have and idea of how it might do in my nose, it could be a little bit smaller but it does the job well</li>
    <li> waste of money-not working properly and died after 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;really hard to find good buy n this category. a</li>
    <li> Fast delivered, very nice!</li>
    <li> Ive owned 3 trimmers over the past 10 years, 2 panasonics and 1 norelco. None were ever that great, but I figured it was as good as it gets. I don&#x27;t remember ever spending less than $15-20. With this Andis trimmer at $8 it works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned - its not perfect but its very good and for the price I just have to give it 5 stars as a package.</li>
    <li> Worked just past the 30 day return period then died.  Piece of junk.  Do not buy unless you want to waste your money.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money not worth a red cent.  terrible cutting action and uncomfortable while in your nose.  zero stars</li>
    <li> Wow, was I pleasantly surprised.  Compact, sturday and trims excellently.....have had two other brands and none compared to this.  Buying more for sons as gifts.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well with trimming nose hair, but it pulls on them a little bit from time to time, but not too much</li>
    <li> a very useful device. will recommend it to my family and friends</li>
    <li> Easy to use... I love it</li>
    <li> Great little product, it does the job I need it to do and the quality is pretty good as well. I also love how it takes a battery and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Stunned at how well this works. Fast, doesn&#x27;t seem to leave strays, no mess, cuts &amp;#34;low.&amp;#34; Better than a more expensive Panabrand I am replacing.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut any of the hair at all. I keep thinking I&#x27;m using it the wrong way but its a pretty simple device. I would not recommend this thing.</li>
    <li> I will buy again from this seler,A+</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it feels safe.  I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up just yet, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I choose this trimmer as it was very well rated on Amazon. It replaced an old one that became unoperatable after several years of service. The Andis 13430 performs very well and matches it&#x27;s description from Amazon. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone looking for a personal trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job. Small, compact. Not fast, but for the price I&#x27;m not going to complain. God bless</li>
    <li> this trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve used yet better than anything you can get @ target,walmart etc great trimmer for nose and ears thank you</li>
    <li> It stopped working after about a year. Changed out the battery and it would not work. Apparently it shorted out. You can get a higher quality trimmer from a more recognized brand for a few bucks more, It&#x27;s worth spending the extra $3 to $5 on a higher quality trimmer.</li>
    <li> Got this after my Philips trimmer broke. Good prices and it works. Also, already came with batteries included which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Just average. Not as good as the Panasonic I had before. Works for the nose but not the ears or eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
    <li> My old one broke, needed a new one. Bought this because it had many good reviews and 4 star ratings.</li>
    <li> The only thing you hear is the motor running with the  awefull smell. It does little if nothing at all. I would not recommend this trimmer to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints so far.  It runs awesome and gets the job done as expected.  They are quality trimmers.</li>
    <li> This is good. At least it is helpful for my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Good price and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Not the best trimmer I have owned, but it&#x27;s a great little unit for the price. Battery life seems good so far (after two months of use) and it&#x27;s holding up well. Much better than some of the multi-use trimmers with nose-hair trimmer attachments I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The Andis 13430 Trimmer I received does not work reliably. When I turn the switch on, nothing happens. After I check the battery connections and the blade cover, still nothing. I changed the battery for a known fresh battery, still nothing. Once or twice, I was able to get it to turn on by gently tapping it against my palm. When that happened, it stayed on until I turned it off and seemed to trim as expected. After sitting in the drawer, though, it always didn&#x27;t work upon the next attempt to use. If it would turn on reliably, the trimmer seems that it would have met my needs.</li>
    <li> Finally a product which does the job it was intended for. Thank you for your effort to producing this product. I&#x27;ve had several, buy none which exceeds  even this old man.</li>
    <li> This product has met all of my expectations. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works as intended. Could have been stronger, but works fine.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer for the little nose hairs or if you have hairy ears. Great product and great pricing. It was shipped on time and I got it early</li>
    <li> Works great and easily trims the annoying hairs. Not sure why they don&#x27;t conform to nature and stay hidden. I would suggest to anyone that has not used one before, don&#x27;t trim to far in or you will find yourself with an itchy nose.  Update: After using this for maybe 6 times the blade started making a grinding noise. Sounded like it was going to stop at anytime. I continued to use it and It still works fine just with a very annoying noise.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really go wrong with Andis products.  I think they are one of the best.  The last of these I bought lasted me 10 years.  It would have lasted longer if my kid hadn&#x27;t dropped it and broken it into a million pieces.  This is a great product and worth the investment! And - it comes with a battery!</li>
    <li> What can you say about this product, either it works good or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done, small, quiet, easy.</li>
    <li> bought it for my dad, he loves it!</li>
    <li> This trimmer does an ok job with nose hairs. Price was good and battery life is ok. Just wish it was a little more precise!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it overheats and has problems spend a little more money and buy a better one trust me! I found out the hard way and when I confronted the retailer they told me they wouldn&#x27;t replace it and told me to contact the andis company for a replacement! the customer service is horrible, even after they gave me the number for the Andis company they even told me they don&#x27;t replace them either its a win lose situation be smart don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
</ol>
