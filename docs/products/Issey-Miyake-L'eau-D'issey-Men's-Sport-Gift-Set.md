      <li>100% ok.</li>
      <li>Will buy some more colognes.</li>
      <li>the second best cologne I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The first is Issey Miyake !!!</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t worry or they must be so good at duplicating something real that you can&#x27;t notice</li>
      <li>Nuit is my favorite then original then this one.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
      <li>This issey miyake cologne smells good but doesn&#x27;t last more than 35 minutes on you</li>
      <li>It smells delicious, But it doesnt last much</li>
      <li>I have the Issey Miyake intense and it smells pretty good</li>
      <li>This is all original Issey Miyake.</li>
      <li>ORIGINAL LASTS ALLL DAY .</li>
      <li>It has this nice sweet smell to it yet very masculine and the ladies, or shall I say &amp;#34; my lady&amp;#34; loves it.</li>
      <li>Great buy went to a fragrance store in the mall and the Charged $90 to $100 for this exact same size.</li>
      <li>Excelent product, and very convinient price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years and love the smell on me.</li>
      <li>That seems very far fetched unless the other colognes were won from the ring toss at the county fair.</li>
      <li>The girlfriend likes this a little more than the original.</li>
      <li>I love regular Issey Miyake, but this one is a little more sporty.</li>
      <li>Stay away from the others like bleu or intense.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was $15 lower than any local department store, and it included free shipping.</li>
      <li>Looks real</li>
      <li>Definitely not the real thing...</li>
      <li>Decided to try this since I previously bought an original white bottled one.</li>
      <li>I guess it is a fake product, smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for even an hour.</li>

<li> I guess it is a fake product, smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for even an hour.</li>
<li> for a long time and if you were to sweat the perfume acts almost like a deodorant.</li>
<li> Just a little spray and it last all day.</li>
<li> I have smelt it on other individuals and always holds it fragrance</li>
<li> Definitely not worth your money.</li>
<li> This one tops the previous one.</li>
<li> I previously used the non-sport version, which is lighter and sweeter, but this...this scent rocks.</li>
<li> When I find something that works, I don&#x27;t change it however, my phlopsophy changed when I ventured out a little and tried Issey Miyakes EDT Sport.</li>
<li> Very big, but fake  the smell was off in 5 minutes.</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> Sorry for my bad english.</li>
<li> I doesn&#x27;t know if I got a fake</li>
<li> I was so disappointed with this cologne.</li>
<li> I bought Eau de Parfum Spray, Pour Homme Sport, 6.7 for $ 79.99 and got my bill and shows Eau de Toilette Spray, this is outrageous, I cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> This issey miyake cologne smells good but doesn&#x27;t last more than 35 minutes on you I was so disappointed with this cologne. I have the issey blu and that stays on you more than 24 hours. I wanted my money back but my wife convince me to just let it go.</li>

    <li> Fantastic price for a good perfume.</li>
    <li> Definitely not the real thing...</li>
    <li> Awesome pricing, and quality merchandise</li>
    <li> I love regular Issey Miyake, but this one is a little more sporty. I prefer this as a daytime scent. The girlfriend likes this a little more than the original.</li>
    <li> Everyone loves it. I previously used the non-sport version, which is lighter and sweeter, but this...this scent rocks. Guys and ladies continuously comment on how great it smells. Amazon&#x27;s price was $15 lower than any local department store, and it included free shipping.</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome. Very Good Sporty cologne for the men!!!...This is all original Issey Miyake. Will buy some more colognes.</li>
    <li> the second best cologne I have ever used. The first is Issey Miyake !!!</li>
    <li> I guess it is a fake product, smells good but doesn&#x27;t last for even an hour. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> It smells delicious, But it doesnt last much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and love the smell on me. I have smelt it on other individuals and always holds it fragrance well.</li>
    <li> great buy for the price compared to retail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews from individuals calling this the best cologne they have used. That seems very far fetched unless the other colognes were won from the ring toss at the county fair. I own scents from Tom Ford, Chanel, Gucci etc and this should be used as a fire starter in a BBQ pit. Definitely not worth your money.</li>
    <li> I bought Eau de Parfum Spray, Pour Homme Sport, 6.7 for $ 79.99 and got my bill and shows Eau de Toilette Spray, this is outrageous, I cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yo compre Eau de Parfum Spray, Pour Homme Sport, 6.7 por 79,99 $  tal y como se muestra en mi factura y recib&amp;iacute;  Eau de Toilette Spray, esto es indignante , me estafaron.</li>
    <li> Try it! It&#x27;s great. This together with Vetiver is an excellent combination.</li>
    <li> Just a little spray and it last all day. I love it.</li>
    <li> Probably the best cologne I have ever used. I love smelling good and I don&#x27;t like change. When I find something that works, I don&#x27;t change it however, my phlopsophy changed when I ventured out a little and tried Issey Miyakes EDT Sport. It has this nice sweet smell to it yet very masculine and the ladies, or shall I say &amp;#34; my lady&amp;#34; loves it. He best part is that the smell stays on your &amp;#34; hot spots&amp;#34; for a long time and if you were to sweat the perfume acts almost like a deodorant. I have nothing but great things to say about this product. And it&#x27;s NOT a rendition so don&#x27;t worry or they must be so good at duplicating something real that you can&#x27;t notice but that&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
    <li> SMELLS ORIGINAL LASTS ALLL DAY . I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> excellent fragrance, good size, best price</li>
    <li> Great buy went to a fragrance store in the mall and the Charged $90 to $100 for this exact same size.</li>
    <li> Thanks for great parfum! The freshness and the persistence are just fantastic!!!! Will definitely try another summer parfum from Issey!!!</li>
    <li> Decided to try this since I previously bought an original white bottled one. This one tops the previous one. LOVED IT</li>
