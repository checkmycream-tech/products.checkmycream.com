      <li>Perfect replacement item, fits and works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This is a Quality cuff, it works great.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Great replacement for a cuff that started leaking&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I am glad I found this since the machine is still in perfect cond.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>nice color.</li>
      <li>I did not have to pay almost $100 for a new machine -- and the cuff fits my arm and the machine perfectly.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>We have thinner arms and this fits much better.</li>
      <li>so I was able to replace ReliOn cuff with the failing Velcro hook and loop fastening.</li>
      <li>I have a OMRON HEM-711 BP monitor and it worked perfectly with the Omron Standard D-Ring Cuff.</li>
      <li>Very light cuff and easy applications.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment, good product.  </li>
      <li>Attaching the air plug to the air tube was fairly easy.  </li>
      <li>The cuff is fine and it proved to me that the problem lies within the machine.  </li>
      <li>this one will work fine for you</li>
      <li>This replacement fit our unit fine.</li>
      <li>The description said that it would fit HEM-780, but the air plug (connect to the air jack, tube) doesn&#x27;t fit my unit.</li>
      <li>Great to use alone, don&#x27;t need an extra hand to tighten cuff.  </li>
      <li>Purchased for an elderly person and he has not complained about anything, so I am also satisfied :)</li>
      <li>replacement cuff was needed to fix unit that was no longer available, worked fine now for several months, a good buy.</li>
      <li>in case my original cuff sprang a leak.  </li>
      <li>Works same as original &amp; was a fair price.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I kept the air plug I already had.</li>
      <li>Comes with a fitting for my ReliOn Digital Blood Pressure Monitor</li>
      <li>The cuff looks and feels a little different from the original but works great.</li>
      <li>I unplugged the old 90 degree connector off my machine, and changed it out with the end that came on this new cuffs air tube, and had it in service quite easily, - in about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>just what i wanted and was fast delivery thank you</li>
      <li>My BP goes up about 20 points in the doctor&#x27;s office, so it is very helpful to take the Omron along to use the stored readings to show what  BP is at home.</li>
      <li>sthetoscope area should be flat and smooth.</li>
      <li>brought the BP monitor back to full function and avoided costly replacement</li>
      <li>I really needed a new cuff as the velcro was not holding on the old cuff.</li>
      <li>However it took patience and effort to disconnect the air plug from the air tube without damaging the air tube in order to store the new cuff and prolong its usefulness.</li>
      <li>Hence I would like to return the cuff and replace it with a new machine or buy a new machine without the cuff.  </li>
      <li>Blood pressure measurements with both my original cuff and the new cuff were comparable to each other.  </li>
      <li>My Blood pressure machine is 20 yrs old.</li>
      <li>Simple pull out the old and plug in the new.</li>

    <li> This is a Quality cuff, it works great. I unplugged the old 90 degree connector off my machine, and changed it out with the end that came on this new cuffs air tube, and had it in service quite easily, - in about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as an alternative to buying a replacement [[ASIN:B00006WNPW Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSense]] in case my original cuff sprang a leak.  Blood pressure measurements with both my original cuff and the new cuff were comparable to each other.  Attaching the air plug to the air tube was fairly easy.  However it took patience and effort to disconnect the air plug from the air tube without damaging the air tube in order to store the new cuff and prolong its usefulness.</li>
    <li> Very light cuff and easy applications. nice color. too short tubing. sthetoscope area should be flat and smooth. confusing application diagram on the cuff.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement item, fits and works perfectly.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Does not fit into my OMRON BP760 automatic blood ressure monitor. Ineed a different nozzle to connect to my omron monitor</li>
    <li> I have had the blood pressure machine for over 10 years. The only problem was that recently the Velcro failed to hold on the band.  This was the perfect solution. I did not have to pay almost $100 for a new machine -- and the cuff fits my arm and the machine perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought the cuff to replace one on my Omron blood pressure monitor machine.  The cuff is fine and it proved to me that the problem lies within the machine.  Hence I would like to return the cuff and replace it with a new machine or buy a new machine without the cuff.  Would this be possible?</li>
    <li> just what i wanted and was fast delivery thank you</li>
    <li> My Blood pressure machine is 20 yrs old. I really needed a new cuff as the velcro was not holding on the old cuff. I am glad I found this since the machine is still in perfect cond. (Other than the printer, which broke 6 months after I bought it. My fault I dropped it)</li>
    <li> My old cuff failed after a couple of years of hard use, but this one brought the blood pressure machine back to life. My BP goes up about 20 points in the doctor&#x27;s office, so it is very helpful to take the Omron along to use the stored readings to show what  BP is at home. Also, the doctor can check the accuracy of the home unit against his equipment.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, good product.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works great and I want to thank you for the speedy delivery.</li>
