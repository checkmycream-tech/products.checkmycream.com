<li> Can be hard to find, especially 1.7 oz.</li>
<li> Smells like old grandma, I was really sad when I got this.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t hate anyone right now</li>
<li> so I guess I&#x27;ll be forced to keep this in my house... for now.</li>
<li> First impression very BAD</li>
<li> when we received the two boxes of perfume looks like they where opened, boxes dirty, no protected covering, they look like store samples.</li>
<li> They give me a headache and make me feel sick when I smell them.</li>
<li> Disappointed with to.  </li>

    <li> Bought this on Amazon after seeing it a lot more expensive at Walgreens. I bought it for myself and ended up giving it to my Grandma since she liked it. Love that it is soft yet long lasting.</li>
    <li> Smells like old grandma, I was really sad when I got this. I&#x27;d rather fart in a jar and smell that for 5 hours than spray this onto my body again. I wanted to give it away to somebody but I don&#x27;t hate anyone right now so I guess I&#x27;ll be forced to keep this in my house... for now.</li>
    <li> This is another one I tried.  Disappointed with to.  Fragrance must of set around to long.  It smell good for a little bit.  An than nothing.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite perfume the last few years. Love the scent and its not overpowering like others can be.</li>

    <li> I am always on the lookout for deals on Faith Hill perfume. My wife absolutely loves the stuff.  The prices vary widely, so you just have to watch and be patient.</li>
    <li> I have the other two perfumes by Faith Hill and love both of the scents.  However, this just isn&#x27;t my thing.  Perfume is a very personal thing, so this definitely isn&#x27;t a knock on it.  I will say that with the first spray it does smell very strong.</li>
    <li> Old smell I can&#x27;t even put my finger on what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like..loved True and said hey let me try dis this..bad choice..this was da first of like 5 more bad blind buys..it should have been my warning but I kept tryin..lol</li>

    <li> Fast shipping Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She only uses this and one other all the time. Service was great. Only problem is the order was for 1.7 oz. but when package arrived it was only 1.0 oz. Customer service made it right with no problem. I would buy from them again next time.</li>
    <li> when we received the two boxes of perfume looks like they where opened, boxes dirty, no protected covering, they look like store samples. First impression very BAD</li>
    <li> Three words...she loves it! Fast shipping, well packaged and one heck of a great scent.</li>

    <li> This is a nice soft feminine scent that isn&#x27;t sweet and fakey smelling.  This is one of those that will make people say &amp;#34;you smell good&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;nice perfume&amp;#34;</li>
