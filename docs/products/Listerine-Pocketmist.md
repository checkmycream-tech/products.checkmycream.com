      <li>So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day</li>
      <li>I have a habit of carrying around gum when when I need to freshen my breath after a meal, but this is super handy to have in my bag if I either don&#x27;t have any gum, or in a situation where chewing gum wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate.</li>
      <li>Listerine cool mint is great to carry in your bag and always makes your mouth feel clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>It is easy for carrying.</li>
      <li>really easy to use</li>
      <li>It is a vere effective product, and I love the size, very convenient to carry in your pocket or purse.</li>
      <li>easy to carry</li>
      <li>Strong and works.</li>
      <li>The product is perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>These taste very listerine-y and fit nicely in my pocket.</li>
      <li>You can go to any dollar store and buy one of the cheap breath mists with twistable caps and then replace it with Listerine.</li>
      <li>To save shipping costs, I bundle it with something that has free shipping.</li>
      <li>So easy to order, quick to receive and the price is comparable.</li>
      <li>It has that strong bite to it like the mouthwash that I love and is a must have for anybody who doesn&#x27;t keep a toothbrush on them throughout the whole day.</li>
      <li>Most importantly it is easy to use without much to swallow.</li>
      <li>Who wouldn’t want fresh breathe all the time?!</li>
      <li>I love the quick easy access to spray and get fresh breath, my job requires I have fresh breath</li>
      <li>for your office, clean breath in just seconds.</li>
      <li>Packaging was fantastic, quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Excellent flavor (at least for me)</li>
      <li>Good enough for the price.</li>
      <li>No after taste nor too sweet.</li>
      <li>cool meint&amp;#34;-&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re in a situation or circumstance where you can&#x27;t brush right away, or the spices and aromas from a meal are still lingering, a couple quick squirts and you&#x27;re refreshed.  </li>
      <li>A couple of sprays and immediately the Listerine Pocketmist Cool Mint freshens an other wise not so fresh breath.</li>
      <li>My breath is now minty fresh.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about how this sprays out and not crazy about the taste of &amp;#34;Cool Mint&amp;#34; flavor.  </li>
      <li>I think it both kills the odor causing germs and leaves you with minty fresh breath.</li>
      <li>worth it 100%&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>This is a very convenient item to carry in your pocket - Keeps breath fresh and odor free.  </li>
      <li>Plus you can choose from more flavors this way, I personally love the Vanilla Mint and Citrus flavors which are not available in mists.</li>
      <li>I like the product &amp; the shipping was very fast</li>
      <li>and this is perfect and small enough that it hides.</li>
      <li>This is a plastic spray bottle that does not leak, so it is safe enough to keep in my pocket.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using them since they first hit the market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found them to be more powerful and less sweet than their strip counterparts.</li>
      <li>Slow or irregular presses don&#x27;t seem to cause it to spray, which is good to avoid fresh pockets.  </li>
      <li>Easy to carry, not bulky and simple to use.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I find them very comforting to have around, for you never know, when and if, you will need to use them in a hurry.</li>
      <li>So I end up so fast.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>This product is VERY bulky, in a VERY hard-to-open package.</li>
      <li>The price at Amazon is much lower than in the store.</li>
      <li>This is a disappointing shift from the &amp;#34;breath strips&amp;#34; which were/are the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>Tastes good, lasts long, everyone I&#x27;ve used the little pump has always worked right.</li>
      <li>I find it saves me in the middle of the work day to keep my mouth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Glad I can find it online now and not have to hunt them down in retail stores.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Your breath will be as fresh as if you just brushed your teeth.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my breath fresh, but I got a totally different flavor than the one depicted.</li>
      <li>Specially when plagued with common after taste due to some particular kind of food.</li>
      <li>The spray seems kind of weak, like it will start to get leaky after a while.</li>
      <li>Easy to administer... does not last quite as long as you would think, since you need several squirts to get the effect of a breath freshener...</li>
      <li>Hard to find something different to say regarding most purchases.  </li>
      <li>Tastes kind of bad but gives fresh breath.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough about how wonderful the simple act of squirting a simple mist and bad breath is gone.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other stuff it is up to you to spray one snap or as much as you will.</li>
      <li>spray at first will not do anything, you need to pump the button a few times till it comes out.</li>

<li> I never, ever have to worry about bad breath anxiety because these are handy, work GREAT and don&#x27;t taste half bad either.  </li>
<li> I thought stores were starting to discontinue this product, but I found it in Target the other day for about the same price.</li>
<li> This is a strange design for a breath spray.</li>
<li> I expected Listerine.</li>
<li> I usually need 3 squirts for enough to make into my mouth for the freshness level</li>

    <li> This is a very convenient item to carry in your pocket - Keeps breath fresh and odor free.  I find it saves me in the middle of the work day to keep my mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> The product is perfectly fine. Work really good!</li>
    <li> Having one of these on my keychain is my secret to confidence in any situation.  Interviews? No problem.  Auditions? No problem.  Happy Hours after work?  No problem.  I never, ever have to worry about bad breath anxiety because these are handy, work GREAT and don&#x27;t taste half bad either.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a disappointing shift from the &amp;#34;breath strips&amp;#34; which were/are the perfect solution. This product is VERY bulky, in a VERY hard-to-open package. (tape strips everywhere). It&#x27;s an attempt to be &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; with the product, which seldom works well.</li>
    <li> These are great for the car, purse, backpack or any where you want.  I keep them around my house and use them all time.  Glad I can find it online now and not have to hunt them down in retail stores.  Not everyone carries them and it can get frustrated trying to track them down.  I highly recommend.  Who wouldn’t want fresh breathe all the time?!</li>
    <li> Like it and will buy again</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Love it.</li>
    <li> Listerine cool mint is great to carry in your bag and always makes your mouth feel clean and fresh.  It is small so therefore if you are a man you can put it in a jacket pocket and you too can carry it with you all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Good hygiene and for your mouth.</li>
    <li> Strong and works. It has that strong bite to it like the mouthwash that I love and is a must have for anybody who doesn&#x27;t keep a toothbrush on them throughout the whole day.</li>
    <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Packaging was fantastic, quick shipping. I love the quick easy access to spray and get fresh breath, my job requires I have fresh breath and this is perfect and small enough that it hides.</li>
    <li> These work greatly, but a cheaper and surely better alternative is to get a pocket sized, refillable bottle and to fill it from a bottle of Listerine. You have to keep repurchasing these mists and I doubt it&#x27;s formula is STRONGER than mouthwash Listerine. Plus you can choose from more flavors this way, I personally love the Vanilla Mint and Citrus flavors which are not available in mists. Save some money and buy a pocket sized bottle and a big bottle of Listerine and pour it in! You can go to any dollar store and buy one of the cheap breath mists with twistable caps and then replace it with Listerine.</li>
    <li> Listerine Pocket mist Cool Mint is great after meals and before meetings.  Your breath will be as fresh as if you just brushed your teeth.  Say goodbye to gum.</li>
    <li> The best oral Spray  ever! I dont get it in Germany ... So, I must buy the Pocketmist - I like the Taste &amp;#34; cool meint&amp;#34;-&lt;br /&gt;in the USA for much more Money - but worth it 100%&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shopping to Germany</li>
    <li> Because I have gross breath and so do you</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years. It is easy for carrying. Most importantly it is easy to use without much to swallow. Unlike other stuff it is up to you to spray one snap or as much as you will. No after taste nor too sweet.</li>
    <li> My breath is now minty fresh. Will order, again</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a plastic spray bottle that does not leak, so it is safe enough to keep in my pocket. I keep one in my car, too. The price at Amazon is much lower than in the store. To save shipping costs, I bundle it with something that has free shipping.</li>
    <li> I like the product &amp; the shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> I have a habit of carrying around gum when when I need to freshen my breath after a meal, but this is super handy to have in my bag if I either don&#x27;t have any gum, or in a situation where chewing gum wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate.</li>

    <li> Hard to find something different to say regarding most purchases.  They either are as described and great-or you will let everyone know not to purchase-this one is great!</li>
    <li> Work great. Not the best taste though</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love it!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how wonderful the simple act of squirting a simple mist and bad breath is gone.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Awful. Buy Bianca instead. This was so bad I pooped out blood. And I&#x27;m a dude. It was very terrible.</li>
    <li> better that carrying a toothbrush and toothpaste... lots of breath-freshening power in a small, portable container.  Easy to administer... does not last quite as long as you would think, since you need several squirts to get the effect of a breath freshener...</li>
    <li> Just need to say good design on spray button.  Slow or irregular presses don&#x27;t seem to cause it to spray, which is good to avoid fresh pockets.  It&#x27;s a little bulky but not too bad.  Put it through the wash and dryer and it still works.</li>
    <li> great price, love these</li>
    <li> good compact and reliable product. Nice and handy to keep in a pocket or book bag. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, these are the best pocket breath-misters on the market.  Easy to carry, not bulky and simple to use.  If you&#x27;re in a situation or circumstance where you can&#x27;t brush right away, or the spices and aromas from a meal are still lingering, a couple quick squirts and you&#x27;re refreshed.  If you&#x27;re a smoker...these are great to have around.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about how this sprays out and not crazy about the taste of &amp;#34;Cool Mint&amp;#34; flavor.  It is convenient to carry around and does last quite some time.</li>
    <li> Awesome if you go out  or hook up .Also for your office, clean breath in just seconds. really easy to use</li>
    <li> I love having this in my hand or gym bag. It is just so convenient to have this pocketmist.</li>
    <li> price little bit high</li>
    <li> easy to carry.. works great</li>
    <li> It is a vere effective product, and I love the size, very convenient to carry in your pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> A great pocketmist for any occasion, it fits everywhere and its cheapear than getting it at a target or walmart, sometimes you cant even get it at those places.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big mint addict, but don&#x27;t always want tins (plastics?) of tic tacs rattling around in my pockets. These taste very listerine-y and fit nicely in my pocket. They don&#x27;t have the unpleasant sensation that the strips do. The mechanism doesn&#x27;t always work properly, however.</li>
    <li> Wherever I go, I carry a Mist with me.  I&#x27;ve found them to be more powerful and less sweet than their strip counterparts.</li>
    <li> My husband is a considerate smoker (yes, there is such a thing), and has these with him at all times.  They are so hard to find in a store anymore, and who wants to go to a big box store just for this item?  So easy to order, quick to receive and the price is comparable.</li>
    <li> This is a strange design for a breath spray. The good thing about this is that you don&#x27;t need to remove any cap to get to the spray. When you push the button, a small cover opens up and blasts out the minty mist. Tastes kind of bad but gives fresh breath. I find myself trying to swallow constantly after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray at first will not do anything, you need to pump the button a few times till it comes out. The spray seems kind of weak, like it will start to get leaky after a while.</li>
    <li> Works great for fresh breath. Don&#x27;t over spray because it may sting your mouth.</li>
    <li> I expected Listerine. Excellent flavor (at least for me), so I use it a lot in a day sometimes, i think it&#x27;s more because I like the taste because I need it. So I end up so fast.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations 100%</li>
    <li> Pros: Great breath spray. I think it both kills the odor causing germs and leaves you with minty fresh breath. A two-fer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small size is nice, fits anywhere. I keep it in a pocket of what I wear at work and spray as needed throughout the day!! Coffee breath? Not a problem! Onions for lunch? The answer is yes! Bring it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The spray nozzle seems to spray low, with some practice, it gets easier to know how/ where to aim. I usually need 3 squirts for enough to make into my mouth for the freshness level I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again! I let my co-worker use it at work (a win-win situation if you know what I mean) and she loved it and will be ordering some as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This didnt kill my bad breath and seemed to make it worse its like after eating a candy and your breath gets worse idk i bought on all the good reviews but didnt work for me</li>
    <li> Keeps my breath fresh, but I got a totally different flavor than the one depicted.</li>
    <li> it says count of 2 which means 2 packages but it wasn&#x27;t they meant it is one twin package and it was WAY overpriced and when i tried to get them to fulfill their promised they just blew me off.</li>
    <li> I thought stores were starting to discontinue this product, but I found it in Target the other day for about the same price. I bought this for someone else who prefers this spray over gum or mints.</li>
    <li> This is the best breath spray I&#x27;ve found for both flavor and lasting for a while. I don&#x27;t understand however why they are so darn expensive!! I wish a competitor would come up with something, because these should be half the price of what they sell for.</li>
    <li> Sometimes one wishes they had brought a little toothbrush and toothpaste along for the ride. Specially when plagued with common after taste due to some particular kind of food. This product helps on those grounds. A couple of sprays and immediately the Listerine Pocketmist Cool Mint freshens an other wise not so fresh breath. I find them very comforting to have around, for you never know, when and if, you will need to use them in a hurry. Knowing it kills bacteria in the process is an added plus. Comes in handy, that is for sure! 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> Its so convenient usually there when i need to do something in a hurry with it. So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day seems like i find endless uses for it...</li>
