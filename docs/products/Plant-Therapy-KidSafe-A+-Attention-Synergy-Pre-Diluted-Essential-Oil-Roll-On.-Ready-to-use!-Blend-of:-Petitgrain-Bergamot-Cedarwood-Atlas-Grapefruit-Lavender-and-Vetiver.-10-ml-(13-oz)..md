    <li> I purchase this for my son.  I really like the scent and it seems to help my son stay more focused.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for if this works.  My son has ADHD and it&#x27;s pretty severe.  For a mild case this might work better.  I will say I liked the smell and feel on the skin.  It wasn&#x27;t too oily or pungent.  I have used it myself and feel that it helps on me.</li>
    <li> not sure if it has helped my son or not, have not used it a lot so I can&#x27;t give that good of a review yet, but what I have seen its helped a little bit</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seeing any positive result since I started using it</li>

    <li> Very soothing and relaxing smell</li>
    <li> Very very very happy!!!!</li>
    <li> works well in homemade bombs made for granddaughter</li>
    <li> Had to look up on the internet how and where to apply</li>
    <li> The oil smells really good. I apply it to my daughters wrist every morning before she goes off  to school. It helps her concentrate.</li>
    <li> Great product, even for adults!</li>
    <li> Product has a good smell and is easy to apply. We are just starting him out on it and he is already showing improvement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday on my son for a month, and good teacher called me last week stating that his behavior has improved over the last month. I really do think it&#x27;s do to the essential oils.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been on Strattera for years, but what a difference with A+ Attention!!! I work in L&amp;D and NICU and I feel great!  My husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> I didnt notice any difference other than my son was sneezing real bad..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the.claims of this being a miracle for your.children. I am genuinely happy.for you that this worked for you. It.sure didn&#x27;t fir my 8 year old. It smells like an old man&#x27;s after shave and he didn&#x27;t like me rolling this stuff on him. It is such a hoax, I  was so.disappointed.BC the reviews were so good but turned out to be a total let down. Sorry folks, don&#x27;t bother getting it.</li>
    <li> It works amazing!  Helps my son to focus while he&#x27;s at school</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely horrid. My 8 year old wont even let me try it on her because of the smell. Gah! Never again.</li>
    <li> Just ok, doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. Smell is a bit off putting too.</li>
    <li> Have used it faithfully for the past 10 days and other than seeing the oily spots where I&#x27;ve applied it, the product has not been helpful for my grandson.</li>
