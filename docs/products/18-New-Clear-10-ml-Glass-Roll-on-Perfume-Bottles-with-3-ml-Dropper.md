      <li>These were great and not very expensive!</li>
      <li>Pleased with price, not quality.  </li>
      <li>than that they seem ok.</li>
      <li>Kind of cheap but does the job</li>
      <li>Make sure  to put together</li>
      <li>Work perfect for making essential oil blends.</li>
      <li>Just wish the roller top popped in easier.</li>
      <li>The dropper is nice and the vials seem good quality but the roller does not seem to dispense the oils very well.</li>
      <li>Great buy and as always fast, easy shipping.</li>
      <li>Very easy to fill, Dropper works nicely the first time you use it</li>
      <li>The roller doesn&#x27;t roll easily.</li>
      <li>The roller doesn&#x27;t roll easily, which presents a problem for my clients.</li>
      <li>However, the company returned them easily with no problems.</li>
      <li>This set includes an easy to use plastic filling squeeze tube.</li>
      <li>but otherwise fine.</li>
      <li>but they washed up fine.  </li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>They are a bit bigger than i thought which is great.</li>
      <li>I used these for essential oils and they work great.  </li>
      <li>Works great with my essential oils.</li>
      <li>Great set of 18 empty bottles with roll on cap inserts as well as an outer cap.</li>
      <li>It only works if what what your rubbing it on has a fair amount of friction.</li>
      <li>Overall these were good.</li>
      <li>They definitely aren&#x27;t good to use on children, which is what I was wanting to use them for.</li>
      <li>Sometimes they will randomly loose he ball in the roller part but for the most part I love them!</li>
      <li>Loved getting this shipment and didn&#x27;t take long to receive.</li>
      <li>The roller ball doesn&#x27;t move smoothly and doesn&#x27;t allow much oil to come out.</li>
      <li>so the clear glass is perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>They operate wonderfully, but when received the bottles were dirty and we had to clean out.</li>
      <li>Mine were brand new and clean.  </li>
      <li>of the bottle had oil on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;the roller balls are plastic, glass roller balls are better for essential oil.</li>
      <li>I keep mine out of direct light</li>
      <li>They still hold liquid but do not stand very steady.  </li>
      <li>just OK, not High Quality.</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>It really takes some work to get the roller ball to move.  </li>
      <li>Glass bottles but plastic roller balls that don&#x27;t roll very well.</li>
      <li>I have gotten into essential oils recently and bought these to do my own blends.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if they had been for me, but I was ordering out of desperation because my normal supplier was backordered and I needed bottles for orders asap.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty gross.</li>
      <li>You have to put a lot of force down on the ball in order for it to move freely.</li>
      <li>Takes a little breaking in to get the roller to go smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>Just wish I had thought to buy amber colored bottles instead of clear.</li>
      <li>This can waste precious essential oils!</li>
      <li>Nice price, one arrived broken, haven&#x27;t noticed leaking.</li>
      <li>Glass is thin, you can feel the seam at top and on the side of bottle.</li>
      <li>but I find it hard to clean.</li>
      <li>The little balls don&#x27;t really move on the product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One bottle is broken in the box upon opening. packaging not really great.</li>
    <li> Overall these were good. A couple of the roller balls fall out so you have to be careful if you have oils in them that it doesn&#x27;t spill out of the roller ball comes out!</li>
    <li> Will buy again, good quality</li>
    <li> Very cloudy bottles, rollers are very stiff. A couple bottles were cracked. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> These work perfect for my oil mixing. It came with everything I needed and they haven&#x27;t leaked or cracked..etc</li>
    <li> Terrible quality, balls fall out of the roller after one use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
    <li> 4 of 18 roller balls didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;some of the bottle had oil on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;the roller balls are plastic, glass roller balls are better for essential oil.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 18 pack of roller bottles and received 18 bottles and only 12 rollers.</li>
    <li> Bottles were dirty and several were chipped on bottom</li>
    <li> Good amount for the price and quality.</li>
    <li> Work perfect for making essential oil blends. Just wish the roller top popped in easier. Takes a little breaking in to get the roller to go smoothly and evenly.</li>
    <li> The roller ball doesn&#x27;t move smoothly and doesn&#x27;t allow much oil to come out. You have to put a lot of force down on the ball in order for it to move freely. They definitely aren&#x27;t good to use on children, which is what I was wanting to use them for.</li>
    <li> Be careful that the balls dont fall out</li>
    <li> very nice, clean, roller balls work well, I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> They leak! I used these for blending my essential oils... they leak! My expensive essential oils... wasted!</li>
    <li> The roller balls were plastic and did not roll properly.</li>
    <li> Love love love them ..were perfect for what I needed them for</li>
    <li> Great price and product, however some of the rollers stick. Otherwise, 5 stars. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I read some horrible reviews.  Mine were brand new and clean.  The bottles were not scratched.  The roller balls work just find once you put some oil through them.  I was very happy with these.</li>
    <li> arrived in a timely manner - was just what I wanted and expected</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I am going to get more!</li>
    <li> I have gotten into essential oils recently and bought these to do my own blends. They are a great purchase and I will probably be getting them again to mix up batches as gifts.</li>
    <li> Awesome bottles to use for blended oils</li>
    <li> The roller doesn&#x27;t roll easily, which presents a problem for my clients.</li>
    <li> My bottle arrived broken. I have to wait to return and get a refund to get a replacement.  I wont buy these again</li>
    <li> Work well for what I wanted</li>
    <li> Works fine. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Very easy to fill, Dropper works nicely the first time you use it but I find it hard to clean.</li>
    <li> These were missing pieces and were dirty upon arrival. However, the company returned them easily with no problems.</li>
    <li> The bottles and balls work for awhile...a few weeks maybe of daily use, but then the ball falls out and wont stay in.  Perfect size and idea.</li>
    <li> They are a bit bigger than i thought which is great. cant wait for my essential oils to get here so i can try them out.</li>
    <li> A wee bit hard to get started but otherwise fine.</li>
    <li> This is the fastest I have ever had an item received...and a great product!</li>
    <li> The rollerball falls out of every one.. Not a good investment for pricey essential oils</li>
    <li> Working well for her project</li>
    <li> Came perfectly packaged and unbroken.  super happy!</li>
    <li> There is some kind of grim on the inside of the bottles. Not High Quality at all.</li>
    <li> These are larger than what I am used to, but that just means the oils inside will go further!</li>
    <li> Make sure  to put together good otherwise it will leak.</li>
    <li> The roller balls did not spin well or let out the oil. Very difficult to use. I ended up returning them.</li>
    <li> Great set of 18 empty bottles with roll on cap inserts as well as an outer cap. This set includes an easy to use plastic filling squeeze tube. Great size for travelling, keeping in a car or at work any of a great many liquid items. Great buy and as always fast, easy shipping.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order these based on some of the reviews but i&#x27;m happy I did.  The glass doesn&#x27;t seem to be thin at all. The roller balls fit in the bottles and work great.  No leaking!  I keep mine out of direct light so the clear glass is perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> Glass bottles but plastic roller balls that don&#x27;t roll very well.</li>
    <li> The roller doesn&#x27;t roll easily. It does not push enough oil thru. Kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what I needed thank you!</li>
    <li> Loved getting this shipment and didn&#x27;t take long to receive. I will order agin from this source at a great price.</li>
    <li> Do what they&#x27;re suppose to. They work great. Just wish I had thought to buy amber colored bottles instead of clear. Oh well. They still work great.</li>
    <li> As good as the price seems, I will not order these again. The balls continuously fall out of the roller and what you put in them streams out. Very dissatisfied with this product. Every roller was this way.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I wanted it for---essential oils.</li>
    <li> Mine were packaged well, none were broken... but they were dirty! Some had moisture inside, some had weird smudges inside (as if they&#x27;d previously had oil in them). That&#x27;s pretty gross. I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if they had been for me, but I was ordering out of desperation because my normal supplier was backordered and I needed bottles for orders asap. Couldn&#x27;t use these for my purpose.</li>
    <li> Everything was great but the dropper was NOT included.</li>
    <li> One of them came broken but other than that they seem ok. I think UPS is to blame for the broken one.</li>
    <li> The roller ball pops out on occassion.</li>
    <li> These have worked well. No leaking from lid.</li>
    <li> These are great bottles for the price. Sometimes they will randomly loose he ball in the roller part but for the most part I love them!</li>
    <li> They operate wonderfully, but when received the bottles were dirty and we had to clean out. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The little balls don&#x27;t really move on the product. Makes it hard to roll on the mixture</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than stated. Very pleased with product</li>
    <li> 2 of the bottles were chipped on the bottom.  They still hold liquid but do not stand very steady.  Also they were filthy when I received them but they washed up fine.  Roller ball fits tightly inside bottle and does not leak.  Caps screw on well.  Would likely order again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping however when I opened two of the bottles were cracked.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these. The rollerballs fall out.</li>
    <li> Glass was dirty could not get them clean Roller ball all fell out</li>
    <li> Works great with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Plastic roller balls fall out too easily! This can waste precious essential oils! Size, lids, and pipette are good</li>
    <li> just OK, not High Quality. Glass is thin, you can feel the seam at top and on the side of bottle. One bottle was broken when I opened the box, was not due to packaging, just thin glass. the rollerball fits well into the bottle and lid fits well. Glass is just too thin!</li>
    <li> makes oils on the go really easy!</li>
    <li> These were great and not very expensive!</li>
    <li> I used these for essential oils and they work great.  Although the roller ball is sometimes difficult to remove and a few times I have damaged it accidentally.</li>
    <li> Finally got my carrier oil. Can&#x27;t wait to fill them.</li>
    <li> Great bottles for my oils</li>
    <li> Bigger than expected.  Kind of cheap but does the job</li>
    <li> The glass looked dusty inside, maybe it was something in the glass, but they didn&#x27;t look as clear as other&lt;br /&gt;I have bought.</li>
    <li> Nice price, one arrived broken, haven&#x27;t noticed leaking.</li>
    <li> The dropper is nice and the vials seem good quality but the roller does not seem to dispense the oils very well. It only works if what what your rubbing it on has a fair amount of friction. Otherwise the roller does not spin and nothing comes out.</li>
    <li> Pleased with price, not quality.  It really takes some work to get the roller ball to move.  I give these away with samples of EO and have only used 2 because nothing comes out.  Disappointed, I ordered different ones with the hope that the roller balls move.</li>
