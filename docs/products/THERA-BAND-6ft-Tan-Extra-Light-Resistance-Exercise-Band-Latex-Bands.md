<li> but I only ordered the grey one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it to help me stretch and to strengthen my feet muscles as I am flat footed.</li>
<li> So closer to 5.5 feet long, not six feet.</li>
<li> The band I received was not six feet long.</li>
<li> This is the one and only resistance band that can withstand my heavy use and not break apart and smack me in the face.</li>
<li> gold is really more efficient though, cutting doubles all the time kinda sucks.</li>
<li> This is an upgrade from the black bands.</li>
<li> It did not break, but it got sticky and not usable after a few months.</li>
<li> put the band around your foot and do sets of turning in, turning out, dorsi-flexing, plantar-flexing, in addition to your usual ankle routine.  </li>
<li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet like my black one did.</li>
<li> I use it to rehab my weak ankles.  </li>
<li> However, they do fail after a couple of years, whether you use them or not.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re tired of doubling up the bands so they have some resistance and then they STILL break, this is the band for you!</li>

    <li> makes exercising at the desk easy</li>
    <li> Very durable.  Good for using it for physical therapy.  Most of my other ones break after a while, but this one remains sturdy.  12/26/2015 Update: it did not last after all. It did not break, but it got sticky and not usable after a few months. We live in Southern California so it&#x27;s not very dry or humid.</li>
    <li> Been using it &amp; love it.  I needed something with more ressistance.</li>
    <li> My husband love the bands.  Great for his exercised</li>
    <li> The grey one smells like chocolate :) the others might smell the same but I only ordered the grey one.</li>
    <li> I use it to rehab my weak ankles.  Silver is perfect for athletes who regained full functionality in their ankles but needs rehab work to prevent future injuries.  put the band around your foot and do sets of turning in, turning out, dorsi-flexing, plantar-flexing, in addition to your usual ankle routine.

    <li> This is an upgrade from the black bands. The added resistance is excellent. I have had those for a couple of week and I have not had to readjust anything. They seem durable and don&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good customer service. Had a problem receiving the products originally, but the sellers helped resolve it professionally and courteously. Would buy from them again.   Regards,  Stan</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product. It served what I wanted it for my rehabilitation after an ankle surgery.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Product is as promised.</li>
    <li> This is a giant rubber band.  The possibilities are endless really.  Thera-band, funnel, sturdy couple of sticks - you got yourself one high-powered slingshot sir.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet like my black one did. Good strength someone working on shoulders.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of &amp;#34;Damage Control&amp;#34; from 4-Hour Body. I use it for chest pulls. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Basic band. Good resistance and quality seems to be good. I&#x27;ve been using it to help me stretch and to strengthen my feet muscles as I am flat footed. I&#x27;ve also been using it in PT for my IT bands.</li>
    <li> These bands are a great, light weight exercise tool.  If you have the right resistance, you can carry your gym with you for a few ounces.  However, they do fail after a couple of years, whether you use them or not.  I&#x27;ve purchased many of these over the years, and if I find an old, unused band (more than two years) and try to use it, it will invariably break. However, given the low cost, this is not a reason not to consider using these as an exercise tool.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my older ones. These have a good, strong pull resistance. It is what I needed for my PT on knees.</li>
    <li> I am using this to treat my achilles tendonitis with an exercise using the thera-band.  Seems to offer enough resistance to be helpful.</li>
    <li> I use this for slingshot band material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this gives a nice smooth light pull, doubled up(3/4 x 1/2 taper) it zings 3/8&amp;#34; steel quite nicely.  gold is really more efficient though, cutting doubles all the time kinda sucks.</li>
    <li> The band I received was not six feet long. It is about five inches short.  So closer to 5.5 feet long, not six feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the bands for years. And I feel like I get a good workout.  I recommend this product to anyone interested in resistance band exercise.  .</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Shipping was fast. Great!</li>
    <li> Good value, works as intended</li>
    <li> This is the one and only resistance band that can withstand my heavy use and not break apart and smack me in the face. I went for the heavy-duty, and that it is~!  If you&#x27;re tired of doubling up the bands so they have some resistance and then they STILL break, this is the band for you!</li>
    <li> These exercise bands have the perfect resistance/tension.  They have a light vanilla scent to them, as well.  That&#x27;s a bonus :)</li>
    <li> This is heavier than traditionally used in therapy programs but I have had a number of seniors who didn&#x27;t like the thinner bands but thought this gave them a real workout. Popular with my macho patients even into their late nineties!</li>
    <li> Excellent.. and long enough to stretch with. Helps my feet and leg flexibility.</li>
