      <li>Works Great, smells great!</li>
      <li>Great mouse with Moroccan Oil benefits.</li>
      <li>It does make my curls look great</li>
      <li>This is just as great as the Curl Defining Cream.</li>
      <li>Works amazing!</li>
      <li>Smells so good.</li>
      <li>It worked great, controlled my frizz and gave my curls a nice shine.</li>
      <li>One star for smelling good.</li>
      <li>I have used Moroccan Oil products for a number of years and been very satisfied up until this purchase.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years!  </li>
      <li>Not as easy to create curls as a lotion product but seems to work great to reduce frizz.  </li>
      <li>This was such a great deal, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.... 💚</li>
      <li>I love these products though and would still recommend it.</li>
      <li>Really love the mousse, my curls are looking better than ever in my life.</li>
      <li>This product really brings out the shape of my curls and works great to keep frizz under control.</li>
      <li>This keeps the frizz controlled. :)</li>
      <li>Although it felt better than when I just used the curl mousse allover, it still made my hair feel kinda sticky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real bummer because the product does a great job of defining the curl and eliminating frizz as they suggest.</li>
      <li>I got the Moroccan Curl Cream and it works much better.</li>
      <li>I love how this product gives my hair body and fullness.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in an experimental journey to reach beautiful, bouncy without  having greasy, crunchy hair.</li>
      <li>Curls are light and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the scent and it holds my hair in place.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or crunchy - just nice soft curls!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried over at least a dozen products and so far the Morrocan line is the one that has worked the best without having to mix 3 or more products.</li>
      <li>This is probably a great product but for me a bit heavy.</li>
      <li>Marc Anthony also seems to help reduce frizz, creates nice curls, long lasting and has a nice feel when applying.  </li>
      <li>Medium hold with soft, non crunchy hold that is great for wavy to loose spiral curls.</li>
      <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned Moroccan Oil needs to take this product back to the lab and do some more work on it!</li>
      <li>I find that works better on dry hair than this product.  </li>
      <li>It was just rolling around in a large box, and the lid and pump</li>
      <li>I bought this one because it was slightly less expensive,had similar great reviews and was offered through prime.  </li>
      <li>This product is great when mixed with the Morrocan hair cream, curl activator, and dried with a diffuser.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worked very well.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, frizzy hair</li>
      <li>it is very beat up.  </li>
      <li>I have 3b-3c hair which requires some product in order to tame frizz and look good enough in my eyes.</li>
      <li>I love the product, but the packaging left a little to be desired.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product once so far</li>
      <li>This is &amp;#34;Starbucks&amp;#34; to my daughter&#x27;s hair, a must have for wearing your hair natural.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect the use at the end of the day (as long as the pump works when put back together), but when you buy something new you like it to look new.</li>

    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever used for curly/wavy hair &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years!  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or crunchy - just nice soft curls!</li>
    <li> I have used this product once so far and it&#x27;s worked very well. I enjoy the scent and it holds my hair in place.</li>
    <li> The product came damaged.  I can still get product out of the container but it is very beat up.  It looks like it fell off the truck into oncoming traffic.</li>
    <li> Medium hold with soft, non crunchy hold that is great for wavy to loose spiral curls.</li>
    <li> This is just as great as the Curl Defining Cream. This keeps the frizz controlled. :)</li>
    <li> Works amazing! I have very curly, frizzy hair so I purchased this to use while vacationing in Hawaii. It worked great, controlled my frizz and gave my curls a nice shine.</li>
    <li> This product really brings out the shape of my curls and works great to keep frizz under control.</li>
    <li> This is &amp;#34;Starbucks&amp;#34; to my daughter&#x27;s hair, a must have for wearing your hair natural.</li>
    <li> I am finding this to be the best product yet for reducing frizz even in humid weather.  I have not tried the other Moroccan Oil Curl Cream.  I bought this one because it was slightly less expensive,had similar great reviews and was offered through prime.  To me, it feels a bit like hair spray when applying with the stickiness/dryness.  Not as easy to create curls as a lotion product but seems to work great to reduce frizz.  Only a small amount is needed so it should last a long time which further helps rationalize the cost of this product.  I also like the much less expensive Moroccan Oil Marc Anthony curl cream or lotion obtainable at CVS,Walgreens or Amazon.  I find that works better on dry hair than this product.  Marc Anthony also seems to help reduce frizz, creates nice curls, long lasting and has a nice feel when applying.  That said the frizz reduction excels with this more expensive Moroccan Oil Mousse.  A+ on the mousse for frizz control applied on wet hair but less of a rating for the feel (stickiness) and more difficult to use on dry hair..</li>
    <li> If you like the feeling of honey stuck in your hair then this product is for you! It&#x27;s a real bummer because the product does a great job of defining the curl and eliminating frizz as they suggest. However, it is definitely a disappointing product from Moroccan Oil...especially at that price!  I have used Moroccan Oil products for a number of years and been very satisfied up until this purchase. In my opinion the benefits do not outweigh the way the product makes your hair feel. I even tried using the regular Moroccan Oil mousse and then just a little bit of this curl mousse on my ends. Although it felt better than when I just used the curl mousse allover, it still made my hair feel kinda sticky. As far as I&#x27;m concerned Moroccan Oil needs to take this product back to the lab and do some more work on it!</li>
    <li> Really love the mousse, my curls are looking better than ever in my life. Smells so good.</li>
    <li> My hair remained frizzy.  I got the Moroccan Curl Cream and it works much better.</li>
    <li> Works Great, smells great!</li>
    <li> the inky mousse that controls frizz, boost curls and doesn&#x27;t dry hard or sticky&lt;br /&gt;the only mousse I use</li>
    <li> Another reviewer mentioned that Moroccan Oil products dried out her hair. Same happened to me. One star for smelling good.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but the packaging left a little to be desired.  It was just rolling around in a large box, and the lid and pump lid had come off and were rolling around in the box.  Also the labeling on the package was totally dingy and scuffed up.  It doesn&#x27;t affect the use at the end of the day (as long as the pump works when put back together), but when you buy something new you like it to look new.</li>
    <li> This was such a great deal, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.... 💚</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome!! I use it combined with Quidid gel and it tames the frizz and defines the curl!</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations.  It always does.  However, the packaging left something to be desired.  It leaked.</li>
    <li> Great mouse with Moroccan Oil benefits. Curls are light and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I love how this product gives my hair body and fullness.</li>
    <li> This is probably a great product but for me a bit heavy. I love these products though and would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have 3b-3c hair which requires some product in order to tame frizz and look good enough in my eyes. This product is great when mixed with the Morrocan hair cream, curl activator, and dried with a diffuser. I&#x27;m in an experimental journey to reach beautiful, bouncy without  having greasy, crunchy hair. I&#x27;ve tried over at least a dozen products and so far the Morrocan line is the one that has worked the best without having to mix 3 or more products. For the price of this product I don&#x27;t think I will keep buying since I have to mixed several products in order to get what I want.</li>
    <li> There is actual Moroccan oil in this mousse. It does make my curls look great but the oil makes my hair feel greasy. Not a winner.</li>
