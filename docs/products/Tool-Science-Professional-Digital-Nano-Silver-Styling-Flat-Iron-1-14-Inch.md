      <li>but this one is pretty good.</li>

      <li>My daughter has very curly hair and this product straightened her hair very easily!</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly, had several heat settings (even though the lowest temp if perfect for me).  </li>
      <li>/is easy to style.  </li>
      <li>It straightens my hair very quickly and my hair is shiny when I&#x27;m finished too.  </li>

      <li>The top heat option is way to high if your trying to not fry your hair - but the 375 does the trick with two more temperatures on top of that.</li>
      <li>I was a huge fan of the CHI straightener until my hair stylist suggested this straightener to me.  </li>
      <li>This is a great flat iron.  </li>
      <li>I bought mine a few years ago (still working great) and just bought this one as christmas gift for my mom. :-)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone who needs to iron their hair daily should own one :-)</li>
      <li>That could very well be from the fact that I&#x27;ve dropped it so many times.</li>
      <li>True story...</li>
      <li>It works quickly.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it gets salon hot (450 degrees) improves the process and leaves me with a smooth and light and STRAIGHT finish!</li>
      <li>I have used many, many flat irons over the years.   </li>
      <li>I love my new iron.</li>
      <li>The science tool straightners get super hot quick and are durable.</li>
      <li>I have curly, frizzy hair and this product makes my hair smooth and straight.</li>
      <li>she loves it, it works very well, and it isn&#x27;t built too cheaply inside.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of comments on how nice my hair looks...which I didn&#x27;t get with my last iron.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron is amazing..</li>
      <li>and the price is right..</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re purchasing this iron, you&#x27;ll be very pleased but use EXTREME caution with it because it&#x27;s size and high temperatures make it easy to burn your hands or your head.</li>
      <li>instead of 1\\&quot;, grips easily, feels sturdy, hair slides easily between plates, has a long cord, and cord is attached with a swivel so the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle or get in the way.</li>
      <li>I am replacing my previous Sedu which I also loved.  </li>
      <li>This is the second one, first was STOLEN because they liked it so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>u never need to put to 450.The first time i used it</li>
      <li>It does get hot, but it comes with heat guards where you hold the iron, and they work.  </li>
      <li>I would say leave these to the professionals because it gets really really hot, 450 degrees is no joke.</li>
      <li>I had to adjust to not holding the end of the iron, because it can get too hot, but after a couple of times, I got used to it, and have had no issues with it.  </li>
      <li>I do use a higher heat setting, 410, but it can be used cooler or hotter...</li>
      <li>It just gets too hot.     </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have A LOT of long, naturally curly hair that is fairly difficult for me to control and shape beyond just straightening. I purchased this iron to straighten and curl under or out at the same time (I hate doing 50 different steps to get my hair where I want it and I don&#x27;t have the time).     This iron will get the job done if you keep your movement fluid with very few pauses during the curl. It heats up quickly and makes the job \\&quot;easy\\&quot; (relatively speaking).    However, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve seriously burned my hands since I bought it and I rarely go above the lowest setting of 300. The settings are 300, 340, 375, 410, and 450, I find it extremely hard to believe that anyone needs a setting of 450!     My daughter has gotten into straightening her hair (she&#x27;s 11) and I absolutely will not let her use this iron alone even though she uses my other very frequently and has no trouble. It just gets too hot.     If you&#x27;re purchasing this iron, you&#x27;ll be very pleased but use EXTREME caution with it because it&#x27;s size and high temperatures make it easy to burn your hands or your head. I would not recommend this for young girls learning to style their hair unless an adult is helping even if they frequently use a larger iron on their own.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this styling iron. I have very wavy and frizzy hair and is the only one I have found that work great and for a good price.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist and I were talking about straightners and she recommended this one.  It is great, and heats up quickly.  It has different heat settings, too.  It&#x27;s better for your hair than a Chi because you can control the heat!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these today at a local store to replace my Chi Original. I love everything about it. At first I used it at the highest setting, and realized I didn&#x27;t need that much heat. I looked up the Chi to find out what temperature it used. I found that it was 370, so I lowered my setting to 375. This straightener works even better than the Chi for me. Straightens faster and left my hair feeling smooth and silky. I like that I can adjust the heat, that it has an auto shut-off if it&#x27;s accidentally left on, that it is 1 1/4\\&quot; instead of 1\\&quot;, grips easily, feels sturdy, hair slides easily between plates, has a long cord, and cord is attached with a swivel so the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle or get in the way. So glad I chose this straightener!</li>
    <li> Not to expensive and works great. A wider one would work best but this one is pretty good. Delivery was fast and price was fair!</li>
    <li> One of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of them. No snagging my hair while straightening and I only need to go over my hair once. Quick, easy, less damage to the hair, the cord is long. This is my everyday, go-to flat iron. I have naturally curly, thick hair and this works great.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the best!  I have extremely curly, frizzy, wavy  hair and it has been always been problematic.  I am replacing my previous Sedu which I also loved.  My Sedu is very highly rated but it quit working this morning.  I have used many, many flat irons over the years.   I had used the Tool Science flat iron at a friend&#x27;s house and was shocked to find out it could be purchased for $39.99.  I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this iron based on the low price figuring it wouldn&#x27;t do what I needed.  The Sedu is $130 and that&#x27;s what I figured I have to pay to get a good one.  The Tool Science is every bit as good as my Sedu if not better.  Even at the regular price of $59.99 it&#x27;s worth the money.  It straightens my hair very quickly and my hair is shiny when I&#x27;m finished too.  I highly recommend this iron if you&#x27;re looking for very high performance! I would have ordered it from Amazon but due to time constraints I drove to Sally&#x27;s as soon as I could!  I have nothing bad to say about the Sedu but when you&#x27;re looking to save money - the Tool Science is the way to go!</li>
    <li> This is the second one, first was STOLEN because they liked it so much. True story... Would/will buy again even if it broke tomorrow. Yeah, its better than models twice the price. Needs a better name, like Yippie - hair done in a pass... Lol</li>
    <li> As a straightener, this does the job. But as an \\&quot;ion straightener\\&quot; I was fairly disappointed. I have long, fine hair. My hair hasn&#x27;t been colored either. This straightener leaves my hair straight, but I still get fly aways. Although I do like it, I wish I would have spent a little more money on a better one.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Was told at Sallys that it was just a step down from the chi which was too pricey for me. I had it about a year when it quit heating up for me but in its defense, I dropped it ALL the time and wound the cord around it. I reordered the same one on Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find it at Sallys and I&#x27;m in love with it allover again! I plan on treating it much better this time. Great deal for the price! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This straightener is great quality. It gets very hot and does a great job straightening my hair, which is very thick, long, and wavy. It heats up very fast and maintains heat very well. I do not use the finger grips, as they grab my hair pretty badly and it&#x27;s painful. Other than that, this straightener has had no problems!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I put through the top part of my hair so it is all even (I have half straight and half curly hair, which is difficult to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;), and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out, when I run this through my hair, and it makes my hair look nice/is easy to style.  I love the timer feature. Even though I am &#x27;only&#x27; 40, I am forgetful because I zoom arond when getting ready, and I forget to turn some things off.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron.  It heats up quickly, had several heat settings (even though the lowest temp if perfect for me).  This is the second one of these that I&#x27;ve bought.  The first one lasted me for several years with regular use.  I like the new grips that can be attached to this model to help with holding and preventing your fingers from getting a burned.</li>
    <li> THE BITCH TOOK IT WITH HER....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dropped this straightener on the ground too many times to count, and it still turns on and heats up fine. I&#x27;ve had this for almost three years now, and I&#x27;m very impressed by it&#x27;s durability. One trick I&#x27;ve learned: unplug it after each use, so it heats up to the appropriate temperature. Occasionally, if I turn it off at 450 degrees, and turn it on hours later at the same temperature, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot like it does when I unplug it. That could very well be from the fact that I&#x27;ve dropped it so many times.</li>
    <li> Best straightener. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair and this product straightened her hair very easily!</li>
    <li> One of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Highly recommended to all</li>
    <li> I previously owned this product and almost cried when it stopped working after 4 years. I was so happy when I found this product on Amazon! I have curly, frizzy hair and this product makes my hair smooth and straight. I would highly recommend this product....Thank you Tool Science for making me feel pretty again!!!!!</li>
    <li> excellent service, excellent product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> i am so glad i found a straghtner to work with my hair its a great difference compared to the one i had&lt;br /&gt;one word AMAZING</li>
    <li> My GF love it she is very happy with the product!!</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of the CHI straightener until my hair stylist suggested this straightener to me.  The variable heat settings are really what sold me on it.  I have very thick, coarse hair, so I use it on 450 with a smoothing serum and heat protectant spray.  It literally cut my styling time in half, and the straightness will last for days!  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it still works as good as the day I got it.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Had my iron for the past 8 months at my salon and it still works like a dream, i love it. I would say leave these to the professionals because it gets really really hot, 450 degrees is no joke. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this, maybe from 6 years ago. I got a ghd straightner about a year ago and wasn&#x27;t quite enjoying it.......it&#x27;s not even compareable to the science tool straightners. I use it every day and have dropped it quite a few times but it&#x27;s still goin. The science tool straightners get super hot quick and are durable. They are qreat quality. I&#x27;ve used hot tools, chic, babyliss, and ghd none of these have lived up to my science tool one. I have super thick long wavey hair and I can straighten my hair in 10 mins OR do big curls in 10 mins.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the variable settings, and the automatic shutoff (after an hour), and hoped I would like the results.  I love it.  It works quickly.  For my thick, very curly, frizzy hair, I was able to straighten it and wave the ends at the same time.  With my last iron, I could do this, but within the hour, the ends would lose their wave.  With this one, it lasts all day.  I do use a higher heat setting, 410, but it can be used cooler or hotter...I just went with the lowest temp that worked for me.  It does get hot, but it comes with heat guards where you hold the iron, and they work.  I had to adjust to not holding the end of the iron, because it can get too hot, but after a couple of times, I got used to it, and have had no issues with it.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of comments on how nice my hair looks...which I didn&#x27;t get with my last iron.  I love this!  But I agree with a previous poster...not for use with children unsupervised.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE flat iron!! My family owns 3 of them so I had to join! The best flat iron to me!!</li>
    <li> This iron is great. It heats very well, holds very well. It leave your hair nice and shiny, u don&#x27;t need sheen.&lt;br /&gt;Great for professional use.</li>
    <li> I really love  my till science! It works perfect! It gets hit fast and works great! I hasn&#x27;t been burnt yet..so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who needs to iron their hair daily should own one :-)</li>
    <li> I you are a person that straightens their hair - this is a must-have!  It is smooth and it&#x27;s nice to not feel like your ripping your hair out!  The top heat option is way to high if your trying to not fry your hair - but the 375 does the trick with two more temperatures on top of that.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to love this and I was so so close. I set it to the highest setting because my hair is so curly and I have tons of it. The 450* was perfect and straightened quickly in one or two passes. It also straightened a large chunk at a time which was very appreciated. I finished my whole head in about 30 min without blow drying first and that is unheard of for me. I have always had to blow dry straight first even though I was using a T3 straightener ($100+) at 410*. My problem comes from the snagging. If I used a large chunk it skimmed through but any smaller portion snag and ripped. I have a halo of flyaways due to the pulling. That&#x27;s a deal breaker for me. I can&#x27;t have it causing breakage. I guess I&#x27;ll have to foot the bill for a GHD.</li>
    <li> This flatiron was good for the first few months, then I noticed that it started to take longer to heat up to my normal setting. Now only one and a half years later it&#x27;s not heating up past 149. For some reason it seems to be stuck at that setting. Not worth the money I paid to for it to last less than two years. I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
    <li> This was not for me, so I can not comment on how well it works. I have been told it does work well.</li>
    <li> I love my new iron. Just perfect...</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve owned.  My first one lasted me for years!!!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I owned one years ago and replaced it with a more expensive model which was a huge mistake. Many straighteners have gaps in the plates that pull your hair out. This one doesn&#x27;t. This one also didn&#x27;t break my hair like the more expensive model. I am glad I was able to get another one of these. Don&#x27;t spend more $ because that does not mean a better product!</li>
    <li> Cut my straightening time in half! 10 minutes for my whole head. The fact that it gets salon hot (450 degrees) improves the process and leaves me with a smooth and light and STRAIGHT finish! GREAT PURCHASE!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered it as a gift, my cousin loves it!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron for the price, for sure. I bought mine a few years ago (still working great) and just bought this one as christmas gift for my mom. :-)</li>
    <li> My friend had this product and she bought it for like $100 and i got it for $60. I also saw this at my professional hair salon. This is a great product i would expect a product like this to be about $150. Thats how good it is.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing..it heats up quickly and definitely gets the job done. My hair is thin with a little wave to it and definitely never wants to curl. Chis and curling irons do not curl my hair neither can a professional get my hair to hold a curl . But this flat iron I can curl the ends and they will stay and I don&#x27;t even spray hair spray. I&#x27;ve had a similar one for 2 years and have never had any problems. It does everything I want it to do. it Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this on behalf of my girlfriend who has an older, non-digital (dial controlled) version of this flat styling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just finished repairing it, and it&#x27;s back to performing like new. Below is what we found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron worked very well for about 3 years. Then it became more frustrating for her to use as it was taking longer for her to style, and the results weren&#x27;t as nice as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, it got to the point were it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to style her hair in a single pass, nor would it keep heat in-between applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a multimeter, we found that the power cord section had gone bad and was only making intermittent connection somewhere inside the molded strain relief portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we repaired the damaged section of cord, we cleaned off any residue, inspected the circuitry, and checked the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing the max heat setting, we saw that it was only reaching 340 degrees F in-between the closed irons using a temp probe. A good bit shy of it&#x27;s rated maximum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing on the controller board appeared damaged or out of sorts so I sprayed some contact cleaner (DeoxIT) into all the rheostats and worked them around them a little bit. Re-checking the temp, we saw a peak of 420 and a hold at 412 which is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all she loves it, it works very well, and it isn&#x27;t built too cheaply inside. Minus one star for the power cord that bailed after 3 years and discovering that it appears to be a common point of failure on these models (Tool Science and CHI Turbo).</li>
    <li> Came on time, like the straightener so far.  Have thick hair and it gets the job done and is nice and lightweight.</li>
    <li> I been having this flat iron for 4 years and its still in perfect condition!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets very hot..u never need to put to 450.The first time i used it i burned my finger..I have thick coarse unpermed hair.One pass on 350 my hair is bone straght.This the best flat iron i ever used..and the price is right..I dont need another flat iron ever!</li>
