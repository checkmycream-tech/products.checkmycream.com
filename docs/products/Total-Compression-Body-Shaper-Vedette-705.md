      <li>I&#x27;m not disapointed, I just know if I want better results and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>but my clothes do fit better when I wear this shaper.</li>
      <li>it becomes easy...</li>
      <li>I can move, breathe easily, and even pee without taking off the item as it has a hole on either side.</li>
      <li>I received it in the mail very quickly.</li>
      <li>Once your in it, it seems comfortable.</li>
      <li>i knw a lot of ppl saying theirs dont fit</li>
      <li>It fits securely and I can still go to the bathroom.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure what I was sent was a onesie for an INFANT.</li>
      <li>This is good to wear a mid length dress or skirt....</li>
      <li>You are better off buying a high waisted spanxx.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping-3 days!</li>
      <li>I promise its worth the work.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the 136 body shaper and loved it, this one is a bit harder to get on</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good if your just using it for a little belly bump, but I like the other one better, it really makes you feel sexy :)</li>
      <li>It really fits nicely, and holds in at all the right places.i would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>The straps would be better if they could lengthen a little more.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a large!</li>
      <li>Material in legs are nice but the mid section material is very abrasive.</li>
      <li>Just tried it on for the first time...</li>
      <li>FIRST</li>
      <li>I purchased a size to large on purpose.</li>
      <li>I bought this body suit in a large.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 and about 160 lbs and ordered a large...</li>
      <li>Absolutely works</li>
      <li>I was looking for a very sturdy body shaper.</li>
      <li>Thanks to all the ladies that took the time to write these reviews</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
      <li>honestly, considering how small this thing is when it arrives I was worried I&#x27;d need to call for reinforcements to cut me out of it.  </li>
      <li>But overall this shaper is worth the price.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did, and I will share with you guys the easiest way to get in this baby, a lady that sells Colombian girdles told me how to do it, loose the shoulder straps, flip it inside out and now hold it by the edge of the legs and start puting it on your legs all the way up, now grab the upper part and slide it over your body</li>
      <li>hope I&#x27;m being clear, it flattens my tummy</li>
      <li>but seriously I should be able to put it on....</li>
      <li>Really look at the size chart prior to ordering and purchase the recommended size for your specific measurements.</li>
      <li>after the initial dance to get in the tucker, it is amazing and not that uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>I purchased the large simply because I wished for only a little help.</li>
      <li>I want it to be very tight so if you have about the same measurements as me get a medium... Be patient at first trying to get it on this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t like it was because it made my waist look boxy and unnatural. If you&#x27;re a plus sized woman, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for you. I am a curvy woman and wear undergarments to make my physique and outfits looks good, but this one was by far the worst I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> This Total Compression body shaper, was not what i expected..It seem very fragile, and the first  time i tried it on it tore on one side really disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> Too small, sizing inaccurate</li>
    <li> Can this be worn for when you get a tummy tuck and Brazilian butt lift.  Will it help..</li>
    <li> This shaper makes my body look deformed and I have a nice figure. It is also very uncomfortable. I won&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> am so glad i ordered this body shaper, it fits great. 2day is my 1st day wearing it and i dont feel restricted at all. i knw a lot of ppl saying theirs dont fit but what i did 2 get my size was 2 measure my hips, waist and under bust and match them to the vedette size chart. my size was a large and its awesome. what vedette 705 did 4 me was 2 smoothe me out and gave my waist and hips a flawless look and lift my bust. this shaper is a MUSt have.its somewhat of a challenge to get into but the result is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST MEASURE UR BODY FIRST AND YOU&#x27;LL GET UR SIZE.</li>
    <li> I bought this body suit in a large. I am 176lbs, 5&#x27;6&#x27;. I got into it after about 15 mins, of sweating and jumping up and down. Once your in it, it seems comfortable. I can move, breathe easily, and even pee without taking off the item as it has a hole on either side. Another thing I didn&#x27;t like about the suit was that it bunched up by the stomach.</li>
    <li> WAY TOO SMALL- You&#x27;ll get a hernia attempting to get this thing on.</li>
    <li> This body shaper is great and fits snug. Really look at the size chart prior to ordering and purchase the recommended size for your specific measurements. Disregard whatever size you &amp;#34;usually&amp;#34; wear. Haven&#x27;t noticed yet if it is signifantly helping with reshaping my body but my clothes do fit better when I wear this shaper.</li>
    <li> Just tried it on for the first time...honestly, considering how small this thing is when it arrives I was worried I&#x27;d need to call for reinforcements to cut me out of it.  It felt like it took me forever to get on,  and a couple times it felt like I was fighting a losing battle,  but push on....I promise its worth the work.  Looks like I lost at least 15 pounds.  Absolutely works</li>
    <li> I hated this product, I felt like I was wearing a straight jacket, would not recommend.  I wanted to return, but unable to now.</li>
    <li> after the initial dance to get in the tucker, it is amazing and not that uncomfortable. I can wear it for about 9 hours before I start getting antsy. It smooths out all my lumps and bumps. It fits securely and I can still go to the bathroom. love this!</li>
    <li> Material in legs are nice but the mid section material is very abrasive. Also, way too small per measurements online. If you are going to buy, go bigger.</li>
    <li> It really fits nicely, and holds in at all the right places.i would definitely buy again. Love, love love this.</li>
    <li> Thanks to all the ladies that took the time to write these reviews those helped me a lot, now is time to pay it forward even though I don&#x27;t like to write reviews....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First my measurements: Bust 38&amp;#34;, waist 30, hips 40, usually I wear medium and my dresses are 6 or 8 but I got the small size on this following suggestions and I&#x27;m so glad I did, and I will share with you guys the easiest way to get in this baby, a lady that sells Colombian girdles told me how to do it, loose the shoulder straps, flip it inside out and now hold it by the edge of the legs and start puting it on your legs all the way up, now grab the upper part and slide it over your body you just have to wiggle like we do went wearing skinny jeans, hope I&#x27;m being clear, it flattens my tummy</li>
    <li> Poor material no supportive</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok... I purchased the 136 body shaper and loved it, this one is a bit harder to get on and I don&#x27;t feel it has the same effect as the 136. It&#x27;s good if your just using it for a little belly bump, but I like the other one better, it really makes you feel sexy :)</li>
    <li> I received this today and about died when I saw it! It is so small! I got the size it said to, but couldn&#x27;t get it past my knees. I doubt my sis who weighs 105 could even get it on and it&#x27;s a large! I will try to send it back now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I wish I did not. I am 5 ft tall. I weigh 119 pounds. I purchased the large simply because I wished for only a little help. I did not want to be miserible just slightly improved. I started to put it on. I got one foot in one leg and couldn&#x27;t get it on without a 30 minute struggle. Maybe its just me but seriously I should be able to put it on.... I purchased a size to large on purpose.</li>
    <li> I received it in the mail very quickly. The garment was smaller than what I thought and thinner than what I thought. I was looking for a very sturdy body shaper. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for but it will do for now...it smooths me out but my problem is my stomach...I need something to hold that in.</li>
    <li> I ask for a Large size and it looked and felt like an xx small. Did not like it, returned it</li>
    <li> Not as advertised, returned it immediately. I was very disappointed with this product and will never buy anything like this online again.</li>
    <li> It works and stays up well. It&#x27;s tough to get on but once its on it does the job. The straps would be better if they could lengthen a little more.</li>
    <li> This is basically longer spanx....yes it is a little hard to get on at first but after you get used to it it becomes easy... I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 and about 160 lbs and ordered a large... I feel like it fits a little big I want it to be very tight so if you have about the same measurements as me get a medium... Be patient at first trying to get it on this is why it is a compression garment... This is good to wear a mid length dress or skirt.... Very fast shipping-3 days!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure what I was sent was a onesie for an INFANT. Wouldn&#x27;t bother trying it on because of how small it looked, and the fabric was difficult to stretch even with two people pulling at it. Sending it back ASAP!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles, it did what I needed it to do. I&#x27;m not disapointed, I just know if I want better results and more shaping I&#x27;ll have to spend more money for it. But overall this shaper is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Itchy.  Uncomfortable.  Wish I never bought it.  Not comfortable at all and I can&#x27;t think of why I would ever wear it.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was going to be. You are better off buying a high waisted spanxx. Great for using it at the gym though.</li>
