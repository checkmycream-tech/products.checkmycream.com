<li> I have fine hair and very hard to add body.</li>
<li> The lift holds with humidity, too--we&#x27;ve had weeks of about 90F and rain and while my hair \\&quot;frizzed\\&quot;, it did not go flat.</li>
<li> (Have used Pureology for a long time but the local store closed!)</li>
<li> I will definitely buy again and look for their other products to stop the humidity frizz.</li>

<li> I have used other Pureology products that I like a lot.</li>
<li> A little expensive, but well worth it,</li>
<li> Added little volume to hair.</li>
<li> Mousse is runny and thin, even after shaking well.</li>
<li> I have very thin hair</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> This was the first time ordering this particular product. I have color treated hair, that doesn&#x27;t have much body to hold fullness or curl. My hair is is cut short in back, with it being longer on the sides and top. I have used other products that have done a better job. First of all, the nozzle on this product only sprays a straight stream, not a mist spray. The product was very gummy to me, and doesn&#x27;t hold a set very well. I have used other Pureology products that I like a lot. This one just isn&#x27;t up to par for me.</li>
    <li> Great product I have used it on my fine long hair for years</li>
    <li> Perfect .. just what I was looking for.  High recommend!  (Have used Pureology for a long time but the local store closed!)</li>
    <li> The product I received is not the same as pictured &amp; ordered.  It was the same brand, but not the same product!</li>
    <li> Consistently great product</li>
    <li> Having a great beautician is great. She has taught me so much about hair products. She explained to me how great these products are! Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This product works good for my fine hair.  I put in my roots at the top of my head &amp; blow dry, then setting my hair.  Been using this product for quite a fit years.</li>
    <li> Works just like my salon.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Love the Lift!! Great Product! Use with Pureology Silk Bodifier and my hair has great Body nod Lift at the Root!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> As listed.....will buy again.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product when I borrowed it from my daughter. It gives great uplift to my hair and does not leave an overly sticky residue on my hands when used.  When using my hair dryer &amp; brush, everything works smoothly with no tug or pull.  Feel like I have found the product that I was looking for &amp; will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Pureology  is great for your hair and a great buy!  Thanks I don&#x27;t have further comments about this products and can not come up with further description.</li>
    <li> I love the Pureology Colour Stylist Root Lift Spray Mousse for my hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and love the effect that it has on my hair. My hair just is not the same without it. I cannot find it locally so I have had to resort to buying over the internet so that my hair can turn out the way that I like it to.</li>
    <li> I like the original bottle not the spray but love the product not to sticky , makes hair thicker and easy to comb through</li>
    <li> My girls loves this stuff and if she is happy than I am too.  I ordered 2 more before the first ran out so I might get lucky tonight!!!</li>
    <li> Smells good but don&#x27;t put too much makes your roots feel a bit crunchy</li>
    <li> Pureology products are wonderful. I really like the root life, it give my hair the lift it needs. I have straight hair so it really helps mr style my hair.</li>
    <li> Really like this Mousse. I have thin and fine hair and this helps with volume without making hair sticky or stiff!</li>
    <li> The best volumizing product for baby-fine, thin hair you will find.</li>
    <li> LOVE this (and EVERY other) Pureology product!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and very hard to add body. Pureology  Root Lift works great with my hair. I highly recommend. A little expensive, but well worth it,</li>
    <li> Pureology Root Lift gives me the lift I need and the stiffness I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. My hair tech recommended I purchase this and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  This  works has a great smell.  I will continue purchasing the  product.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it advertises and is not scented so I have no worries about clashing scents with shampoo, conditioner, or perfume. Even when my hair was \\&quot;overgrown\\&quot; to let some layers grow out, I left for work looking good. The lift holds with humidity, too--we&#x27;ve had weeks of about 90F and rain and while my hair \\&quot;frizzed\\&quot;, it did not go flat. I will definitely buy again and look for their other products to stop the humidity frizz.</li>
