      <li>It worked perfectly for my Cosplay and is easy to care for.</li>
      <li>but all in all a good product.</li>
      <li>Strands do tend to fall out fairly often.</li>
      <li>Very cute</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, the shipping was prompt, the price was right, and the look is perfect for what I want.</li>
      <li>I love it !</li>
      <li>really cute wig!</li>
      <li>Both shed so much, it&#x27;s kind of embarrassing when I&#x27;m at work.</li>
      <li>She liked the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>really nice, well made</li>
      <li>wig is of nice quality though, it is smooth and wears nicely.</li>
      <li>very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the friendly service and commitment of the seller to ship the product before the deadline, as I needed.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this wig.</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I have had better wigs before, but for the price, its okay...</li>
      <li>wig is also much more curly at the bottom than in the picture.</li>
      <li>around, I would say it&#x27;s OKAY</li>
      <li>but it is a lovely wig altogether.</li>
      <li>WASH FIRST!!!</li>
      <li>This wig is adorable and true to color.</li>
      <li>This bob is super cute.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also came with a pair of socks as a free gift.</li>
      <li>you get what you pay for and it was cheap.</li>
      <li>I liked this product, but the texture feels very synthetic.</li>
      <li>The wig is cute, the inside seems built kinda like for more smaller heads, and it can become tangled very easy.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully, it came with a full head of hair, so even though a lot of hair came out in the beginning, there&#x27;s still quite a bit of hair left.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just got this wig (super fast thanks to amazon prime) and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>wash first!</li>
      <li>I was a little nervous about buying a wig online, especially a cheap one.</li>
      <li>One of the wigs I bought was squished and it took some time to get the hairs to lay right</li>
      <li>the net can be a tad tight but for me its perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money to get a better quality wig.</li>
      <li>but the texture is soft, and from a reasonable distance, looks pretty convincing.</li>
      <li>I have bough some other wigs from this seller and so far besides this one they were great.</li>
      <li>I plan on purchasing more wigs from this company in the future.</li>
      <li>When I first got this wig, all appeared well...</li>
      <li>The only thing I could say I didn&#x27;t like was that is was a lot more brown than in the picture online.</li>
      <li>I wanted to use this wig as a stepping out wig but now its only good enough to us when i go to the gym.</li>
      <li>It feels like real hair and it survived its first going over with a wig brush like a champ.</li>
      <li>It will be a fun change from my normal hair.</li>
      <li>&quot; On the exact day I decided to purchase this, someone else left a very nice review about it, which helped my confidence a little.</li>
      <li>It came with a hairnet (and a little pair of socks, just because), so that was nice.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think you can beat the price.</li>
      <li>The Bangs are not to the side they are straight across and no matter how much you try to brush them to the side they dont wanna stay.</li>
      <li>it fits me really well and looks real under the sunlight.</li>
      <li>In the contacts I had with the selling company was always very well attended by the Jackie and Yvonne.</li>
      <li>This wig was a lot better than I expected.</li>
      <li>If it sheds too much, I&#x27;ll be ordering a replacement.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, way above worth what I paid!</li>
      <li>The main reason its getting  3 stars from me is because the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>It only comes with a netted wig cap (nothing special)</li>
      <li>You will most likely need to cut the bangs as well, because they tend to fall back in your face when you try to sweep them to the side like the photo.</li>
      <li>Nice quality wigs, at least for costume/dressup.  </li>
      <li>but if I put my hair in a couple of braids and pin them, the wigs fits quite naturally.</li>
      <li>and I have been able to use for several occasions over the past year with no problem.</li>
      <li>Definitely not a dark brown, and do not have the body of the picture shown.</li>
      <li>One is sewn together a little better than the other one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft not reccomended if you have a big head</li>
      <li>Not too tight or too hot.</li>

<li> The problem I have is that I was sent a different wig, not the one pictured here, I was sent a very long straight wig that goes about halfway down my back and has no wave to</li>
<li> I gave the product as a gift for a sick relative and they loved it.</li>
<li> In some lighting, it&#x27;s almost black, but in brighter room, it takes on a pretty dark brown-red color that I simply adore.</li>
<li> Speaking of my long hair, I really don&#x27;t have much trouble hiding a hair away in this either.</li>
<li> I have long, long blonde curly hair and whenever I pull out this wig</li>

<li> Not sure if they would pass as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; but they work well for playtime.  </li>
<li> , I just put it on...and luck would have it, my scalp started itching like crazy 20 minutes later.</li>
<li> I have a small head and face, so I did wind up cutting the bangs a little to keep them out of my eyes.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really thin and lighter than depicted.</li>
<li> It does not look fake.</li>
<li> Trying to brush it out carefully, it sheds something awful.</li>
<li> It sheds like crazy.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t shed that badly</li>
<li> everyone is always shocked as they think I have cut and dyed my hair drastically.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m totally disappointed with it, but then again....</li>
<li> OMG one of the worst itching experiences I&#x27;ve had with a wig...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> really nice, well made</li>
    <li> If I could give this wig 3 1/2 stars I would. Trying to brush it out carefully, it sheds something awful. Even just trying with your fingers to smooth things down, strands come out like crazy. The wig itself is a little small for my head, so it can be hard to keep in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the shipping was prompt, the price was right, and the look is perfect for what I want. It came with a hairnet (and a little pair of socks, just because), so that was nice. I really don&#x27;t think you can beat the price. If it sheds too much, I&#x27;ll be ordering a replacement.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying a wig online, especially a cheap one. I decided on this one because I figured, \\&quot;Hey, it&#x27;s $20, if I don&#x27;t like it, no big deal.\\&quot; On the exact day I decided to purchase this, someone else left a very nice review about it, which helped my confidence a little. This bob is super cute. I have a small head and face, so I did wind up cutting the bangs a little to keep them out of my eyes. The color of the wig is beautiful. In some lighting, it&#x27;s almost black, but in brighter room, it takes on a pretty dark brown-red color that I simply adore. I plan on purchasing more wigs from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> I just got this wig (super fast thanks to amazon prime) and it is amazing. It feels like real hair and it survived its first going over with a wig brush like a champ.It needs some fluffing/ styling on one side, but I would buy this again in a second.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep making the same mistake.....wash first! I was so excited to try this, I just put it on...and luck would have it, my scalp started itching like crazy 20 minutes later. OMG one of the worst itching experiences I&#x27;ve had with a wig...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style is a bit &amp;#34;flatter&amp;#34; than the picture shown, and the color&#x27;s seems a tad bit lighter (depends on lighting, sun, etc.) but the texture is soft, and from a reasonable distance, looks pretty convincing. Boo the price went down a day after I ordered + it was offered as Add-on...so it took A WHILE to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, I would say it&#x27;s OKAY...I have had better wigs before, but for the price, its okay... WASH FIRST!!!</li>
    <li> This wig is adorable and true to color. It will be a fun change from my normal hair. Very cute</li>
    <li> It did not suit my type of head. So I donated it.</li>
    <li> This wig is falling apart.  I hope it will last until Halloween and then I can throw it away. I&#x27;m totally disappointed with it, but then again.... you get what you pay for and it was cheap.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but the texture feels very synthetic. And as other reviewers mentioned, it sheds a lot. Good for the price though!</li>
    <li> This wig is great. I have long, long blonde curly hair and whenever I pull out this wig everyone is always shocked as they think I have cut and dyed my hair drastically. Speaking of my long hair, I really don&#x27;t have much trouble hiding a hair away in this either. It only comes with a netted wig cap (nothing special) but if I put my hair in a couple of braids and pin them, the wigs fits quite naturally. Not too tight or too hot. It doesn&#x27;t shed that badly and I have been able to use for several occasions over the past year with no problem. Styling has been minimal, just shaping the bangs with my fingers when they go askew as I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also came with a pair of socks as a free gift. Very pleasant experience, I will be returning to this seller for great wigs for a relatively cheap cost</li>
    <li> Nice quality wigs, at least for costume/dressup.  Not sure if they would pass as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; but they work well for playtime.  One of the wigs I bought was squished and it took some time to get the hairs to lay right but all in all a good product.</li>
    <li> The problem I have is that I was sent a different wig, not the one pictured here, I was sent a very long straight wig that goes about halfway down my back and has no wave to it.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is of nice quality though, it is smooth and wears nicely.</li>
    <li> When I first got this wig, all appeared well... until I opened it. With each stroke of my fingers, hair would come out in the masses.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, it came with a full head of hair, so even though a lot of hair came out in the beginning, there&#x27;s still quite a bit of hair left.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is if later on the hair will continue to fall in puddles.&lt;br /&gt;This wig is also much more curly at the bottom than in the picture.</li>
    <li> In the contacts I had with the selling company was always very well attended by the Jackie and Yvonne. I was very pleased with the friendly service and commitment of the seller to ship the product before the deadline, as I needed. The seller was correct. I gave the product as a gift for a sick relative and they loved it. She liked the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft not reccomended if you have a big head the net can be a tad tight but for me its perfect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig. It is cute, bouncy and really awesome with a beret! The bottom is a little curlier than in the picture but it is a lovely wig altogether. One of my favorites to wear and go.</li>
    <li> Really cute wig, does shed but didn&#x27;t look quite like picture.. still very gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I bought two. One is sewn together a little better than the other one. Both shed so much, it&#x27;s kind of embarrassing when I&#x27;m at work. It&#x27;s worth the extra money to get a better quality wig. Next time, I&#x27;ll try a $40-$50 dollar one.</li>
    <li> really cute wig! i have long hair and i always wanted to try short one. i love it. looks almost like in the pic. it fits me really well and looks real under the sunlight.</li>
    <li> The wig I received looks nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s really thin and lighter than depicted. Definitely not a dark brown, and do not have the body of the picture shown. It sheds like crazy.</li>
    <li> The wig is cute, the inside seems built kinda like for more smaller heads, and it can become tangled very easy.</li>
    <li> It dose not  look like whats on the manikins head. The Bangs are not to the side they are straight across and no matter how much you try to brush them to the side they dont wanna stay. I wanted to use this wig as a stepping out wig but now its only good enough to us when i go to the gym. I have bough some other wigs from this seller and so far besides this one they were great. The main reason its getting  3 stars from me is because the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great wig. It worked perfectly for my Cosplay and is easy to care for. It does not look fake. I love it !</li>
    <li> Love this wig!!!! It&#x27;s so soft and easy to comb. I this for my Kiki&#x27;s delivery service cosplay and it will work wonderfully. The only thing I could say I didn&#x27;t like was that is was a lot more brown than in the picture online. But that&#x27;s ok I still love it!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for i guess.  very cheaply made. ended up not using it.</li>
    <li> This wig was a lot better than I expected. I bought it for a costume, and for this purpose, it works perfectly! I would not use it daily, however. Strands do tend to fall out fairly often. You will most likely need to cut the bangs as well, because they tend to fall back in your face when you try to sweep them to the side like the photo. So it&#x27;s not a wear-straight-out-of-packaging wig. It has adjustable straps for different head sizes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, way above worth what I paid!</li>
