### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>As for the ones that I ordered they seem to do as good a job as the ones from Phillips</li>
      <li>Price was good</li>
      <li>Not as good as the originals, with a tendency to easily break.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>As others agree, it is a cheap clone that is not as good as original.  </li>
      <li>Did fit and the price was much better, but not going to be my replacement again.</li>
      <li>+ is a direct replacement and works great...</li>
      <li>Cheaply made and tore up my face.</li>
      <li>I can never get a clean shave.  </li>
      <li>Not near as good as the manufacturer&#x27;s product</li>
      <li>Does not shave any better than old head</li>
      <li>My old razor head cut better than this replacement.</li>
      <li>The price was right, how ever the product wasn&#x27;t....</li>
      <li>I used the first of two shaving heads for about three months before the plastic around the head broke.</li>
      <li>By 12:00 I really need another shave  Shaver/Razor Replacement Heads</li>
      <li>Does not cut very well.</li>
      <li>The blades are dull and don&#x27;t cut as good as the old ones.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave, but it sure costs less!</li>
      <li>Just not a quality replacement, clogs and dulls much faster that original manufactured equipment.  </li>
      <li>No complaint about closeness.</li>
      <li>more than what i hoped for  but just for the record, i found that the new replacement head was a little bit bigger than my original one, and therefore, the protection plastic cover will not fit.(shaver head will be unprotected unless you by a different one.)</li>
      <li>I threw them away after four uses and bought a brand new razor.</li>
      <li>The item was listed as new in box but arrived as a refurbished item.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap imitation.  </li>
      <li>It took a long time to find the right one, but now it&#x27;s like a new shaver all over again.</li>
      <li>Spend the extra $15 and get the real thing.</li>
      <li>Went back to old head and threw this one away!</li>
      <li>-  pulls a little but price does not hurt near as much</li>
      <li>I will try to see if I operating differently, slower motions or applying more pressure to test if something changes, but unfortunately I think that I will have give up and buy a new shaver, the original part is as expensive as the shaver and clearly the alternatives are not satisfactory.</li>

<li> Feels a little coarser / rougher than the factory replacement blades but does the trick.  </li>
<li> , I returned it because I probably would have gotten a closer shave with an old rusty shaving blade, didn&#x27;t work worth a crap!!!</li>
<li> Cheap piece of crap from China!!!!!!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
<li> I wasted my money.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that this item was made in the Peoples Republic, but in fact, it works pretty well, I would say 3/4ths as well for a bit less than 1/2 the price of the brand name head, so</li>
<li> Very dull and pulls hair</li>
<li> After-market - not totally happy tho it will do the job.</li>

    <li> Works well -  pulls a little but price does not hurt near as much</li>
    <li> I used the first of two shaving heads for about three months before the plastic around the head broke. I am using the second head, just hope it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Does not cut very well.</li>
    <li> Just not a quality replacement, clogs and dulls much faster that original manufactured equipment.  Did fit and the price was much better, but not going to be my replacement again.</li>
    <li> This RQ 12 replacement head is not what I was looking for.  The blades are dull and don&#x27;t cut as good as the old ones.  The price was right, how ever the product wasn&#x27;t....Jon</li>
    <li> more than what i hoped for  but just for the record, i found that the new replacement head was a little bit bigger than my original one, and therefore, the protection plastic cover will not fit.(shaver head will be unprotected unless you by a different one.)</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and tore up my face. I threw them away after four uses and bought a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Not the factory replacement but a clone (knock off).  Feels a little coarser / rougher than the factory replacement blades but does the trick.  No complaint about closeness.</li>
    <li> Price was good but sometimes you get what you pay for, I returned it because I probably would have gotten a closer shave with an old rusty shaving blade, didn&#x27;t work worth a crap!!! A Norelco RQ12+ is a direct replacement and works great...</li>
    <li> Very dull and pulls hair</li>
    <li> does not cut the hairs</li>
    <li> Not as good as the originals, with a tendency to easily break.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  Does not shave any better than old head it is replacing.  As others agree, it is a cheap clone that is not as good as original.  I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for the RQ10, and this product showed up as an option. It fits in place and runs, but the quality is not even close to the model that I had, I have to spend double the time to get the same shaving finish, this irritates my skin. I will try to see if I operating differently, slower motions or applying more pressure to test if something changes, but unfortunately I think that I will have give up and buy a new shaver, the original part is as expensive as the shaver and clearly the alternatives are not satisfactory.</li>

    <li> I was disappointed that this item was made in the Peoples Republic, but in fact, it works pretty well, I would say 3/4ths as well for a bit less than 1/2 the price of the brand name head, so, the advantage goes to China.</li>
    <li> The item was listed as new in box but arrived as a refurbished item. It did not shave as close as the used head I was replacing. Went back to old head and threw this one away!</li>
