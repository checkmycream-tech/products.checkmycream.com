    <li> I bought this plate a couple weeks ago, and it&#x27;s amazing! I really love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome plate. I have another set of discs, but this is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; plate on a regular basis. I get so many compliments, and everyone assumes that I&#x27;ve had them professionally done.  The designs pick up really well.</li>
    <li> I like these stamps because you can stamp varying images on all ten nails but they still all match.  These stamps are different than any on the market to date.  Stamped image is crisp and I found no defects when stamping various sections of the stamp.  Very nice product and not the last I will buy.  Good job MoYou keep them coming.</li>
    <li> Once again, MoYou has blown me away with their creativity and innovation in nail stamping/accessories.  With a variety of patterns and scenes, MoYou has something for everyone who enjoys DIY nail art.  And the images stamp very clearly, with every bit of the detail you see here.  The hardest part is just deciding which part of the plate to use!  I&#x27;ve recently ordered several more of these full plate designs from this company and I cannot wait to get stamping with them!</li>
    <li> These plates are wonderful!! I love them. I bought 7 different kinds and want to buy them all so I have the complete collection. I have noticed that if a soft stamper doesn&#x27;t work try the harder stamper. What works for me on the softer stamper is push straight down. But on the harder stamper you use a side to side technique. These plates are top rate. All came shipped in great shape too.</li>
    <li> Love this plate. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> So detailed, moyou plates are great!! Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> So intricate so beautiful and so unique.The plates are perfectly etched.:) A must have for any nail art fanatic.You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I just love MoYou.. I bought many plates from them &amp; I was blown away by the quality... It&#x27;s like stamping heaven... Perfect etching, original images &amp; amazing variety especially with those full plate images...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you MoYou, please keep doing these awesome plates :)</li>
