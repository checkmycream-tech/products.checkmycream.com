<li> It last a long time too, only need a little to spread on</li>

<li> The yellow logo makes my foundation makeup  too thick.</li>
<li> The fading is subtle and it&#x27;s not a miracle, but I also don&#x27;t have further breakouts when using.</li>
<li> It was so embarassing because it always looked like a had a little moustache or five o&#x27;clock shadow there.  </li>
<li> and I have little dis coloration on my face.</li>
<li> I decided to give it a try because I wanted to fade my freckles, some brown patches I had under my eye, as well as a few acne scars.</li>
<li> I also like the thicknesss and that they are not too heavy.</li>
<li> Sadly the product was not good for me.  </li>
<li> I became terribly allergic and developed blisters everywhere!</li>
<li> I saw my family after being away for a few months and they were shocked about the difference in my skin tone.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed I did not get the facial cream.  </li>
<li> I was expecting it to smell like a foot or worse, BUT IT DOESNT SMELL!  </li>

    <li> The delivery and service were great.  Sadly the product was not good for me.  I became terribly allergic and developed blisters everywhere!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer and fade cream</li>
    <li> I decided to try Esoterica before turning to a dermatologist.  I am so glad I did.  I just started using the product and already notice a change after 2 days!  Maybe I am just wishing, and I should have taken a before picture, but I really feel this is making a difference.  I was a bit worried about all the comments about the \\&quot;smell\\&quot;.  I was expecting it to smell like a foot or worse, BUT IT DOESNT SMELL!  In fact, the scent is very pleasant and smells refreshing.  But I guess everyone is entitled to their opinions...I will continue to use this and hope my skin keeps getting lighter and more even toned!</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal! I had some darker spots on my fact and around my eyes and after a month of usage its all gone.  Also, it makes my skin smoother. I saw my family after being away for a few months and they were shocked about the difference in my skin tone.  Beautiful!</li>
    <li> On time and good product as well</li>
    <li> no change in skin tone</li>
    <li> This product shipped fast, thank you! I wish the scent was a little more pleasing, but has been several days now and I guess I&#x27;m getting used to it. The cream feels good on my skin. My skin tends to look a little oily after a few hours, so sometimes I wash my face and then apply more. I use this in conjunction with the Esoterica Facial Cream for Night Time as well. I am see very slight results so far and think this may actually work on my dark spots long term.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Amazon is the only place that ships it for a good price, great for dark skinned females. I have been using this product for years and I have little dis coloration on my face.</li>
    <li> I had melasma on my upper lip due to oral contraceptives.  Had no idea what it was until I started reading articles online.  It was so embarassing because it always looked like a had a little moustache or five o&#x27;clock shadow there.  This product (used in conjunction with the nighttime product) worked wonders!  I would wash my face &amp; then gently rub it in and give it a couple of minutes to soak in before applying lotion, makeup, etc.  Has no odor whatsoever.  It took about 2-3 months of doing this morning and night to fully go away but sooo worth it if you do have a medical problem like I did, hooray!</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine.  My complexion has improved.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for over 35 years. They work for me. I use daily. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It work better than on my skin. All the other fantasy brand name strip my skin of it natural oil. I would recommend this to anyone who want a clear skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I think the ingredience has changed. I&#x27;ve been looking for it, and finally found it, at Amozon</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, price ok. And product really does lighten your skin and, removes dark circles and spots but you must use it twice and, be patient.. Can&#x27;t find product in regular stores anymore.. thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I order the pink day cream. Instead, the day cream with sun screen yellow logo sent. I am stocked sending it back due to my work schedule.  I am currently using one of it. I will definitely review the product.  I miss the pink logo face cream because it makes my make up flawless.  The yellow logo makes my foundation makeup  too thick.</li>
    <li> It really works and is not too greasy. I like how it feels in the skin and the soft scent. My sister tried it too and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I ordered Esoterica facial cream, but what I received was regular esoterica cream.  I was very disappointed I did not get the facial cream.  I like the products but I already had the regular cream.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR YOUR SKIN WITH CONSISTENT USE. I JUST PURCHASE ANOTHER JAR OF THIS CREAM.</li>
    <li> I love this version of this product.  The night and SPF versions are a bit sticky.  This goes on well and feels great.  The fading is subtle and it&#x27;s not a miracle, but I also don&#x27;t have further breakouts when using.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for over 30 yrs.  It last a long time too, only need a little to spread on</li>
    <li> A Good product to use</li>
    <li> Maybe it would of worked better if I would of exfoliate first so this cream could penetrate better. I&#x27;m not for sure if it woukd of made a difference or not. It was a better moisturizer than fade cream. I didn&#x27;t make me break out so that was a plus.</li>
    <li> Esoterica keeps my skin moist and safe from the sun. Excellent if you have dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for over ten years.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s wonderful!...i&#x27;m already seeing results...it&#x27;s only been two weeks!...i&#x27;ve recommende it to my beautician and coworkers...three others have already ordered</li>
    <li> I love this fragranonce and they don&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or. sticky.  I also like the thicknesss and that they are not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I have used esoterica cream since I was a teenager, it still does the trick on freckles!</li>
    <li> this cream is a great cream that ive used for many many many years. its always taken care of my skin and kept the scares off my face</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results!</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I decided to give it a try because I wanted to fade my freckles, some brown patches I had under my eye, as well as a few acne scars. Don&#x27;t expect results right away, because it does take some time. I really started to see results after about a month. Be aware that this cream may cause acne, depending on your skin type of course. I have really sensitive skin, so this caused a small outbreak of acne around my cheeks and nose. HOWEVER, after using it twice daily for a few weeks, my skin got used to it and it no longer causes me to break out. I found that it works best if applied with a cotton ball. Using my fingers just caused more oil, which meant more acne and oily skin. Now that I have been using this for a little over a month, I have seen an amazing improvement.

It also faded the darkness under my eyes, and made my skin have an even tone and look bright and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this cream again. Very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time,it&#x27;s work on my face since I started using it. Yes it&#x27;s lightens my dark or brownish on my face, I really like it.</li>
