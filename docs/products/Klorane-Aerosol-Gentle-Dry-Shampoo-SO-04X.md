      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I have ever used!</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
      <li>It is light but creates volume in the hair.</li>
      <li>It also has a very mild scent - you notice a clean smell when you spray it on, but then the scent is gone and you don&#x27;t smell it all day.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time using dry shampoo, and I have to say that I was quite impressed!  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to try it out</li>
      <li>Although it is a bit pricey, it&#x27;s still worth it to me!</li>
      <li>It just looks clean and shiny.  </li>
      <li>When I received the full sized bottle</li>
      <li>This was only fair.</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
      <li>Has the normal white residue at first but brushes/rubs out easily and has a nice refreshing smell to it!</li>
      <li>The scent is inoffensive and dissipates so quickly.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair with light blonde highlights and I love the way my hair feels, looks and smells after using this product.</li>
      <li>May not be great for girls with dark hair.</li>
      <li>But it absorbs within 20 minutes and a quick brush through, while I take a shower, and then my hair looks freshly washed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only bummed it took me so long to discover this wonderful product!</li>
      <li>A good dry shampoo gives it volume and oomph.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This was affordable, and I love that it&#x27;s a natural product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this one is, in my opinion, top notch.</li>
      <li>it shows up kind of white in my hair.</li>
      <li>Good formula but only good for a few uses.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t exactly the most amazing product, but it brings body to my hair for a few hours after applying in the morning.</li>
      <li>The seller did right by me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos, and I believe this is the absolute best.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft and clean!</li>
      <li>: Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Things to note: The aerosol comes out in a pretty powerful burst.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I enjoy that I can feel more confident with some body to my hair and can try some new hairstyles that the texture of my hair previously did not allow.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and lays flat on my head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting much better multiple uses from this non-aerosol version of the product, and will buy it again.  </li>
      <li>only downside not as many uses as I had hoped for but</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo hands down!</li>
      <li>I like this dry shampoo; it works great on my blonde hair.</li>
      <li>This is a Great dry shampoo, my hair feels bouncy, gives a blow dry look to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about this dry shampoo, but I don&#x27;t get what the fuss is about.</li>
      <li>The smell is much more tolerable and a bottle of baby powder lasts a lot longer than a bottle of dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t mess with the color of your hair and doesn&#x27;t flake and it smells nice.</li>
      <li>After a few decades of not believing that an ideal dry shampoo existed, I decided to canvas the market, try a handful of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; ones out, and prove to myself whether a good dry shampoo was possible.  </li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo so much.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be a bigger fan, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this!</li>
      <li>If I spray too much, it gives my hair a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feel until I brush it</li>
      <li>Too much powder in it.</li>
      <li>It seems to run out fast.</li>
      <li>I dont&#x27; care too much for the chemical smell it leaves in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I apply this by bending forward, spraying, and gently scrubbing my fingers through my hair.</li>
      <li>This really extends the time between shampoos.</li>
      <li>Hands down best dry shampoo ever, I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
      <li>Unlike other brands, it doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; or like hairspray; it doesn&#x27;t leave a brown powder residue on my scalp; and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking still oily but with more product in it.  </li>
      <li>more of a plus - it actually makes my fine hair look and feel a little bit thicker.</li>
      <li>It was more than i expected, very natural look after you spray it on your hair and comb it, i&#x27;ve tried others and they leave your hair looking opaque and stiff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It has an extremely light sent, leaves my hair fluffy and clean without all the excess white residue.</li>
      <li>I have tried several types of Dry Shampoo and this brand is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I use dry shampoo because my blonde hair is very fine and tends to lay flat.</li>
      <li>i have tried other spray dry shampoos and this seemed slightly better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. The only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found that works without white residue</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have bought a three pack since. It is light but creates volume in the hair. Has the normal white residue at first but brushes/rubs out easily and has a nice refreshing smell to it!</li>
    <li> this dry shampoo smells great and adds remarkable volume.  I have incredibly flat, sleek hair that gets oily after a few hours, I feel in love with this dry shampoo after trying a travel-sized sample at sephora.  When I received the full sized bottle I was disappointed that the powder leaked everywhere and I only got one use out of it.</li>
    <li> This was different than what I&#x27;ve been ordering at the Klorane site. Too much powder in it. Not the same. Won&#x27;t order from again, will stick to Klorane site.</li>
    <li> great buy! This is my second time purchasing this product...This has saved me lots of time when I&#x27;m running late for work or meeting with friends and don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry my hair...I have blonde hair and the spray is white in color so it blends in well after brushing it out...not sure how well it does on darker hues....only downside not as many uses as I had hoped for but still a great product</li>
    <li> I saw glowing reviews so decided to try.  This was only fair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about this dry shampoo, but I don&#x27;t get what the fuss is about. It doesn&#x27;t work well for me at all, I don&#x27;t like the way it smells, and the bottle is tiny. Suave and Batiste work way better for me.</li>
    <li> Dry Shampoo was recommended to me by my hairdresser, because I wanted to try not shampooing my hair every day in the shower, as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s not good for my scalp or my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that I hate the smell and feel of greasy hair, and I wanted something that would prevent that if I didn&#x27;t wet shampoo every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product.  I can see how people like using it, it seems like a great product, it&#x27;s just not for me.  I feel more comfortable just keeping to my bad habits of washing my hair every day in the shower.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite dry shampoo! I do have blond hair. May not be great for girls with dark hair. Ps they are now selling this product at Anthropology.</li>
    <li> I love this product and think it is one of the best dry shampoos I have tried. My only complaint is that I go through a bottle very quickly</li>
    <li> Still leaves a white residue but works great!</li>
    <li> It was more than i expected, very natural look after you spray it on your hair and comb it, i&#x27;ve tried others and they leave your hair looking opaque and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;i think is the oatmeal what makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
    <li> I have tried several types of Dry Shampoo and this brand is by far my favorite. I have fine hair with light blonde highlights and I love the way my hair feels, looks and smells after using this product. Other products tend to weigh my hair down but this one didn&#x27;t have that affect.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos, and I believe this is the absolute best.  It does go on powdery, but you leave it for a few minutes and then brush it out, and it actually DOES BRUSH OUT.  Others I&#x27;ve tried, you can&#x27;t get that powdery look out of your roots, especially if you have dark hair.  This stuff actually does disappear, or at least, I don&#x27;t see it, and that is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more of a plus - it actually makes my fine hair look and feel a little bit thicker. And manageable.  My hair looks better on the days I use this, versus the days I wash my hair in the shower.  And it totally, 100% eliminates the greasy look some of us get with 2nd day hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I&#x27;m sold.  Planning to stock up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the aerosol and this version of Klorane&#x27;s dry shampoo.  I found the aerosol over-pressurized and hard to control; then the nozzle failed and leaked, giving me one use and then a worthless,  air polluting can at a bad price per use.  I prefer this method of delivery.  It takes a few shots to get the right dispersal over your head, but be patient and follow the bottle directions.  I&#x27;m getting much better multiple uses from this non-aerosol version of the product, and will buy it again.  I have fine, dark blonde hair going gray, so I like the extra volume this gives my hair and don&#x27;t have an issue with white residue.  Brunettes are probably going to have to do a lot of brushing to get the powder out.  It blends on lighter hair.  When I am late for work, this is my go-to product to get out the door looking presentable.</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo; it works great on my blonde hair. It&#x27;s helpful when you&#x27;re busy and can&#x27;t wash your hair one day. I use it sporadically and it does the job. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other brands, so I can&#x27;t really draw a comparison, but I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> just okay. i have tried other spray dry shampoos and this seemed slightly better. but i got the oscar blandi dry shampoo and that is by the the best i&#x27;ve ever tried. i got them both at the same time and i just don&#x27;t use this as it pales in comparison to the oscar blandi powder.</li>
    <li> Highly disappointed. I was so excited to try it out but the bottle was non-functional and empty. Wasted my money on this one. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice product but just pricey</li>
    <li> Love this.. only wish it came in colors (my hair is dark) bc it shows up kind of white in my hair. Great scent though!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far.  My favorite thing about it is the scent.  I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Overall I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Things to note: The aerosol comes out in a pretty powerful burst. This product also leaves the typical dry shampoo white powder marks.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It refreshes my hair and gives me an extra day or two between shampoos.  Especially helpful in the heat!</li>
    <li> I gave this dry shampoo 3 stars. I thought it would be really super duper after reading some of the other reviews here and on other sites. I use dry shampoo because my blonde hair is very fine and tends to lay flat. A good dry shampoo gives it volume and oomph.&lt;br /&gt;This one didn&#x27;t do the trick. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo so much. I&#x27;ve tried herbal essences, tresseme, and batiste. This one is a clear winner. It leaves no visible residue with almost no stiffness but still adding volume. It literally looks like I just washed my hair. (I have straight thin hair). The scent is really mellow and fresh too, not nauseatingly artificial like some other brands. The only complaint I have is that my can was dented when I received it, and the product would not spray out continuously. I went through it in about 7-8 uses. For the price, it&#x27;s not exactly a bargain. I would go through 1 can per week if I could. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos and this one is, in my opinion, top notch. I highly recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t mess with the color of your hair and doesn&#x27;t flake and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> NO!  I used it ONE TIME, and it didn&#x27;t work after that!  IT WAS USELESS!  I believe the can was completely EMPTY!!  HORRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> After a few decades of not believing that an ideal dry shampoo existed, I decided to canvas the market, try a handful of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; ones out, and prove to myself whether a good dry shampoo was possible.  I am completely amazed at the results from this little can.  I have fine hair, somewhere between blonde and brown, and rather oily skin - which makes my hair look dirty along my hairline within 24 hours (though at least not 12 hours anymore, like when I was a teenager).  This dry shampoo sprays on visibly, with a little white coating, so that you can see where it has gone and where you still need to hit.  But it absorbs within 20 minutes and a quick brush through, while I take a shower, and then my hair looks freshly washed.  Unlike other brands, it doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; or like hairspray; it doesn&#x27;t leave a brown powder residue on my scalp; and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking still oily but with more product in it.  It just looks clean and shiny.  It also has a very mild scent - you notice a clean smell when you spray it on, but then the scent is gone and you don&#x27;t smell it all day.  And best of all, your hair feels clean to the touch.  I couldn&#x27;t be a bigger fan, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this!</li>
    <li> This is a Great dry shampoo, my hair feels bouncy, gives a blow dry look to it.Smells ok, good for oily hair.</li>
    <li> I got one as a sample 1.7 oz/50 ml. I had tried one other (just once though) but this one really impressed me. It comes out in a High-powered Spray with not much scent. The scent is inoffensive and dissipates so quickly. It&#x27;s a spray powder. Brush and go. I LOVE it! I&#x27;d definitely buy this. No doubt.</li>
    <li> I was able to skip shampooing three times and my hair still looked and smelled amazing with this product! Usually I&#x27;m oily immediately within the first day of not shampooing. ( I have thick, wavy, auburn hair) I have noticed a definite difference in my hairs health since I have not been over shampooing. I&#x27;m only bummed it took me so long to discover this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! Smells great and works well. Makes my hair feel soft and clean! If you spray a lot it shows as white when you spray it on but goes away after you brush it through and it works into your hair.</li>
    <li> Okay so I did read the reviews by brunettes like myself. yes it does make your hair white BUT as the instructions say. BRUSH your hair after 2 minutes. its amazing! its saved my life seriously. I get last minute meetings I have to rush to and I&#x27;d be totally in between washes. I&#x27;m not doing the embarrassed bun anymore.</li>
    <li> Although a little pricey, it works better than other dry shampoos.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Good formula but only good for a few uses. It seems to run out fast.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo hands down! I had once given up on using dry shampoo because the smell of most dry shampoos are absolutely horrific! So I had reverted to using baby powder in my hair on those off days. The smell is much more tolerable and a bottle of baby powder lasts a lot longer than a bottle of dry shampoo. Anyhow, I came across this Klorane bottle in my monthly Ipsy bag. At first glance I was reluctant after all my bad history of dry shampoos but I gave it a whirl anyway. To my surprise this is the best product that has entered my bathroom. It has an extremely light sent, leaves my hair fluffy and clean without all the excess white residue. Hands down best dry shampoo ever, I&#x27;m never going back! Although it is a bit pricey, it&#x27;s still worth it to me!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I have ever used ! Keep re-ordering it !</li>
    <li> This was my first time using dry shampoo, and I have to say that I was quite impressed!  This was affordable, and I love that it&#x27;s a natural product!</li>
    <li> I literally used this product ONCE on very short hair and the can was empty! Definitely not worth the money!</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and lays flat on my head. I have shoulder length blond hair that sometimes looks greasy and stringy even after just washing and drying. I have tried various products to try to bring life and body to my hair and found what I was looking for in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t exactly the most amazing product, but it brings body to my hair for a few hours after applying in the morning. I bring it with me through out the day at times to &amp;#34;refluff&amp;#34; my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I apply this by bending forward, spraying, and gently scrubbing my fingers through my hair. My roots are lifted.&lt;br /&gt;2. It makes my ponytail look fuller for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;3. It seems to be invisible in my blond hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. Bobby pins seem to actually stick in my hair with this product!&lt;br /&gt;5. As long as I reapply this every few hours, my hair does not get greasy or stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. If I spray too much, it gives my hair a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feel until I brush it out.&lt;br /&gt;2. It only lasts a few hours for up and down styles.&lt;br /&gt;3. I dont&#x27; care too much for the chemical smell it leaves in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I enjoy that I can feel more confident with some body to my hair and can try some new hairstyles that the texture of my hair previously did not allow. I have bought this item twice and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo there is! It does not weight hair down, or feel chalky all day long like most other brands.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised (held out no hope, actually) when I tried this Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo, and it seemed to really make a difference when I had absolutely NO TIME to wash my oily hair! Now, it doesn&#x27;t make it look like I just washed it, but when I am desperate, ANY improvement is greatly appreciated. My hair looked better. I recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is suppose to be top of the line when it comes to dry shampoos, I liked but I don&#x27;t see a big difference between this product and what was in the article as the worse dry shampoo.  I have a feeling all dry shampoos are created equal.  Not sure if it is worth the extra money.  My hair looks good</li>
    <li> I have brown hair and it changes the color of my hair and it&#x27;s very obvious where I&#x27;ve sprayed this and what my natural hair is</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! after trying this for the first time, i have never used another dry shampoo! I have fine oily hair and this works amazing</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have tried.  I use this because my hair is thinning and it adds texture and volume.</li>
    <li> The best dry shampoo out there!  Use it before going to bed and your hair will look freshly washed with great volume in the morning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I really can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I have long, thick hair, and I don&#x27;t have the time or the desire to wash it frequently. This really extends the time between shampoos. Takes away the oily roots. I divide my hair into sections and spray directly at the roots. Then I massage it in, and brush it out. I have dark hair, and you can&#x27;t see anything after I brush it. Awesome!</li>
    <li> The seller did right by me. Very impressive.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product!!! After spraying it on, I let it sit for a few minutes, then brush my hair thoroughly, and finally use a blow dryer for a few seconds. I finish by using a dry conditioner on my ends and brushing that out a bit. My hair looks better and is more manageable using this product than on m first-day washing. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> This is the only dry shampoo that works on me after tried 3 other brands. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residual after brush, and adds a little volume to the hair. Plus , the scent is pleasant.</li>
