<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love the results of this...face feels so much better than it used to!!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing to happen to my face since sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge, it cleanses the skin without being abrasive</li>
    <li> I have found using this Konjac Sponge to be addicting.  At first glance it looks very different from anything I had ever used on my face, but after letting it soak in some warm water, it looked a lot more familiar.  I love how it leaves my skin feeling - it seems to get all of the rough patches off and make my skin so much softer.  I will be using Konjac Sponges on my face every day from here out!</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge! When it arrived, I was like- &amp;#34;What the heck?&amp;#34; it&#x27;s hard as a rock! But it just needs to soak in water , and it works great! I have gotten 2 more!</li>
    <li> Best facial sponge ever:)!</li>
    <li> purSOL Konjack  facial sponge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purSOL facial sponge arrives small and very firm. You soak it and you are ready for your chemical free natural sponge usage. PurSOL Konjack is soft but has just enough abrasiveness that it will exfoliate skin. It is natural. A real fiber from the root of the Konjack plant. You can use it with or without a cleanser. I was offered this product at discount to evaluate and offer my option, an honest one. This looked interesting because it is a natural, biodegradable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to simplify my skin care regime and use less products that pollute the water once they go down the drain. Changing from chemicals to using natural products on my skin. I was able to eliminate exfoliating cream, cleanser and even toner. At times I am too tired and lazy to have more than one step to care for my skin before bed. It comes with a suction hook so it frees up your counter space. Easy to take with for an overnight or travel. Any instructions or product info you need are printed on the box.</li>
    <li> This sponge was quite small when I got it, but when hydrated it grew to the size of my palm. It has a nice soft spongy texture and has been working out well to use on my face. It comes with a string to hang from and hook. I wanted to wait a few weeks to do review to make sure string didn&#x27;t fall out or sponge didn&#x27;t fall apart, but I have no complaints. It has been several weeks and still good as new.</li>
    <li> Received at discount for review i soaked the sponge then used its nice to wash my face with very soft it helps to have a sponge to get to all the problem areas.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! So many great reviews that say it all! Basically looks can be deceiving Do not let your first glance or fell be your last. After your 45 sec wait you will be glad you tried it. You can feel the differance the very first time you use it!! Gotta love nature!! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love my Konjac Sponge,this is the first time I got the original and I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to like it,so I was excited and watching for it to arrive in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I get the charcoal ones,but I thought why not change it up a bit. I opened my mail today and to my surprise it as there and it arrived super fast:) I was so happy and ready to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it before going to bed tonight. As many of you might know the Konjac Sponge comes hard and not soft,You put it in water and it softens up very fast. I added soap to my face and got my sponge wet and applied the sponge to my face to rub in my soap and to exfoliate my face. I was so happy with it. It is so soft and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;When I was done I did exactly what I have done with the charcoal ones and hung my sponge up with the hook that it comes with to let it dry out. I&#x27;m so impressed with it and loved how well it works and feels on my face. I really recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s perfect for the whole family!!&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little to no cost to me to give my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I hope my review help you out. They truly are wonderful!! My daughter has her own and so does her boyfriend. Our whole family loves them!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little beauty product. It exfoliates gently and effectively for ultra smooth skin. I have noticed a big improvement in my skin since using it, especial with less break outs. Great!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauty supplies, will be replacing these for a long time. Love how your face feels afterwards and that it has a light alkalizing effect. Much better than a microfiber cloth etc. I have it hanging on my bathroom mirror. Very very impressed! I can see giving this gem as gifts.</li>
    <li> Amazing ! I have mature skin and using the oil cleaning method. I&#x27;m taking coconut oil and rubbing it on my face, then get in the warm shower and use this wonderful natural sponge and my face is clean, soft and hydrated 😊</li>
    <li> This little sponge works great with your favorite cleanser. The Konjac sponge is all natural, biodegradable and chemical free. When you first receive your Konjac facial sponge it is hard and ruff but when it is soaked in water for a few minutes it puffs up and is completely soft and read to use. It is gentle on your skin and leaves in feeling soft. Also nice that it comes with a suction cup hook so you can hang to dry.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!  It cleans so very well and leaves my face so soft and smooth. Will definitely buy again!!  I have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter to use since she has pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is 100% natural, and say&#x27;s it will improve skin texture, makes skin brighter, removes impurities and toxins, and you can use this just with water or a little dab of your facial cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I love that Amazon has so many great promotions, I was able to score this at a great discount.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you will notice is that the Konjac Sponge comes shrink wrapped, so you have to cut the plastic off, then soak the sponge in a bowl of water to re-hydrate it.&lt;br /&gt;Once it is fully hydrated again, it is ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter tried it first without and cleanser on the sponge. It seemed to work nicely, it was gentle to her skin. Then she tried it with about a peas size of her usual face soap, and boy did it lather up!&lt;br /&gt;When you  rinse the facial sponge out, do not wring it out, press it between both hands to gently squeeze the water/cleanser out of it. Rinse thoroughly, and hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge has a built in string for hanging, and comes with a suction cup hook to hang it from to dry.&lt;br /&gt;If by change it dries out completely between uses, just re-soak it again,and it&#x27;s ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;They do recommend sanitizing it once a week by placing in boiling water or microwaving the sponge for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponges should be replaced every 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be looking into the charcoal Konjac sponge for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this facial sponge. You will get great results naturally!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from a friend and I really love it. It leaves my face feeling really soft and clean, my pores are looking so nice after using this. It does take about 3 days to fully dry out,  it is easy to hold, and does not feel weird when using it. I do use it with a facial cleanser though, a very mild one, as I have acne and need to use more than just this sponge to keep my face clear. But, even after the first use of this sponge, you can notice a difference in the look and feel of your face! I am in love with this sponge.</li>
    <li> Just tried it. It&#x27;s very soft. It feels clean. My skin is very sensitive and this is OK with my skin. I don&#x27;t need harsh scrubs. This one does the job.</li>
    <li> I had never used one of these before but had heard so many good things about it, I just had to try it! When the sponge arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it as I had heard all the many wonderful benefits of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up the sponge, I wet it under the faucet for a few minutes until it was completely soft. Once soft, I added some of my cleanser to it and started smoothing it over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found is that it is completely luxurious and feels so soft and fantastic on your skin. You feel like you&#x27;re at the spa using it!  I found it incredibly relaxing and plan on getting one to keep by my bathtub to use when soaking in a nice relaxing bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smoothed it around my skin for a few minutes and was amazed with how well it lathered up my cleanser too. I found you only need a little bit of cleanser when using this sponge with it, so it will save you money on product too! When drying, I also found that it did an amazing job of removing all of my makeup! When using my cleanser alone, I normally notice some spots I&#x27;ve missed when I wipe my face with my white towel and see makeup pop up on it. I didn&#x27;t get any makeup on my towel when using this sponge (besides a little around the hair line). I thought this was pretty amazing. It really got my skin super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference I noticed and why I will keep buying this wonderful sponge from now on, is how incredibly soft, supple, and smooth my skin felt after washing with this sponge. Its totally noticeable! I felt my skin afterwards and it felt so soft and plump. This sponge works as an amazing super gentle exfoliator fabulous for all skin types, even sensitive skin, to really remove the dirt, and remove all the nasty dead skin cells too, leaving you with the softest, smoothest skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used  lot of exfoliators in my day, but the gentle softness this sponge left my skin with is beyond anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before. I absolutely love how wonderful my skin feels after using this amazing cleansing sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have really dry skin and felt like this product not only left my skin feeling smoother and softer, but also feeling more moisturized too! I normally have to run to my moisturizer after washing because my face begins tightening up and drying out right away, but not with this sponge! My face felt so nice and moisturized, I took my time adding my moisturizer and my skin never felt tight or dry once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love that its biodegradable and after a few months of use, you can compost this sponge. It is also free of parabens, sulphates, and phthalates, so you know you&#x27;re doing good for your skin when using this super gentle, organic product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With extended use you can also expend to find younger-looking skin too as it promotes cell growth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m head over heels for this sponge and will certainly be continuing to use it over and over again! I love how smooth and soft my skin feels, and especially the nice glow it brings to my skin right away after using it! I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy, younger-looking, smoother, softer skin!kin feels after using this amazing cleansing sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have really dry skin and felt like this product not only left my skin feeling smoother and softer, but also feeling more moisturized too!

    <li> Washing my face with purSol&#x27;s Original Konjac Sponge is such a soothing and enjoyable experience, and it leaves my face feeling refreshed and squeaky clean.  This little sponge is only about the size of a half dollar and hard as stone when it arrives in its pretty cardboard box, so I wondered is this all there is to it?  Well, hardly! After reading the simple to use instructions on the back of the box I filled a small bowl with warm water and set the sponge aside in it for a few minutes as I got ready to shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within moments the sponge had soaked up its fill of water and had grown to triple the size it was when dry. It has a handy string attached to two edges which is supposed to be used when you hang the sponge up to dry on the enclosed suction hook, but I also found that it worked very well for me to loop my fingers through to hold the sponge with as I washed. The vegetable fibers of the Konjac root that this sponge is made of become soft when soaked in water and the sponge now felt cushiony rather than hard. I added a small amount of my usual Vitamin C facial cleanser to the sponge and gently began to scrub my face using a circular motion. I could feel the plant fibers gently scrubbing and exfoliating my face. The sponge was soft though so it didn&#x27;t feel the least bit irritating - it felt totally relaxing.  When I was finished and rinsed off my face felt squeaky clean and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more squeezing or using harsh facial scrubs to clear up my blackheads - this gentle sponge helps clear up existing blackheads as well as exfoliates dead skin which relieves the pore clogging issues that cause blackheads. Not only that but using it will tighten up my pores again and encourage new skin growth to give me a better complexion.  I&#x27;m 100% sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is all natural, made entirely of the fibers of the Konjac plant, a renewable resource, it&#x27;s eco friendly, biodegradable, cruelty free, and contains no additives whatsoever.  When you&#x27;re done with it you can just compost it and let it enrich your soil.  Natural goodness and it feels great to use - like being at an expensive spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with this sponge at no cost for evaluation purposes. I did not promise to give a review but made it clear that if I did review it my review would be completely honest and unbiased. My review of this sponge is based entirely on my examination of the sponge and my personal experience using the sponge itself.done with it you can just compost it and let it enrich your soil.

    <li> works as described. i just wish i used it more.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these now. The first one crumbled and basically fell apart after 2-3 weeks although I followed all the instructions: squeezed it out, hung it up to dry etc. The seller kindly sent another one as I contacted them direct before writing the review. Anyway, the second sponge behaved just the same way as the first one. In fact, it degraded right around where the location of the string used for hanging, and then continued. Very disappointing and definitely not $10 worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of these appeared to offer any particular benefits to  my skin cleaning regimen. I have other sponges that work just as well and  have lasted for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very interesting natural sponge.</li>
    <li> leaves skin feeling soft. lathers really well. very convenient to hang and dry with its suction cup</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges are such a phenomenal way to gently exfoliate skin and I am really excited about this one. I love that these sponges are natural and eco-friendly. They also do a great job in helping get the gunk out of my pores and keeping them clear. They can even be used without a separate cleanser! The small size of this sponge is perfect, allowing me to easily clean all the nook and crannies of my face. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this facial sponge when u first got it and nowi regret it! I absolutely love it and have noticed a difference in how my skin looks and feels since I started using it. I would recommend these to anyone and will be buying more for my daughters!</li>
    <li> Best konjac sponge that I have used thus far...and I have used a few. What i like most about this product is the pure white color, and firm compact design. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I received this Konjac Sponge for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. This sponge was much smaller than I expected when it arrived, about the size of a golf ball cut in half. It came dried, hard and wrapped in plastic inside a cardboard box as shown in the Amazon description picture. After placing it in water to soak for about 5-10 minutes it almost doubled in size to just slightly smaller than a regular baseball cut in half. It&#x27;s rounded on one side and flat on the other. It has a string coming out of it so that you can hang it. It also came with a suction cup with a hook that it can be hung off of. I found the suction cup to be useless, I tried repeatedly to hang the suction cup but it kept losing its suction within minutes and falling back into the tub. It is not our tub/shower enclosure because I have used other suction cups that held heavier things with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how this sponge feels against my face and how well it works with whatever facial cleaner I want to use with it. I don&#x27;t feel that for my skin by itself without a cleanser it would not do any good. I have combo skin and it might work fine on dry areas but it does nothing to the oily areas to rid me of the oils. It does work well in tandem with my cleanser though so I will continue to use it with that. I like how it gently exfoliates without scraping off half my skin because I do have sensitive skin so this feels nice but does help slightly rough up the dry areas to get the dead skin off without being overly abrasive like other exfoliators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did mark this down because I don&#x27;t think it can stand up to any of the claims of better cleaner looking skin without cleanser for most skin types. I really think the average person would have to use a cleanser with it. I don&#x27;t see improved skin texture and I honestly have no clue if it is removing toxins and impurities, my pores are all still the same large size they have always been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use mine until I feel it&#x27;s life is up, at this time I have used it for a couple of weeks with no problems at all with it holding up to regular use. I didn&#x27;t drop this is as low as three stars because I did like the sponge and it&#x27;s size. I like that it[&#x27;s flat and rounded. It fits well in my hand/fingers and I do like using it for cleaning my face and feel it is just the right size for me. I do like it better than some other Konjac sponges I have tried.continue to use mine until I feel it&#x27;s life is up, at this time I have used it for a couple of weeks with no problems at all with it holding up to regular use.

    <li> What a unique product!  So much gentler on my skin than most exfoliators.  I love that it is an all natural plant based product, and I liked the way my skin looked so fresh after cleansing.</li>
    <li> This sponge leaves your face feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This is nice gentle exfoliating sponge. I use it with Cetaphil when I wash my face and it looks great when I&#x27;m done. I love the packaging and that it came with a suction cup to hang the sponge from to dry. I love these facial sponges and will continue to use them. This is my second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will order more!</li>
    <li> At first, I was delighted with this product.  It feels better than anything I have ever used, I really mean that. It soaped up so well, I was just pumped at first.  But.....I was upset that it only lasted about 3 weeks.  A small hole started in it and I was hoping it could still be used.  Not so,.... the hole kept getting bigger and bigger until it just fell apart.</li>
    <li> Konjac beauty sponges are made from a moisture rich plant fiber. It is a natural product that helps balance the acidity of skin and oils. They are 100% all natural, eco-friendly and can be composted when your down using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge has a flat side and rounded side. And it does an excellent job of exfoliating and cleansing the face. The sponge is rock hard when you open the package, but after getting it wet, the sponge gets very squishy and soft. It re-hardened after each use and continues to work just fine. I use it with my facial cleanser every morning and it leaves my face looking healthy and refreshed!

She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product and I will definitely will be purchasing more of these when mine is worn down.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge!  Feels like you&#x27;re washing your face with a cupcake and you feel good about not using something too harsh that is going to pull your skin.  I would recommend boiling the sponge once a week as they advise, to keep it clean.  I also love that it came with a suction cup hook.  It&#x27;s totally necessary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Konjac sponge for about a week and love the way it feels.  It&#x27;s not like a typical exfoliating sponge.  The Konjac is a nice massaging sponge.  My face feels so good after I use it.  It gently exfoliates so my face doesn&#x27;t look red or feel raw after I cleanse.  Another benefit it that I&#x27;m using a lot less cleanser with the sponge.  A little bit worked into the sponge makes a good bit of lather.  This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. Is gets most of the makeup off. You still need another option also It&#x27;s great as it exfoliates the skin well.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial sponge. I comes in a cute little box. Take it out of the box and put water on the sponge and watch it expand, it expands a lot actually. I used the sponge last night in the shower and it help get the dirt off my face. I like that it has a piece of string on it so that I can hang it up after I use it. I love that the box is small and that it would go well in my traveling luggage when I fly on vacation. I think this would be a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great little sponge, I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion</li>
    <li> This sponge is amazing! I love, love, love it! It comes in a cute eco friendly box. It is packaged in plastic and is hard and rough at first. I followed the directions and soaked it in water for a couple of minutes. It expanded into a nice fluffy soft sponge ready to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge works great by itself or you can use it with your regular cleanser. It&#x27;s super soft, but still does a wonderful job exfoliating. You will definitely see a difference after use. It left my skin soft and supple. It also left it with a beautiful healthy glow. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my skin was until I used this sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes with its own suction cup hanger. Its keeps your sponge convenient and allows it to dry. It is all natural, which is awesome to me. It makes my skin feel and look great. I am happy to recieve this awesome sponge to review. I will definitely continue to use this in my every day cleansing routine. It would also would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> Better than expected !</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges have been my preferred facial cleansing tool for the last 6 months. My first one was a similar sponge from this same brand,Once again they have knocked it out of the park. The sponge arrives solid, as most Konjac sponges do, then quickly becomes soft after placing it in warm water. It exfoliates my skin, without being too rough. The added string and suction cup hook make this easily hangable in my shower. I really like that the sponge is non-irritating and that it is 100% natural. There are no harsh chemicals added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is super easy to use. When it arrives, place it in some warm water. It will become very soft and squishy. I like to apply my facial cleanser directly to the sponge then work it into my skin with circular motions. This is a brand that I have used and trust. The quality of the products has been consistently great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample received for testing, no other compensation received.*</li>
    <li> This sponge is my favorite. I am planning to try out their other varieties but this is my first Konjac Sponge and I really really like it. When completely soaked, the sponge feels edible, it has the real vegetable/fruit texture to it. It is also very soft; no matter how much I use it to massage my face, it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy, nor does it make my face look red. Goooood sponge. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, but this is a great little sponge that comes with a hanger to store vertically.  It is saving me lots of washcloths that get really stained from makeup removal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about. I was on the fence about buying this product, but I after reading all the great reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Yes, it is hard when I took it out of the package, but after placing it underwater for a few minutes, it became very soft. It does feel good on the face and it is not abrasive at all. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> I really like the konjac sponge. I have recently started using it and own about 4 of them each for different purposes. One for removing make up, other for my body, one for daily exfoliation and one for backup.&lt;br /&gt;I really really like it a lot. When it arrives , it will be as hard as rock almost. But just run it down the water and within 2 minutes it will become very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It really cleans the face well. After using it i can feel my skin become fresh and gentle and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;This product s made from 100% konjac root. It deeply cleanses the face and instantly makes you feel the difference as to how clean your face becomes.&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the charcoal color one hence the 4 star. I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> This sponge has worked wonders for my skin.. I will be repurchasing some more for my entire family to use.</li>
    <li> Feels good on your face, however is slightly small.</li>
    <li> Got my sponge today and I tested it right away. Just like the charcoal activated one, This sponge is really nice and soft once you soak it up with water. Rub it on your face with your favorite face wash and after rinsing, you can tell how smooth your face is! It&#x27;s like an instant gratification. honestly, I own facial brushes, italy towels and other face washing stuffs but this Konjac sponges are my favorite. No matter how hard you rub it on your face, it still goes on smooth and silky. Great product! I love it. If you have not tried one yet, buy it and you wont be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**got the product free in return of my honest opinion and review about it.**</li>
    <li> Nice way to treat your face.</li>
    <li> I really like these purSOL Konjac sponges. My skin has such a nice glow now. I have naturally large pores and this sponge and the purSOL Activated Charcoal Konjac sponge have decreased the size and appearance of my pores.  I don&#x27;t use any cleanser on my sponge just soak it and use it. (Every day) I&#x27;ve honestly had amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Works great for exfoliating my face.I have tried charcoals &amp; turmeric konjac sponges and fell in love with them.I seem this white one and definitely had to try it.It works the same way as the charcoal/turmeric konjac sponges work.It comes wrapped up and has a foam like feel to it when it arrives.You have to soak it in water for a few minutes until the sponge becomes soft.Once that is done you are ready for washing your face with it.I washed my face with this and it works just as I expected it to work.It really helps clean off the dead and dry skin with gentle exfoliation.It does not hurt or irritate it which is nice.The sponge is very small about maybe 2&amp;#34; or almost 2&amp;#34; in diameter.It expands when softened and comes with a string to hang up on the suction cup it gives you.I have been using it prior to putting my makeup on because of how well it gets my skin nice and smooth for application.I would definitely recommend it.You may use any cleaner you choose or if you don&#x27;t want to you can just use this alone.It naturally draws out toxins and impurities form your skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Complimentary sample provided for inspection &amp; my honest unbiased evaluation.</li>
    <li> Make sure that you note the size of the product before you purchase.  The BOX is only 2-1/2 x 2-1/2 x 1.  The sponge itself is less than 2 inches in diameter.  It is tiny.  I have not used it yet but it is smaller than I expected and I can believe the reviews that say it is tough to handle</li>
    <li> This facial sponge is fantastic and eco friendly. The sponge comes small, but after you let it sit in water it expands. The sponge really makes your face feel clean and smooth. There is no odor or odd smells that come from it. The sponge is nicely packaged and makes for a great gift.</li>
    <li> This little sponge, once soaked, feels very nice on my face.  It can be used with or without cleanser according to directions, however I only used it with a cleanser.  I like that it came with a little suction hook to hang for air drying.  The only downside is that you do have to soak it, so it&#x27;s a bit inconvenient for the shower.</li>
    <li> I like that you don&#x27;t need to use a cleanser with a Konjac sponge. My face is so oily I have to use something to clean it halfway through the day and this is a nice find.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a Konjac Sponge and I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try one sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is all natural.  I have a very sensitive face so I always have to be careful trying new things.  When I read this was vegan, cruelty free, biodegradable with nothing added I knew I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes in the box?  You get the sponge a long with a suction cup to attach to the shower wall so its convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time the directions state to soak the sponge for several minutes prior to use.  It puffed right up.  You can use it alone or with a face wash. I love the way the sponge feels when its moving across my face.  It really feels like you are really cleaning your skin. My skin feels so soft and feels brighter.  I am not really a big make up wearer so this is perfect addition to my routine.  My completion is so clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;re done you want to be sure to remove as much water from the sponge as you can.  I would recommend pressing against the shower wall then hang from the handy hook.  Keeps mildew down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I would most certainly recommend this product.  My face and skin have never looked better.  Clean and crisp feeling.  I was so ecstatic to be able to receive this sponge during a promotion period!  It has been such an amazing find!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for about a week. I think its okay but not the best way to cleanse my face. I wish it exfoliated a little better, i still have dry flaky skin on my face after cleansing. I did like the lather it created and it was easy to use. he hook it came with was also very convenient.</li>
    <li> Awesome product that I am using delay. I did not expect to fall in love with this product.</li>
    <li> I already purchased one of these for myself, the Konjac Sponge - Activated Charcoal - Facial Sponge (it&#x27;s the black one), and because I enjoy using it, I decided to get this one for my wife.  For intents and purposes, it&#x27;s the same as far as the eye can tell, except it&#x27;s smaller and obviously a different color.  However, it still provides the same skin care.  We don&#x27;t yet know how well its claims of tighter skin and deep cleansing work, but we do love how soft it is on the skin, how it is chemical-free, and, I know this will sound crazy, but how we can wash it and re-use it and then COMPOST it when we are finished.  There aren&#x27;t too many companies that blatantly encourage you to not just throw out their products but to compost them!  We love that! I considered giving it only 4 stars because I was a bit disappointed by the size of it compared to its charcoal counterpart, but since it appears to do the same kind of work, it gets all 5.</li>
    <li> My 2nd Konjac sponge, this time bought the white one. The 1st one (black) lasted about 6 months, didn&#x27;t use it everyday tough.&lt;br /&gt;You can see the difference right away. It&#x27;s part of my natural beauty routine now.</li>
    <li> this is a great product love it  works amazingly  my face has never looked better</li>
    <li> I receive this item and thought it was small but once I soaked it in water it got bigger, its not to rough bbut it leaves a nice soft finish on or face works great recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am really loving this sponge. It leaves my face so clean and it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product, it&#x27;s small but works very well.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. It is the perfect size and felt like my face was much more thoroughly cleaned without being abrasive. Nice that they included a hook as well just in case you didn&#x27;t have an extra.</li>
    <li> Product works as described and makes skin feel great, but I break out anytime I use it on my face. I must be sensitive to the root or the additive they use to create the elasticity of the sponge.</li>
    <li> I am so conflicted. I noticed that clean glow right after the first use. It felt like a perfect massage and left my face clean. But after no more the 2 weeks use, the sponge started cracking and got worse and worse. By the fourth week I had to trash it. I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. After each use I rinsed it and hung it to dry. I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. I must apologize because I loved how my felt after I used it.</li>
    <li> This is a strange sponge LOL but don&#x27;t be too nervous to try it. Once wet it enlarges and softens up. It&#x27;s strong enough to actually scrub but soft enough not to bother. I hope the end up making a large body sized one because that would be AWESOME to replace my loofah. Also, I didn&#x27;t know my cream cleanser could foam so much!! This sponge is really cool.</li>
    <li> So good at exfoliating gently.  The only thing is that because its a natural product it does wear out quicker that vs a man made product.  But you cannot be that it&#x27;s all natural.  For me, it gentle enough that i can use daily.</li>
    <li> Love it. Wasn&#x27;t sure what might arrive as I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this type of facial sponge. Just follow instructions - soak in water, sponge expands in size, very gentle on my VERY sensitive skin! Hang to dry with enclosed suction hook. Best part - 100% biodegradable &amp; compostable when it wears out. Mine isn&#x27;t even close to that point yet but being eco friendly will definitely make me a repeat buyer when time comes!</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge! It fits easily in my hand and gently exfoliates my skin. This facial sponge is gentle enough that I use it twice a day to cleanse my face. My preference is to add a little facial cleanser to the sponge then massage entire face. My face feels so much cleaner and looks much brighter since using this sponge. I love that a suction cup is included so you can hang it up to dry/air out.</li>
    <li> This sponge worked well. My wife uses it regularly and I believe I will be ordering more at some point.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of my face.  It is smoother feeling after using.</li>
    <li> The Konjac Sponge is a crucial part of my everyday skin care routine that I can no longer live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is that it does an excellent job of helping to eliminate the dirt and grime that are deeply set into my skin/pores and provides my skin with a extremely soft and clean surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this sponge multiple times a day and it holds up extremely well. I have used it for every day cleansing as well as for exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that is worth every penny that I will no longer live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to review this product for free in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> No complaints on the product, but I did expect it to be larger. It&#x27;s size is actually a benefit making it easier to use.</li>
    <li> This was smaller than I imagined, but it is actually the perfect size.  I love this, I keep in my shower (they provide a little hook to stick on the tile). It leaves your skin feeling refreshed without feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this sponge when I opened it up and inspected it but did what the instructions said and was impressed that it doubled it&#x27;s size and became so spongy and soft in about a minute by soaking it in water. Now I have adult breakouts so I chose to use the konjac sponge with my cleanser and I will say that when using a cleanser it doesn&#x27;t take as much product as you would normally use. I used my typical amount and it was way too much for the sponge. I used small circular motions all over my face and neck and it feels so good and cleansing on the face. I have noticed a little difference in not having as many breakouts since I started using this sponge. I prefer using this sponge now to cleanse my face as opposed to using a washcloth like I was before. I love having the hook to hang it on when your&#x27;re finished using it to let it dry out. These are so easy to use, clean, and sanitize. I have even gotten one for my husband now and he likes it just as well and I have noticed a big difference in his face not having as many blackheads across his nose. These sponges seem to last for a long time too so you don&#x27;t have to replace them often. Maybe once every 3-4 months depending on how well they are taken care of. I would definitely advise on adding this konjac sponge to anyones facial cleansing routine. It&#x27;s very worth it. I recieved this product for my most honest and unbiased inspection and review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This sponge has helped my skin. I have been having severely dry skin and have tried everything. After using this sponge a few times, I noticed I have less visibly dry spots. I was extremely happy! I highly recommend this sponge to anyone looking for something to help with their dry skin!</li>
    <li> Im getting ready to order another one. I am giving one to my daughter. It makes your face feel amazing.</li>
    <li> Nice product. I dont like using soap so this was perfect!</li>
    <li> This sponge feels great when you&#x27;re using it on your face.  It&#x27;s a pain if you forget to start it soaking right when you get in the shower because it does take a few minutes to soften up.  It&#x27;s worth those few minutes though!</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge, at first I was wondering whether it would really gently exfoliate my skin, because after wetting it it didn&#x27;t feel like it would scrub, but when I used it I could feel it exfoliating my face but gently, it cleans well, and sometimes almost feels like a massage to my face, it also leave my face feeling very soft after use. This is a very nice natural product.</li>
    <li> Best product for your face. Feels absolutely amazing!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the Konjac Sponge by purSOL because I had heard it is good for your skin. I have very sensitive skin with occasional breakouts and many products out there just irritate my skin even more. I was anxious to get the Konjac Sponge, but when it came and I opened the box here was this tiny hard sponge. Of course I was wondering how that little sponge would do any good for my skin especially being hard and rough. When I let it soak in warm water for about 50 seconds the sponge grew to be much larger...approximately 3 times larger. It felt so good on my face as I gently cleansed it. After I was done washing my face it felt so soft and refreshed. This is no ordinary sponge by any means!  When I was done with sponge I just squeezed it between my hands to get the excess water out and hung it on the suction cup hook it came with. The directions tell you not to wring or twist the sponge out as it will ruin the fibers of the sponge and will become unusable. The Konjac Sponge is a 100% Natural Sponge, Eco-Friendly, Gentle Exfoliating, Deep Cleansing, Improves Skin Texture, Free of Chemicals, Parabens, Sulphates, Fragrances and Coloring. Good for Extra Sensitive Skin, Hypoallergenic, Cruelty Free, Vegan, Biodegradable, Naturally Sustainable. Overall I found this product to be quite refreshing and would recommend it to others. This my honest opinion after trying this product.</li>
    <li> Love the sponge itself. The string is essentially thread. It will not last.  My sensitive face loved the gentleness. This is a great beauty sponge.</li>
    <li> I personally think it is all PR a regular cleaning disc works just as good or maybe better.  Nice idea fluff up after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect facial scrub sponge. First it is completely organic. There are no harsh chemicals additives and it is free of parabens and sulphates. It&#x27;s also biodegradable so you can feel good about your green footprint.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is the perfect size for your face. It&#x27;s edges can get into the small nooks around your nose. It is big enough to hold on to and really clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator and cleaner. My skin feels so soft after use and my pours are visibly smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a plastic suction cup with a small hook so you can hang it to dry. The sponge has a piece of string attached to the back for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this sponge!!&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product at a promotional price to test and provide my honest unbiased feedback and opinions. All statements above are my own opinions.*</li>
    <li> perfect size for your palm, nice texture for a slight exfoliation. Love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> While on the hunt for a 100% vegan way to cleanse &amp; exfoliate, I was asked if I&#x27;d be willing to try this sponge at a one-time promotional discount-of course, I jumped at the chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved most about it is being able to use it with or without my favorite facial cleanser. It arrives hard &amp; scratchy feeling, but only takes a couple of minutes soaking in water to soften up enough to use. Make sure that it is completely dry before it&#x27;s used again; also, don&#x27;t wring it out or you&#x27;ll damage the fibers and dramatically decrease its shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a fantastic tool to keep in your beauty arsenal-it&#x27;s 100% natural and cruelty-free. You simply can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> it broke with a few uses O.Q</li>
    <li> I really love this sponge. it helps my dry skin considerably.</li>
    <li> This thing is so neat. I was intrigued and decided to give it a go. The price is great if you take into consideration the cost of a quality exfoliator product. This lasts MONTHS. You will actually save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the scoop. I was skeptical BUT it feels amazing on my skin. It&#x27;s so soft and gives a nice, light exfoliation... gentle enough for daily use. I think I&#x27;m hooked. I love the idea of avoiding all the chemical defoliators now.</li>
    <li> Love this!! It gets off all of the dead skin I have on my face. I have combination skin but from the dry winter and tow starting to tan my face had dried out and was flaky. The sponge removed all of the dead skin and wasn&#x27;t harsh feeling like some of the others I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> It lasted 3 days. After that it was tattered and unusable.</li>
    <li> Truly the BEST asset I have in my arsenal of acne defense products, and general overall healthy skin care. I started with the charcoal konjac sponge. Then tried their original. Now I just had the trio of: original, green tea, &amp; charcoal arrive today. I will write my review on the green tea konjac sponge, however I already know, its going to be another 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> These konjac sponges are my new favorite thing in life. I have started using them just within the past couple months but I love how soft they leave my skin. I had only tried konjac sponges with the activated charcoal until I got this pure konjac one. I love it, it&#x27;s like washing your face with the silkiest cloud. I know that&#x27;s cheesy but it&#x27;s the closest thing I can think of that it reminds me of. It exfoliates really well but it is gentle anf feels like its barely touching your skin. It is almost like it releases a really light oil as your washing with it and your skin is left glowing and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge expands much larger than the ones I have used before which is cool because I wanted to have one for my body and this is a much better size. When it first arrives it&#x27;s tiny and looks like a rock. Super hard and rough. After a minute or so in warm water it plumps up to about the width of a tennis ball. You don&#x27;t have to add soap and actually, doing so breaks down the fibers in your sponge faster. The natural oil released breaks down the grime and oil from your skin and scrubs your pores clean. If you choose to add soap just be sure to rinse it well after you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not hard or complicated to take care of it to make it last. Make sure you squeeze it gently to get the water out and let it hang on the provided suction hook to dry.  I keep mine in my shower away from the spray of water. If I had a less humid but practical place to keep it I would there but this is convenient and I really don&#x27;t know where else I&#x27;d keep it. You can boil it gently for 2 minutes or wet it and pop in in the microwave for 1 minute to disinfect it but eventually this wears on the sponge too so I only do it once every two weeks. I rinse it well before and after every use though and make sure it gets to dry right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love these sponges. My skin is super sensitive and this is very gentle. I&#x27;ve even seen it recommend for babies because it&#x27;s so good for our skin and all natural and won&#x27;t cause any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive my sponge free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but that doesn&#x27;t mean I HAVE to like it. If it&#x27;s garbage I have no problem calling it out.  My review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions with this product. I rely on reviews before I buy too, so I would only give my real opinion.  It&#x27;s a really great alternative for your skin care routine.atural and won&#x27;t cause any irritation.

    <li> If you havent tried this Konjac Sponge you should. It is natural and contains nothing to irritate your skin. When its wet the sponge is super soft so it wont damage it either. The great thing about this sponge is you can compost it after you are done so you don&#x27;t have to toss it in the waste it can go right back to nature. These sponges are made from plant material so they are super green and safe for the environment. This comes with a plastic hook to hang it in the shower. You must make sure it dries in between uses so it works its best. This one is white. I also have the dark colored one. This is great for your face it leaves you feeling fresh and clean , but you can also use this sponge anywhere on your body that you wish, even on babies because its that soft. Its great for exfoliating and keeping your skin clear and healthy. If you haven&#x27;t tried a konjac sponge you should definitely try it.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture! it massages my face with bouncing feelings and I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DT4757A/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_30 and it has been amazing!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a konjac sponge, you need to know that they are THE BOMB. It blows my mind that something that is basically a perfectly shaped piece of vegetable root could be the best face cleanser ever. You will be amazed at how smooth, bright and exfoliated your skin is using these and after about a week of regular use your pores will become absolutely tiny. No special sauce needed, just this sponge and some water. If you still want to use cleanser with it, you just need a drop as the sponge will make it foam up like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have NO EXCUSE now not to wash your face before bed because this is  about as low maintenance as it gets. Get it wet. Rub it on your face. Go to bed. Boom. Done. It even gets off makeup and it&#x27;s naturally ph balanced to keep your skin gorgeous without needing toner. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like so many cleanser can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that pureSOL sponges come not only in biodegradable packaging and the sponge itself is biodegradable, but unlike many competitors, it also has a hang string threaded through it and an enclosed suction cup hanger so it can dry and stay hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have gotten this for review purposes, but trust me, this is a REAL TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> This product works very well and makes skin very soft</li>
    <li> The sponge is nice and soft once added to water. I use it on my face. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference one way or another yet. I will update after I have used it longer than a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Smells like a dirty sponge.</li>
    <li> I exfoliate my face once or twice a week - but I have always used a cream with exfoliating beads. I have never used a Konjac Sponge before and I must admit that when I first got this product, I got a little concerned that it might be too abrasive on my skin. I tried it out and was I wrong! It was not abrasive at all and did a great job at exfoliating my face! It&#x27;s doing a wonderful job and I have less black and white heads around my nose area and temples. Two thumps up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! It&#x27;s light weight and works great. Good packaging as well.</li>
    <li> I recently received the pureSol Konjac facial sponge, which is made from the root of a Japanese plant.  It is supposed to gently exfoliate your skin while deep cleansing and removing toxins/impurities.  I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the body sponge because I felt it was *too* soft.  The facial sponge has the same texture, but because it&#x27;s for your face, it seemed appropriate.  I wouldn&#x27;t WANT to use something that is rougher on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect texture for your face, even for sensitive skin.  Not at all abrasive.  After I was done using it, my skin felt very clean.  I can&#x27;t necessarily say that I&#x27;ve noticed any change in my skin, but I did enjoy the clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge plus for me is that the pureSOL Konjac sponge is eco-friendly.  It is biodegradeable, vegan, and 100% cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a sample for review purposes, but I believe that all reviews should provide honest feedback.  All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge! it feels great on my skin, and my skin tends to feel really soft after using. I will be keeping one of these in my bathroom. You do have to be careful with it as you ring it out. Its recommended that you don&#x27;t twist it to remove the water; but squeeze it in between your hands. It also comes with a hook and string so you can hang it to dry once you&#x27;re finished with it. Very convenient~</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product for my rosacea sensitive skin! Initially, I thought it was too hard, but that was only because I did not let the sponge soak in the water thoroughly No joke it feels so smooth on your skin, it almost feels slimy. But its not actually slimy its just super smooth. The only downside about this material is that once you get a small rip on it, it will continue to tear very easly and the sponge comes apart. Any little tear will continue to rip. :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I was sent this little sponge to review. I was very surprised. It felt like I was at a spa. It really did make my skin feel amazing! I was shocked at how durable it really seems to be. It only has to be replaced every 3 months (as long as it is cared for properly) and is very affordable. I look forward to washing my face with this every morning and every evening. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on the body sponges. This instantly became one of my very favorite things!!! I highly recommend this sponge! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this sponge and uses it everyday - she is sure that her acne is looking better since she started to use this sponge - so she is sure that this sponge is detoxifying her skin and clearing up all the little imperfections.  She is sold completely and I have to say that her skin is looking better - I don&#x27;t give her face as much time as she does so she is more the expert on her face than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge comes with a hook for your mirror so it can hang and dry out without any worry of picking up germs from the counter or edge of the sink.  This is a great product to use on your face and maybe other parts of your body that need deeper cleaning then the rest of you(acne on your back or chest could us this sponge.)  Also this is green - !!!</li>
    <li> Just as described. I&#x27;ve owned other natural Konjac sponges before and this one is just as great. I like that it brings a little suction hook to hang it for drying. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> My face broke out shortly after using this for the second and third time so I am worried the sponge collects bacteria like traditional sponges.</li>
    <li> The sponge works very well to do a nice, deep clean leaving me feeling fresh and relaxed like after having had a facial. I&#x27;d recommend this sponge to my best friend, in fact, I just might do that. Also, I love that it&#x27;s organic and biodegradable - icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> This facial sponge is gross, it felt like it had a gel all over and thru it. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!!! Love it.</li>
    <li> My sponge fell apart after a couple weeks</li>
    <li> I can tell you this will work for you if you hAve sensitive skin!!! Mine is the most sensitive Of everyone I know and I can scub my fAce like crazy no problem!! I also bought a different brand of konjac sponge and didn&#x27;t like it. I will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this particular Konjac sponge. Really did not see any difference in my skin (level of cleanliness, exfoliation, smoothness, etc) after using this product. Following mfg. directions to rehydrate, use, cleanse, etc and after two weeks the sponge turned an off-putting greyish white. Not something I wanted to use on my face. Would not purchase this item again... Off to the compost heap it goes.  I did like the petite size and shape of this sponge... would be a great travel item.  Am presently using another brand of Konjac sponge (purchased at the same time as the pureSOL) and have not had the same discoloration issues.</li>
    <li> This PureSol Konjac Facial Sponge is good. Before using the sponge, you have to soak the sponge in water until it&#x27;s fully soft, that way you can get the best results. You move the sponge in a circular motion to clean your face and neck. It washes, refreshes and cleans any toxins and impurities which is left on your skin. By using this you are removing all toxins from your skin to leave a more flawless and healthy looking complexion. It&#x27;s very important to cleanse the sponge with water after every use, and once a week boil the sponge in water for about a minute to kill the bacteria which may remain on the sponge. I personally love this sponge because it feels so good when I use it. I use it every night right before I go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It is super soft feeling on your face. This sponge make exfoliating so easy and not at all painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first get this sponge it is as hard as a rock. It comes with a little string attached as well as a suction cup hook. I put my suction cup hook on the mirror above the sink because that is where I wash my face. It has been up there for two weeks and has yes to fall down. The first use I had to soak this sponge for a good 4 minutes before it softened so it was ready for use. Any use after the first time it only takes a little over a minute to soften it for use. I like using this alone after I have washed my face. This feels so super soft on my face I could seriously just walk around all day rubbing my face with this sponge. I may look funny doing that but at least it will feel good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this sponge!! I love the feeling that it leaves on my skin. So soft and squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s GREEN :) yay</li>
    <li> I am such a fan of pureSOL facial sponges.  After falling in love with the charcoal sponge, I decided to try the original one as well.  I was not disappointed.  Like the charcoal one it arrives hard and you soak it in water to soften it up and make it ready for use.  It is a wonderful, gentle exfoliator.  My skin feels so clean after using this little sponge.  My only issue is because my skin is dark the makeup stained the white sponge.  Because of this I will only use the charcoal from now on.  The original works exactly the same as the same as the charcoal its just a preference.  Id prefer my sponge not to look stained.  I am so happy I was given the opportunity to try and review this sponge.  I was not compensated in any other way.</li>
    <li> I love my Konjac sponges, I have the activated charcoal Konjac sponge too. They gently exfoliate my face and it feels wonderful afterwards. I do not experience any irritation or redness after using the sponges and I have sensitive skin. They are so easy to use with or without cleanser. Just run the sponge under warm water and get it softened up before use, gently massage your face in small circular motions and you are done! I have been looking for a chemical and toxin free way of exfoliating my face and I found it with PureSOL Konjac Sponges. I love that they are eco-friendly and vegan.</li>
    <li> The konjac sponge is amazing.  It&#x27;s all natural made from the root of the Japanese konjac plant.  My face feels cleaner after using this! You can tell the difference.  It gently exfoliates as well.  I will always keep one of these around.  I have used other sponges and the quality and the way this is designed is much better than most.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get this thing!  It&#x27;s a kind of slimmy sponge. I didn&#x27;t get a lot of lather from my soap which normally lathers fine with my hands. Noticed no difference in my skin. I just can&#x27;t get over the slimmy feel!  Not for me.  There are so many other products for washing face that are better than this.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me one of these and I have bought more for myself.  Your skin feels so smooth no matter what kind of soap/cleanser you use with the sponge.  The only caveat is to not hang it from the string and hook that comes with it.  My string broke and the sponge started to fall apart at that point where it was hanging.  I cut the string from my new one and just set it on my shower shelf and will see if it holds up longer.  This sponge is biodegradable so don&#x27;t expect it to last a year.</li>
    <li> Deeply cleanse, exfoliate and detoxify skin for a radiant complexion. efficient boscia Konjac Cleansing Sponge is made from 100 percent preservative-free konjac root from the pristine, idyllic Jeju Island.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! It is exfoliating my face, but it is not rough or harsh on my skin. This sponge is a welcome new addition to my skincare routine. I plan on using it for life! Well, not the same sponge, one just like it though, because it probably will wear out eventually.</li>
    <li> This is a very cool little guy. It is not very big, but it is effective. I used it on my face with my scrub. WOW! My skin was glowing. I think it is a great tool, and a great alternative to harsh brushes!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review this until I could try it several times. The test was clearing the blackheads around my nose. They look so much better and my face is much smoother! Great product and feels like a little massage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my seventies and was looking for a cleansing sponge that would remove dead skin cells without harming my ageing and always extremely sensitive skin.  This sponge does wonders.  I use it with a few dabs of cold cream, which is what I have always used to wash my face, morning and evening.  The results after the first week of use were amazing.  My skin is soft and well moisturized, my skin tone is evened out, and there hasn&#x27;t been the least hint of irritation from using the sponge.  I&#x27;ve never looked so good (well, not in years, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our medicine cabinet isn&#x27;t recessed into the wall, so it was easy to stick the hook for the the sponge to the side of it and let it hang to dry out of the way.  Drying it properly would seem to be very important to keep it from disintegrating.</li>
    <li> This sponge has helped my skin. I have been having severely dry skin and have tried everything. After using this sponge a few times, I noticed I have less visibly dry spots. I was extremely happy! I highly recommend this sponge to anyone looking for something to help with their dry skin!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t abrasive enough to remove the dead skin on my face. I found that it was too soft and didn&#x27;t do what it described to do.</li>
    <li> Great little facial tool.  My skin looks clearer and has a glow to it after first few uses.  Want to try the charcoal one too!! Rinses and dries easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s soft and gentle. I just simply wet the sponge thoroughly and rubbed it all over my face. It has the sensation of exfoliating without any roughness. The sponge dried really quickly so I don’t have to worry about it being slimy. It gives a good scrub to wash your face or body. It held a good amount of soap and it lathered up on it very nicely. I also love the little hanger/holder it comes with. I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Since I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, I am always on the lookout for something that will help maintain and ease it. I came across this new facial sponge and had to see if it truly did what the description says. I was sent one for free for review purposes but all opinions are 100% my own. It is so very soft &amp; makes your skin feel so smooth &amp; clean. I love the mini suction that comes with it. I will definitely be buying another one when this one is done.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this sponge and see if it exfoliates better than any of my other devices. Alas, it was nothing special. Maybe good for people with extremely sensitive skin, but otherwise I will stick to my Clarisonic. The sponge was fun to lather and use, but the novelty wore off quickly. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I received both the original and the activated charcoal facial sponge to review and I must say I like them both.  I don&#x27;t really see a difference with the charcoal sponge but I can say that after using this just once, I can already see less whiteheads and blackheads around my nose area.  I used this with and without my normal facial cleanser and I feel this product is more convenient to use in the shower as it needs to be soaked for a couple of minutes before use.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough but I do like that you can put this in the compost bin after use, eliminating waste.</li>
    <li> recommend this!! It&#x27;s good for all skin type. Exfoliate well and not too harsh at all</li>
    <li> This is my second time trying out a Konjac Facial Sponge and it&#x27;s just as great as the Ovealine one. I like that this one comes with a suction hook so you can hang it on your mirror and let your sponge dry after you use it. I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and it has made my pores a little smaller and it has also made my skin clearer. I have been getting some pimples here and there but since I started to use this, my face has been clearing up. The sponge itself is very soft once you wet it with water so this is perfect for those who have sensitive skin and won&#x27;t worry about exfoliating everyday because it&#x27;s not rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this little sponge. I thought it would be bigger but it is the perfect size. After soaking it with water, I use it everyday in the shower. I am lazy about using exfoliaters so this is my go to product. My face and neck look younger and tighter plus glow more. The hook makes it easy to dry after use.Now I want to try Konjac&#x27;s black sponge.</li>
    <li> This is too small. I couldn&#x27;t comfortably get a grip on it. I had been using disposable exfoliating face pads, so I was excited to try something that I wouldn&#x27;t have to toss after 1 use. Unfortunately, this is not that product. Like some other reviews, I would agree that I&#x27;m sure this retains some bacteria as it&#x27;s not the easiest to rinse out.</li>
    <li> Very soft and easy to use. Great for washing your face gently in the shower or bath.</li>
    <li> SO I’ve been using this product for a few weeks, and I am extremely satisfied with the way my skin has been reacting to it! It doesn’t dry out my skin, no redness and best of all my skin is free of breakouts! You can use it alone or with your favorite face cleanser, its such a great product that I RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about this sponge but after using it for a while, I began liking it. Cleanses my face very well without the harsh feel.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s such a great idea, it foams your regular soap quite a bit in your hand, but when you rub the sponge on your face the foaming doesn&#x27;t transfer as well. When I used it and rinsed off my face with water it felt as though there wasn&#x27;t any soap on my face. I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s because the sponge distributed the soap evenly or if because it ended up soaking up all the cleanser (I use bare minerals purifying cleanser for reference). It comes pretty small and extremely hard and fragile feeling. However, make sure you soak it in water for around 5 minutes so that it can soften up and be easily handled. It doubles in size when it has been soaked and ready to use. I also like that this is compostable so it won&#x27;t just be sitting in the trash for years to come it&#x27;ll be able to get thrown in the compost. I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review, all opinions are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> Better than my Clarisonic! I have been using Clarisonic for 5 years and really liked it. However, I am now 59 yrs old and the skin is getting thinner on my face which resulted in broken capillaries from the Clarisonic on my cheeks. This sponge appears to clean just as well as the Clarisonic, but does not result in broken capillaries......and the cost is a lot less.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Kojac sponges from PureSol. I&#x27;ve tried the charcoal one and this one to review and they are both great! If you&#x27;re looking for a good quality sponge definitely pick one of these up! They even come with a suction cup so you can dry them out! LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> I skin feel so good I like it.</li>
    <li> In a beauty world that is consumed with chemicals, it is nice to find a company that takes the natural approach and especially when it comes to cleaning the very thing you are trying to keep looking it&#x27;s best, your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What exactly is a Konjac Sponge-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac Sponge is made from 100 percent preservative-free konjac root. This is a root-based vegetable, which in Asia has been cultivated for it&#x27;s fibers. The root&#x27;s fibers are a perfect detoxifying and purifying agent. The fibers calm and exfoliate, creating a sponge that is delicate to sensitive skin. The Konjac root material is natural in alkaline and balances the acidity of your skin by removing impurities and oils, such as build-up from congested pores. Blackheads and acne issues are easily corrected and managed because the fiber of the root provides gentle exfoliation. No chemicals here to encourage redness, irritations, or more skin problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root is naturally enriched with many minerals and vitamins but remains gentle enough for the sensitive skin suffers. The Konjac sponge provides deep-cleansing, leaving you with a natural PH balanced surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Sol offers a large array of Konjac sponges, with each variety addressing different needs. I was able to review the Original sponge from their product line.

I have been washing my face now to remove the make-up and then using the Original Konjac sponge after and once my face is cosmetic free.

Using the sponge in this method allows me to use my masks as I need to and be worry-free if any chemicals are going to give me lizard eyes.

    <li> I love this sponge!  It is a great for exfoliating but it isn&#x27;t rough on my sensitive skin! Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this it works perfectly</li>
    <li> Worth it!!! Cleans deeply down your pores and it is not rough at all...very smooth sponge actually, perfect for the face...I love it!</li>
    <li> I hate to say It&#x27;s a scam.  I used it for a while nothing changed for me.</li>
    <li> The pureSol Konjac Sponge is the absolute best face sponge/body sponge i have ever used. It exfoliates and cleanse but is not harsh on your sensitive skin. I will be buying one of these for everyone i know. My face has been clean, free of breakouts, and refreshed.</li>
    <li> You purchase and then the company e-mails you &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; on use of the product.  Sounds corny, but cool customer service.  Purchased one for me, one for my daughter.  We love them.  Exfoliates and really smooths your skin tone.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Love this sponge, it&#x27;s super soft and sudsy. Just the way I like it..</li>
    <li> I love to gently massage my face and decollete with the sponge in a circular motion and in an upward direction. This produces a lifting effect and avoids sagging skin. I got this for myself ...but with a tween in the house who&#x27;s face MUST BE FLAWLESS she has taken over ownership. If it&#x27;s tween approved  then you know it&#x27;s good because they don&#x27;t like anything of &amp;#34;Mom&#x27;s&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always allow sponge to air-dry in a well-ventilated area after each use. The sponge will slightly shrink, harden and become wrinkly as it dehydrates. Sterilize in boiling water once per week.</li>
    <li> Loving this little sponge. The texture is positively perfect for exfoliating my face and neck. My face feels cleaner and pores seen smaller.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. It is just what I needed- not a hard face brush, not a wash cloth. Gentle enough, but strong enough, and it leaves your face feeling unclogged and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure not to pose any holes in it or make any tears, because then you ned to buy a new sponge, but it is very difficult to accidentally do that like I did. I like that this sponge is soft but it scrubs at every pore gently but deeply.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a new one for sure.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried a Konjac sponge, you are missing out.  They are so much better for your face than wash rags, or your hands. The texture of them, really help with exfoliating your face, but is gentle enough for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PureSol sponge is a really nice sponge. However, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few Konjac sponges and while the quality of the sponge is great, I&#x27;m a tad disappointed at the size of the sponge. It just isn&#x27;t very large at all. I&#x27;ve tried other sponges much larger than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a Konjac sponge, don&#x27;t be surprised when you open it and it&#x27;s hard as a rock....  This is normal and ok. Just wet the sponge and it will transform before your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great sponge and works tremdously well. My only complaint is in the size. But, it&#x27;s definitely not something that would prohibit me from purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sample provided for testing &amp; review purposes</li>
    <li> I discovered this sponge through a beauty and bargain blogger I follow on FB, and she just raved about it, and had a discount code for her readers, so I decided to try it. It was about a month after it arrived before I remembered I had it and decided to start using it. It felt strange, and my skin didn&#x27;t remotely feel clean after, but I figured it was just a new thing I had to get used to. Well, since I started using it, I have gotten more zits than ever, even when I started using it with my regular face wash, and about the sixth or seventh time I went to use it, it completely disintegrated in my hand. Waste of bloody money. (Unless you like buying expensive compost fodder.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this thing. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now and I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the appearance or texture of my skin. That&#x27;s not the big issue though, because I know I may need to use it longer to see the results...however, my sponge isn&#x27;t drying! I use it exactly as directed but each evening when I go to use it again, I grab it off the hook and it&#x27;s still damp and soft. I don&#x27;t know what the issue is but I&#x27;ll probably stop using it soon because that seems gross.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this facial sponge at a reduced price to review it, and share my thoughts on it.  When it arrives home you will notice it&#x27;s very small &amp; hard. Looks like a pumice stone to me. Simply soak the sponge in water for just a few minutes &amp; it will become big &amp; soft. Love that after soaking it in water it becomes oh so soft. I like to use mine with whatever facial cleanser have on hand. Like that this product is free of nasty chemicals, cruelty free &amp; biodegradable. This product is also Vegan friendly. Say your ready to use your Konjac sponge well soak it in water allow it to become soft. Get your face wet! When you use this Konjac sponge you need just a small amount of facial cleanser. Use small circular motions to clean your skin. The get water to get the cleanser off your face &amp; pat your face dry. Rise your sponge with cool water, and lightly press out the excess water with your hands. Hang it to dry with the included suction cup &amp; allow to dry. My skin looks softer, &amp; feel soft to the touch. Have even uses less moisturizer since using this Konjac Sponge. This is a new concept for me, but so far I am very happy using it.</li>
    <li> really like the feel of this facial sponge.  will be taking it with me in travels.</li>
    <li> Never knew this would work so well.  Once you wet it for a few minutes, its ready to clean.  It seems to especially help with blackheads on my nose.</li>
    <li> I received this Original Konjac Sponge for free to try for my 100% honest opinion. When i first opened up the package I kinda thought, &amp;#34;Well, this is it?&amp;#34; It came in a small box and the sponge was dried up and small in plastic wrap. After reading the directions and soaking it in water for a few minutes it doubled in size. It is flat on one side and rounded on the other, and after being soaked is super soft. It can be used with or without cleansing product. I chose to use my face wash and found that you only need to put a little bit on it because it will foam up real quick. It also has a string attached so you can hang it on the suction cup hanger that comes along with it. I was happy it came with the suction cup hanger because it makes it way easier to keep it clean and dry. The Konjac Sponge is made from 100% pure Konjac Root and also Eco Friendly, Vegan, Cruelty Free, Biodegradable, and Chemical Free.</li>
    <li> I got this today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! I followed the package directions and soaked it till it was soft. I was skeptical about using without cleanser, but I want to stop using chemicals on my face. I started in small circular motions all over my face and I started to get little &#x27;soap&#x27; type bubbles.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should rinse, so I just splashed a little water and patted dry. It&#x27;s several hours later and my skin feels amazing! Clean, soft and supple! The little hook that came with this is a wonderful idea! Good job pureSOL!</li>
    <li> This sponge is fantastic!! It&#x27;s so gentle on skin but really makes my complexion look so clean and fresh. I love that I can add a bit of cleanser right to the sponge and really foam it up nicely, or I can apply the cleanser first and sort of buff it off my face with the wet konjac sponge. Plus you know that it&#x27;s not going to harbor bacteria because it dries to almost rock hard again in a few hours. this is a perfect option for anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone that can&#x27;t afford a fancy facial brush. I have a clarisonic, and the konjac sponge works almost as well- very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These sponges are fabulous!  They leave my skin feeling so clean and I swear my pores are minimizing before my eyes!  I have oily skin and have always had a problem with large pores.  I will be a continual buyer of these Konjac Sponges!</li>
    <li> This was only good for two face washes, it broke into half.</li>
    <li> Smaller than it appears in pictures...Purchased at discounted price for review</li>
    <li> I love it! Was skeptical when it arrived in a tiny box and a hook. After soaking it for a few minutes, it turned out nice and soft. I have been using during my shower. I can definitely notice a difference. Will buy again - hopefully it lasts a while though.</li>
    <li> I was sent the pureSOL Konjac Sponge free to try if I would be willing to leave a review with my honest opinion. My main criteria in skincare is that it be cruelty free (not tested on animals) and vegan is always a great bonus. I have been using the Konjac Sponge for a little over two weeks now and I am still enjoying it! I love the gentle exfoliation this sponge provides, it is so gentle that it is actually soothing. I really look forward to using it at the end of the day and I will definitely purchase this myself!</li>
    <li> This feels like a loofa at first, but gets softer after use.  It definitely does the job as specified.  I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this sponge twice with my normal cleanser.  While I can&#x27;t tell any significant different in the appearance or feel of my skin, it certainly feels as if I&#x27;m getting my face cleaner with this rather than just using my hands.  I&#x27;ve never used any kind of sponge or other appliance to clean my face so this is new to me, but I&#x27;m loving it so far!  It&#x27;s gentle but still deep cleans.  Will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> Konjac facial sponge is pretty neat!! The most important features to me were of course performance and source.  the sponge is really different and when hydrated becomes this very soft and nice natural sponge that cleanses and lightly exfoliates your skin.  I LOVE that this is a natural sponge from a plant!!! I used to use those nylon poufs until one day I was in the shower using the nylon style pouf with cleanser and just felt like I was rubbing toxic plastic into my skin and had an eye open moment then thinking &amp;#34;what the heck and I doing??&amp;#34; why would I want to use PLASTIC chemically produced crap on the largest organ on our bodies????? I threw away all the plastic and unnatural based sponges that day and have been trying other natural products and am feeling like I am doing something much better for myself and my health.  I switched to a natural sea sponge in the shower but using that for facial cleansing just does not work as the pores are too large and loose in nature.  The Konjac sponges the perfect fit for natural facial cleansing.  The size of the pores of the Konjac sponge are just right for holding a nice facial cleanser like Burt&#x27;s Bees Clary Sage Facial Cleanser this sponge deep cleans while very lightly exfoliating the skin.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on your face, I wash my face with a mild soap before using this and skin feels amazing while using sponge and after.</li>
    <li> I really like it, im using it everyday and i noticed a big change of my skin. My pores are becoming invisible.</li>
    <li> I received this Konjac facial sponge as a sample for evaluation and review. I really like it! The sponge is the perfect size for your face - not too small and not too big. After I use it (along with my face wash), my face feels clean and soft, exactly what you want your face to feel like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This facial sponge lasted three months for me using it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is my first konjac sponge. I used to make bath products for a living and have always avoided mechanical exfoliants for the face, but this was very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works great with cleansers. I use Cerave Hydrating which is more creamy than foamy, but I think with a cleanser that lathers this would help stretch the product so you can use less each time. The sponge feels like a nice little massage for your face without being abrasive. I liked that it came with a little hook and suction cup so it can be hung up on the shower wall, keeping it cleaner and helping it dry out after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Don&#x27;t expect any miracles---think of it as a very soft washcloth. Unlike a chemical exfoliant like a BHA or AHA, this won&#x27;t leave you feeling amazingly refreshed or reduce oil by much on its own. I also found that after a month or two, the side that rested against the shower wall would discolor to yellowish orange. The discoloration could be cleaned off easily enough, but it was still off-putting to look at.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sponge! It&#x27;s perfect to use with my Neutrogena facial cleanser. I use it in the morning and at night and it makes my skin feel amazing! You just need to be sure not to scrub TOO hard or your face may get irritated (as mine did the first time I used this). FTC - I got this product free to review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Brilliant idea to make a gace cleaning sponge from this root. It is very soft after it is completly wet, it does not irritate your skin, you can even use it with no soap, it is veru gently and leaves my face very soft.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d quickly---Tried it immediately---felt wonderful on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll keep re-purchasing as needed!</li>
    <li> This facial sponge is perfect! Like others said, when it came it was small, hard, and super lightweight. However, once it is submerged in water; it plumps right up! It exfoliates beautifully without being harsh! Has a handy string attached so it can hang nicely - I like that; as I feel it keeps it cleaner from bacteria and such.</li>
    <li> I have been reading about this sponge in a lot of women&#x27;s magazines. It is a perfect addition to my skincare routine. I have been using the sponge in the morning instead of a washcloth and my Clairsonic at night-my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I had never used a Konjac sponge before, so was excited to receive one to review. I think it is my new favorite way to cleanse and exfoliate my skin. I was initially concerned it might be too rough, as I don&#x27;t really like those exfoliating shower puffs and find  luffah sponges a little too rough for my skin. However, I did not find the Konjac sponge to be rough at all. If thoroughly wet, it feels soothing to my face. My skin has felt very soft and my makeup sits smoothly on my face. I did have a minor breakout about three days after I started using the sponge. Sometimes breakthrough breakouts can happen with a new cleansing method. I suspect I may have caused this myself as I keep touching my face as it feels so smooth. I will update in about a week, if I find that the breakout doesn&#x27;t clear up or gets worse. (I don&#x27;t expect that as my skin is already recovering). So far, so good. Other than a couple pinples, my skin looks and feels great.  I can see myself continuing to use a Konjac sponge. According to the instructions that I read, the sponge should be replaced every three months or so. $10 every three months for a sponge might seem a little spendy, but if effective I see it as a good value especially since I am not using a cleanser with it (other than occasional coconut oil to remove eye makeup).</li>
    <li> One of many thing I love about this konjac sponge is that its 100% natural, eco-friendly and free of parabens, sulphates &amp; chemicals. It is also vegan,cruelty free and biodegradable. It gently exfoliates my skin while cleansing and removing any impurities, leaving me with a glowing complexion. It is extremely soft and gentle enough to use everyday. My skin is has less blemishes and blackheads since I started using it. While I do wish the sponge was a little bigger, the smaller size does make it easier to hold and get in close to nose and eye area. This one is a bit more gentle than my charcoal one so I like to use it in the morning before I apply my make up and save my charcoal one for night. I love that it comes with a suction cup to make sure the sponge dries completely, its important to make sure facial sponges dry completely so they don&#x27;t grow bacteria or mold. This is good for any skin type, I have sensitive combination skin and this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I prefer to use this sponge with an organic face wash. I did receive this free to review and share my honest opinion</li>
    <li> I love my little Konjac sponge! I was a little hesitant when I was asked to review this product because I have very sensitive skin, but I was hopeful because there are no additives or added colors. After two weeks of using the sponge I have had no break outs or skin irritation. I love how it is a cruelty free product and biodegradable!  I will definitely be buying another when I have to decompose it in a couple months.</li>
    <li> It does nothing for my skin - it is too soft, small and not comfortable for facial cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive of the Konjac Sponge before using it. I got one for review purpose. I was surprised a the size of the sponge. It looks big in picture but when you remove it from the box it is about 2&amp;#34;. It feels hard and abrasive. But, if you follow the directions on the box, you will be very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the instructions and soaking it in water, it had increased in size due to water absorption. In addition to that it had also become soft and puffy. I used it on my face in circular motion and it felt really good on my skin. Many of the exfoliating products available feel abrasive on the skin, but this Konjac Sponge is not like that. It feels nice, smooth and gentle on the skin. It is so smooth that I did not feel any kind of irritation at all. My skin felt refreshed. I have only used it for couple of days now and I have noticed the pores are smaller and tighter. I think to really see a huge difference I may have to use it for a longer duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to add that this sponge is chemical free and is completely bio-degradable and that is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> Apparently Konjac sponges are created from a type of Asian potato plant fiber so they will eventually break down over time (2-3 months). Although this may seem inconvenience, itâ€™s absolutely paragon and sulphate free due to the materials! When I first got this product, I was surprised by how cute and efficient the packaging is. It comes in this nice paper box and the sponges are securely sealed in separate plastic baggies. It was kind of oddly deformed and a bit smaller than my palm, but it did the job! I was initially a bit worried about how cleansing it was going to be, but boy, I was not disappointed. The sponge is gentle on my skin, but exfoliating enough for me to feel refreshed after use. The roughness of the sponge is definitely not harsh, and I was happy to note that the product is free of chemicals. It truly seemed as if this sponge was stripping away the toxins from the day and is perfect for smoothing out your skin tone. I have pretty sensitive skin but I was glad to see that it was simply a gentle massage for my skin, much like a spa treatment without the cost! The sponge should be soaked in water until it reaches an appropriate softness. You can choose to use a cleanser with it or you can opt out. I choose to use a cleanser the second time I used it, and I was surprised to note that my face felt equally clean both times. It comes with a suction cup hook to dry out your sponge after usage. This is a great way to exfoliate without redness, and I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get it and using it the first  few times, it felt good and was giving results, but the darn thing just disintegrated rapidly.</li>
    <li> This fell apart just a few weeks after the purchase.  I didn&#x27;t think it was worth $10 at all!  I could use a washcloth with better results.  Bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Using this to wash face is very comfortable. Nice texture! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received this at how little it was. I went back read the description and nothing about the size.. So next look at the reviews... Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t just me! So I went ahead and soaked and watched it grow to more of what I expected. It wasn&#x27;t like a normal sponge. I loved it. My face feels smooth asks clean. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
