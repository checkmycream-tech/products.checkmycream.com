      <li>Everyone commented on how cool it looks!</li>
      <li>Pretty nice.</li>
      <li>When it came it looked great, however when you put it on it isn&#x27;t actually white.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is.</li>

      <li>Although it is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>however it is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Just really a pearlesque shimmer on the lips..</li>
      <li>I love white lipstick but this was soft and broke in the tube.  </li>
      <li>It makes them a very light pinkish tinted color, not solid white, but it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
      <li>Feels very moist...does not dry out my lips.</li>
      <li>(I was expecting a pure white color)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this to be silly and I ended up using it whenever I went to a rave party. Everyone commented on how cool it looks! A perfect shade of white and kind that I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this lipstick to be white. It is more like a clear gloss. I would not recommend it if you are looking for a white lipstick.</li>
    <li> This is more sheer than I had hoped, and it is VERY soft.  Good texture, scent and feel.  Pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Have to put on heavy to get the effect I like, but I love it....  So glad I found!</li>
    <li> Not a horrible product. But, basically it&#x27;s just a tinted chapstick. Although it is very moisturizing.  All together pleased. Will most likely try to pick up more L.A. Colors lipstick.</li>
    <li> I bought this item 3 months ago for 1/3 of the price.  What gives with amazon? I do believe this is the last time I will use them, you can not complain! Bad business concept!</li>
    <li> Good enough, but light coverage. Feels very moist...does not dry out my lips.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive enough that if I didn&#x27;t like it and would throw it away, it would be ok.  BUT, I like it!  Plus the ordering was easy, the delivery fast.  Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Yonelay is spectacular! I got my lipstick the day after I ordered it. It was for a costume even though I didn&#x27;t get to wear it I def used this lipstick before vacation and I love it. Although it&#x27;s not matte white the shimmer makes it look nice and I like it!</li>
    <li> Matte whites work better to lighten other lipstick colors, the frosted ones just kind of smear the lipstick under it.  Revlon used to make White a la Carte, a great matte white lipstick, but they discontinued it, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find another matte white.&lt;br /&gt;This was described as a matte finish, but it is not.</li>
    <li> Its just a lightly colored chap stick,  I wanted a white lipstick.  Beware this is not  a white lipstick just looks it till you put it on.  I tried to layer it to see if the color would come and its just a fancy chap stick.</li>
    <li> Its not as white as I thought. Just really a pearlesque shimmer on the lips.. If you put some primer potion on your lips and maybe some powder before this, the white might show up more. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but it would be pretty drying I think.</li>
    <li> I got the blue, not expecting much. It is amazing! It goes on like chapstick, but with a couple coats it definitely gives me a crazy light blue color! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is.</li>
    <li> Fills the need for a white lipstick, which is impossible to find anymore.</li>
    <li> I love white lipstick but this was soft and broke in the tube.  I still use it but the quality could be improved so it is a bit stronger.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  I just wanted a touch of white to put over my lipstick and it is so clear, you can&#x27;t even see it.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This would be a great lipstick if you&#x27;re looking for a sassy clubbing night look. I just wanted like a chalk plain lipstick as a foundation. It&#x27;s pretty oily and has glitter in it. The hold is not the best... however it is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a costume.  It is extremely hard to find white lipstick.  When it came it looked great, however when you put it on it isn&#x27;t actually white.  It is a sheer that just adds gloss and glitter.</li>
    <li> I have light colored lips and mildly tanned skin, and this covers my lips well. It makes them a very light pinkish tinted color, not solid white, but it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for something to lighten your lip color. It&#x27;s not as exotic as it looks (I was expecting a pure white color) but it&#x27;s definitely a must have if you like a &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; look to your lips.</li>
    <li> For the price it wasn&#x27;t bad, but I was expecting more coverage. This reminded me more of bad 90&#x27;s fashion than something I could wear with a costume. I have light lips and it more or less just tinted them.</li>
