    <li> Im not really a fan of lipstick. So I decided to get these. Cheap and it came with 3 different color options. The lightest color- Not my favorite. But the rest I love (And so does my boyfriend) ;)</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are extremely dry.</li>
    <li> Love the Pink Passion!  All that I wear because it stays on!</li>
    <li> Lipstick colors look VERY alike. But you get what u pay for</li>
    <li> I recommend going to their website... more colors and 1.49 each for 3 you can get them at 4.47 this is major ripoff....</li>
    <li> Love the colors was shipped quickly but didnt receive the earrings</li>

    <li> Nice colors. Good quality. Didn&#x27;t get the free earrings but all I wanted was the lipsticks :)</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s pretty good cool colors</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have these three specific colors,  but I love Jordana lipstick! Amazing product! Totally worth your money.  I&#x27;m brown skinned African- American women and my favorite shade is Natural 82! Great buy ladies.</li>
    <li> I like the lipstick but don&#x27;t love it. Slightly sheer but not entirely.  I usually wear a chapstick under it and a gloss over it to moisturize it because it doesn&#x27;t have any moisture itself. But I love jordana! For the price, great products.</li>
