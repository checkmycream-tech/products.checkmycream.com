    <li> Imjoi micro pedi is the best thing since sliced bread. The coarse rollers are great.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> Not like the micro-pedi rollers I have delivered automatically.  They are nice in a pinch.  They need to be changed after one or two uses.  My feet are in very good condition..these rollers help with maintaining smooth skin, but would not have left a positive impression if they had ever been my first purchase.  These are not made by Emjoi.  The packaging clearly indicates made by another company.</li>
    <li> works lack a champ...</li>
    <li> This is a reorder thanks.</li>
    <li> these are terrible.  don&#x27;t last even 1 session.</li>
    <li> not as course as I would expect</li>
    <li> So happy to have found how to get these rollers for my micro-pedi. They work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great, and I prefer the courser texture, although it&#x27;s not the course.</li>
    <li> Claims to be extra coarse but they were barely coarser than the used one I was replacing. Boo!</li>
    <li> Saves a fortune in pedicures</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these for my little pedi tool. They work great for getting the bad callouses off of my heels.  I will continue to buy these replacement wheels.</li>
    <li> They are just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> always efficient, fast delivery and well priced</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR FINGERS AND TOES.......</li>
    <li> The Emjoi Micro- Pedi Rollers fit my Micro-Pedi and cost lots less then the Micro-Pedi rollers at Micro-Pedi.com. They work just as good as the Micro-Pedi Rollers. If you need any rollers for your Micro-Pedi go to Amazon.com and by the Emjoi Micro-Pedi instead.</li>
    <li> perfect refill rollers when you don&#x27;t want to spend too much time in the bathroom</li>
    <li> not exact fit, kinda loose on the end</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to buy in multi pack</li>
    <li> These extra course refill rollers for your Emijoi Micro Pedi are a must have.  I live is south Florida and wear sandals year round.  Therefore, dry, cracked, calloused feet are a major no no.  These extra course rollers are the only ones I use. They smooth away dry skin with minimal effort and leave my feet feeling soft and smooth.  I find that the fine rollers don&#x27;t leave my feet any smoother, and they wear out much quicker. To be honest, my feet look and feel better than after any pedicure I&#x27;ve had.  Buying bulk on Amazon saved a considerable sum of money in comparison to buying at a retail store or most other places online.</li>
    <li> Work wonderfully for nice and smooth feet.</li>
