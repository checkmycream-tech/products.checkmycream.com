      <li>and they worked okay,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied with Amazon, because you attended all my expectations.</li>

      <li>The rounded tip makes it so easy to get close to the scalp for better straightening as well as for use on bangs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with the way the TS-2 styles my hair and if it lasts five years like my last iron I will be thrilled.</li>
      <li>The iron gets hot quickly, curls hair beautifully, but when straightening, hair slides out of the plates really easily.</li>
      <li>tried this on three people and all enjoyed the product, found the controls responsive and smartly located and 2 of the three were impressed at how nice a better flat iron could be compared to their entry level units they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great iron for natural hair!</li>
      <li>The auto turnoff feature is a nice idea , in the morning rush it very easy to forget certain things.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>For my hair, which is medium to fine, I set the iron at 180 degrees (the default and lowest setting) and the iron did a great job getting my hair smooth and straight.  </li>
      <li>I also like that you don&#x27;t have to pass it over your hair more than once to get a silky, smooth look.  </li>
      <li>and it was able to smooth and straighten my hair while I watched television.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slim and sleek and easy to store away when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to manage - even in my inexperience and clumsiness, I have succeeded in not burning myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The swivel is a must and makes it easy to move the iron around the head.  </li>
      <li>The rounded end makes the iron easy to slide under your hair close to your scalp without burning you.  </li>
      <li>I like the design, easy to wield.  </li>
      <li>I love how fast it heats up, love the very smooth plates that glide so smoothly over my hair, love the precise temperature control and the automatic shut off.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly, and gets the job done, plus I love the shape.</li>
      <li>But with a little conversion, you can figure out which temp works best for your hair and just keep the iron at that</li>
      <li>I truly see a difference that these plates provide when it comes to even heat distribution and smooth maneuverability.</li>
      <li>It has a great grip so you can control this light-weight iron without slip; and, the swirl cord allows for the fluid movement of the iron.</li>
      <li>So straight in fact it just kind of hangs there.</li>
      <li>and it felt silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>The titanium mirror plates allow smooth sliding while the surface is anti-bacterial.  </li>
      <li>It heats up really fast and will shut itself off automatically after 60 minutes of not using it which is a nice safety feature.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with the way the TS-2 styles my hair and if it lasts five years like my last iron I will be thrilled.efaults to 180C every time I turn it off.</li>
      <li>With about 5 minutes worth of work, my wife’s hair went from wavy and curly to mostly straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it will look great and knowing that it can be straight in a short period of time, makes it all the more appealing.</li>
      <li>I truly see a difference that these plates provide when it comes to even heat distribution and smooth maneuverability..</li>
      <li>After our first child, her hair developed wavy curls in it (which I think are still beautiful) and</li>
      <li>Great flat iron.</li>
      <li>The TS-2 Millennium Flat Iron is a great iron.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron is great and the nano plates feel so silky</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great flat iron.  </li>
      <li>The iron is very lightweight and even after being on for about 10 minutes, the handle was still nice and cool.  </li>
      <li>iron heats up quickly and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have an on/off button rather than a switch, which depending on how you hold the iron can be easy to bump on accident, but overall, this is a great flat iron at a good price.</li>
      <li>Well worth your consideration!</li>
      <li>If it works this great on somebody who already has straight hair it must work wonders on those with naturally curly hair.</li>

      <li>My fiance really hates most irons for her hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with Amazon, because you attended all my expectations.</li>
    <li> While i wouldnt call it &#x27;an iron this good only comes around once in a millennium&#x27; (thats the marketing slogan) this was still a good and well recieved iron by the ladies in my house.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up in roughly half a minute to max temperature; and does its job very well. Usage wise, the swivel cord was great. Though the buttons are positioned such that occasionally you will press them without noticing. The auto turnoff feature is a nice idea , in the morning rush it very easy to forget certain things.&lt;br /&gt;Also would like to point out the dual voltage capabilities; meaning it is usable anywhere in the world. You just need the plug converter.</li>
    <li> Great iron for natural hair!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never used another brand of flat iron (that I can remember). I&#x27;ve always been able to blow out my hair straight with some styling spray. But now that it&#x27;s getting a bit longer, it doesn&#x27;t want to cooperate so easily.&lt;br /&gt;I also have 3 girls and 2 of them have very wavy hair. My oldest was pretty excited when she found out that her curls could be straightened, even if only temporarily. Haven&#x27;t tried it on her, yet, but if it works on mine, I suspect it will also work on hers, as she got her hair from me.&lt;br /&gt;I do love that it heats up quickly and seems to cool pretty quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;The style of it is simple and contemporary, but not &amp;#34;boxy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten caught in the hinge as it often does in other hair tools I use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter absolutely rave about this. It heats up in about a minute has a temperature gauge so you know when it&#x27;s done. The iron comes with a 3 year warranty which I thought was amazing in this day and age of disposable hair dryers and electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is reinforced at the connection and swivels. My wife said she finds the ergonomics to be perfect. She uses it to straighten her shoulder length bob but curls the ends in toward her neck. She said it&#x27;s the nicest iron she&#x27;s ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They took it to Japan and since it features dual voltage they didn&#x27;t have to worry about adapters.</li>
    <li> I have has a number of flat irons over the years, and this is one of the best.  I like the look, which makes it unisex, and a perfect gift.  I think this one heats up  more quickly than some, and has a very nice ( and EVEN ) heat distribution, which is appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it pass my  press the pants and sleeves of a shirt test -- it sure does, and is great when you need a touch-up while on the road!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the unit is high-end, and there is little worry of burning yourself ( or your forehead in particular ) The results are just what you would expect, sleek and shiny hair, in minutes. Well worth your consideration!</li>
    <li> It does not work. It kept cutting off &amp; going cold while doing my hair. Whatever you do, do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> Love the design and it heats and cools fast.</li>
    <li> This is it!!!! truly the best flat iron out there. Quick heat up, uniform heat application, fully digital screen shows temp, and easy to use side adjustable buttons to regulate temp. This is better than Chi.</li>
    <li> My hair is type 4B / 4C and this iron works like a dream smoothing out my hair from the root to the tip. This is a flat iron that can be a substitute for a curling wand.  It has a great grip so you can control this light-weight iron without slip; and, the swirl cord allows for the fluid movement of the iron. I love that it has digital temperature read out so you can vary the temp which goes up to 450 degrees to suit your needs. This iron heats up very fast too.  It has a power auto shut off capability so you don’t have to worry if you forget to shut it off.  My last iron was ceramic so I have noticed a difference in the shine of my hair after using this titanium plates iron. I love this iron and recommend it over some of the high end models. I’m going to get me another one so I have a back up for the future.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> I have another flat iron that I thought I loved. It&#x27;s the square tip one and it did a good job. When I got this one I found it so much better to handle! It&#x27;s a little lighter and has a digital display that, for me, makes it easier to handle and to set the temp. The swivel cord makes it so much easier to get to all of the &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; I need it to! I would definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, and slides over rough hair easily. It&#x27;s good for wrapping to curl or wave hair.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature is displayed in Celsius, so you&#x27;d have to know how to convert if you&#x27;re used to reading in Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li> I have wavy to curly hair that is below my shoulders. Last time I tried to straighten my hair, it took close to an hour and my arms hurt a lot from holding the iron so long. This time, in just 15-20 minutes, I had straight hair. This iron works so well. I like the fact that it has an on/off switch as well as the ability to adjust the temperature. I tried it at the factory setting too, of 180 degrees, but I know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and some may need to use it at a higher setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am growing my hair out to donate and just can&#x27;t wait to try this iron again with shorter hair. I think it will look great and knowing that it can be straight in a short period of time, makes it all the more appealing. If you are looking for a new iron, this one should make you happy you used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a clunky rectangular shaped flat iron for years and I had no idea how outdated it was until I received this one. First of all, this one heats up much faster than my original and I&#x27;m able to control the temperature digitally (an option that my old one doesn&#x27;t have). The product claims that the rounded shape is designed to reach the scalp easier and it&#x27;s true. I don&#x27;t have the crimp lines at my roots that I use to have. Whether I straighten my hair or curl it, it looks great! This flat iron is so easy to use and I love it!</li>
    <li> I never saw myself as somebody who would every use a flat iron. I have super straight hair. So straight in fact it just kind of hangs there. That&#x27;s where the TS-2 Millennium comes to the rescue. I can use this to add some body to my hair and some fullness. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but once you do, you&#x27;ll never go back to using a ceramic flat iron ever again. I can add some body to my limp hair in no time using this flat iron. It seems to do less damage to my hair than the traditional ceramic flat iron did. With the ceramic, I always ended up with split ends and breakage. With this flat iron, I notice a lot less of that. If it works this great on somebody who already has straight hair it must work wonders on those with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> My fiance really hates most irons for her hair. The reason is she&#x27;s terrified that it&#x27;ll do long term damage to her hair and, to her, it&#x27;s not worth doing even if she likes her hair straight from time to time (it&#x27;s naturally a bit curly). I have some wild hair myself occasionally due to bed hair on a moderately sized men&#x27;s haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has worked pretty well for us. I find that it&#x27;s not too difficult for her to use and straighten her hair whenever she feels the urge and she hasn&#x27;t complained about feeling like it&#x27;ll cause damages. I rarely do anything with my hair but I&#x27;ve found it works pretty well when I have a business meeting and need to put my hair to the whip per se. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference but she says her own hair feels healthier with it than normal flat irons as well for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest this flat iron for people trying to put their hair under control. The price is a bit steep but compared to other ones this really does the job well which is worth it when it comes to your body and taking care of yourself for the long term.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I thought this iron would be perfect for my hair.  This iron did not straighten my hair.  I like my hair to be silky straight and I could not achieve that with this iron.  I made several passes through my hair but the iron only smoothed out the kink in my hair.  It did NOT straighten my hair.  This iron is not for women who have course thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love the sleek design of this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;the plates really do make a difference for my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have long curly hair so i appreciate the long swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;as i was able to do my entire hair with ease&lt;br /&gt;flipping one side to the other no problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like how fast it heats up that is great&lt;br /&gt;i do with the the auto off was 30 min instead of 60 min of inactivity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is lighter than other irons i have used previously which is a plus&lt;br /&gt;then my arms do not get tired as it usually takes me about a good 15-20 min to do my hair&lt;br /&gt;really makes it crazy straight and no fly aways or crimps at the roots&lt;br /&gt;the rounded tip helps to get right to the ends near the scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a high quality wand worth the money and the 3 year warranty right there is a huge plus</li>
    <li> The iron gets hot quickly, curls hair beautifully, but when straightening, hair slides out of the plates really easily. My daughter misses the Chi.</li>
    <li> I was previously using a $20 basic flat iron. I really did not have any complaints about it, until I got this one! This is definitely a nicer quality flat iron. I especially love the rounded design as it makes curling under or out easier. It heats up really fast and will shut itself off automatically after 60 minutes of not using it which is a nice safety feature. The cord is long and thick.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday, but I already love it.  The shape of the straightener allows you to get really close to your roots.</li>
    <li> It works great and loved the price.</li>
    <li> When I received this flat iron, I was very excited to try it out.  I have used quite a few flat irons and a variety of brands.  There are a few things that I like about this iron - it is thin and heats up fairly quickly compared to other flat irons that I have used in the past.  I have wavy and frizzy hair, about shoulder length, and it does wonders.  It is extremely easy to use and allows me to straighten the hair near the top of my head and scalp.  It has digital setting which I don&#x27;t mind.  I could, however, do without the temperature in Celsuis.  I would much prefer to have it in Fahrenheit.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great flat iron.  I think it is worth the price it is currently at on Amazon ($59.99).  There are several other flat irons that I have tried that are just as good but a lot more expensive.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me her opinions of this straightener, since my hair is very short and straight:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  heats up quickly, has adjustable heat levels; I like the thumb rest that prevents my hand from sliding up toward the hot part when I’m using it; it has an auto shut off if I forget to turn it off.  I’d say it’s worth the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly a con:  mine is in Celsius (goes from 130 to 230), but the back of the box says it heats up to 450 F ( and gives instructions to use 235 F for fine hair, 345 F for medium hair, &amp; 450 F for think hair).  This isn’t a big deal because I just figured out where I like it, but some people might be annoyed by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially the product refers to Farenheit in packaging, but the display is in Celsius, as if it wasn&#x27;t designed for the US market, but has been repackaged to sell her..  as she said.. not a real big deal, once you know your setting, its what you use..</li>
    <li> I haven’t taken the time to use a flat iron in a while but after using this one, it makes me want to take the time to use one again.  I have curly, frizzy hair and the Millennium Flat Iron takes the frizzy out without leaving my hair looking like I used a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up quickly and is easy to use.  The swivel is a must and makes it easy to move the iron around the head.  Great addition to my hair styling routine.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I really like this flat iron!  I have bought several in the past few years and they have all always burned my hair or just didn&#x27;t do what I wanted them too. The TS-2 has completely changed how I style my hair.  I can now curl it with ease and straighten it without fuss.  I have very thin hair so I need something that will not damage it further and this so far hasn&#x27;t done any new damage.  The flat edges allow me to get very close to my scalp without burning myself and I can even use this to curl my bangs.  Normally when I curl my bangs with a flat iron I have a weird crinkle, but with the TS-2 I don&#x27;t have that problem.  I really hope this styling tool last forever because I am definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> This product has so far been awesome and sweet to use!  I have a different branded straightener with a flat paddle that is gold.  It is old and each and every time that I would swipe my hair through it would painfully snag my thin hair.  Each. and. every. time!  This flat iron is great and the nano plates feel so silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat this flat iron comes with a 3 year warranty!  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.  The titanium mirror plates allow smooth sliding while the surface is anti-bacterial.  The rapid heat up claims to reach maximum temperature within 30 seconds; once I pressed the button on the plates were burning and the blister on my finger is proof of that.  Another great feature for travelers is the DUAL VOLTAGE ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that was a minor peeve: the digital read-out for the temperature is in Celsius.  The product heats to 450 degrees F but the read out will be in Celsius.  Not a bother for other countries but not so much for myself born and raised in America.  The conversion isn&#x27;t second nature in our household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin, long and wavy.  I turned the iron on and within 1 second was able to use.  I did not raise to a high temperature for fear of what the heat would do.  The plates are just very hot...  I lowered it to 130 degrees C and it was able to smooth and straighten my hair while I watched television.  I was able to go so close to my roots and behind my ears where the hair tends to curl.  This experiment was done without any product.  My hair looked neat and smooth!  There were no fly away hairs and it felt silky smooth.  This has never been possible with my old iron.  The maneuverability because of the swivel cord made it a breeze for once.  I also was pleasantly surprised on how light the product was.  I did not experience shoulder fatigue or carpal tunnel in my hand as other times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see an issue in the future when the digital display goes out and truly hope that it will not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this flat iron because of the generous warranty, rapid heat up time, long swivel cord and most importantly the NANO REFLECT TITANIUM plates.  I truly see a difference that these plates provide when it comes to even heat distribution and smooth maneuverability..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this flat iron because of the generous warranty, rapid heat up time, long swivel cord and most importantly the NANO REFLECT TITANIUM plates.

    <li> Great flat iron. Heats up quickly, and gets the job done, plus I love the shape. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> My hair naturally curls into tight spirals, and finding a flat iron that will actually get the job done and get my hair straight from root to tip is a chore.  Wider irons don&#x27;t get close enough to my scalp, so I end up with curls and waves right at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TS-2 is a narrow iron that lets me get right to the base of my hair and straighten it out well.  The plates are also long enough that if I wanted, I could do large sections of my hair at a time.  The plates heat up fast, and I like that it has a digital readout for the temperature.  The temps are displayed in Celsius, so if you&#x27;re used to Fahrenheit only, that is a bit of a problem.  But with a little conversion, you can figure out which temp works best for your hair and just keep the iron at that setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have an on/off button rather than a switch, which depending on how you hold the iron can be easy to bump on accident, but overall, this is a great flat iron at a good price.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It leaves my hair nice and silky!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome. I have thick hair with cowlicks and a single pass leaves it smooth and silky.  I like the design, easy to wield.  Not as popular as some others but I find it to be far superior to the Chi I previously had.</li>
    <li> My wife used to have beautiful, thick, straight hair when we met.  After our first child, her hair developed wavy curls in it (which I think are still beautiful) and 10 years later, it is still that way.  As my hair is short and straight to begin with, I felt that it would be much better to try this product on my wife than on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plugged the flat iron in and tried the heat at the 200C that the thermostat was initially set at.  The iron advertises that it is ready to use in about 30 seconds and while I did not have a stop watch in hand, I would agree that 30 seconds was about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, my wife’s hair is nice and thick and in order for the flat iron to work optimally, we had to turn it all the way up to the max setting of 230C.  Once the heat was turned all the way up, the iron worked beautifully.  My wife’s hair glided effortlessly through the heat plates.  With about 5 minutes worth of work, my wife’s hair went from wavy and curly to mostly straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife did most of the testing and thus the comments are mostly from her.  The iron is very lightweight and even after being on for about 10 minutes, the handle was still nice and cool.  The swivel cord is an ingenious feature that really helped keep the cord straight and not bunch up under the iron.  The rounded end makes the iron easy to slide under your hair close to your scalp without burning you.  The digital thermostat is easy to set and easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent quality product and one that we would recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW: May 15, 2014&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of use the flatiron stopped working. I would turn it on but it would not heat up. I contacted the company by email and three days later they replied instructing me to return the iron and they would send me a new one as soon as they received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mailed the iron on March 21. Five weeks later (May 1st) I had not received a replacement, so I again emailed the company. No reply. Sent another email on May 8th. No reply. On May 14th I received as a replacement a different model flatiron, the [[ASIN:B002C89MJI TS-2 Hybrid Professional Styling Iron]]. It is a very basic flat iron with none of the features (digital, auto shutoff, dual voltage) of the 3-month-old Millennium that I returned. I checked the company website and the Millennium no longer appears on their product page - perhaps it has been discontinued? I don&#x27;t know because there was no explanation for the substitution and my emails went unanswered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that a product can be defective. I liked the Millennium Flat Iron and originally rated it 4 stars. If the company had stood behind their warranty and replaced the defective iron, my review would have remained at 4 stars. However, I no longer have a Millennium Flat Iron. Mine lasted 3 months and then died. I appreciate that a replacement flat iron was eventually sent, but the customer service experience should be better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I liked the original flat iron, I can no longer recommend buying it because, if it breaks, you may not get a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW - 4 Stars: January 6, 2014&lt;br /&gt;The TS-2 Millennium Flat Iron is replacing a Chi that I have been using for the past five years but has now stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TS-2 has a nice shape with a rounded tip and thin design making it easy to style my short, frizzy hair. It heats up fast and in about 30 seconds it was ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron defaults to 180C every time I turn it off. I want the heat at 200C so I need to remember to turn it up each time I use it. A small annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dual voltage for international use is nice to have but the downside is a much thicker cord that is a little more clunky to use than the flat, lighter weight, 110-only type cord. It took a few weeks to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side edge of the plastic outer casing gets quite hot. I have short hair and have to be very careful not to brush my neck when getting close to the hairline. My old Chi had an outer housing that stayed cool to the touch and I miss that safety feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the way the TS-2 styles my hair and if it lasts five years like my last iron I will be thrilled.efaults to 180C every time I turn it off.

    <li> I love my new flat iron. It&#x27;s slim and sleek and easy to store away when I&#x27;m not using it. The controls are clear and it&#x27;s nice to have a flat iron that works so well.</li>
    <li> I am African American and I have very thick kinky hair. After trying to straighten my hair with Andis ceramic flat irons, I decided to some research on flat irons. I read that people with thick hair should use titanium plate flat irons so I decided to search for some. I have to say after using these, I said goodbye to the salon! They are so easy to use and grab your roots! My hair is so soft and shiny! The cord is super long and doesn&#x27;t twist like the other cords! These are perfect and I am so happy I can straighten my hair again. Oh and they curl very well because of the shape. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> The TS-2 Millenium flat iron makes my hair feel so good (not crunchy) and I would love to say it&#x27;s my favorite flat iron. BUT, 3-4 weeks after purchase it would no longer stay turned on while in use. As soon as I pick it up or start moving it around, it turns off. There must be a short in the cord somewhere. Problem is, since it&#x27;s been more than 30 days since I purchased it off Amazon, I can no longer return it. So I&#x27;m stuck. Which is too bad because I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love the design of this, it&#x27;s really smooth and sleek and allows me to straighten my hair or even add a little flip without getting weird crimps. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that I sometimes turn it off accidentally due to it having a button instead of a switch. But it&#x27;s a small inconvenience.</li>
    <li> This is a striking upgrade from my $20 Revlon flat iron. This iron requires only a couple passes over my very thick, curly, long hair to straighten it. This saves me a lot of time and means I can straighten my hair more often. What is really nice about this iron is allows me to add the finishing curls at the ends of my hair without switching to a curling iron. It handles very well which allows me to do more with it. It heats up quickly and I did not notice any smell during my first uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the handle does start to get a bit warm after a while.</li>
    <li> Sleek, well designed and actually top performing flat iron. Instead of making you feel like a beta tester, they have thought of everything--even down to a full nine foot power cord that swivels so it never gets tangled. The temperature gage works exactly like you expect, delivering real time information and the flat iron actually delivers on that super high temperatures without burning you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried this on three people and all enjoyed the product, found the controls responsive and smartly located and 2 of the three were impressed at how nice a better flat iron could be compared to their entry level units they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the auto shut off feature was adjustable instead of taking a FULL HOUR of non use before it turns off. That is about the only complaint I could find and it is such a tiny thing that I couldn&#x27;t remove a star for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run and don&#x27;t walk to grab this at the current price (about half of list).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helped you and please let me know if you have any further questions!</li>
    <li> One of the reasons I use a flat iron is because I have 2 crazy cow licks at my hairline that make my bangs go in all crazy directions.  This is the best flat iron I have used for getting right down to the hairline and pulling those suckers straight.  Basically, if you need an iron with a lot of maneuverability, this one does a very nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a screen that indicates the temperature the iron is set at.  This can be changed by pushing either an up or the down button.  For my hair, which is medium to fine, I set the iron at 180 degrees (the default and lowest setting) and the iron did a great job getting my hair smooth and straight.  These buttons are on the side of the iron.  One potential problem is that these buttons, along with the on/off buttons, are easy to hit with your hands and I have inadvertently shut this iron off at least once in the month that I have been using it.  Normally I would deduct a star for this but I am so happy with how close I can get to the hairline that I can&#x27;t make myself take off a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I love this iron because it makes my crazy cowlicks look shiny and neat (something that my previous flat irons didn&#x27;t do well).  The only drawback is the placement of the buttons.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a flat iron, although I&#x27;ve probably needed it. I have fine, rather straight hair. But, what body I do have can cause cowlicks and problems that only a flat iron can truly solve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works well to solve those problems. I can control the heat, and the iron does not seem to damage my hair. It works quickly and smoothly, making it very easy to tame the wayward turns of my chin-length hair. It is also easy to manage - even in my inexperience and clumsiness, I have succeeded in not burning myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint about this flat iron is with the on/off switch. It seems rather persnickety, opting at times to not respond at all. Sometimes the iron will turn on first try, but other times it takes as many as five or six presses to get the iron turned on. This happened the second time I used the iron, so it is not caused by wear and tear. Perhaps faulty wiring?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, though, this is a great iron! I&#x27;m delighted with the quality and the function.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron ever it easily smoothed my edges, and gave my hair a phenomenal shine without weighing it down. My only complaint is its hard to curl with these but I&#x27;m sure with some practice I can get it right ;-)</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straightener. The two other straighteners I&#x27;ve had were on the cheap side and they worked okay, but it&#x27;s a big difference between those and TS-2 Millennium Professional. I love how fast it heats up, love the very smooth plates that glide so smoothly over my hair, love the precise temperature control and the automatic shut off. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I worried that I left my straightener on, so glad to finally have one with automatic shut off (hard to find for some reason) The curved design is also a big plus, very easy to add a soft curl. I had been thinking about getting a CHI, but I&#x27;m so please with the TS-2 there is no need. Great straightener at a good price.</li>
    <li> The TS-2 Millennium Flat Iron is a great iron.  With three girls in the house, all with different hair types, we are very picky about the flat irons we like.  We have tried many different brands (Chi, Revlon, Croc, etc.)  This is one of our favorites.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well, if not better than the Chi, which up to this point has been our favorite.  Before this flat iron, I didn&#x27;t think you could be a Chi.  I like it much better than the Croc as the size is easier to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that you can adjust the heat, and the auto shut off.  I also like that you don&#x27;t have to pass it over your hair more than once to get a silky, smooth look.  My 17 year old daughter has very coarse hair.  In fact, we have it permanently straightened once a year.  She still has to use a flat iron and the only one that has worked for her in the past is the Chi.  She says this one works better than the Chi and takes less time because she only has to pass it through each section of hair once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it, it&#x27;s a great iron.  It&#x27;s durable and works great!</li>
    <li> This is my second TS-2 flat iron.  My first one  lasted right around 3 years.  I would highly recommend it to any one looking for a flat iron.  It&#x27;s by far the best flat iron on for the money.</li>
    <li> This straightener does it&#x27;s job, however, the cord drives me up the wall. Out of the package it was fairly straight, but once I started using it, the cord started kinking up and now I have to fight with it every day to keep it somewhat straightened out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she really likes it.  She had a Chi before and I think she likes this one better!</li>
    <li> Works great leaves hair feeling silky and Shiney</li>
    <li> I have 4a texture hair and this flat iron does a really great job with straighten  my curls!</li>
    <li> The TS-2 Millennium flat iron has a sleek design and rounded edges that make it a dream to use.  The plates are high quality which allows the flat iron to glide through my hair like silk with no pulling.  The rounded tip makes it so easy to get close to the scalp for better straightening as well as for use on bangs. The controls are on the side and easy to use, you have an on/off button and then a plus or minus button for heat control.  The digital read out is on the top of the flat iron and is easy to read and lights up in green. I really like how light weight it is and less bulky than other flat irons.  The only issue I have is that I have to turn the heat up higher on the TS-2 than on the straightener I am replacing it with. I have a Babyliss Pro Titanium and I used the heat setting 375 but on the TS-2 I have to use 410.  I tried 395 but it didn&#x27;t seem hot enough.  I hope this is not an indication that the flat iron is not heating properly.  I have been using it for a few weeks now.  I am going to reach out to the company about this.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just go get a Chi or a Babybliss or use your clothes iron.  This thing worked nicely for like 2 or 3 months and then it just kaput died.  It would not turn on.  I didn&#x27;t drop it, smash it, shock it, or anything.  It just died.  No way a flat iron this price should die in 3 months.</li>
</ol>
