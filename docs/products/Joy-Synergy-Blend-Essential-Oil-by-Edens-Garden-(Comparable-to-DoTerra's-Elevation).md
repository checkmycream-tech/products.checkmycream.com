      <li>I actually liked this product.</li>
      <li>Maybe the rose?</li>
      <li>Kind of reminds me of my grandma&#x27;s house.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like rose scented things because....</li>
      <li>and it adds a nice scent.</li>
      <li>VERY GREAT PRODUCT SHIPPING IS FAST</li>
      <li>love the scent and it does make you feel a sensation of happiness.</li>
      <li>I smell a lot of the rose in this oil, but with a citrus type note to it as well.</li>
      <li>Their Breath Easy blend is super awesome...</li>

      <li>Love this oil.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting more citrus notes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I think it would have been more floral smelling without the Ylang Ylang, that oil seems to add a spiciness to it that I was not expecting.</li>
      <li>I use it for many things in my home.</li>
      <li>I love this blend, it makes me feel more energized when I diffuse it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It may be okay for someone else though.</li>
      <li>I just love it,  will buy again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really wanted to like this.  I&#x27;m new to the whole EO thing and still trying things out, but to me, this smells like bug spray. :(</li>
    <li> I actually liked this product. It is indeed uplifting and a great pick me up for my afternoons.</li>
    <li> This product is as described but a blend might be better bought some where that it can be smelt first. It a flowery and citrusy smell, cheery but strong.</li>
    <li> Add to your favorite carrier oil for a real massage treat.</li>
    <li> Not near the quality of Young Living and Doterra.  Ok to use for perfume but definitely not therapeutic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too perfumy.  The scent bothers me.</li>
    <li> I received this the other day and will give it a chance.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed anything yet as far as mood enhancing.  However, I&#x27;m sorry to say I find the scent awful.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes because I can only tolerate the smallest amount of that smell.</li>
    <li> Holy stink! This is NOTHING like doterras elevation.  I love elevation, but was hoping to find something more affordable but similar in scent...this isn&#x27;t it!  Seriously, I am only even using this for &amp;#34;deoderizing&amp;#34; my doggy because it isn&#x27;t AS bad as stinky dog, and because I feel like I have to find SOMETHING to do with it since I paid for it.  I didn&#x27;t think it smelled like body odor specifically, but when I had others sniff the bottle, that was their exact impression of it.  As a substitute for doterras elevation, THIS &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; is an epic fail.  Most of my Edens Garden oils I have been VERY satisfied with, though.</li>
    <li> I will definitely continue to buy these oils. They are comparable or exceed other popular brands and the prices are unbeatable!</li>
    <li> I intended to buy the &amp;#34;muscle relaxer&amp;#34; version of these oils, and clicked &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; instead (this brand carries so many!)...But I&#x27;m using it in sesame carrier oil on my own &amp;#34;trial basis&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m pleased with the AEROMATHERAPY qualities (don&#x27;t feel too much joy with my silly mistaken click during ordering).</li>
    <li> So so happy with this wonderful essential oil.  I was hoping to replace my number one favorite essential oil by YL because of the expense. This is a wonderful replacement.  Smells very very similar. Smells identical in the diffuser. I use this scent as my perfume and in my body and hair products. I think this is even a nice enough product for this purpose. Thanks so much for making it affordable!</li>
    <li> I love this blend, it makes me feel more energized when I diffuse it. Lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this oil, its the reason I started purchasing from edens garden. Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. It definitely has the potential of being an uplifting scent, but there is just way too much going on in this bottle. It has a citrusy overtone that is almost in a war with the floral undertones which just make it smell kind of gross. If you are sensitive to smell and want an uplifting scent I would recommend the bergamot scent sold by edens garden rather than this.</li>
    <li> As far as personal care is concerned when it comes to the use of essential oils, Joy essential oil synergy blend is a great product to reckon with today. And, it means much to me. I don&#x27;t think there is no woman who doesn&#x27;t want to care for her skin and ensure that it is healthy, smooth and good-looking in every way imaginable. My outward appearance is part of my self-esteem. Nothing makes one look ugly than to have wrinkles and skin irritations all over the body. These things have been a terrible challenge to me. Yes, I have used a number of traditional medicines and some over-the-counter medications, but all to no avail. Most of them only work to suppress the problem, they don&#x27;t help to deal with the root. Another thing I could say is that using such remedies for a long time might have some side effects. I think it&#x27;s just like living on drugs. As far as I know, most medications have one side effect or the other. On the other hand, using a natural remedy that is friendly to the body is a better choice. So, I can use this product over and over again for a long time without the fear of having any negative effects on me. I would say it was a great thing to have this from my hubby a few weeks ago...I couldn&#x27;t tell how he came to know about the potency of this synergy oil, but I feel great each time I use the oil. For me, there are no allergies, though sometimes, I use it in combination with my body cream. It&#x27;s just on my own personal judgement, though there is a claim that body cream promotes acne. I won&#x27;t dispute that at all. That is not my concern. With this synergy oil, the reverse has been the case. More so, I want to believe that since it is made up of 100% natural ingredients, it would be safe for use on all kinds of skin. The smell is good - there is nothing nauseating about it. It has really helped me to combat inflammation and acne. My skin texture has changed a bit in the past few days. I know the acne problem would eventually fade off. I don&#x27;t think that I would use my body cream again without mixing it with Joy synergy essential oil blend. Another major aspect is how this essential oil blend stabilizes hormonal ups and downs in the body. Thanks to my hubby who ordered it for the family. It&#x27;s a great product indeed.</li>
    <li> Seemed a bit &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; compared to similar brand.  Other than that, the aroma was wonderful and I enjoyed using in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> I used to use Young Living -- that&#x27;s more of a MLM type oil.. Excellent but overpriced so peeps can make $ by referring people. Why I bring this up-- edens garden is just as good, reasonable prices, excellent customer service.  They are 100% pure therapeutic oils-- the nicest Compant to deal with also. And ps- their packaging of the gift sets is adorable :)</li>
    <li> This essential oil blend was very understated.  Most members of our family thought that it smelled like baby wipes so I ended up giving it to a friend who appreciated the scent.</li>
    <li> It did improve my husband&#x27;s mood when I put a&lt;br /&gt;little behind his ears...I have used it for myself as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the essential oil world so I e been trying several and trying to make my own scents. Not too good at it to say the least. I ordered this because it was comparable to Dotteras brand and I&#x27;ve smelt that before and liked it. However I do not like their prices for oil! Anywho u give this 5 stars. It&#x27;s affordable and I absolutely love the smell. It is most definitely a joy to smell this oil. :) big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This brand is much cheaper than the Young Living Oils and serves the same purpose. I am glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Uplifting, clean scent. The scent is a refreshing, earthy citrus blend with summer flowers.  Great for your oil burner, as it makes any room in the house smell incredible. I would also use this as a fragrance for the body...unisex appeal. Definitely one of my favorite essential oils from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> Same pleasant smell /always puts joy in my heart , a wonderful way for me to start the morning a few drops of joy on my heart</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after a friend recommended another brand&#x27;s &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; blend to help with my postpartum depression. This one is lots cheaper and the smell is lovely! It has a musky, floral, woodsy scent. I can feel a certain lightness in my spirit and find myself smiling when I have this oil going. Maybe it&#x27;s just the lovely smell but maybe there really is therapeutic value. I love the scent! I have an ultrasonic humidifier that I use (cheaper than a specially made diffuser and multipurpose, plus those specially made ones are really just small humidifiers!), I&#x27;ve made my own spray with water and a little Epsom salt, I&#x27;ve stuck a cotton round in my a/c vent, and I&#x27;ve been known to sniff straight from the bottle. Love this stuff. Planning on getting the 30 ml jar next :-)</li>
    <li> I love this oil,  I wear it everyday.  To me I smell almost a baby powder smell in this fragrance,  does anyone know which oil in this possibly smells like baby powder? I just love it,  will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very aromatic, like stress relief a lot better.</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Use on me and massage clients!:)</li>
    <li> I thought it smelled like soap when I first opened it, and that was a bit disappointing. However, it smelled amazing when I diffused it. It really lifted my mood, calmed my nerves, and even gave me a little energy boost. My husband loves it and describes it as a \\&quot;fun\\&quot; smell. Don&#x27;t give up on it after the first whif!&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy with the shipping speed and everything else I have purchased from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> I love this smell not to strong and vey nice in diffusers</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. There is an after odor that reminds me of something that has sat and gotten old. It might just be that one of the essential oils in it is just not to my liking. Maybe the rose? I don&#x27;t like rose scented things because....it reminds me of things my Gma had that had gotten old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be okay for someone else though.</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells just like the young living but for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> hoping this helps with fighting off the winter blues.  so far, so good.  will order again from here.  very pleased.</li>
    <li> I would have to create a blend of the oils listed in this blend to determine what I really think.  There are so many oils in this I can&#x27;t tell what part of it makes it unappealing to my nose.  Much like the &#x27;love&#x27; blend, I find this fragrance not for me, but unlike the &#x27;love&#x27; blend which has not brought any compliments or complaints, I find this fragrance unappealing and would not apply it to my skin (diluted) again.  I have several other fragrances I would choose over this one... and would not include this one in my rotation.  The blend has too many hints of other fragrances that do not smell like any of its parts... like the smell of paper... and dust.  It&#x27;s possible that the oils found in this blend do not compliment one another...the term &#x27;Joy&#x27; does not come to mind... trying not to be too harsh as choosing oils for pleasant fragrance is so subjective... I&#x27;m not suggesting there is an issue with quality here... the review is just based on opinion and preference.  Sorry, EG.  I do love some of your oils and blends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guilt over this review compels me to share the EG oils I do like.  Their Sweet Orange is yummy-smelling.  Their Breath Easy blend is super awesome... as is their Cleaning blend.. No complaints from their peppermint, clove, and muscle relief blend are great.  I have not purchased any oils from EG that I wanted to return except for one... and I&#x27;m discussing that one with the company to ensure the product did not suffer any damage somewhere along the line.  I won&#x27;t review that one until we figure it out.  I look forward to trying out other EG oils.  Love the price and I LOVE finding so many uses for each.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thankful I purchased this product at 65% off (7.95+2.99 shipping) because I honestly do not like this combination. I feel like the citrus notes are so heavy that you can&#x27;t smell any of the other notes. It doesn&#x27;t smell or feel properly harmonized. I&#x27;ve purchased many combinations including geranium, jasmine, ylang ylang, rose, rosewood... on Etsy and this one pales in comparison. It even gives me a bit of a headache. I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it. Perhaps others will have a better experience.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for someone. They were very pleased that this smelled just like the YL product.</li>
    <li> I love the scent! I use a few drops in the bath and as a perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells great! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other Edens Garden oils and have loved them all.  Great quality.  Just not a fan of this particular scent.  Kind of reminds me of my grandma&#x27;s house.  Not in a good way.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scent and it works well as a dab on the wrist or in a lamp ring to scent a room.</li>
    <li> the nicest joyful scent. i love it. i rub it on my temples before bed and I go to bed happy. Really it&#x27;s just lovely. Plus eden&#x27;s garden makes the best quality stuff!!</li>
    <li> Very powerful rose scent. Not really what I expected but not terrible. It&#x27;s personal taste,  not the product&#x27;s fault. :)</li>
    <li> There is nothing delightful about the scent of this oil. It truly smells like a funeral home or an international store, not the light citrusy scent I had hoped for. The geranium scent is overpowering.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a great product. I was looking for something that is good and affordable since this is something you continue to use over and over.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review on something you smell since our smelling experience is relative to personal preference and something quantitative. That said, I hoped the bergamot and jasmine would be a bit stronger in this blend, but I think the geranium is really the strongest note.  This is still a nice scent, but I have been mixing it with additional essential oils to get the smell I was going for, which is more floral and light, rather than the earthier smell of Joy.</li>
    <li> Oh JOY! A perfect delight! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this scent. I use it for many things in my home. including homemade beauty products. it has a very fresh scent and has a very uplifting fragrance. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just received this at it smell wonderful and refreshing.  I have diluted it and use it to freshen up my home.  My children are allergic to all those chemicals in plug-ins and carpet powders, but the essential oils work well.  I would highly recommend this blend.  Next I am going to try the Relaxation Synergy blend, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> Love the company! Love their products! I have several of their oils and have been so happy with each one. This is the only oil that I have not been 100% satisfied with. It is too heavy on the floral notes. I was expecting more citrus notes. It smells more perfumey to me than a natural blend like their other synergy blends. I have contacted Eden&#x27;s Garden in regards to their 30 day money back guarantee. I will update this review, after I return the product to comment on customer service.</li>
    <li> I add this to the water when running baths for my children.  It reminds me of Aveda&#x27;s Fire 3 that I used to have during massages at the salon.  Perfect for relaxing and finding positive energy.</li>
    <li> Not the fragrance I hoped it would be. It kinda smells like cleaning product.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  Smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Meh, this scent is nice for candles in my home, but I would not wear it as a perfume. It is a pleasant smell, but a very &amp;#34;grandma&amp;#34;ey smell. We all love our grandmas and how they smell, but I don&#x27;t want someone thinking I&#x27;m a member of AARP at 23.&lt;br /&gt;I do put this in soy based candles at home and enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> I smell a lot of the rose in this oil, but with a citrus type note to it as well. I think it would have been more floral smelling without the Ylang Ylang, that oil seems to add a spiciness to it that I was not expecting. Still a great smelling oil, and I&#x27;ve also used this one in a carrier oil for my skin.</li>
    <li> love the scent and it does make you feel a sensation of happiness.</li>
    <li> Lovely, uplifting scent.</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Different than used to. But very uplifting and fresh. Love it</li>
    <li> Not as good as most oils. It seemed like it was diluted too much.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought a diffuser.  Love my oils.  So much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Priced fairly, quick delivery, smells great and promotes relaxation and overall peaceful feeling.  Bought this for my daughter also and she loves it as well.</li>
    <li> the smell is really strong , a little bit too strong for my taste but is ok , is not bad or anything</li>
    <li> this smells fresh and light and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;mixes well with carrier oil (I&#x27;ve used cocnut but prefer almond)&lt;br /&gt;fragrance persiists well on skin</li>
    <li> enjoy all the many essential oils I&#x27;ve purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of the Joy Synergy Essential Oil. I put it in my laundry and it adds a nice scent.</li>
    <li> My new favorite! It smells divine! I&#x27;ve mixed this with some unscented hand/body lotion and&lt;br /&gt;I find myself looking forward to using it everyday. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I do Young Living Essential Oils, although they are 100% pure with no other chemicals or additives, Edens Garden has wonderful oils as well. I would definitely order from them all the time.</li>
    <li> I have to just say, I am in love with Joy. I have been using EOs for about 20 years now. Last fall a good friend of mine gave me Young Livings Joy and I fell in love. However, when I ran out, I started researching an alternative blend that was a bit more affordable. I came across Edens Gardens. I have heard people using their brand with great luck so I decide to give it a try. While the smell is not exactly the same as YL, it is very comparable and I still feel good wearing it. I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few of my friends who also like YL brand.</li>
    <li> I struggled a LOT with feeling happy. I bought this in hopes it would help me improve my mood. It does just that. The smell is amazing. It helps my whole family feel happy and it&#x27;s just an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this one. I have used it to scent my cleaning supplies, and want to try it in massage oils as well.</li>
    <li> Heavy on the orange note and not my favorite blend.  Wish I could smell the floral notes more.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a few oils from Edens garden. I love them all and they are high grade!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this JOY blend essential oil by Edens Garden.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> This smells great, near replica for YL Joy. Really like the smell</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS IT SMELLS AWESOME AND I FEEL GREAT WHEN I USE IT I USUALLY PUT IT IN MY HAIR WITH OTHER OILS TO GIVE THE COMBO A GREAT SMELL!!! VERY GREAT PRODUCT SHIPPING IS FAST AND I CANT COMPLAIN!!!</li>
    <li> dIDN&#x27;T REALLY LIKE THIS BLEND, REMINDED ME OF OLD LADIES!</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant, herbal scent.  The price is great and I like the oil, but the scent does not last on me.  It could just be my skin-type.  For the cost, it is worth a try, and I would buy it again if it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Great value, excellent product, prompt shipping. Recommended.</li>
    <li> When I first smelled it from the bottle, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was something I would enjoy. It has a sharp almost a citrus scent to it, or pine. But then I put it into my oil warmer, and the room was filled with soft floral, woodsy, lovely, fresh and calming scent. I think bergamot is the one that I recognize the most, and something slightly piny...very slight. Anyway, I em thoroughly enjoying this scent, its making me very happy and I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> All of there products are excellent!</li>
    <li> Love this! Very close to YL&#x27;s Joy. This blend is uplifting, playful, comforting. I will probably purchase this blend again.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. I can&#x27;t afford the more popular EO&#x27;s that you have to order from a rep. So I tried these. They smell great and don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; smell like the cheaper brands. Also the smell lasts. I researched their company a bit and am really happy. This is the only brand I will buy from now on! If you look on their website, you will see all the oils they offer. Amazing selection and quality!</li>
