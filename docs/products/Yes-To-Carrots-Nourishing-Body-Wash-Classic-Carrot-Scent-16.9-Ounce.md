<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is by far my favorite body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell!  I love that I am not itchy after I bathe because it lacks harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;And I love that most of the ingredients are natural.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use regular body wash again!</li>
    <li> I love this brand and this soap in particular is a very clean scent. Have and will repurchase again. Love that it is cruelty free too!</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS NOT THE ONLY THING ARTIFICIAL! all of the ingredients in every single box is the same whether it is labeled cucumber, tomatoe or grapefruit etc, IT IS ALL THE SAME INGREDIENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and had been searching for quite some time for a bodywash that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I decided to give Yes to Carrots and was pleasantly surprised! The scent is subtle but wonderful smelling! It leaves my skin feeling really moisturized unlike other soaps I&#x27;ve tried. I even use this on my toddler who also has sensitive skin and it seems to work well for her too. I feel great knowing it is 97% natural as I try to avoid products with a lot of chemicals and unnessecary additives. It&#x27;s now my favorite go-to bodywash!</li>
    <li> I first found this at a drug store.  When I ran out, I was able to scan with the Amazon app, [...] and order right away.  It arrived (as always - thank you, Amazon) 2 days later.  I love the scent, it lathers just the right amount, and leaves my skin soft, moisturized and clean.  Contains organic ingredients.  Plus the dispenser top is very convenient. And one bottle lasts me at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is great for eczema.</li>
    <li> Love the wash BUT- the bottle is definitely NOT arthritic friendly...have to really squeeze to get it to come out!</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every product in the YTC line, and I found this one to be great.  It&#x27;s cruelty-free and it lathers easily without the need to use a lot.  It smells excellent as well.  I brought this with me on my honeymoon and the small travel sized bottle lasted me the entire week and then some.</li>
    <li> First bought this gel in Israel because it had Dead Sea Minerals.  Very sudsy and nice natural smell.  very economical compared to other gels.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, I have tried virtually every lotion, and body wash, in hopes of curing these dry rough spots on my arms and legs.  I used to use steroid cream but really didn&#x27;t want to apply that to the more sensitive areas of my body.  I decided to go the organic route, couldn&#x27;t hurt right?  Nothing else was working, and all the chemicals in the other stuff can&#x27;t be helping.  This body wash is AMAZING!  Not only is my eczema \\&quot;under control\\&quot;, the longer I use it the better it gets.  Now you do not have to have a skin condition to use this so don&#x27;t get me wrong.  If you want amazing skin then use it.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy greasy feeling on my skin.  It hydrates and nourishes your skin!  I have also noticed a significant decrease in body breakouts since using this body wash.  A little on a poof goes along way, it lathers so well, and it smells so good.  I bought this two months ago and am still not 1/2 way through the bottle and I use it daily.  I will use no other body wash.</li>
    <li> Great love it, so soft and nourishing but effective as a cleanser, too.</li>
    <li> VEGAN ORGANIC CRUELTY FREE!!! Do yourself a favor and join the Yes To movement! I love all of their products. Especially the smell &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Love it, and it does not burn my toddlers eyes.</li>
    <li> I love all the \\&quot;Say Yes To\\&quot; products! They are excellent and organic and that is all I am using now for myself and my kids too! They all smell great too!</li>
    <li> The amount of fragrance and alcohol used in this product made my eczema flare up really terribly within 30 minutes and I have a very mild case of it. This is my fault for using a product that has fragrance in it, though.  It is not all organic and still contains parabens.  This shampoo does smell pleasant and lather pretty good but I feel like it leaves my hair gross feeling and weighs it down. The conditioner you use with this is really bad, I&#x27;d suggest not investing in any of these products. It&#x27;s a great idea and concept but needs a bunch of improvement.  It&#x27;s a step up from the other cheap shampoos and conditioners you can buy but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the nicer high end shampoos such as Redkin. I&#x27;ll take my parabens back until we find a better product.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff!  It smells good and lathers up nicely.  The price is much better than Targets so I will keep buying it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great Body wash! I love this product. I love the whole say Yes to Carrots line. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I love that it&#x27;s paraben free and doesn&#x27;t have all the creepy chemicals in it. i recommend this to anyone who is looking to go parben free or all natural for their beauty products. i just wish they made makeup! :)</li>
    <li> This body wash is wonderful and I will be buying it again. With very little product on a puff it has a rich lather that goes a long way. It leaves my body feeling very clean! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this body wash. I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product - it is not worth its price. It&#x27;s OK as a shower gel, does its job (though I would not say it&#x27;s moisturizing). However, the smell is too cloying and artificial for my taste - I could smell nothing like carrots or melon. Would not recommend and would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love they way this stuff leaves my skin feeling and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong lasting smell.</li>
    <li> Smells like baby powder, and leaves my skin dry.  I wont buy this item again, have shoved it in a cupboard as a back up if I run out of the good stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells great, a little goes a long way, it gets a great EWG score, and even my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> IT IS ALL NATURAL, IT GOES  A  LONG WAY MAKING IT ECONOMICAL.  THE  SUDS  ARE FAIRLY  SMOOTH  AND  A SMaLL AMOUNT  DOES MAKE A GOOD AMOUNT OF BUBBLES.  IT DOES NOT DRY MY SKIN  BUT  I AM NOT  SO SURE IT DOES A REAL GOOD JOB  OF MOISTURIZING . ( NOT A BAD ONE )  IT DOES NOT HAVE A MUCH SCENT  AT ALL.  THE THING I HATE IS  THE LID.  IT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.  A SIMPLE  SQUIRT  OR PUMP LID  WOULD BE A MILLION TIMES BETTER THEN THE ONE  THEY HAVE NOW.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. It does the job... cleans me. It&#x27;s a good price. I like that it&#x27;s organic. I need to use a lot to get suds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this body wash ever since I decided to proactively try to get SLS out of my shower products.  This body wash lathers really well even without SLS in it, smells good without being really perfumey, and lasts forever and a day.  Most moisturizing body washes make me feel like I have a layer of oil left behind - but this one rinses nice and clean which is a huge plus.  Both the carrots and grapefruit body wash are my favs.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed by this. I was expecting some sort of scent, carrot or otherwise (as I don&#x27;t really know if carrots do have a scent.) But it was very bland, straightforward soap. If all you&#x27;re interested in is the natural and health aspects of it then you might like it. I will be hoping to go through this quickly so I can get something else I like better.</li>
    <li> The scent of the product is so wonderful. It&#x27;s a light fragrance that I look forward to daily. My skin LOVES this product. I use this as a shower gel and shaving gel, and my legs were growing irritated with my previous shower gel. When I started using this product, all my razor burns and dry skin vanished. Seriously can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this shower gel!</li>
    <li> I love the Yes to Carrots collection of products. The orange bottles shampoo and body wash has a pleasant scent. The price in the stores is a dollar more and I found it on Amazon for a lesser price. The best part is  95% Natural&lt;br /&gt;  Petroleum, SLS, &amp; Paraben Free&lt;br /&gt;  Cruelty-free</li>
    <li> Loved the smell of this product. Clean and sweet gender neutral scent that my husband doesn&#x27;t mind using. My skin felt clean and lightly moisturized after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Con: the lid does not snap open very wide so you have to squeeze pretty hard to get any product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again. Product was added to my subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam as much. I use my body buff puff to create a lot of foam. This rinses cleanly and non-drying. Gotta say that I love this one.</li>
    <li> My husband struggles with eczema, so when I went on my latest YES TO buying spree, I made sure to order some YES TO Carrots products for him. I got the Body Wash and the Daily Moisture Body Lotion. I even threw in a little something for myself; the Repairing Night Cream. We completely fell in love with the YES TO Carrots line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you need to know that my husband is not a person who likes to use lotions. Even scented body washes bother him a lot. He just doesn&#x27;t like artificial products loaded with unhealthy ingredients, such as Paraben, Petroleum and SLS. He won&#x27;t even use a toothpaste with SLS in it, and boy, try finding one without (that&#x27;s the stuff that makes it foam up)! That being said, I was thrilled to have discovered the YES TO line. Their products are almost 100% natural and they don&#x27;t contain any of the yucky stuff mentioned above. Most importantly, though, they actually WORK. His eczema got much better and he never - not even once - complained about the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the lotion and the body wash as well, all throughout my pregnancy and after giving birth. In fact, I am still using them and have no plans to switch to something else. These products helped me with the hormonal changes in my skin - such as breakouts, uneven skin tone, red blots, etc. The body wash doesn&#x27;t foam up much, but as other reviewers already said, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very pleasant and delicate. My skin loves the YES TO Carrots line. It&#x27;s smooth, clean (completely grease-less!) and refreshed after every use. I can not recommend these products enough!</li>
    <li> This doesnt leave me feeling like my skin has been stripped of it natural oils.  The newer bottle, however, is a little difficult to squeeze so it&#x27;s a waiting game when you&#x27;re in the shower.  Love the Yes To Carrots body butter for after the shower on my driest areas, gets rid of desert skin.</li>
    <li> Great Product, soft clean fresh scent and doesn&#x27;t dry you out. I find my self alternating between this and naked bees orange blossom and honey body wash.</li>
    <li> This product i bought at Target with a deal with a Yes to Cucumbers body wash and the carrot conditioner.  Thought it was the shampoo and realized it wasnt half way into putting it on my hair...it didnt matter.  My hair is so soft and ALL of my dandruff is GONE!  I had horrible patches of psoriasis in two places on my scalp that used to get really flaky and peel off and get weepy...not anymore. I will never use another product again. This saved my scalp and hair....for a third as much as Nioxin and works ten times better.  I use it on my 2 year old son...the smell reminds me of what baby shampoo would smell like if it were natural.  Cant sing the praises of this stuff enough.  A friend recommended that I also try the Yes to Tomatoes face scrub and the carrot face lotion line. I think i will try it out.  She loves it and had combo skin but her boyfriend has oily...works for both of them &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I used to use a lot of drug store soaps like Dove and Olay and I found myself smelling really pretty but my skin not feeling the greatest even when I put my lotion on. I decided I wanted to make a switch to a more natural soap without all those harsh chemicals used as fill ins in most of those types of soap and I am glad I did. It smells nice but the smell isn&#x27;t lasting which I love especially during the summer when all the buggies like to follow you around. You can feel yourself being cleaned but not striped of moisture and my skin has a nice healthy glow to it now. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s well worth the purchase (it&#x27;s also available at walmart).</li>
    <li> Everything in a body wash I was looking for. Non-scented and smooth and soft. It leaves my body feeling great after a shower.</li>
    <li> I really like this shower gel.  I have eczema and this product has really worked for me so far.  I will definitely continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Weird smell, do not like.</li>
    <li> This is my go to body wash. It lathers nicely. The price is fantastic. I use almost exclusively Yes To Carrots products. I can say without hesitation that the quality is there, the price fantastic and the results speak for themselves. My skin is soft. This leaves no film or residue. I use a Japanese Salux cleansing cloth with this product. It lathers nicely. The Salux cloth has an exfoliating effect and  when combined with the lovely suds of the bodywash, make for a wonderfully refreshing shower experience. My skin glows. I also love that Yes to Carrots lists on the front of every product what percentage of the product is natural. In this case being 96% natural. I finish with their body lotion.</li>
    <li> This product is as advertised. It works great. It smells good and you feel clean when your done. I have bought 3 bottles of it now and I will continue to buy more!</li>
    <li> I have been using this wash for over a year and cannot say enough good things about it.  My skin if very soft and I love the fact that it is sulfate free.  I use this on my child and even have my mother hooked on it, too.  I like the smell of this better than the other Yes to products.  I received a great deal on these bottles with free shipping through Amazon.  A bottle at the local retailer will run about $10 but it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thought it would smell more like carrots but oh well!</li>
    <li> Judging by how many people love this product, I would say give it a try.  For me, the product smells okay, but I don&#x27;t like that the scent lingers so long.  More importantly, I thought this natural product would be very gentle, but it irritated my feminine areas.  I am using it up as a handwash, but I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> THe fragrance is divine and it feels good. The price is unbeatable and it doesn&#x27;t have the bad stuff. I have been buying it again and again</li>
    <li> I go through this body wash in epic quantities (it&#x27;s my favorite and I shower often because of a physically active careers). Finding it on Amazon for over a $1.00 less per bottle than at Target was awesome. If you haven&#x27;t tried this before, it has a fresh clean scent that (to me) doesn&#x27;t really scream carrots but definitely smells great. It lathers well and a little bit goes a long way. I found that when I started using it regularly, my skin felt a lot less dry from frequent showering.</li>
    <li> I love how moisturizing this is and the smell is so wonderful. I will definitely be purchasing more of this when I run out.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft all day long when I use this. I won&#x27;t buy anything else now that I know how great this stuff is. A little bit lathers so well that this bottle should last a long time! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I love it!  I have very sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use just anything.  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals is an added plus.  Since I first tried this product I switched all of my body products hair, lotion, lip balm to yes to carrots.  And shopping on Amazon purchasing with the subscribe and save is an amazing deal</li>
    <li> Definitely has a carrot scent. I was hoping it&#x27;d be a bit less than it is. It&#x27;s also REALLY difficult to squeeze the body wash out, I have to use to hands. But it lathers well and certainly provides a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Great gel, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out or make it feel tight. Pleasant smell but not overwhelming/perfumy. The only thing I would change about the product is the container - would prefer to have a pump versus the cap it has. When you have little product left and turn it upside down to store it (to make the gel come out faster) it leaks. Have purchased at least 8 of these and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I love it because it lathers just feels really good. I usually don&#x27;t use shower gel, for some reason Im  allergic to something in them, but I took my chances with this as a 98% natural product and it works great :) I just purchased the Yes to Tomatoes shower gel so excited to try that out.</li>
    <li> This wash has an unbelievably great scent.  It lathers well and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.  This is by far my favorite soap to use.  Compared to other stores, this is a great price as well.</li>
    <li> I love Yes to products, and this one&#x27;s a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;A small amount is needed to produce a soft, smooth lather!  I end up putting a tad too much on because I love the way it feels!&lt;br /&gt;Kind of smells like carrots, but it&#x27;s not a strong smell by any means.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin feeling moisturized after rinsing!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;no lotion needed afterward\\&quot; comments.  It&#x27;s winter, and I need some freakin&#x27; lotion.  I purposely didn&#x27;t put some on this morning for this review--yeh, just checked--dry skin alert.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be purchasing Yes to&#x27;s body butter for that problem.&lt;br /&gt;Anywho--great size bottle for the price (about $9 in stores).  It should last well over a month and a half at least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> This was a random purchase for me. I&#x27;m SO glad I found this! I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizing shower gel that doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. This gel is perfect for someone with extremely dry skin. I don&#x27;t have to use ANY lotion afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I keep touching my skin. I can&#x27;t believe how super soft it is...without lotion! Amazing stuff! A++</li>
    <li> Yes To Carrots Nourishing Body Wash- Cleans &amp; Smells great. Our whole Family uses and I don&#x27;t have to worry about&lt;br /&gt;sulfates.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!  Made the switch from Method (because I couldn&#x27;t buy Method online anymore) to this and very happy with how this products smells and feels!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 8 and has eczema. I had her using a Neutrogena body wash thinking it would help hydrate and cleanse gently, but it was too strong. Yes to Carrots is gentle, smells great, and her skin is already much softer and hydrated after only using it for 10 days.</li>
    <li> Smells clean, rinses away without residue and actually feels nourishing with regular use, we found this out our local grocer and have since purchased other products from this line. It is quality, lathers a lot, smells fantastically fresh and the design of the bottle seems to dispense controlled amounts almost. We find it lasts longer in the shower than the big bottle of Dove body wash we used to buy.</li>
    <li> Say yes to Carrots shower gel is a great product. (1)A small amount lathers well and a bottle last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;(2)It has a great smell (3)It feels great on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;My house guest always comment on how well they like Yes to Carrot shower jell. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This shower gel is gentle on sensitive skin, moisturizes dry skin, and leaves you feeling soft all over.  Plus, it smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It&#x27;s a,translucent kind of milky-white color and it&#x27;s comes in a big bottle. A little really went a long way, I only used a quarter-sized dollop for my entire body (126 lbs and 5&#x27;6&#x27;&#x27;). It lathered really, really well. It has a pleasant, kind of baby powder smell. Will purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all the bottles in the carrots &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; line, it can be difficult to squeeze some out the first or second time, because they fill it up to the brim without any air at the top. After one or two uses, it has a little air inside and it&#x27;s a lot easier to get out. But I appreciate nixing the extra packaging and filling it up with product for the consumer. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with the smell of this body wash.  It does not smell like carrots but it does smell very clean and soft which I love.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying Loving Naturals Unscented Aloe Vera Body Wash, and found that this soap has the qualities that make me happy (natural, non-toxic, well-priced, clean scent) and that make my husband happy (suds, clean, non-girlie scent, easy on his skin). It does not smell like carrots - just fresh and clean. And it helps with keeping my dry skin a little less dry. I doesn&#x27;t leave a residue of any kind, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture in order to get it really clean. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on facial skin (although I prefer using a face cleanser). Great product and Amazon ships and delivers as promised!</li>
    <li> I use this as shampoo....i love it nothing else cleans and softens my hair like it....id recommend the conditioner as well,</li>
    <li> It does not seem to smell very much like carrots, but the smell is quite nice and neutral enough. The bottle is pretty large, so it is good value, but it is not always easy to squeeze the body wash out, maybe a pump would be more convenient. Also, even though it is supposed to be all natural, organic, paraben free and such, it stings quite a lot if it gets into any wounds (or into your eyes), so I would not recommend it for very sensitive or atopic skin.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious but does not last long on the skin. Careful not getting even a tiny drop in the eye: ouch!</li>
    <li> Gentle and smells great. This product does not irritate my child&#x27;s  sensitive skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> A pleasant-smelling, richly lathering bath gel. The gel lathers up nicely, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. The scent is mild/natural and doesn&#x27;t linger as anything other than a hint of \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GF and I both use the same bath gels, and I&#x27;m sensitive to fake fragrances, so we look for natural products that are strong enough to get me clean, but not hard on her skin, and don&#x27;t smell excessively gender-specific-- I don&#x27;t want to smell like strawberries + candy and she doesn&#x27;t want to smell like musk + pine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other criteria are they not be drying or harsh, and don&#x27;t have any of the cloyingly fake smells mainstream bath gels often have. This \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; gel seems to hit all of my demands, I&#x27;ve been very pleased so far. I don&#x27;t experience any irritation despite my skin generally being sensitive. I first started using \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; products with their heavy hand cream, and was impressed-- and continue to be impressed. We&#x27;re trying the \\&quot;cucumbers\\&quot; version of the bath gel next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great, natural shower gel, and surprisingly inexpensive, especially using Subscribe+Save.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> THE BODY WASH IS PERFEKT FOR YOU WHO HAVE VERY DRY SKIN. AND IT SMELL VERY GOOD. REKOMENDATION THIS WITH THE YES TO CARROTS INTENSE LOTION.</li>
    <li> This is my first sulfate free body wash.  I was surprised how well it lathered.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this.  The packaging is fantastic.  It is big but doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  I have been a Dove girl for so long but I found I like this just as much.  Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I discovered Yes to Carrots and absolutely love this product!!!!!  I&#x27;am one of those people who is chemical sensitive.  How many times I feel like I cannot breath with the scents in many products.  By chance, I got the body lotion first and notice the scent was mild, pleasant, my skin didn&#x27;t burn after use.  Also, took the itchiness right out of my skin, and my skin started to heal immediately.  Now I use all of their products, even the night cream.  What a difference this product line has done for my skin.  What is great, the product&#x27;s are affordable.</li>
    <li> It makes a good lather but does not have a very strong smell.  I guess this could be good because I really don&#x27;t want to smell like carrots, but there&#x27;s no good smell that lingers on your body either when you get out of the shower---just clean.  It lasts a long time but the cap is poor at dispensing so I keep the cap off.  I wanted a shower gel without chemicals for a good price but I don&#x27;t think this fits the bill I was looking for.  Will keep searching.</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves your skin feeling incredible.  We purchased it for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The air here tends to be dry, especially during winter... and our water is semi-hard; we wanted something to help our skin recover.&lt;br /&gt;2. We&#x27;re tired of having adverse reactions to washes and soaps that rely heavily on intense synthetic chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;So far, we couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this shower gel.  If used correctly, it will leave your skin feeling incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few tips worth considering:&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t expect lots of foam, here.  If that&#x27;s very important to you, you may want to look elsewhere.  I&#x27;d suggest giving YTCarrots a shot, though - I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;2. A little goes quite a long way.  If you tend to use a lot of shower gel, you may want to back off just slightly.  This gel leaves a slight moisturizing sheen on your body that you may want to rinse off completely.  The more you use, the longer you&#x27;ll need to stay under water in order to completely rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;3. You may or may not want to keep a bar of dial around for really dirty days.  If you work in a garage or outside often, you may not want to ditch your tried and true bars quite yet.  I&#x27;m not sure YTCarrots was really designed for extremely tough grease or grime.</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash my husband will use! He likes the way it cleans compared to other natural body washes, and I love the way it smells</li>
    <li> No pthalates. No parabens. Made with carrots and ingredients my body likes. Smells good. Makes me happy to read the label.</li>
    <li> This is the only shower gel i buy for my boys and myself.  I love the smell and it leaves your skin feeling soft.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Great nourishing body wash, with no strong smell.  Great because it can be used by the whole family! Keeps skin hydrated</li>
    <li> Smells great and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, the price is great compared to other well known organic brands.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and how much it lathered. However, it caused a very light burning sensation on my female area. I didn&#x27;t want to believe it since the product is natural so I went back to my current body wash for a day and then tried the carrots again and experienced the same results. I will use it as hand soap in my liquid pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> love love love this clean light body cleanser</li>
    <li> Ahh the smell is great! I just love this product!</li>
    <li> I love Yes to Carrots and I&#x27;m happy to have found the Yes to line of products in general. I use the Yes to Blueberries for my face needs, but I used carrots for the body wash. It changed from orange to white and I&#x27;ve noticed a decline in the dispenser lid quality. I have to squeeze the life out of the bottle to get it to dispense any soap. I have tried to clear the pathway and it doesn&#x27;t help. So something happened with this line&#x27;s dispenser lid. I have the shampoo and the conditioner and both of those dispense fine. This is the second bottle of body soap where the dispenser lid is a serious issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to review this for a few weeks now. I used to love this body wash, it was gentle and smelled great and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It also used to be 99.8% natural, but the bottle I just received says it&#x27;s only 96% natural. I thought that I had ordered a different kind by mistake because the bottle was different too. Unfortunately, when I checked the Yes To website this is the only carrot body wash they sell, and the website now says it&#x27;s only 95% natural. Not great... my skin is really sensitive and I can tell the difference between the new and old formula. And what&#x27;s up with the new cap? Ugh, time to find something else :(</li>
    <li> I used the Cucumber one and it was great, now I use the Carrot one and it is fabulous.  All you need is just a drop on your bath sponge and it lather&#x27;s up so much.  The smell is divine.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like carrots, it just smells great.  It is a natural product so I am comfortable using it on my skin.  I love this, I will definetly be buying this again.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower gel!  I love it because it&#x27;s all natural &amp; organic &amp; it&#x27;s good for your skin.  I just ordered another bottle, but I still have quite a bit left in the first bottle.  It&#x27;s never too early to reorder!  I would recommend this to everyone!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely amazing....soft &amp; fresh with a rich lather!!  My new fav.</li>
    <li> very nice, love the Yes proucts</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell and lathers great. One of the better deals from this company.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, except I have issues with the bottle it came in. It might be a one time, only mine thing, but it is super difficult to squeeze out. I have made sure it is all the way open, and I honestly cannot find an actual issue with the bottle or lid. But it is a battle getting it out. I&#x27;m gonna end up putting it in a different bottle, and hopefully my next order doesn&#x27;t have this problem (if so I will update my review). Beyond that, it&#x27;s a good body wash. I think that it smells like baby powder, which I found pleasantly surprising. But if you don&#x27;t like the smell of baby powder, then this isn&#x27;t the body wash for you. I also like the size, as it should last a long time. I love Yes To&#x27;s products, and this is another success in my book.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Price a little high.</li>
    <li> My teenage kids use this body wash and absolutely love it! Very pleasant scent and it rinses cleanly without leaving an icky residue.</li>
    <li> Fast ship great product I will def order from you guys again. This great product is the best part of my regimen. Can&#x27;t wait to try everything else in this line..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash with a puff for a year and a half with no issues. This size bottle can last a year with conservative use. The puff is great for extending a small drizzle of the body wash. I have sensitive skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, dryness or itchiness. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I twice received defective caps so I stopped buying them. So annoying! The product is adequate.</li>
    <li> My new favorite body wash, I was worried about the smell, but is a sweet nice fragrance.  My skin is soft, and you just need a small amount for a great lather.</li>
    <li> Pros: Good smell, leaves body feeling clean and not overly drying, free of petroleum, no SLS, no Parabens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
    <li> USES THE FOR YEARS.  GREAT BODY WASH. LEAVE THE SKIN FEELING GREAT.  AND NO PERFUMES</li>
    <li> This is a very basic body wash offered at a very decent price. It&#x27;s thicker than most inexpensive body washes which is good BUT the cap isn&#x27;t so great. My hands are kind of weak from years of typing and you have to really squeeze this sucker to get the product out. Not good. It also has a noticeably &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; scent. This is why I can&#x27;t rate it any higher than a three. It works fine, lathers up well, and gets you clean but its claims of being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; have me giving them the stink eye. It smells almost perfumey and not all like either carrots or melon or anything found outside of a lab so I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I develop allergies to shower gels (start sneezing during/after showering) so I prefer milder gels. This smells very &#x27;natural&#x27; (in a good way), and a bit like baby shampoo! Creates a good amount of lather. Leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized, but without that &#x27;coated&#x27; feeling. Smell lingers slightly.</li>
</ol>
