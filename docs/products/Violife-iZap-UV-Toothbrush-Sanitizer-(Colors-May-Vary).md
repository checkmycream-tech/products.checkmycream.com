      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I can sanitize my tooth brush no matter where I am -- great traveling kit for the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>ANOTHER GREAT GADGET.</li>
      <li>great cast to keep and sanitize toothbrushs in</li>
      <li>WORKS GREAT WITH THE BRUSH ATTACHMENT OF MY ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH.  </li>
      <li>It is working great.</li>
      <li>Purchased this for my son, who loved it while it worked.  </li>
      <li>Aside from a premature death, its a good unit.  </li>
      <li>I own two of these, one for each suitcase I use.  </li>
      <li>It was yellowed with age as if it had been laid out in the sun for years or stored someplace awfully warm.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m more relieved knowing most of the airborne germs that would land on my brush are now banned!</li>
      <li>This product worked great for the first 6 months.  </li>
      <li>This unit remains the simplest, sleekest, most mobile, and the most preferred of my two toothbrush cleaners.</li>
      <li>ALSO ANOTHER WAY TO STAY HEALTHY.</li>
      <li>Five HEALTHY Stars.  </li>
      <li>That kept up for maybe two more weeks.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>, we are pleased.      </li>
      <li>I have traveled with so many electronics with switches that manage to turn themselves on with motion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good product.    </li>
      <li>Then sometimes when I shut the case, the light would not turn on, but I was able to jiggle it to get it to work.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use.</li>
      <li>This case fits easily in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In slightly under a year of use, and twice-a-day brushing, both of my units have functioned flawlessly.  </li>
      <li>of use was fine with this model.</li>
      <li>After 6 minutes, the light automatically shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I arrive as a destination and the light is on.  </li>
      <li>The bulb doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up well at all to fit in a suitcase.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller to request a refund or exchange, but they told me I needed to provide them with an RMA number that was written on the original box in which it was shipped.</li>
      <li>I travel extensively on business and was delighted to find this unit in my Houston luggage store-though for far more money than Amazon!  </li>
      <li>the case comes with one nice toothbrush with medium soft bristles.</li>
      <li>This worked just fine for the first couple weeks.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to find one that was large enough to fit most toothbrushes and that was easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>REASONABLY PRICED, CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
      <li>5 weeks is an absurdly short life span for a device of this kind at this price</li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>I read about sanitizing cases and saw how economical these were.</li>
      <li>So, naturally, that means I&#x27;ve used many UV sanitizers.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the same kind as I have</li>
      <li>However, there are still many standard brushes that will fit.      </li>
      <li>but this was the first &#x27;portable&#x27;</li>
      <li>However, there are still many standard brushes that will fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>4 weeks after first using, it died.</li>

      <li>The first one didn&#x27;t function when it arrived</li>

<li> I use a regular zip-up men&#x27;s toiletry case in one travel setup, and a fancier toiletry case from Victorinox in the other setup.  </li>
<li> Dry your brush with a towel before throwing it in here and into your suitcase.</li>
<li> so I always have a dry brush to put in my case.</li>
<li> I followed instructions and even took the advice of another buyer to dry the toothbrush before returning it to the case.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s that dry.</li>
<li> I read that after brushing, the toothbrush should be relatively dry to preserve the bulb for longer life.</li>
<li> Just remember to wipe your toothbrush dry before inserting it.  </li>
<li> possibly 1/4\\&quot; wider than the average brush case.  </li>
<li> It was not treated roughly, the toothbrush was always dry when inserted, all instructions were followed to the letter.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very, very dry here.</li>
<li> Because it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;s actually working, one only can judge toothbrush sanitizers on longevity and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The container also functions as a closed toothbrush storage area for one toothbrush.  </li>
<li> Purchased mind in December and 6 months later its dead.  </li>
<li> It was not dropped or handled in a rough manner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a pretty good product.    Zaps the germs when I am on the road.    Worth it.</li>
    <li> The  white plastic was yellow, it looks like an old article.</li>
    <li> We had a bit of a problem getting the device to work.  Then my husband thwacked it.      Other than that, we are pleased.      I took the batteries out for when we aren&#x27;t using it.</li>
    <li> I own two of these, one for each suitcase I use.  I travel extensively on business and was delighted to find this unit in my Houston luggage store-though for far more money than Amazon!  I&#x27;d seen the home models but this was the first &#x27;portable&#x27; I&#x27;d seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is constructed of a clear plastic front, a white plastic back with a slot for batteries, and a molded inner case made to hold the brush on its side.  When the brush is placed on its side with the neck in the soft clip, then the case is shut.  There is a little finger molded into the clear front that depresses a switch upon closing.  This action turns on a small UV light tube aimed at the bristles.  After 6 minutes, the light automatically shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read uncomplimentary reviews of this device complaining about battery terminals failing, etc.  I find it amazing that someone would put a wet brush in this case; did they do this with their prior cases?  Nasty.  The brush should be dried as much as convenient before replacing in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews complaining about the size of the case.

This case fits easily in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel 25-50% of my month on business.  In slightly under a year of use, and twice-a-day brushing, both of my units have functioned flawlessly.  I haven&#x27;t had to replace batteries in either unit.  I appreciate having no external switch to turn on/off.  I have traveled with so many electronics with switches that manage to turn themselves on with motion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, though, that one needs to be careful when purchasing a replacement brush for the original provided.  The fad right now is to make brushes with big fat heads, and these won&#x27;t fit.  However, there are still many standard brushes that will fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not criticize the plastic construction or the fact that a wet brush can&#x27;t be placed in the case.  After all, this is an inexpensive device.  I would not want to pay 3-4 times the price for a prestige stainless version, sealed with German precision.

    <li> This product worked well for about 5 weeks and then just died for no apparent reason.

    <li> Five CLEANSING Stars!! As simple as a product can get. After use, wipe the manual or electric toothbrush to remove all moisture or shake it vigorously, put the DRY toothbursh into this IZAP UV Toothbrush Sanitizer, close the case door which automatically turns on the &#x27;killer ultra-violet light bulb&#x27;, and the job of killing e. coli, salmonella, strep, lysteria, pseudomonas, and other unspecified germs is done in only 6 minutes. Then the bulb automatically turns off. The container also functions as a closed toothbrush storage area for one toothbrush.  BTW the case comes with one nice toothbrush with medium soft bristles. Great idea for home or on the road! Requires 2 AAA batteries which are not included; the UV bulb is included and rated at 8000 hours, 90 day warranty. This unit remains the simplest, sleekest, most mobile, and the most preferred of my two toothbrush cleaners. My Highest Recommendation. Five HEALTHY Stars.  ***UPDATE: the bulb ceased lighting after 120 days but I&#x27;ll take the blame because it WAS due to excessive moisture which caused one of the battery terminals to rust-the one which can&#x27;t be seen unless you remove the three  phillips screws on the back. I cleaned the terminals, put in new batteries, and the UV bulb ignited: the new batteries lasted about 6 months, but your mileage may vary. Just remember to wipe your toothbrush dry before inserting it.  This unit gets My Highest Recommendation !!! ***</li>
    <li> I received this product and opened it about 3 weeks later for Christmas only to find that it did not work. Apparently, the UV light bulb had been broken, probably during shipping. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this item online, since it&#x27;s so fragile. The chance to receiving a damaged product is quite high, in my opinion. I contacted the seller to request a refund or exchange, but they told me I needed to provide them with an RMA number that was written on the original box in which it was shipped. Of course, I had thrown away that box a long time ago, not presuming that the item would be broken. So, now I have $25 less and a broken toothbrush sanitizer. I would NOT recommend buying this product online.</li>
    <li> great cast to keep and sanitize toothbrushs in</li>
    <li> This product worked great for the first 6 months.  It started acting up afters six months and now it is dead.  Tried new batteries several times.</li>
    <li> Bulb broke after a couple months. The bulb doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up well at all to fit in a suitcase. Very sad cause it seem to be functioning quite well in those two months. Are UV bulbs this hard to make solid? Oh well, now I have an extra tooth brush in a plastic case. Would only recommend it if you don&#x27;t plan to travel much with it.</li>
    <li> If you use an electric toothbrush, you&#x27;ll have a hard time getting the toothbrush head into this, as the space is rather tight.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel. Runs a long time on batteries. Takes a beating in my suitcases but has kept working for years.</li>
    <li> I had this product for about seven weeks before it died. A very short life span for a $20.00 product. I followed instructions and even took the advice of another buyer to dry the toothbrush before returning it to the case. It was not dropped or handled in a rough manner. The UV bulb must have burned out or shorted. It is a great concept ruined by either poor materials or poor design. Save your money. Don&#x27;t get zapped by iZap like I did....</li>
    <li> I have had the same UV and ozone toothbrush sanitizer for the past 5 years and it has never given me any trouble.  When I went to buy one for my girlfriend I couldn&#x27;t find the same kind as I have so I shopped around for something else.  I wanted to find one that was large enough to fit most toothbrushes and that was easy to clean.  My old one is difficult to keep clean because of the ridges and nooks and crannies it has.  I chose the Violight iZap over the other products on Amazon because of it&#x27;s ratings, price, and the appearance that it would be easy to clean.  It actually would be easy to clean if it worked long enough to need cleaning.  The first one didn&#x27;t function when it arrived so I sent it back.  The second did fine until it was just outside the 30 day return window.  Then it quit and hasn&#x27;t worked since.  Based on my experience with this product, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This worked just fine for the first couple weeks.  Then sometimes when I shut the case, the light would not turn on, but I was able to jiggle it to get it to work.  That kept up for maybe two more weeks.  After that, the thing would not light at all.  I tried replacing the batteries to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not into disposing of and replacing items like this after just a couple months.  I am hoping to find a more permanent solution (perhaps from a different manufacturer).</li>
    <li> No frills with this case, put your brush in, close the case, and don&#x27;t stare directly at the UV light. Auto off in 6 minutes or so. Durable plastic, toss it in the suitcase and forget about it. Only cons, won&#x27;t take the largest size brushes, and no venting slots in the case. Dry your brush with a towel before throwing it in here and into your suitcase.</li>
    <li> Purchased mind in December and 6 months later its dead.  Tried new batteries and no go.    Aside from a premature death, its a good unit.  My other complaint is while packed in luggage the unit would turn on.  I arrive as a destination and the light is on.  No idea for how long, but for sure not good on the batteries.    Wish someone made one that was rugged for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an admitted obsessive when it comes to tooth care. So, naturally, that means I&#x27;ve used many UV sanitizers. This one really stunk. Because it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;s actually working, one only can judge toothbrush sanitizers on longevity and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use was fine with this model. But longevity was abysmal. It lasted, maybe, two weeks. I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many have said you can&#x27;t put a wet brush inside the case and expect it to last. I might agree with that, though I think manufacturers can and do compensate for it. In any case, I live in Wyoming. It&#x27;s very, very dry here. A professional carpet cleaning takes just a few hours to dry nearly to completion here. It&#x27;s that dry. Zero perceptible humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why this sanitizer is just junk.</li>
    <li> Even after wiping off the moisture of the toothbrush prior to placing in the holder the item worked for about 2 days. The placement of the toothbrush is too close to the UV. I would suggest not purchasing</li>
    <li> Given all the reviews I should have checked this product as soon as I got it but I didn&#x27;t.  Now that I have, it doesn&#x27;t work. Not even once and now I am outside of the return window.  If you decide to take a chance on this worthless product please try to use it as soon as you get so that you can return it when it fails you.</li>
    <li> I read about sanitizing cases and saw how economical these were. I got one for myself and one for my husband.  I love it. I read that after brushing, the toothbrush should be relatively dry to preserve the bulb for longer life. So I have a second brush and I rotate them so I always have a dry brush to put in my case. i&#x27;m more relieved knowing most of the airborne germs that would land on my brush are now banned!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son, who loved it while it worked.  While it actually worked seemed to work well.  4 weeks after first using, it died. Switched out batteries... nothing, just dead.  Hope to find a brand that really does work.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these and will be getting more in the near future. I can sanitize my tooth brush no matter where I am -- great traveling kit for the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave it a 4 because. It was just like the picture. It was easy to use. I used it to sanitize my kids toothbrushes. It must of worked my kids haven&#x27;t gotten sick since I used it. Great product!</li>
    <li> External package had sharpie and left over tacky stuff from stickers and looked extremely aged.  Opened it ever hopeful. The toothbrush container was not white.  It was yellowed with age as if it had been laid out in the sun for years or stored someplace awfully warm.  Did not even attempt to use it as it looked disgusting.  Returned it!</li>
