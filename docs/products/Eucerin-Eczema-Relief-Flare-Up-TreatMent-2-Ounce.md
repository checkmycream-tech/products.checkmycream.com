<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema for years and have a whole shelf in my medicine cabinet of products I&#x27;ve tried to show for it. This one is now one of my favorites. When I first bought it I used it once or twice, didn&#x27;t see a change, so gave up. I rediscovered it about a month ago and took it on vacation with me because of its small size. Using it every night for a week, I have been really impressed. A lot of the eczema spots on my hands have disappeared or improved noticeably. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt my hands, which a lot of lotions and creams do (even ones labeled as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously different products work differently for people, but this has worked great for me. I&#x27;ll be buying my next bottle soon and I&#x27;ll buy it here because the price is excellent!</li>
    <li> This Product Really WORKS!!!! I have never found  a product that works so well on Eczema before. This is a miracle product. Every time my skin gets irritated I put some on and in about seconds the itching is gone.Its a good lightweight formula as well, not sticking or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;A MUST BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> Item as described, exactly what I want, come it fast and package is good</li>
    <li> Really worked for a spot on my son&#x27;s face with just using it a few times a week. Gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> Works as described &amp; provides extended deep moisturizer relief. My flakey skin went away (do to my excessive scratching).  For me, it also served as an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; cream, as my wrinkles diminished &amp; also helped with bug bite relief.</li>
    <li> This really helps Eczema and makes your hands look great too!&lt;br /&gt;What a relief to find something that does both.</li>
    <li> This product has exceeded my expectations. The cream goes into the skin and starts to work wonders immediately,extremely happy with item.</li>
    <li> I have tried many things, even prescribed creams, ointments, and pills.  Nothing has worked.  This does.  Its oh so smoothing when I put it on and it is not greasy, smelly or otherwise offensive.  Its not expensive compared to a lot of other things on the market, I can carry it with me when I go out in case I get &#x27;that itch&#x27; and need to apply it, and I know its going to work, right then and there.  My problem in on the back of my ears and around my forehead.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I have less of a problem, and what is there is much more manageable with this.  Try it, perhaps you&#x27;ll have the same results I have.  But please remember, we are all different, what works for me, might not work for you. It doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m making this review up, it only means that we are different people with different needs.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t started to use it, but I trust the brand</li>
    <li> This is miraculous for cracked, ashy, weather-beaten skin.  We&#x27;ve suffered from some severe winter weather here in the Northeast, and even wearing gloves and daily use of hand creams and body lotions didn&#x27;t help.  In fact, the creams and lotions lasted mere moments and my hands and feet went back to looking like a cracked, ashy mess.  That is until I tried this product.  It does work.  Within a couple of days, my hands and even my feet feel smoother and look better.  Thank goodness, I&#x27;d almost given up.</li>
    <li> I sometimes get patches of dry skin on my hands that are painful and burn, especially when I&#x27;m stressed. My dermatologist recommended this lotion and ever since I started using it (3-4 months ago), the patches have disappeared completely and have not returned.</li>
    <li> Both the Eczema Relief CREAM and the Baby version of the Eczema relief Cream give almost instant temporary relief to our little one.  Even though it&#x27;s not a permanent solution, this product gave our child the relief they needed to go to sleep without scratching and waking themselves up.  Highly recommend (both the regular &amp; baby versions of the CREAM.. FYI - Amazon currently has this product titled as lotion, but when you look at the picture, it is showing the cream.. and the cream is teh product received.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some form of eczema for more than 20 years. Tried everything my dermatologist suggested over the years. Did some research, and came across this product. No stink, no greasy feeling, reasonable price: it has given me relief from the very first few days, and I use it daily now. Happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered on time, but was packaged poorly. (2 tubes) One tube was broken. Vendor replaced item quickly, and to 100% my satisfaction. I hope they will package my next order better. At least they are standing behind their product and customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this will work for everyone, but if you have eczema, try this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about &#x27;instant&#x27; relief but it&#x27;s pretty good and reasonably priced!  Just got to rub it for a while.</li>
    <li> Love it! My elbows were dry,cracked and sooooo itchy. It was horrible.Thankfully this helped and really moisturized them and made them not as dry and itchy. I will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the product, it is very good!</li>
    <li> I like the thickness of this cream and so far it seems to be helping my baby&#x27;s dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> This had zero affect on the eczema on my arms. Someone suggested &amp;#34;coconut oil&amp;#34; and it did the trick!  It&#x27;s also great for all over moisturizing!</li>
    <li> During the winter months, I have terrible skin problems. This Eucerin is the one thing that is both hypoallergenic and works so well!</li>
    <li> its a sample that&#x27;s not supposed to be resold! its the size of a usb drive and not a actual reg size lotion scam!</li>
    <li> i accidentally bought this unit, but I was looking for other set. There are several units with various prices on Amazon. Try to compare them before purchase.</li>
    <li> I am not really impressed with this product, it did not work. I will not purchase again, it is a decent hand cream but does not help relieve eczema symptoms.</li>
    <li> Much reduction in areas of the skin where there were redness previously. Itchiness immediately soothed upon application of the above mentioned product.</li>
    <li> excellent!!! really gives results and bring relief to my baby s senstitive, dematitis prone skin. great texture, non greasy in touch but rich texture.</li>
    <li> My son has occasional eczema break outs - sometimes they are bad. Our doctor told us to try this product and it works very well. It stops the itching and helps his skin clear up quickly. Each application lasts several hours.</li>
    <li> This cream is everything that it says. My grandson suffers with Eczema very badly and this cream calms his irritation. It is well worth the expense for a small tube instead of wasting money on the cheaper brands that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> May just be a good lotion...but has done nothing for my eczema.  Have a spot on the palm of my hand and it works the same as jergens or any other hand lotion.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever worked like this lotion does on our daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> My son has bad eczema and his doctor recommend this product. He also has to have allergy shots which causes even&lt;br /&gt;more breakouts. This product is a lifesaver for him. It works great and very soothing.</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you thank you for suggesting this product.  I have been living with itchy rashes on the backs of myhands that have come and gone over the past 5 years along with the occasional armor leg itchy patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried many lotions, cremes and even prescription stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creme stops the itch practically on contact and used a bunch of times the first fe days to keep from itches and I was cured inside of a week.  Now I am using it once or twice every few days and the rashes aren&#x27;t coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my best purchases ever from Amazon!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s had eczema since a month after she was born. We were recommended Eucerin when she was 4 months old by a trusted family member. She is now 12 months old and I still use this product,  she hasn&#x27;t had any breakouts using it. I will continue using this product to keep her eczema under control and I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Have very dry skin because I live above 6000 ft. This really softens and hydrates. A bit expensive for the amount.</li>
    <li> It was excellent eucerin</li>
    <li> I have used this on my baby and it is amazing! It has really helped his dry skin and craddle cap. I bought it because the doctor told me to buy a lotion without fragrance and with the ceramide to help with baby&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
    <li> Husband has very dry, cracking elbows and we&#x27;ve tried everything and I mean EVERYthing on them. After using this cream 2x a day for a week, his elbows are 80% better. I like this cream on my legs after shaving, very emollient but not greasy. It&#x27;s difficult to find in a drugstore, don&#x27;t know why. Recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter originally bought this for me after seeing a review in Allure magazine.  My hands looked so bad I wouldn&#x27;t put nail polish on because I didn&#x27;t want to draw attention to them.  I&#x27;ve tried every OTC cream, lotion, soak, etc I could find.  Anytime I would read about something that would help I tried it.  Most would work ok, for awhile.  They would relieve the itching for awhile or moisturize until I washed my hands, but none actually cleared up the eczema.  I never found anything that cleared the redness.  My hands looked like they had been scalded.  The Eucerin completely cleared up everything.  Within a week the itching was gone and my hands weren&#x27;t as dry.  Within a month the redness was completely gone so that even I couldn&#x27;t tell where the eczema had been.  It is expensive, but it works.  I would highly recommend Eucerin to anyone that has skin issues.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream not expecting too much, but it actually worked really well. I have stress related eczema and I only experience it every so often. My doctor did not want to prescribe me the only medication that actually worked for me since it contained steroids. I guess that&#x27;s a good thing, but when my eczema got really bad I didn&#x27;t know what to use anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this since I know Eucerin to be a good brand and I didn&#x27;t want something too pricey. I&#x27;ve been using it every night since I received it and it has helped a lot. It has helped with the itching (most of the time) and the dry scaley redness has subsided. The size of this tube is good for my usage on small areas but if you have a bigger affected area you might want to invest in a bigger size because it probably wont last you long. Overall I think this is a good solution for now.</li>
    <li> If you have eczema, you know the intensity of the itching and misery. This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found to get ahold of it and actually works. As it happens, my dermatologist, probably the best in our state,  recommends this. She does prescribe some cortisone to be used in addition to this for exceptionally bad cases or flares. You should use this after bathing in warm, not hot, water. She suggests I use it twice a day but I seldom need to anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my eczema. Did not even relieve the itch. Did not moisturize.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped extra fast</li>
</ol>
