    <li> A little darker than pictured, this palette is perfect for smokey eye and has both shimmer and matte colors. I would search for other photos online to get a more accurate color analysis.</li>
    <li> It is wonderfully dark and sparkly! I have olive skin and it shows up nicely. The case and mirror is super nice too.</li>
    <li> Bought them as a gift for a friend. The colors are very pretty and pigmented. I bought the Bad Girl palette and it is money well spent.</li>
    <li> creamy, vivid, beautiful. will be buying more. would recommend to ANYONE. just a tip though, I would start with a little bit of pigment and build. some of these are so intense it can make a mess if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try Sleek Makeup palettes because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things. The pigmentation is really great and the palette compact so you can carry it around easily. The black shadow in this palette &amp;#34;Noir&amp;#34; is the deepest black shadow that I have ever used. I would definitely suggest trying Sleek Makeup.</li>
    <li> I have most of the Sleek palettes -- and this is one of my favorites. Highly pigmented, buttery smooth, and beautiful colors. I have pale skin, cool undertone, and dark brown eyes. These cool blue-toned colors are gorgeous on me. Love Sleek Love this palette. I definitely gravitate to this palette when I am going for drama, but I can also use it for day time looks.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purchase of the year!!! I ordered this after viewing a Halloween makeup tutorial and thought for $15 I might as well just buy the palette they show instead of trying to find my own colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off-Worked perfectly for what I needed and lasted all night!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t realize is that I&#x27;d wear it regularly for work! The colors are really tru and they stick around all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy! Very versatile palette</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I ordered this product. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and make-up artist located in Alexandria VA , and I just love the quality in this makeup. A little goes a long way so I know  I will have it for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone, and it was delivered way fast then the estimated time. Is a wonderful product try it out you will love it i brought four different ones and love them all and can&#x27;t wait to order the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joy</li>
    <li> The minerals made me itch. I was excited about it but when i received it. most of the colors mimicked each other.I gave it to a fried and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This palette is great for days when I want a smokey eye. All of the colors are pigmented and blend fairly easily. My only issue would be the fallout; some of the shadows are a bit powdery and flake off under my eyes. This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me and I can fix it by wiping the powder away. The colors are all rich and dark, so it&#x27;s my kind of palette!</li>
    <li> I love my sleek bad girl palette, the shade are nice and dark..... looking forward to creating lovely makeup looks!</li>
    <li> i ordered this palette because of the good reviews .... the shadows have a weird smell they came broken and are not pigmented at all. I totally regret buying this. Not to mention the shadow colors are nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I ordered this. Worth the money. Don&#x27;t even think, just order it as quickly as possible. Yay !</li>
    <li> GREAT colors... LOVE this</li>
    <li> Very pigmented! Awesome palette! My fave!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is perfect and I love it.  I have every palette IDivine makes at this point and the colors are very pigmented and for me stay put all day long.  I get no creases, no fading lots of compliments on the colors of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my eyes different everyday and the multiple colors are wonderful.  The best eye shadow I have found yet for the money&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of matte colors I use the most.  I will continue to buy this eye shadow forever.  That is until they change it like most others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can create a light work eye shadow and liner for daytime and then just add a darker color for night without having to go through a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these shadows and own every palette they make.  Well worth the money.  They last so long.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow. It has amazing pigmentation and application is a breeze. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Omg! Pigment is wonderful.  Im a Makeup Artist on I one of each palette in my kit. Some colors a little chalky but great buy</li>
    <li> a color and  doesn&#x27;t last very longwhen you wear it,.texture and richnest not like seen on the video with the Jamaican makeup artist</li>
    <li> This is my go-to night look palette, but be warned.. if you use these shades without primer, you will regret it. That said, most shadows in this palette are buttery smooth and super pigmented. All you need is a light hand to achieve the intensity of the colors in the pan. You can also use some of the darker shades as an eyeliner so you really get value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the applicator it comes with, but I had no intentions of using that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll buy a few more of these!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to recieve this package!! It is excellent shadow!! Applys very dark which is a plus way better than my cheap store bought shadows. Just recieved my brushes and cant wait to have fun with them. Gave 4 stars because it doesnt last long but i also did not use any primer.</li>
    <li> My daughter liked it very much - it is what she has been looking for. The colors were very well matched</li>
    <li> Very well pigmented! So affordable for the quality. I would re come not to anyone looking for a highly pigments shadow palette.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son&#x27;s girlfriend as part of her Christmas gift - I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it, and it&#x27;s a nice way to try all the colors.</li>
    <li> I was SO EXCITED to get this in the mail to try.. Got it today to open it and find some of the colors crushed and EVERYWHERE. :( Cannot comment on how it works yet... because I&#x27;m to busy cleaning it out of my car and off my clothes from when I opened it. ;(</li>
