      <li>Refreshing/cooling feeling afterward is enjoyable.</li>

      <li>and it does clean and softens those areas.  </li>

      <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Nice big scrubbing particles</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>how effective  it will be at helping to keep my 55yr old skin clear, time will tell.</li>
      <li>I love Avon minty scrub but with the new packaging came a new formula.</li>
      <li>Brand is consistently made.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Feels so fresh and tingly after and the fine scrub does wonders for uneven skin!</li>
      <li>I started my new regimen of cleaning my face with it as soon as i wake up,and then again at night before i go to bed.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and use this with no problems.</li>
      <li>The 8th day, my skin had several large red pimples/hives and more red rough patches.  </li>
      <li>I have bought it from Avon directly for 2 for $7.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap and you wont be disappointed :)</li>
      <li>So after searching online for the original product and not finding any, I took a chance that this would at least come close.  </li>
      <li>The new recipe is not as minty as the old one, and not as cleansing as the previous one too.</li>

<li> It did not help to clear my skin, only dried it up.  </li>

<li> So, while my blackhead issue is lessened, the overall result was pretty bad.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m 44 and routinely get told I look at least 10 years younger.  </li>
<li> The red pustules diminished after treating with plain yogurt masques but the rough patches are slowly healing.  </li>
<li> Now that the formula has been changed, it just like other scrub on the drug store shelves!</li>
<li> I have used this for a few years, trying other things in-between.</li>
<li> Ive never had super bad acne</li>
<li> BLACK HEADS OUT!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for twenty years at least.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Always helps with skin issues.  Brand is consistently made.</li>
    <li> Great product - excellent exfoliant.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 years (they just changed the look of the package but the product is still the same).  I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t use make-up but this product is mild but effective and leaves my skin tingling.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I picked this stuff up at a local flea market for a few bucks and decided to try it.. Ive never had super bad acne but i always break out on the side of my face and chin and it seems like nothing I&#x27;ve tried has helped except this stuff! I started my new regimen of cleaning my face with it as soon as i wake up,and then again at night before i go to bed. As soon as i use this stuff i can feel the pores on my face being cleaned out, it feels great. I have also been using a little nivea soft moisturizing cream afterwards.  so far this regimen is working awesomely.. haven&#x27;t had a breakout in over a month. I encourage you guys to try it.. it&#x27;s cheap and you wont be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of this product for years. The fact that the product has changed very little over the years is awesome. Great exfoliant, a little goes a long way. Leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Meant to be used twice a week.  I use it after I shave, which is not as often as it should be.  But works great, I like the way my skin looks after.</li>
    <li> I LOVED the original Avon Clearskin Cleansing Scrub Exfoliant (the electric blue scrub that smelled like menthol).  I finally ran out of the ones I had in stock and when I went to buy more, I was extremely disappointed to find out that the product had been discontinued.  So after searching online for the original product and not finding any, I took a chance that this would at least come close.  I had to say I was pleasantly surprised that except for the green color, it seems like the same product!  It has the same size scrubbing granules, the same tingly-fresh feel afterwards and it smells the same.  I&#x27;m very happy that I found this and I think I&#x27;m going to stock up for another 10 years before they discontinue this one, too!</li>
    <li> Just the stuff my wife was looking for. She had been looking around a bit and had no luck,  she loves the stuff!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT NO PUSHING ANY DIRT BLACK HEADS OUT!  BABY SMOOTH SKIN THIS LADYS&#x27; IS A MUST HAVE BUY MORE THAN (1)</li>
    <li> Have tried innumerable cleansers.  This is the only one I have ever tried that GETS RID of blackheads.  Worked for me.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it on any area that needs it.  Go gently on the face as the granules can scratch your delicate skin.  But I have used it on my elbows hands and feet as well and it does clean and softens those areas.  Just be sure to follow-up with a good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also check your prices.  I have bought it from Avon directly for 2 for $7.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel dress until I use this product.  it leaves my face feeling cool and clean.  works ever time.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because Avon discontinued the Anew Clinical microdermabrasion, which I loved.  While this is not like the Clinical product it is refreshing to use and feels good on my skin.  I don&#x27;t know yet how effective  it will be at helping to keep my 55yr old skin clear, time will tell.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this face cleanser it&#x27;s the only one that seems to work for her and helps reduce her acne</li>
    <li> I need to exfoliate daily because of my oily skin, so this scrub is great. The tingling sensation after use is great. The grain of the scrub is excellent as well. I feel like I do get a deep clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good exfoliant and nice addition to a beauty routine. It tingles when you use it and gets a deep clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years so I knew I liked it.  It was discontinued in my area so now I order it on line. I am pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. It is a great product. It will be in my beauty routine for years to come.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.  I used it 3 times in 7 days.  The 6th day, I noticed red rough patches near the areas where I used the product.  The 8th day, my skin had several large red pimples/hives and more red rough patches.  The red pustules diminished after treating with plain yogurt masques but the rough patches are slowly healing.  So, while my blackhead issue is lessened, the overall result was pretty bad.  I have oily skin and not particularly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Was not that impressed with it.  It did not help to clear my skin, only dried it up.  I am happier with my current acne soap.</li>
    <li> Tons of granules for an easy exfoliation. Refreshing/cooling feeling afterward is enjoyable. This is my 3rd tube and I plan to continue to use it. Doesn&#x27;t take a ton to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Avon&#x27;s Clearskin Pore Penetrating Invigorating Scrub. I have used this for a few years, trying other things in-between. I always go back to this. It keeps my skin clear and acne free. I hope avon NEVER stops making this! I have very sensitive skin and use this with no problems. I&#x27;m 43 and plan to keep using it. I use Obagi in the AM and this everynight to take the makeup off.  Love it</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL TO USE I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Wonderful scrub with enough grit that it really takes off the dead skin. This product has more scrubbing power than most products, leaving my face smooth and clean. Be sure to moisturize immediately afterward, as this cleaner will remove all the oil on your face.</li>
    <li> I love Avon minty scrub but with the new packaging came a new formula. The new recipe is not as minty as the old one, and not as cleansing as the previous one too. Quel domage! Avon Clearskin scrub was the best one I ever used and I didn&#x27;t find anything else like it. Believe me I tried a ton! I tried many in Europe and many here in the US. None was like Avon Clearskin. Now that the formula has been changed, it just like other scrub on the drug store shelves! I hope Avon will go back to their previous product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for twenty years at least.  It&#x27;s the best scrub out there.  Nice big scrubbing particles so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m just rubbing debris into my pores.  Nice menthol-esque tingle, too.  Don&#x27;t worry about damaging your skin with this scrub --- I&#x27;m 44 and routinely get told I look at least 10 years younger.  You will love this scrub!</li>
    <li> Perfect product for exfoliating. Feels so fresh and tingly after and the fine scrub does wonders for uneven skin! I love it!</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law has been using this product for years.</li>
