      <li>I sniffed it in the store and it seemed ok,</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more. ...</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing two more soon.</li>

      <li>and I love this...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad we tried it out at home at</li>
      <li>but it gets better after awhile.  </li>
      <li>I think the magic of this deodorant (as it is in fact, a deodorizer) is the scent mixing with the herbal fluids to prevent bacteria.</li>
      <li>I still feel like this is my better</li>
      <li>This deoderant smells better than any deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>My daughter love it.</li>

      <li>Great product for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I had already purchased this deodorant and was able to let her smell it.</li>
      <li>Works great for my 5 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for their spray aerosol/isobutane Missy deodorant to become more available, as it&#x27;s still in the UK.</li>
      <li>I love that it is paraben, alcohol, and aluminum free, and with aloe vera.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this for my 8yr old, tried it, and LOVED it!</li>
      <li>What is most important is working.</li>
      <li>It does not stain clothing, and the roll on is more comfortable for her than a stick when applying.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh scent and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong when you first put it on, but it does smell nice to me and does not smell overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Pretty glad I did!</li>
      <li>the other hand, if I could have gotten used to the smell, it would have worked wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply since it&#x27;s a roll-on</li>
      <li>and it dries very quickly without being sticky.</li>
      <li>strong scent</li>
      <li>worry a lot about how strong a smell</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t tell you if this works on adults, or if it works all day, or if it stains shirts, because the smell was so strong</li>
      <li>This seems to work well in preventing odor, but the smell is WAY too strong.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, the smell didn&#x27;t bother me and did not seem too strong.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer said, it is so strong.</li>
      <li>A great option for younger girls who need deodorant.</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Bought for my 10 year old daughter and tried it for myself and bought more for me... Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I did have to explain how the rollerball applicator works and show her how to lightly swipe this under her armpits.</li>
      <li>She was sold on the light ly floral scent.</li>
      <li>I searched and searched for a deodorant that was cruelty free that worked for me.  </li>
      <li>I have gone through so many natural deodorants and none are as effective as this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells good, keeps my seven year old from smelling.</li>
      <li>therefore that&#x27;s normal for her to kind of strong odor...</li>
      <li>The fragrance is strong to get used to at first, but over time it&#x27;s become one of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>For me the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong and is disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>a lot of people think, even if it was, I would rather smell that kind of high end perfume smell than my daughter&#x27;s stinky pits.</li>
      <li>Soft fresh scent is perfect for a young girl.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect size for their small</li>
      <li>She stays fresh all day even after playing in the park and swimming all day!  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and lasted quite a while without a white residue on clothing.</li>
      <li>The natural crystal body deodorant works much better!</li>
      <li>Not so much floral/babys powder, a bit more hippie like smell.</li>
      <li>It goes on cool and dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I searched and searched for a deodorant that was cruelty free that worked for me.  This product is wonderful!  It smells great and lasts all day. Btw, I&#x27;m an adult and I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I am an adult who has had problems with chemical additives. This is working for me. I have used two of them so far. It has a pleasant smell and lasted quite a while without a white residue on clothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; mom. My kids eat cereal with marshmallows and they probably spend more time playing Minecraft than I&#x27;d like to admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;d prefer their first venture into the world of deodorant be one that isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals.  Both my kids NEED deodorant and they both love this.  It smells fresh and it works as long as they use it every day.  It&#x27;s easy to apply since it&#x27;s a roll-on and it&#x27;s the perfect size for their small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started them on a fragrance-free Tom&#x27;s deodorant, but they wanted something &amp;#34;cooler.&amp;#34;  This is the perfect solution for all of us.  I like the scent-- it&#x27;s much better than the alternative!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, but now I am the one using it. I&#x27;ve tried endless different products, from prescription-strength brand names, to all of the usual suspects in the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; category. This is the ONLY ONE THAT WORKS!! I never imagined that a product developed for younger, more delicate skin, would end up working so well. And believe me I put it to the test. So happy I discovered this and will be buying more for myself and my daughter.</li>
    <li> It really works.I&#x27;m ordering more. ...</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the scent. It&#x27;s a liquid roll on. Great for girls!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 7 and has been using deordorant for a year now.  Searched for an organic one, this has a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> I only gave it 3 stars because of the scent.  The purple roll-on&#x27;s scent is much nicer.  But this still does the job.</li>
    <li> My daughter needed a natural kids deodorant. I chose this one based on reviews.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase. It works well. I gave 4 stars because it does leak if turned over making a little mess. Smell is a little strong at first but tames nicely.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent, probably won&#x27;t use it for daughter. Looking for something super natural. Company did very good job getting package to me right away!</li>
    <li> My six year old daughter has started having under arm odor, so after consulting the pediatrician, decided to try a &amp;#34;kid-friendly&amp;#34; product.  I love that it is paraben, alcohol, and aluminum free, and with aloe vera.  It does not stain clothing, and the roll on is more comfortable for her than a stick when applying.  There is a bit of a musk smell to it, which I thought at first was not appropriate for a little girl, but we put it on at night so by the next day it has faded, and it lasts for 24 hours with no problem.  She does have some red under arm skin occasionally, but I found that with other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products as well, and it does not make her feel itchy or irritated.</li>
    <li> Works well but strong scent</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Dries quickly. Works better than the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great product but a little pricey!</li>
    <li> I love this natural deodorant for my 5 yr old daughter! I only use it on her when we go out into public. It has a very fresh scent and it doesn&#x27;t make her under arms sweaty and or icky!!  Great buy, and will buy again!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself as I am allergic to so many things.  Does a great job for odor control.  Smells a bit perfume like but it gets better after awhile.  That does not bother me as long as it works.  I recommend this if you have no allergies to scent.</li>
    <li> My daughter love it. What is most important is working. No more underarm smell.</li>
    <li> I often borrow this from my daughter. It smells great, rolls on liberally, and lasts longer than natural deodorant made for adults!</li>
    <li> I love Terry Mugler&#x27;s Angel perfume so I decided to buy the expensive matching deodorant. Under the so-so reviews for that I saw this deodorant mentioned as an identical scent at a sixth of the price. It arrived within four days and I can confirm the pink version smells identical to Angel perfume. Even if you don&#x27;t like Angel, you will like this deodorant as it is sweet (think chocolate, berries and faint boozy patchouli) without being overpowering. It is also totally clear against black clothing which is why I use it during the day and it dries very quickly without being sticky. It does offer protection but it is natural and targeted toward teens so if you do sweat a great deal I HIGHLY recommend using Certain-dri at night several days a week to close up your pores so you don&#x27;t sweat then use this during the day just for added protection. Using this combo I never sweat a drop and smell fresh all the time. Again, this is a natural product which is important to me but it far exceeds other brands (Toms, Crystal, etc).</li>
    <li> I love that this is &#x27;kid friendly&#x27; and not full of nasty chemicals, but it&#x27;s smell is quite strong. Not a bad scent per se, but one that I think is way too much for a little girl who just doesn&#x27;t want to smell after dance rehearsal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a 8 yr old girl when the local stores only had harsh chemicals and Aluminum in them. It appears to be working however, the scent is really strong especially for the age of the child we bought it for. We may try a different scent next time.</li>
    <li> Perfect solution to my daughters BO issue.  We have not had a stinky day since she started using this.  Very long lasting as well, with no need to reapply.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and goes on nice. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves you feeling wet.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 9 and has no food allergies and has never had any skin allergies so far.  After trying out the product as soon as it arrived, about 3 hours later she was in a panic as her underarm skin started itching, burning and turning red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly disagree that this product is for every skin type and I would advise that you should try it at home to test for any reactions first.  I&#x27;m so glad we tried it out at home at did not just put in on in the morning and go to school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the smell didn&#x27;t bother me and did not seem too strong.</li>
    <li> This product did wonders for my 4 year old. I only have to use it once or twice a week. Love this product</li>
    <li> This is the best of the most natural deodorants out there. My eight year old daughter needed a deodorant and I tried A LOT of the other natural brands and she kept smelling within 2hrs. I actually like the smell, it is not as overpowering like a lot of people think, even if it was, I would rather smell that kind of high end perfume smell than my daughter&#x27;s stinky pits. I now feel comfortable knowing that she is good through the whole day!! I also got the boy one for my 11 year old son and we love it as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Aluminum, alcohol, and paraben FREE! I hated using Tom&#x27;s line b/c (lets face it) they don&#x27;t smell great, in my opinion. I thinks it&#x27;s bit weird for these products to be marketed for children, but if you&#x27;ve been searching for a wonderful smelling NO ALUMINUM alternative to all the chemicals out there... Look no further, plus the boys version smells just as fabulous.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter uses this to control her body odor. She has sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause any redness. It also WORKS.</li>
    <li> Not so much floral/babys powder, a bit more hippie like smell.</li>
    <li> If you like the perfume &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; by Thierry Mugler, you will like the smell of this deodorant. I think it is much too perfumey and strong for a child, and has more of a mature and strong scent for a woman. It works well for body odor, though it is not an antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> This does not work at all on my child!  If I could put no stars I would have! The natural crystal body deodorant works much better! Would not recommend it!</li>
    <li> This natural deodorant is very effective for me, an adult. It has a great smell, different, not sweet at all. Sometimes I rub it on my wrists like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that drying time is a little long.</li>
    <li> Daughter says &amp;#34;Yes, I like that stuff.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My 9 year old likes it and adds that &amp;#34;sometimes it runs out pretty quickly.&amp;#34; ;-)</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my 8yr old, tried it, and LOVED it! I&#x27;m constantly outdoors being active and do my fair share of running. To find a natural deodorant that works, and smells good is such a pleasure. My daughter also likes it. We both have sensitive skin and no issues have been noticed. I will be purchasing two more soon.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 6 year old daughter.  She has had an armpit odor problem since she was four, and I had been using the crystal deodorant sticks but wanted to try something a little more practical.  This seems to work well in preventing odor, but the smell is WAY too strong.  It is not floral or any other natural scent.  It smells like you are walking through the perfume section of a large department store at the mall.  It makes me sneeze whenever she first applies it.  After awhile the scent subsides, but I just do not like it and will not get this deodorant again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I must have missed it somewhere that this is actually a roll-on, not a stick deodorant.  It&#x27;s probably stated somewhere in the description, but I was surprised to get a roll-on.</li>
    <li> its clear liquid. works well for active kid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so bummed!  I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to use aluminum deodorants, so finding something workable is a challenge.  Baking soda gives me rashes, but nothing else kills the eau du femme-pit I inevitably get by mid-afternoon teaching in a swampy lecture hall.  Commercial deodorants also stain my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I saw this and, although labeled for kids, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I sniffed it in the store and it seemed ok, but alas, it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell.  Lordy, the smell.  I had a migraine so fast it made my head spin.  I had to scrub really hard to get it off me, too.  So I can&#x27;t tell you if this works on adults, or if it works all day, or if it stains shirts, because the smell was so strong I couldn&#x27;t stand to test it properly.  I&#x27;m getting the unscented for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry a lot about how strong a smell this is for anyone, let alone kids.  It&#x27;s so weird that a health-conscious product would be made with so strong a smell!  Not just strong, but very artificial too.</li>
    <li> Just what my 9 yr old daughter needed before school starts! She stays fresh all day even after playing in the park and swimming all day!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the first non-aluminum deodorant that I&#x27;ve stuck with. It took me a week or so to get it right with application and occasionally, reapplication, but now I really like it. The fragrance is strong to get used to at first, but over time it&#x27;s become one of my favorite scents. Another reviewer mentioned it smells like Angel by Thierry Mugler, which I&#x27;ll be purchasing later, since I like the smell of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me as a moderately active day-worker, it holds up a minimum of 7 hours, then I tend to do a quick reapplication because the scent fades, and I also want to prevent the deodorant from wiping off completely by the end of the day. I strayed a little bit and tried Crystal deodorant, and it did absolutely nothing for me. I think the magic of this deodorant (as it is in fact, a deodorizer) is the scent mixing with the herbal fluids to prevent bacteria. The smell works very well with my body chemistry, and I haven&#x27;t found anything else I&#x27;m quite as happy with. For some back story, I&#x27;ve been using antiperspirants since I began using any form of anti-stink, and I&#x27;ve always stuck to the invisible solids, Dove green tea w/cucumber, Secret Clinical Strength, etc. I still feel like this is my better bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for their spray aerosol/isobutane Missy deodorant to become more available, as it&#x27;s still in the UK. I stumbled across this deodorant in the kids&#x27; school material section at my local drug store, and I tried it on clearance. Pretty glad I did!</li>
    <li> Works well for my daughter but we both hate the smell</li>
    <li> For me the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong and is disappears quickly. I&#x27;m an adult and I love this... it works very well for me whereas others without the chemicals haven&#x27;t helped at all. I&#x27;m not a big, stinky sweater, but I still need deodorant and this is my keeper.</li>
    <li> Great product for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Soft fresh scent is perfect for a young girl.</li>
    <li> Just received today smell if awful and smells nothing like anything my 8 year old wants to wear she normally uses growing basic but they are currently out of stock but as soon as they get some in I will be ordering extra so I wouldn&#x27;t have this problem again.</li>
    <li> It is somewhat effective. My girl has sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her. HOWEVER, the scent is SO STRONG!! I am not sure if it is working or just covering up the odor with perfume..... I wish they had un-scented one.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for my young daughter. I didn&#x27;t want anything with aluminum in it for her. Smell isn&#x27;t too strong and is perfect for young ladies. Just helps on hot days.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Wish it dried on contact.  Easy to apply and smells nice.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old tried this.  I wasn&#x27;t nuts about the fragrance.  And by the end of an 80 degree day at school, I couldn&#x27;t tell she was waring any deodorant.  I am looking for something else.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in her tween...therefore that&#x27;s normal for her to kind of strong odor...I tried every other kind from the stores but none of them work until I got this from Amazon...I can say that much &amp;#34; no more strong odor&amp;#34;...looking forward to order some more.👌</li>
    <li> Way too smelly - the fragrance makes me think that it has way too many phthalates.  And &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is listed pretty close to the top of the list of ingredients and packaging does not say natural fragrance, so I have to assume it is chemical.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her deodorant.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my five year old who gets strong body odor, I get compliments all the time when people smell her. It works great!!!!</li>
    <li> A great option for younger girls who need deodorant. My 8 year old uses this and has no problems with irritation or skin sensitive. The smell is nice and light. We will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Bought for my 10 year old daughter and tried it for myself and bought more for me... Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter is young and I did not want to use anything too strong on her.  She likes the smell above others we have tried and she likes wearing it.  It seesm to give her more protection than other natural brands.  Very good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many natural deodorants and none are as effective as this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m way, way, way past my teenage years, so this is for all ages...if it works with your body&#x27;s chemistry, that is.&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance, great feel.</li>
    <li> My niece loves this for gym class.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my daughters. I didn&#x27;t want them using anything with harsh chemicals since they are only 8 and 6. It has a nice fresh scent and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Works great for my 5 year old daughter.  She loves the smell of it.  No issues yet with skin irritation.</li>
    <li> My daughter is brand new to the deodorant world and this is amazing.... smells great and it works. She smells great even after one full day of school, day care, running around and PE lessons. Without harsh chemicals, this is a Godsend!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well on my 8 year old daughter.  She likes the smell.  It is not overwhelming.  She has had no skin sensitivities to it, either.</li>
    <li> My eight year old doesn&#x27;t need to wear deodorant everyday, but when she needs it, man does she really need it. I find that she needs it most when she wears sleeveless shirts and dresses that don&#x27;t provide a barrier to skin-to-skin contact at her armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was a bit embarrassed when I brought up the issue of deodorant with her. Fortunately, I had already purchased this deodorant and was able to let her smell it. She was sold on the light ly floral scent. There is a hint of a deeper powdery scent in this, but it makes her feel like she&#x27;s putting it on to get a nice scent rather than to mask a bad odor. We find that it was enough for her to wear it a couple of times a week during the school year when sleeveless wasn&#x27;t generally an option. Now that we&#x27;ve hit summer and sleeveless will be the norm, she can be confident that she won&#x27;t have to worry about body odor, as she will probably increase use to every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great starter deodorant, with no antiperspirants in it, so I feel pretty safe letting her use it. I did have to explain how the rollerball applicator works and show her how to lightly swipe this under her armpits. But after a couple of times, she&#x27;s got it down.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t know they still made roll-on deodorant - which I am thankful as the last time I got a teen type deodorant my girl made a mess of the stick.  this smells so good I want to use it!!  delicately scented similar to &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34;.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> No skin irritation so far but my 8 year old does not like the scent. It smells like  men&#x27;s aftershave. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This really has helped with my 7 year old daughter who battles very strong body odor. She puts this on in the morning and still smells good when she comes home from school. The scent is strong when you first put it on, but it does smell nice to me and does not smell overwhelming. It does lessen up as the day goes on. When my daughter comes home from school she smells fresh. I would say it works great!</li>
    <li> My daughter began smelling like BO when she was about 7 1/2. I didn&#x27;t want her to use deodorant at such a young age. I had her use baby powder for awhile, but then she started smelling again. I finally did some research to find another solution and decided to try this Keep It Kind girls deodorant. It has worked wonderfully. She has not smelled since she began using it, even on hot, sweaty days! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My 7 year-old daughter has body odor.  I didn&#x27;t want her using a deodorant with harsh chemicals or a strong smell.  This works well, it smells good, and it is pink.  She loves it, and so do I.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old uses it and it does not cause her any irritation and the scent lasts throughout her school day. It goes on cool and dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing. I use it as well because I&#x27;m allergic to the other deodorants on the market, and this is the only one that I have found that works. I wish they carried it in stores still, but at least I can get it online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it smells like a mix between an old lady&#x27;s perfume and a man&#x27;s cologne.  My daughter had it on for a few hours before we ended up washing it off.  It got to where we could barely stand to smell it.  Everyone has his or her own opinions on smells, tastes, etc.  Personally, I couldn&#x27;t get used to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if I could have gotten used to the smell, it would have worked wonderfully.  It rolled easily and covered very well.</li>
    <li> Smells good, keeps my seven year old from smelling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, but even on the hunt for my own aluminum/paraben free deodorant, this has worked great on me!</li>
    <li> This deoderant smells better than any deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought it for my preteen and she can&#x27;t wait to put it on every day.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife smells prettier :-) BUY IT!</li>
    <li> we bought this and are horribly disappointed.  As another reviewer said, it is so strong. It smells like an adult perfume. This is not at all fresh or clean smelling for a kid.  The smell was so overpowering my  husband, who just had nasal surgery and can hardly smell anything was complaining when my daughter walked by....not even hugging her.  Definitely not for kids. I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, bc my dd won&#x27;t be wearing this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strong but smells good and she loves wearing it. My daughter is 6</li>
    <li> 11 year old daughter loves and it seems to be working well</li>
</ol>
