      <li>I wanted a face moisturizer that will help me my skin feel good all day.</li>
      <li>Its good for moisturizing and sun blocking.</li>
      <li>It is just creamy dreamy and even smells good.</li>

      <li>Even more delighted when I was refunded some money because of change in postage costs.</li>
      <li>and I honestly believe that it has improved the texture.</li>
      <li>Was delighted with my product and the cost also as I pay more for it at home.</li>
      <li>Working good on my skin: I just love it.</li>
      <li>This Elizabeth Arden product is one of my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I love how it feels on my skin, the smell, and the texture.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that is has sunscreen SPF 30.</li>
      <li>I love how it feels when you put in on</li>
      <li>and my skin showed a noticeable improvement within one week and is even softer and the skin tone evened out more now that I had used for a month.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this cream.  </li>
      <li>But this is one of the products that I do buy when I can find it for a better price.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my face and makes my skin soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>What can I say - if you&#x27;re a woman of a certain age, this stuff is probably as good as anything out there.</li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer that can keep my skin smooth during the winter time.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It feels like you have given your skin a long lovely drink that leaves it feeling good and gives you a glowing appearance.</li>
      <li>Has a clean fresh smell also.</li>
      <li>this moisturizer makes your skin feel so lovely and soft</li>
      <li>but I think they are worth the expense.</li>
      <li>I wish they would put it in a tube, so it would stay fresh longer.</li>
      <li>My facial lady told me my skin looks much better~</li>
      <li>the big cosmetic houses do quite a bit of research before putting something on the market, so i feel confident, but i am keeping a close eye on my skin.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than in the store.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>They seem to work better than other products.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Premiere I usually use the Ceramide plumping, but I wanted to try and little stronger more moisturizing lotion as my skin is becoming more dry...</li>
      <li>Although I normally do not pay this much for a face cream, this one is worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>moisturizes and helps firm skin  love it</li>
      <li>if you want to use ceramides to maintain normal maturation and turnover of skin cells, you must use a sunscreen and this product has it.</li>
      <li>The products live up to the product description and my expectations.  </li>
      <li>The UV protection  of 30 makes it great for everyday use year round.  </li>
      <li>I am 23, so maybe my skin is pretty flexible about products, maybe once I get older I might need to look into more expensive creams.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m nearly 60 years old and this product makes my wrinkles almost disappear.</li>
      <li>I am an Elemis fan and rarely use any other products, this is however an exception to my rule.</li>
      <li>My skin is a little on the dry side and this cream seem to keep my skin moisturized a lot longer than most.  </li>
      <li>smooth and small lines are not noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I really like Elizabeth Arden skin care but do not buy it regularly because of the cost and have actually begun to use another line.  </li>
      <li>Creams in general are waxy.</li>

    <li> Working good on my skin: I just love it.</li>
    <li> Was delighted with my product and the cost also as I pay more for it at home. Even more delighted when I was refunded some money because of change in postage costs.</li>
    <li> Using this along with the capsules and already my skin feels so much better! I love this product. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Premiere I usually use the Ceramide plumping, but I wanted to try and little stronger more moisturizing lotion as my skin is becoming more dry...It works great I don&#x27;t have dry patches around my chin area anymore and I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week now. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Creams in general are waxy. I feel no wax in this product. It is just creamy dreamy and even smells good. I like it, and will buy it again. I am an Elemis fan and rarely use any other products, this is however an exception to my rule.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer that can keep my skin smooth during the winter time. This moisturizer is fantastic. I love how it feels on my skin, the smell, and the texture. Love the fact that is has sunscreen SPF 30. It keeps my skin fydrated and protected during the winter, but I kept using it during the summer as well, it is great! I would recommend it if you have dry or combined skin type; it may be too thick if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Elizabeth Arden products for years. They seem to work better than other products. They are not cheap but I think they are worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Its good for moisturizing and sun blocking. one side effect is using first week or so eyes are irritating.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I wish they would put it in a tube, so it would stay fresh longer.</li>
    <li> If I get to close to my eyes irritation effects them causing tearing that can last up to 8 hours</li>
    <li> This product was recommended in Health magazine,and I have used the Ceramide line of products for over four years.  The products live up to the product description and my expectations.  The UV protection  of 30 makes it great for everyday use year round.  My skin looks smooth and small lines are not noticeable.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my face and makes my skin soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> My facial lady told me my skin looks much better~</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  I seen such a difference the next morning.  My skin is a little on the dry side and this cream seem to keep my skin moisturized a lot longer than most.  Has a clean fresh smell also.</li>
    <li> this moisturizer makes your skin feel so lovely and soft and I honestly believe that it has improved the texture. It feels like you have given your skin a long lovely drink that leaves it feeling good and gives you a glowing appearance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it - she does. She likes it but it&#x27;s sometimes hard to find locally. What can I say - if you&#x27;re a woman of a certain age, this stuff is probably as good as anything out there.</li>
    <li> Great price!  This Elizabeth Arden product is one of my favorite.  I&#x27;m nearly 60 years old and this product makes my wrinkles almost disappear.</li>
    <li> if you want to use ceramides to maintain normal maturation and turnover of skin cells, you must use a sunscreen and this product has it. i am using it to prevent SK&#x27;s and AK&#x27;s from setting in on my face and neck; i think it is working (2 months use; skin turns over in 28 days). don&#x27;t be afraid of the price, because you will use it sparingly and Liz Arden has formulated it for high spreadability. as i said, have had it for 2 months, and the jar looks almost full.&lt;br /&gt;be cautious though, because ceramides have not gone through FDA approval, to my knowledge. the big cosmetic houses do quite a bit of research before putting something on the market, so i feel confident, but i am keeping a close eye on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like Elizabeth Arden skin care but do not buy it regularly because of the cost and have actually begun to use another line.  But this is one of the products that I do buy when I can find it for a better price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe what this does for my skin which is on the dry side. People actually think I am 15 years younger than I am. I would never leave this product. The ones with retina in them are too harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Much cheaper than in the store. My skin feels moisturized and make up goes on easier without caking.</li>
    <li> moisturizes and helps firm skin  love it</li>
    <li> I wanted a face moisturizer that will help me my skin feel good all day. This moisturizer does the job, but so does my embryolisse lait creme and I can get 3 for the price of this one. I am 23, so maybe my skin is pretty flexible about products, maybe once I get older I might need to look into more expensive creams. So I am not sure. i will finish it to see if I see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product it does wonders for my skin</li>
    <li> Although I normally do not pay this much for a face cream, this one is worth every penny!  I love how it feels when you put in on and my skin showed a noticeable improvement within one week and is even softer and the skin tone evened out more now that I had used for a month.</li>
