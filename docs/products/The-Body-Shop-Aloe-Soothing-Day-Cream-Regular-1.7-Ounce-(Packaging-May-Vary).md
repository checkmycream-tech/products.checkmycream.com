      <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love body shop products but not this one.</li>
      <li>I also found this a lighter cream with more oil.</li>
      <li>all Body Shop products are safe</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find that some Body Shop products are being sold on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The Body Shop&#x27;s Aloe line is great, their rating is good on skin deep, they do not test their products on animals, they are not outrageously overpriced and they are easy to purchase.</li>
      <li>I currently also have the exfoliating facewash and after I&#x27;m done using it, my face feels all smooth :D</li>
      <li>Very gentle and has a pleasant, light scent.  </li>
      <li>It makes my nose really smooth too, so I keep randomly touching my nose.</li>
      <li>Very nice - and no strange reactions on my skin.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s paraben and preservative free.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it</li>
      <li>Fantastic product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll see if that works although it doesn&#x27;t fit with my perception of what causes the smell.  </li>
      <li>Despite all the positive reviews, make sure  </li>
      <li>If you are the kind of person who prefers natural alternatives to taking care of your skin</li>
      <li>There is also a cool sensation.</li>
      <li>Consumers should be more worried about their health and not so much</li>
      <li>If this cream were a Pokemon, and my dry skin were another, then every time this Day Cream attacks, it&#x27;s super effective!     </li>
      <li>The Day Cream&#x27;s aloe scent is mega mild anyway, -and-</li>
      <li>It absorbs quite quickly.</li>
      <li>I will continue to be a loyal body shop customer for years to come.</li>
      <li>Light and moisturizing, exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It actually does have a calming effect, too, which is great because my face tends to get red easily.</li>
      <li>I am a redhead with fair/sensitive skin that tends to dry in the T-zone and chin, and I thought the world might end when the Body Shop discontinued the hemp face moisturizer (I still miss that stuff!), but this is a fair replacement.</li>
      <li>This lotion gives great moisture but never feels heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>I think I remember that removing the plastic lid actually did kind of help.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money if it works... and this DOES.</li>
      <li>The price is right too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been on a search for the right moisturizer that works for me and THIS works for ME.</li>
      <li>I wanted more than just a tolerable product, especially for the money I was putting out each time.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I have gone through so many different moisturizers looking for a product to keep me hydrated.</li>
      <li>This is the first time anything worked on me so well</li>
      <li>They also have more Aloe products that go with that, such as a toner, a Night Cream, and an extremely gentle exfoliating Face-wash.</li>
      <li>After realizing two years ago that cosmetics are not FDA regulated, meaning anyone can put anything in cosmetics eventhough a high percentage of what we put on our skin is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream, I decided I needed to research ALL of the products I use.</li>
      <li>Amazon is usually pretty fast and reliable with shipping to APO addresses, so I ordered some.</li>
      <li>and I can easily make this last a year.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t think that was healthy long term, and after trying a variety of products, this works for him.</li>
      <li>Worked well to heal very burned chapped skin once the blistering was over.</li>
      <li>My face wants to talk to me and thank me now, I swear.</li>
      <li>That comment was so preposterous that I was compelled to write a review to set the record straight.</li>
      <li>People get so used to scented creams but don&#x27;t realize how toxic they really are.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really do smell-good stuff anyway.  </li>
      <li>i used this for 6-7 months now and did not see much difference on my face.</li>
      <li>It smells like food on my face, which I find off-putting, though I&#x27;m still trying to use it because I like the fact that it has a low (meaning, low in hazardous ingredients) rating at Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database.    </li>
      <li>I did my research on the ingredients, how it compares to other top brands, and the reviews people gave.</li>
      <li>also used this on bug bites, mainly mosquitoes.</li>
      <li>I applied the night cream and it was soothing, mainly because of Aloe Vera.</li>
      <li>I tried a host of Aloe creams and this was the one I found most beneficial, even over other so-called organic and natural varieties.</li>
      <li>His skin looks normal now and he hasn&#x27;t had an issue in months.</li>
      <li>I have SUPER dry skin on my face, yet can have an oily forehead on some days.    </li>
      <li>I was a little worried because it was &#x27;cheap&#x27;</li>
      <li>ALSO was very good for a bad sunburn.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy like pond&#x27;s and it has no odor (see the smelly review</li>
      <li>so I tend to use products meant for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I am 33 and have combination, sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Does not cause me any break outs or problems, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>wow, it&#x27;s been awhile (three years).  </li>
      <li>Just a note that if applied to non-burned skin this did, unexpectedly, make me break out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t quite have sensitive skin, but I do have acne-prone skin</li>
      <li>am I buying old stuff?</li>
      <li>Also be aware that both the day &amp; night cream are basically geared towards people with dry skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a combination of the night cream &amp; day cream everyday for the past few months and it has done a wonderful job keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>Now only if they made this with a decent SPF and I would never use another moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t have splurged for such a pricey item ($14 for 1.7 oz) not knowing if it would work or not, but it was my birthday</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for dry sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Others stung only a little in the beginning, and after several seconds of discomfort were fine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it&#x27;s very subtle and with my sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement lotion for awhile and this is definitely it. I have extremely dry/psoriasis skin and I was previously using Creme de la Mer. I wanted to stop using Creme de la Mer because of the terrible ingredients, ridiculous price and the fact that I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and really don&#x27;t need to be using a powerful wrinkle reducer. I tried a few other lotions and then stumbled upon The Body Shop&#x27;s Aloe line. I&#x27;ve used other Body Shop products in the past and did not like them. The Aloe line however is simply phenomenal. I&#x27;ve been using a combination of the night cream &amp; day cream everyday for the past few months and it has done a wonderful job keeping my skin moisturized. It has also lightened the redness on my cheeks a bit. The night cream has a bit of a weird smell to it, but the day cream has no smell at all. Both creams are also rated a 1 on the cosmetics database, which is excellent. My only complaint about this lotion &amp; the night version is that they make my skin itch a bit after I apply them. Also be aware that both the day &amp; night cream are basically geared towards people with dry skin. My friend, who has oily skin, tried the day cream and hated it. It made her break out quite badly. Definitely look into this product and/or the night cream if you have dry skin though!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and based on the other review decided to try this.  This smells so horrible, just like vomit.  I put it on once and never again, I gave it away because it smells that bad.  I love body shop products but not this one.</li>
    <li> After realizing two years ago that cosmetics are not FDA regulated, meaning anyone can put anything in cosmetics eventhough a high percentage of what we put on our skin is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream, I decided I needed to research ALL of the products I use. The Body Shop&#x27;s Aloe line is great, their rating is good on skin deep, they do not test their products on animals, they are not outrageously overpriced and they are easy to purchase. I&#x27;ve been using them for two years and I&#x27;ve been very happy. The person who said this moisturizer had a bad smell could not be more wrong. In fact, this moisturizer has virtually no smell at all. That comment was so preposterous that I was compelled to write a review to set the record straight.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s not the aloe but the sesame oil ingredient.  It smells like food on my face, which I find off-putting, though I&#x27;m still trying to use it because I like the fact that it has a low (meaning, low in hazardous ingredients) rating at Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database.    A commenter below suggested that removing the plastic lid prevents the smell.  I&#x27;ll see if that works although it doesn&#x27;t fit with my perception of what causes the smell.  But if something good comes out of it I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this comment.    EDIT: wow, it&#x27;s been awhile (three years).  I think I remember that removing the plastic lid actually did kind of help.  Either that or I got used to it; in any case, I did finish the product, but I didn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. i never feel guilty about using enough of this. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for myself every time I apply it after I wash my face. It&#x27;s not heavy like pond&#x27;s and it has no odor (see the smelly review and I explained why this happened to that person in a comment) does not leave your face shinny either.   Fantastic product I recommend it to all the women I know.</li>
    <li> This line seems to be helping with my redness and evening out my skin tone. Also, it&#x27;s paraben and preservative free.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s not greasy, but it still moisturizes.  I have very dry skin and this sinks into my skin without feeling gross.  It also works great to put on before makeup.  Usually face creams make makeup slide off my face or dry up and crack.  This does neither.  I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it&#x27;s very subtle and with my sensitive skin I can&#x27;t really do smell-good stuff anyway.  I will probably be purchasing this again--and for me that&#x27;s pretty dern good!</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the amount.  It is a very good cream, almost emollient.  Please sell larger amounts.</li>
    <li> Very faint scent compared to most. I also found this a lighter cream with more oil. Worked well to heal very burned chapped skin once the blistering was over. A nice alternative to an ointment. Just a note that if applied to non-burned skin this did, unexpectedly, make me break out. But limiting exposure to the burn caused absolutely no issues. Hope that helps - I tried a host of Aloe creams and this was the one I found most beneficial, even over other so-called organic and natural varieties.</li>
    <li> The description says this cream is \\&quot;alcohol free\\&quot; but the ingredients list THREE kinds of alcohol (in Spanish).  Be forewarned. False advertising.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, red, sensitive skin... mostly due in part to medications I take that cause skin reactions, but that&#x27;s beside the point. I have bought dozens of little bottles and tubs that promised to be gentle and soothing. Some even claimed to reduce redness (wishful thinking). There was almost always a sting factor once I applied any of these. Some stung so badly, I&#x27;d have to run to the bathroom to wash it off. Others stung only a little in the beginning, and after several seconds of discomfort were fine. But I found that those didn&#x27;t moisturize well and I&#x27;d be back to my scaly self in 30 minutes or so. I wanted more than just a tolerable product, especially for the money I was putting out each time.&lt;br /&gt;Well, THIS stuff works! I had some time to kill during a layover in an airport that had a Body Shop in it. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t have splurged for such a pricey item ($14 for 1.7 oz) not knowing if it would work or not, but it was my birthday and I treated myself. It&#x27;s worth the money if it works... and this DOES. It soothing, just like it says. There&#x27;s NO sting facor at all, and its moisturizing without being thick and greasy. Great stuff... as are the rest of the products in the Soothing Aloe line.</li>
    <li> My husband has red flaky dry skin and for years before I met him he used steroid cream to control it. I really didn&#x27;t think that was healthy long term, and after trying a variety of products, this works for him. He uses it daily, as well as scrubs periodically with a combination of olive oil and sugar as recommended by the dermatologist. His skin looks normal now and he hasn&#x27;t had an issue in months. Highly recommend for dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Might just be my skin, but I thought it was greasy. After applying, it left a sticky, greasy film on my skin that did not go away.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin too because I&#x27;m Chinese and have allergies. If I so much as accidentally press too hard or scrape my face skin, it will stay reddish forever, or even develop a rash if I don&#x27;t leave it alone. I have SUPER dry skin on my face, yet can have an oily forehead on some days.    I actually took my chances a long time ago on using this stuff. They also have more Aloe products that go with that, such as a toner, a Night Cream, and an extremely gentle exfoliating Face-wash. I currently also have the exfoliating facewash and after I&#x27;m done using it, my face feels all smooth :D Then I slap on my Aloe Day Cream and I&#x27;m ready to go :D It goes on me like silky butter, and I can feel my skin THIRSTING FOR IT if I do not put it on! It does not make me feel oily or clogged-up at all. My oilier hairline doesn&#x27;t seem to mind this cream at all.    There is a review on this Day Cream; the girl said that she felt it smelled like vomit and was horrible and such. I don&#x27;t recommend you listen to her, because anything with aloe is going to well.. SMELL like aloe. The Day Cream&#x27;s aloe scent is mega mild anyway, -and- I enjoy it so I don&#x27;t agree with her.     If I do break out, it&#x27;s never because of this cream. It seems that for me, pimples can be really light colored, yet hurt like a horrible beesting. I just take care of it with that Aloe face-wash and then slap on a tiny dot of Proactiv for each zit to dry it out.     I believe The Body Shop also has a similar line just for crazy skin that can&#x27;t figure out if it&#x27;s dry or oily. I wanted to try that out too but I was so happy with this Aloe one that I don&#x27;t care anymore.    Every time I wake up, I actually look forward to putting this Day Cream stuff on my face. It feels so RELIIIIEEVVVINNGG. I have random dry spots sometimes along my jaw or my forehead, and it clears it up. After I shower, I rub it on and make happy-faces while I wait for the initial absorption. After that dries, I rub it on AGAIN. If this cream were a Pokemon, and my dry skin were another, then every time this Day Cream attacks, it&#x27;s super effective!     It makes my nose really smooth too, so I keep randomly touching my nose. My face wants to talk to me and thank me now, I swear.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite have sensitive skin, but I do have acne-prone skin so I tend to use products meant for sensitive skin. One can never been too careful with what may cause a flare up. Since I have oily, acne-prone skin, I only use just a tiny bit and I can easily make this last a year. It&#x27;s travel sized (1.7 oz) and lasts a long, long time. Now only if they made this with a decent SPF and I would never use another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Light and moisturizing, exactly what I wanted. I will continue to be a loyal body shop customer for years to come.</li>
    <li> This lotion was given to me in a gift pack a couple of years ago.  I LOVE IT!  It is one of the best I have ever found.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find that some Body Shop products are being sold on Amazon. I am an Army nurse deployed to Afghanistan where I very much NEED moisturizer (very harsh water!), and the half jar I&#x27;d brought was running out. Amazon is usually pretty fast and reliable with shipping to APO addresses, so I ordered some. When I received it, I was VERY disappointed. The lid was apparently not all the way on, and half of the moisturizer ended up outside of the jar, all over the inside of the box. :( Also, when I&#x27;ve ordered this item from the Body Shop, it always has that little plastic insert over the cream, once you remove the lid, that you then have to remove to access the product. None of the Body Shop products I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon have had this plastic insert, which makes me slightly suspicious -- am I buying old stuff? What&#x27;s the deal? Yuck. In any case, I love this product, but I will probably cease ordering Body Shop items on Amazon. I am a redhead with fair/sensitive skin that tends to dry in the T-zone and chin, and I thought the world might end when the Body Shop discontinued the hemp face moisturizer (I still miss that stuff!), but this is a fair replacement.</li>
    <li> used it for many years and still do.</li>
    <li> I am 33 and have combination, sensitive skin.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! It is not to heavy to make me break out but works well to moisturize in the dry NV weather.  The price is right too.  I used to use Bare minerals face lotion, but now I switched to this and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> I tried using this as a face cream, and unfortunately it clogged my pores.  Stopped using it and the blemishes went away.  Oh well!  Could work for someone that isn&#x27;t acne-prone though.  Very gentle and has a pleasant, light scent.  I will probably use this up on my body, hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Took entirely too long to receive the product once ordered. In fact, I stopped looking for it to arrive. I usually order directly from The Body Shop, so lesson learned. Saving a few dollars wasn&#x27;t worth the long wait.</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel greasy or otherwise weird. It actually does have a calming effect, too, which is great because my face tends to get red easily. I don&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a substitute moisturizer for Boscia Revitalizing Black Hydration Gel, but of course nothing seems to be comparable since they are all different. I did not want to pay a lot of money for something that only cost that much due to brand name. I stumbled across this Aloe Vera moisturizer along with the day cream. I did my research on the ingredients, how it compares to other top brands, and the reviews people gave. I was a little worried because it was &#x27;cheap&#x27; but I think it&#x27;s a social mentality. Not all &#x27;cheap&#x27; products are bad. So I bought the night cream and day cream to try and I LOVE IT. I use it on my face as well as bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer did not make me feel like I have a ton of oil on my face. I have combination dry/oily skin with some acne. I don&#x27;t use foundation or any make-up besides eye liner. I definitely noticed a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s less flaky and dry but not too oily. It&#x27;s like matte. There is also a cool sensation. My face is a lot smoother than usual... and I love it. It feels like I have baby skin again! I don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to cover my skin so this product lasts for a long time. I&#x27;ve always been on a search for the right moisturizer that works for me and THIS works for ME. Despite all the positive reviews, make sure  you do your research and see if it FITS FOR YOU and YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on bug bites, mainly mosquitoes. I get a bad allergic reaction and swell up. It literally looks like someone punched me wherever the mosquito bite is. I applied the night cream and it was soothing, mainly because of Aloe Vera. Because it&#x27;s so soothing, I didn&#x27;t feel the urge to scratch and can slept well. The next morning it was practically gone. This is the first time anything worked on me so well and I&#x27;m happy with it. This review goes for the DAY and NIGHT cream. I also suggest the Day cream with SPF.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many different moisturizers looking for a product to keep me hydrated. This line from the body shop is perfect for my skin in all seasons and all climates. Truly keeps me hydrated for at least 24 hours and feels fresh going on. One container lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that will keep my face from cracking open in the dry winter months.  Does not cause me any break outs or problems, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  ALSO was very good for a bad sunburn.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream since I lived in England decades ago. I absolutely love it. It glides on easily, is not scented and does not look oily on your skin. It absorbs quite quickly. I am 64 years old, without any wrinkles and look decades younger. I will never even try another cream.</li>
    <li> The Body Shop&#x27;s Soothing Aloe product line is awesome. This lotion gives great moisture but never feels heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I was not a big fan of this moisturizer. i used this for 6-7 months now and did not see much difference on my face. it was not as moistured as others that i have used.</li>
    <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t smell like vomit like one reader wrote. The smell does resemble aloe vera. People get so used to scented creams but don&#x27;t realize how toxic they really are. Consumers should be more worried about their health and not so much the smell.&lt;br /&gt;check out goodguide.com to see how some of our everyday products have toxic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all Body Shop products are safe</li>
    <li> If you are the kind of person who prefers natural alternatives to taking care of your skin and you still want value - this is for you.  Very nice - and no strange reactions on my skin.</li>
