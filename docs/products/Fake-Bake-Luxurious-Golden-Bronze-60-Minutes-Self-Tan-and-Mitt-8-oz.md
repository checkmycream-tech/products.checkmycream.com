      <li>Love love loveeeeee!!!!</li>
      <li>good-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Faked Baked Products and loved them until this one.</li>
      <li>so I wanted to look good and tan.</li>
      <li>If not, still a good product.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I love this product, it really is better than the flawless and lasts so much longer!</li>
      <li>The spray has a tint to it which resembles a very light blackish brown hue and is used as a guide when applying.</li>
      <li>Make sure a pat it on to avoid streaks.</li>
      <li>u will love it</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT...</li>
      <li>more then 2 coats within one week.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Easy application</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and left me with a better color than going to a salon!!</li>
      <li>Fortunately it&#x27;s winter</li>
      <li>I applied lightly for 3 days but didn&#x27;t wash it off as directed after suggested time limit.</li>
      <li>People asked me where I had been to get such a great tan.  </li>
      <li>The blackish color of the spray collects in pores of freshly shaved legs, which I didn&#x27;t like, but it mostly will wash off.</li>
      <li>I have tried every store brand self tanner available.</li>
      <li>As a fair skinned blond, most products left an unnatural bronzy tone.</li>
      <li>For my pale skin it turns into a perfect glow!</li>
      <li>I am very fair to start with, so this gives me a little color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the Fake Bake products are amazing, because I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great reviews.</li>
      <li>It still produces a bit of an orangey tint but the color overall is nice.</li>
      <li>I thought I looked ok in my dimly lit house</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other self tanners with no issues and have heard lots of good things about this brand.</li>
      <li>Works great and gets u dark!!</li>
      <li>is the first time I used the spray type of tanner with the mitt, and on the first application I got it on the sink and bathroom walls, but then second time I found it best to hold the mitt over the sink and do 2-3 sprays onto the mitt, keeping the bottle close to the mitt to avoid getting it everywhere, and apply to my skin in small sections and blend well.  </li>
      <li>The product suggests 1 hr development time but full color isn&#x27;t developed until about 6 hrs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After 1 hour it was a light color, I left it on for 3 hours</li>
      <li>If you wash it off in 1 hr you won&#x27;t have much if any color.</li>
      <li>I am so so upset with this purchase because I was really looking forward to trying it.</li>
      <li>I will try it again except I will be more careful.</li>
      <li>and if you clean the mitt every time it will last past the amount of tanner in the bottle, still my favorite though.</li>
      <li>I have used several Fake Bake products, they tend to be very good</li>
      <li>This product produces a nice golden brown color, and it dries faster than the Fake Bake lotion or the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh n very natural color</li>
      <li>all weekend- color is VeRY natural looking.  </li>
      <li>so I look not pale.  </li>
      <li>The mitt was not like the normal ones that usually come with their products (cheap).</li>
      <li>However, I was sent an old product.</li>
      <li>Fake Bake goes on evenly with no streaking and by adding to the application every couple of days, a gorgeous tan develops without the chemical smell or the itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smells like coconut when applying, and then there is no chemical smell that is present in pretty much every other self tanner out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also a good body scrub in the shower will remove most self tanner entirely so if you mess up or the fade is bad, just scrub it off.</li>
      <li>I was obviously shipped an old product.</li>
      <li>I only left it on for an hour and a half, went tanning and came out beautifully dark. :)</li>
      <li>I can barely tell it has any scent even after several hours.</li>
      <li>The color looks natural and lasts long.</li>

<li> and I am definitely darker, but not much.</li>
<li> I love Fake Bake!</li>
<li> I love this Fake Bake!  </li>
<li> Goes on a dark grey tint and doesn&#x27;t show up until the next day.</li>
<li> and I had some color, which did get a little darker the next morning</li>
<li> But overall, I like that this is not so messy and smelly.  </li>
<li> I also didn&#x27;t like the way it faded unevenly after i spent 2 days at the lake.</li>
<li> I will build up the color again this week to get a little darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> When opened, the self tanner had already turned green.</li>
<li> It turned them green.</li>
<li> Tanned without the sun, bad sell, less streaking, immediate color,dries fast!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m super disappointed with it.</li>
<li> Love my Fake Bake!!!</li>
<li> Darkest of the Fake Bakes (I left it on overnight - Fake Bake does not recommend) but only lasts about 3 days if you shower and shave everyday.</li>
<li> But then the next day I would wake up with an uneven, awkward tan even after I fully cleaned it off with body wash and a loofah and everything.</li>
<li> Unfortunately when I received this one it had already turned green.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s dry in almost no time and finally someone figured out how to minimize the awful smell.</li>
<li> have also used the Fake Bake lotion, which I think gives a darker color than this product, but the lotion is very messy and gets all over the sheets and my husband can&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
<li> and I hate how sticky and slow to dry it is.</li>
<li> I applied a fairly thin layer</li>
<li> The mitt seems to be somewhat poor quality</li>
<li> Fake bake has it figured out.</li>
<li> I guess the chemicals and ocean salts didnt agree with my fake tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a Fake Baker and I wont give up on them.</li>
<li> Maybe I got a weird bottle but after an hour I would shower it off</li>
<li> In my eternal quest for self-tanning products, a friend gave me a bottle of Fake Bake.  </li>
<li> Disappointment can&#x27;t even begin to describe what I feel.</li>
<li> Although there are a couple store brands I do like, I hate the smell of the self tanner once it starts to develop</li>
<li> Horrible product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Fake Bake! I have been using Flawless for quite some time. I got this because it is suppose to last longer and also is darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what not to do:&lt;br /&gt;-Apply more then 2 coats within one week.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply a 2nd coat the day after the first.&lt;br /&gt;-Go over 3 hours of having the coat on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a trip to the beach so I wanted to look good and tan. I did 2 consecutive coats and on the last coat I accidentally slept with it for about 3 hours. I thought I looked ok in my dimly lit house but in sunlight my friend pointed out that I looked like a umpa lumpa (a sunless tanner&#x27;s nightmare). When I was at the beach I was going in and out of the ocean and pool and I must have turned every type of color. I looked yellow and sometimes greenish. I guess the chemicals and ocean salts didnt agree with my fake tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a Fake Baker and I wont give up on them. I will try it again except I will be more careful. I&#x27;ll see what happens</li>
    <li> Great looking tan.  It&#x27;s a keeper</li>
    <li> I love this Fake Bake!  People asked me where I had been to get such a great tan.  Make sure a pat it on to avoid streaks.</li>
    <li> For a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tan, this is the best that I&#x27;ve found. Definitely NO orange color at all. I would try this if I were you.</li>
    <li> If I could rate this no stars, I would. Disappointment can&#x27;t even begin to describe what I feel. I&#x27;m sure the Fake Bake products are amazing, because I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great reviews. However, I was sent an old product. When opened, the self tanner had already turned green. I am so so upset with this purchase because I was really looking forward to trying it. Although the shipping was much faster than expected, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, personally because I don&#x27;t like green skin.</li>
    <li> The best product i have tried!!! Easy to apply and left me with a better color than going to a salon!! In love!! This is the only sunless tanner i will be using from now on.</li>
    <li> Tanned without the sun, bad sell, less streaking, immediate color,dries fast! There u go! Oh n very natural color u will love it</li>
    <li> I always use this product.  Unfortunately when I received this one it had already turned green.  I was obviously shipped an old product.</li>
    <li> In my eternal quest for self-tanning products, a friend gave me a bottle of Fake Bake.  As a fair skinned blond, most products left an unnatural bronzy tone. They also had a tendency to make me itch.  Fake Bake goes on evenly with no streaking and by adding to the application every couple of days, a gorgeous tan develops without the chemical smell or the itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting lots of compliments on my great tan.</li>
    <li> Love love loveeeeee!!!! For my pale skin it turns into a perfect glow!</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a weird bottle but after an hour I would shower it off and I would still look as white as I did when I put it on. But then the next day I would wake up with an uneven, awkward tan even after I fully cleaned it off with body wash and a loofah and everything. Maybe I didn&#x27;t get it all off but it still doesn&#x27;t work in an hour. I&#x27;m super disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> Omg. Love this stuff. It goes great over a base tan. I only left it on for an hour and a half, went tanning and came out beautifully dark. :)</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I&#x27;m returning. I&#x27;m fair skinned. Fortunately it&#x27;s winter and I only put it on my legs. It turned them green. I&#x27;ve used Faked Baked Products and loved them until this one. The mitt was not like the normal ones that usually come with their products (cheap).</li>
    <li> Awesome love this stuff !!!</li>
    <li> Love my Fake Bake!!! Amazon experience A+A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other self tanners with no issues and have heard lots of good things about this brand. I left it on for 3 hrs and I am definitely darker, but not much. I applied a fairly thin layer so it&#x27;s possible I just didn&#x27;t apply enough, or it could be a product that is reapplied until you reach the desired color. Either way, I&#x27;ll reapply tomorrow. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get darker. If not, still a good product. No Orange color and no streaks. The mitt seems to be somewhat poor quality but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I love it!  The color looks natural and lasts long. I applied lightly for 3 days but didn&#x27;t wash it off as directed after suggested time limit. Worked beautifully. Will purchase again and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Goes on a dark grey tint and doesn&#x27;t show up until the next day. It was streaky. Not a fan!</li>
    <li> I have used several Fake Bake products, they tend to be very good and I especially like this one because it actually smells good- it smells like coconut when applying, and then there is no chemical smell that is present in pretty much every other self tanner out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I used the spray type of tanner with the mitt, and on the first application I got it on the sink and bathroom walls, but then second time I found it best to hold the mitt over the sink and do 2-3 sprays onto the mitt, keeping the bottle close to the mitt to avoid getting it everywhere, and apply to my skin in small sections and blend well.  This product produces a nice golden brown color, and it dries faster than the Fake Bake lotion or the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 hour it was a light color, I left it on for 3 hours and I had some color, which did get a little darker the next morning (as another reviewer also mentioned).  Since I have just started using this product, I will try to spray 4 times onto the mitt before applying and maybe this will result in a darker color, will have to experiment.  But overall, I like that this is not so messy and smelly.  I am very fair to start with, so this gives me a little color so I look not pale.  My friend thought I had been at the beach all weekend- color is VeRY natural looking.  I will build up the color again this week to get a little darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the Fake Bake lotion, which I think gives a darker color than this product, but the lotion is very messy and gets all over the sheets and my husband can&#x27;t stand the smell.  I have also tried the mousse which is also lighter in color than the lotion, I definitely prefer the 60 min Self Tan over the mousse.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Works great and gets u dark!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT...</li>
    <li> I love this product, it really is better than the flawless and lasts so much longer! Ive already ordered another one</li>
    <li> Darkest of the Fake Bakes (I left it on overnight - Fake Bake does not recommend) but only lasts about 3 days if you shower and shave everyday. Easy application and if you clean the mitt every time it will last past the amount of tanner in the bottle, still my favorite though.</li>
    <li> I have tried every store brand self tanner available. Although there are a couple store brands I do like, I hate the smell of the self tanner once it starts to develop and I hate how sticky and slow to dry it is. Fake bake has it figured out. It&#x27;s dry in almost no time and finally someone figured out how to minimize the awful smell. I can barely tell it has any scent even after several hours. The product suggests 1 hr development time but full color isn&#x27;t developed until about 6 hrs. If you wash it off in 1 hr you won&#x27;t have much if any color. It still produces a bit of an orangey tint but the color overall is nice. The spray has a tint to it which resembles a very light blackish brown hue and is used as a guide when applying. The blackish color of the spray collects in pores of freshly shaved legs, which I didn&#x27;t like, but it mostly will wash off. I also didn&#x27;t like the way it faded unevenly after i spent 2 days at the lake. I would suggest daily moisturizing  to prevent this possibly. Also a good body scrub in the shower will remove most self tanner entirely so if you mess up or the fade is bad, just scrub it off. Overall the pros outweigh the cons for me and I will buy it again.</li>
