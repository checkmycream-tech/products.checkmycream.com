      <li>I have used this before which worked great but the consistency was normal.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting (always a concern of mine with acid products).</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for this wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Every other day is best.</li>
      <li>The smell wouldn&#x27;t be offensive if it weren&#x27;t so strong.  </li>
      <li>It has also helped the soften and smoothen out my skin, it has reduced the fine lines on my face</li>
      <li>I have lots of spots on my skin from insect bites that refused to fade, but this lotion is definitely fading my spots, i&#x27;m so happy, and not only that, my skin is smooth, glowing and looks so beautiful.</li>
      <li>This is my 7th day of using this lotion, and i can see a huge difference on my skin.</li>
      <li>My husband kept commenting on how smooth and even my skin is now.</li>
      <li>its great for the body, especially if you have backne</li>
      <li>Leaves skin silky smooth, though.</li>
      <li>Good body lotion for body acne and also for any scars or discolorations it helps clear up</li>
      <li>(Lovely name, right?)</li>
      <li>The ingredients in this lotions makes your skin feel soft, supple, velvety smooth and helps it regenerate and to keep it healthy too</li>
      <li>But I think it is totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>Great for fading stretch marks; do not use daily, use every other day; not for sensitive skin; does sting after application even after months of using it; do not apply after shaving; excellent at exfoliating; works well in combination with clarisonic smart body scrubber for very soft blemish free skin; rough patches on elbows and knees gone; worthwhile purchase.</li>
      <li>The smell is also too strong, like old perfume.  </li>
      <li>TINGLY when you first put it on</li>
      <li>When I first received this lotion it was so watery that I couldn&#x27;t even apply it or shake the bottle like some suggested because it just spilled out from the pump.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and shiny  and soft</li>
      <li>now I will definitely be getting more of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Great product, visible results (for me at least) in 3 days.</li>
      <li>This functions beautifully leaves my thick, dry skin much softer and more supple.  </li>
      <li>even though the bottle is a normal size lotion bottle, it&#x27;s worth the higher price.</li>
      <li>I limited myself to using it twice a week, it&#x27;s that potent on my skin.</li>
      <li>It is amazing how much dead skin is on your and how much that it takes off to.</li>
      <li>It definitely helps to exfoliate, but like others have said, go light.</li>
      <li>A real winner</li>
      <li>and I really haven&#x27;t had and severe issues as I have had before.</li>
      <li>I love how it turns the rough patches of my body soft.  </li>
      <li>New staple for My hyperpigmentation-prone k.p. skin.</li>
      <li>How it is good for your body and not full of chemicals the way almost 75% of other lotions out there on the market are.  </li>
      <li>After the first use I saw fewer ingrown hairs on the back of my legs as well as softer skin.</li>
      <li>Got this yesterday and the first use I saw results the next morning.</li>
      <li>Also, I paired it with &#x27;Beauty Facial Extreme&#x27; (is also a body exfoliator) and together they&#x27;re even better.</li>
      <li>Clearly they don&#x27;t know what body lotion is.  </li>
      <li>My legs have never, ever, even once, been this soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>i cant really use it on my face, since it make my face turn red but</li>
      <li>but you will not believe how soft your problem spots will be.  </li>
      <li>It turned into liquid (despite storing in a cool, dry place), burned my skin (leaving patches of scars on my stomach, back and neck), and also created peeling blisters all over my hand.</li>
      <li>There are very few products I&#x27;ve been able to say that about, but this is definitely one of them.</li>
      <li>This stuff removed most of the dry skin and cellular buildup on my skin within a few days.</li>
      <li>legs, back and sides normally crack and bleed.</li>
      <li>I have adult onset acne(face and back) and this lotion has cleared up my skin.</li>
      <li>buying this if u have a dry or sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is so heavily fragranced that I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to use it.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is a little intense.  </li>
      <li>Since I started using it, about two weeks ago I have noticed dark spots getting lighter and skin is very soft!</li>

<li> As much as I wanted to like this product and as soon as I realized a small difference in my skin..</li>
<li> I actually use rubber dishwashing gloves to put it on because my hands started to dry and peel from it.  </li>
<li> and I had bought this to try to sloth off the dead skin in hopes to clear it up.</li>
<li> I would be a long time customer.  </li>
<li> my hands, with years of calloused, thick, dead skin, is sloughing off to reveal new, soft skin.</li>
<li> I suffer from dry and rough elbows, knees, and feet.</li>
<li> I only had a little on my hands and my husband walked by and said, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the Paula&#x27;s Choice glycolic body lotion for quite some time, and I was hoping for something that worked similarly, but was a little stronger.  </li>
<li> It sloughed away the dead skin cells on the target areas and soften them up too in only a couple of applications.</li>
<li> I have only used it a few times and my legs have already started to peel, leaving fresher, softer skin visible.</li>
<li> It took a few weeks to work up to using it every day, and I do still get the occasional pimple, but nothing like before.</li>
<li> A little seems to go a long way so</li>
<li> I have a lot of contact dermatitis issues by my elbows because of allergies to dish soaps and other things</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any of the burning others have described other than where the skin is not intact.</li>
<li> Looking at the other comments I still believe this can work for some people but DO NOT waist ur time money and energy</li>
<li> Certainly not worth the money because it can&#x27;t be used.</li>
<li> But... In less than 2 weeks of use, my skin is AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used less than half the bottle</li>
<li> I have hyperpigmentation issues; any little scratch, bump, blemish, whatever, turns into a dark spot on my skin.</li>
<li> After doing a little research for AHA/BHA lotions without parabens I stumbled upon this gem.</li>
<li> One of the few products I&#x27;ve ever tried where I saw immediate results.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used some of their other products (for the face), but this body lotion was the most horrible experience ever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> BUY THIS if you are looking to improve, even or lighten skin tone at all. I have only used it a few times and my legs have already started to peel, leaving fresher, softer skin visible. Oh my god. I love it. Will rebuy. New staple for My hyperpigmentation-prone k.p. skin.</li>
    <li> I have chronic acne on my chest and back.  Perfect image products have changed my life.  This lotion is a little intense.  I feel an itch/sting for about a minute when I put it on.  I actually use rubber dishwashing gloves to put it on because my hands started to dry and peel from it.  But I think it is totally worth it.  I recommend if you have body acne.</li>
    <li> What a great body lotion. Someone mentioned it burns their face. Clearly they don&#x27;t know what body lotion is.  This got rid of my butt acne and break outs on my chest. Yes, it does burn but I would rather be on fire then have breakouts on my body. It doesn&#x27;t burn forever.</li>
    <li> Good body lotion for body acne and also for any scars or discolorations it helps clear up</li>
    <li> It turned into liquid (despite storing in a cool, dry place), burned my skin (leaving patches of scars on my stomach, back and neck), and also created peeling blisters all over my hand. In short, I do not recommend their body lotion. I&#x27;ve used some of their other products (for the face), but this body lotion was the most horrible experience ever.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It smells great and it does what it says it will do. My hands, knees, elbows and feet started to peel after 1 week of applying at night time only. My husband kept commenting on how smooth and even my skin is now. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle when I run out. Please perfect imagine DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT OR CHANGE THE FORMULA.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I&#x27;ve used other products boasting glycolic ingredients; however, none have returned the results that this lotion offers.  It is tingly when applying but you get used to it, especially realizing its wonder working properties.  Love, love, love.....</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!! Been using Glytone for years..will never go back!  This is light, smells great and works better!!</li>
    <li> Used it for 6 month all my discoloration type scars are gone! Does cause itching and burning if used to often. Every other day is best.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion because not only does it feel cooling on irritated skin, it exfoliates all the dead tissue off your skin. It is amazing how much dead skin is on your and how much that it takes off to. The ingredients in this lotions makes your skin feel soft, supple, velvety smooth and helps it regenerate and to keep it healthy too</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any of the burning others have described other than where the skin is not intact. But I have had very fast and very good results with this. I am as white as they come and was raised in Florida. So I have that Florida skin you hear about. This stuff removed most of the dry skin and cellular buildup on my skin within a few days. Wiped out most of my freckles, too. My skin is smooth and shiny  and soft now I will definitely be getting more of this stuff.  Love this!!</li>
    <li> It definitely helps to exfoliate, but like others have said, go light. If not you&#x27;ll be sorry, with sore spots. It&#x27;s an acid so one layer is enough. I limited myself to using it twice a week, it&#x27;s that potent on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love. Been struggling sudden unexplainable acne all over my body and face. Got this yesterday and the first use I saw results the next morning. Also, I paired it with &#x27;Beauty Facial Extreme&#x27; (is also a body exfoliator) and together they&#x27;re even better. Exfoliate in the shower and this product goes after drying off.</li>
    <li> When I first received this lotion it was so watery that I couldn&#x27;t even apply it or shake the bottle like some suggested because it just spilled out from the pump. I contacted the seller and they replaced it and I love it! Since I started using it, about two weeks ago I have noticed dark spots getting lighter and skin is very soft!</li>
    <li> After four months this product is unusable:  it has turned to liquid, no longer a thick cream that can be spread on the skin.  It just runs off like water.  The expiration date is still more than year away so the product should still be good.  Very disappointing, because it did seem promising at the beginning.  Certainly not worth the money because it can&#x27;t be used.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry and rough elbows, knees, and feet. It sloughed away the dead skin cells on the target areas and soften them up too in only a couple of applications.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion and i just got it but it is watery. I cant even get it to stay on my palm. I have used this before which worked great but the consistency was normal. I am not sure what happened to this one.</li>
    <li> I have adult onset acne(face and back) and this lotion has cleared up my skin. It took a few weeks to work up to using it every day, and I do still get the occasional pimple, but nothing like before. It has also helped the soften and smoothen out my skin, it has reduced the fine lines on my face</li>
    <li> Has the consistency of water, sometimes clear, other times a milky color. Tried mixing it up, thinking it had separated but it leaks out of the pump b/c its like water. The smell is also too strong, like old perfume.  Leaves skin silky smooth, though. Wondering if I got a bad batch? Since no one else has mentioned how runny it is.</li>
    <li> Fix this product please... Its not as good as before</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic!  It&#x27;s a bit....TINGLY when you first put it on but you will not believe how soft your problem spots will be.  I&#x27;m using it for elbows, hands, arms and feet and all are looking very nice.  And the smell is heavenly without being overpowering.  A real winner and I will be re-purchasing for sure.</li>
    <li> Great product, visible results (for me at least) in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Works  but, it&lt;br /&gt;Itches and burns my skin</li>
    <li> As much as I wanted to like this product and as soon as I realized a small difference in my skin.. I also saw HIVES. I stopped for about 2 weeks and as soon as I used it again the hives came back!</li>
    <li> Omg this is the worst product I ever used in my life time!I literally got burn, my skin look worst than ever uneven and darker.&lt;br /&gt; Looking at the other comments I still believe this can work for some people but DO NOT waist ur time money and energy buying this if u have a dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product and I already see a change in my skin. I have hyperpigmentation issues; any little scratch, bump, blemish, whatever, turns into a dark spot on my skin. After doing a little research for AHA/BHA lotions without parabens I stumbled upon this gem. It&#x27;s the most non-chemically based lotion I&#x27;ve found, no parabens, and it has lots of awesome supplementary ingredients that are amazing for hyperpigmentation, such as papaya extract, bearberry, and more. Anyway, this stuff is great and I hope that others will be able to benefit from it as well!!</li>
    <li> i cant really use it on my face, since it make my face turn red but its great for the body, especially if you have backne</li>
    <li> Great for fading stretch marks; do not use daily, use every other day; not for sensitive skin; does sting after application even after months of using it; do not apply after shaving; excellent at exfoliating; works well in combination with clarisonic smart body scrubber for very soft blemish free skin; rough patches on elbows and knees gone; worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> One of the few products I&#x27;ve ever tried where I saw immediate results. The smell is nice, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting (always a concern of mine with acid products). After the first use I saw fewer ingrown hairs on the back of my legs as well as softer skin. A little seems to go a long way so even though the bottle is a normal size lotion bottle, it&#x27;s worth the higher price. There are very few products I&#x27;ve been able to say that about, but this is definitely one of them.</li>
    <li> I have a skin condition known as Ichthyosis Vulgaris. (Lovely name, right?) I&#x27;ve had it my entire life and this lotion is a miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;My condition literally means thick fish skin. I&#x27;ve now used it on my entire body, including my face. It has worked like nothing else or even close to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Even my hands, with years of calloused, thick, dead skin, is sloughing off to reveal new, soft skin. My legs have never, ever, even once, been this soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My legs, back and sides normally crack and bleed. But... In less than 2 weeks of use, my skin is AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used less than half the bottle and I&#x27;m already ordering 2 more!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of contact dermatitis issues by my elbows because of allergies to dish soaps and other things and I had bought this to try to sloth off the dead skin in hopes to clear it up. After two applications, the dermatitis has gone away and the skin has softened and I really haven&#x27;t had and severe issues as I have had before.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this lotion. I love the smell of it.  I love how it turns the rough patches of my body soft.  How it is good for your body and not full of chemicals the way almost 75% of other lotions out there on the market are.  And I just love Perfect Image&#x27;s line of beauty products.</li>
    <li> Yes it works but its so itchy!!! like crazy itchy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so torn about how to rate this product.  It&#x27;s literally everything I&#x27;ve been looking for - with one very important exception.  It is so heavily fragranced that I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to use it.  I&#x27;ve been using the Paula&#x27;s Choice glycolic body lotion for quite some time, and I was hoping for something that worked similarly, but was a little stronger.  This functions beautifully leaves my thick, dry skin much softer and more supple.  The smell wouldn&#x27;t be offensive if it weren&#x27;t so strong.  There&#x27;s a LOT of frangrance in this stuff!  I only had a little on my hands and my husband walked by and said, &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that smell?!&amp;#34; - and not in a good way.  UGH!  PLEASE make your products without fragrance!!  I would be a long time customer.  As it stands, I&#x27;m going to use this on my feet and hope the smell doesn&#x27;t continue to annoy us.</li>
    <li> This is the best body lotion i have ever used. This is my 7th day of using this lotion, and i can see a huge difference on my skin. I have lots of spots on my skin from insect bites that refused to fade, but this lotion is definitely fading my spots, i&#x27;m so happy, and not only that, my skin is smooth, glowing and looks so beautiful. I am definitely going to stock up on this. Thanks so much for this wonderful product.</li>
