      <li>I love, love, love it!  </li>
      <li>I love this gadget I use it every day to help my skin cream sink through the skin layers more effectively.</li>
      <li>ease of use:  -Nice design, ergonomic, easy to hold and operate</li>
      <li>I am so glad I decided to purchase it and thankful that I did not have to return it.  </li>
      <li>A year later, I continue to believe this was the best decision ever.</li>
      <li>Now they tend to disappear more.</li>
      <li>I received the Clarisonic Mia as a gift and just love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
      <li>I literally love my Clairsonic Opal Sonic Infusion System with Anti Aging Sea Serum.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They say the infuser helps serums and creams to absorb much better.</li>
      <li>what&#x27;s wonderful is that you can wash entire product</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t by any more Clarisonic products ever again.</li>
      <li>The hand held Opal must rest ON TOP of the plugged-in charger.</li>
      <li>maybe another serum would be better?</li>
      <li>I have heard about this so many times</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>What more can you say?  </li>
      <li>I love the way it shuts off automatically after 30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I called Clarisonic and they told me that neither Amazon nor Beauty Depot &amp; More (the retailer on amazon) are authorized retailers of their products.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m now trying to take better care of my skin.   </li>
      <li>and it makes so much more difference than the serum that comes with the Opal.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Opal Sonic Infusion System for approx 2 weeks, and have had many compliments that I never rec&#x27;d before.  </li>
      <li>My current device has been with me for 2.5 years and is my best friend.  </li>
      <li>I look more rested.  </li>
      <li>I ablsolutely love what this does to my skin around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>You have to line up the silver with the silver when recharging and make sure it does not move while recharging.  </li>
      <li>Love love love this product.</li>
      <li>The company insists that there is no known problem, yet there are so many issues with this product that the wait time to talk to someone about an issue is 35 to45 minutes.</li>
      <li>The more you use it the better.  </li>
      <li>really love it.</li>
      <li>I have used the Clarisonic face brush for years and love it</li>
      <li>Most people tell me I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping to see better results but I  didn&#x27;t see the results i was hoping for with this product.</li>
      <li>and it shuts off after the appropriate amount of time.  </li>
      <li>sure you register the product or buy it from somewhere that you can return it if you don&#x27;t like it or if it breaks (I returned mine to Ulta after 3 wks no problems).  </li>
      <li>Have used it on a daily basis with my nuface trinity and had beautiful results!</li>
      <li>I absolutely Love the Opal.  </li>
      <li>The best part is that it give a nice relaxing little massage while it&#x27;s working.  </li>
      <li>The expression/smile lines have significantly improved also!</li>
      <li>I have noticed fewer fine lines, but I didn&#x27;t have too many to begin with.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working beautifully and skin is definitely tighter with fewer fine lines!</li>
      <li>The price for the Opal from this vendor was cheaper than most and the transaction went smoothly plus arrived on time.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful</li>
      <li>For that reason and because it&#x27;s easy to use, I&#x27;m still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(it costs much more money there) because of all the reviews that state others have experienced the same as I have in terms of recharging.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this gadget -</li>
      <li>This is pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>It plumps the area reducing fine lines.  </li>
      <li>at the end of the day I did not see a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Fine lines/smile wrinkles</li>
      <li>(The light stops flashing when it is fully charged.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The light massage the infuser does</li>
      <li>Fortunately, mine broke within the window of time that Amazon allowed me to return it.  </li>
      <li>I think the sonic device is what makes the product unique.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love this product. I am 30, and had my first appt scheduleded for Botox. After one week of using, I canceled my appt. After one month now, my crows feet around my eyes have almost completely disappeared. I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> love it working a treat, to brighten &amp; smooth eye area, big plus- feels goood?</li>
    <li> By far this is a fantastic product.  I&#x27;m in love with it!!  I can see a clear difference around my eyes. Skin looks tighter and younger.</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time and in good condition as advertised.  My wife is happy with the results of the device and I can see improvement in her face.  I would recommed and will continue to purchase from Amazom for good values.</li>
    <li> contrary to some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read here, I really like the Opal.  If you have wrinkles and crepiness due to dehydrated skin, it really helps hydrate better than eye creams applied the traditional way.  I like how it makes my eye area feel during and after the application.  I use it as instructed from the crowsfeet area along the bone area in circular motion, avoiding the soft tissue of the lower and upper lids, and finish up with my fingers.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it works over the long haul.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Opal Sonic Infusion System for approx 2 weeks, and have had many compliments that I never rec&#x27;d before.  Some statements have been that I look like I&#x27;ve been on vacation because I look so rested.  Another person commented on the color of my eyes that they have  never noticed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all been since I started using this remarkable product.  It  feels soothing  around the eyes and temples.  I actually seen a difference in the first week with the fine lines (crow&#x27;s feet), and the area under my eyes.  It does not get rid of the bags under your eyes, but it also does not claim to.&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is a great product and will continue to use it.  By the way, Dr. Oz recommends it so it can&#x27;t be bad.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> I find this product  very helpful for reaching the center of my back especially for sunscreen and moisturizing lotions.  The only problem I find a set up my motions are thick the ball stuff rolling so I do have to dilute my lotions with a little bit of water and what&#x27;s wonderful is that you can wash entire product I between use. Teresa K</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed less wrinkles around the eye area.  I love the way it shuts off automatically after 30 seconds.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I use the Clarisonic Mia for cleansing and the Opal for around the eyes. I really like both products. I can tell a difference in the way my skin feels and am not seeing as much puffiness around the eyes. I recommend the Opal and feel that it is beneficial but caution that you do not expect it to be a miracle worker. Those type of results do not come in a bottle and typically require the services of a professional in the medical field.  The price for the Opal from this vendor was cheaper than most and the transaction went smoothly plus arrived on time. Would purchase again from this particular marketplace on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my second Clarisonic product.  I received the Clarisonic Mia as a gift and just love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  Based on my love for the Mia, and a particularly stubborn under eye area, I decided to give the Opal a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have genetically bad under eye circles.  When I was twenty, after a full night&#x27;s rest, strangers would ask me if I was tired.  It has been an uphill battle all the way to 42.  I have never had a product for the puffy dark circles under my eyes that I have bought twice, and believe me, I have wasted a lot of money on the stuff.  Six months ago I moved to a tropical island where the humidity hovers around almost raining every day.  My eyes got much worse, and I was looking old and haggard.  I would cry when I looked in the mirror.  On a whim, I ordered this product, just in case it could do something for me.  What did I have to lose, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical.  I tried it the first time in the morning.  At noon, my husband said something to the effect of, \\&quot;Wow, that stuff really works!\\&quot;  He made similar comments, unsolicited out of the blue, for days.  This is coming from a man who last year didn&#x27;t notice for an entire week that I cut my hair three inches and highlighted it.  I can&#x27;t say if it is the cream, which feels like it has some sort of skin tightening stuff in it, or if it is the sonic infusion, or perhaps just the sonic vibrations have improved the circulation, but I really don&#x27;t care.  It works, for the first time ever, something makes my eyes look better.  I look more rested.  It&#x27;s not that my circles are gone, because I don&#x27;t think even surgery would correct the problem I have, but the puffiness and bags have shrunk considerably.  The darkness is still there, but they aren&#x27;t swollen.  I look five years younger.  I have used it more or less consistently twice a day for three weeks now, and I am just thrilled with the results I am seeing.  I am not sure it would affect everyone the same way, but ifyour problem is puffiness under your eyes, this product is for  you.  I have noticed fewer fine lines, but I didn&#x27;t have too many to begin with.  Last week we were on vacation and one night I was  too tipsy and the next day too hungover to bother, and I definitely noticed some puffiness returned, but another day of application and it was back to looking good again.  Seriously, 24 hours later and it was dramatic.  Like I said, the results I am seeing are mostly reduced puffiness, and a slight reduction in fine lines.  I just can&#x27;t believe my eyes!  I highly recommend this if your eyes make you look tired or like have been crying.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this faithfully every night. It is well-made, an excellent product, sturdy and easy to use.  Definately making the skin around her eyes and cheeks softer. Anti-aging? - I&#x27;ll leave that to the researchers.</li>
    <li> I used it religiously for a couple of months. (under the eyes, jaw line, and forehead areas, twice a day).&lt;br /&gt;The Anti-Aging Sea Serum (Parabens free) spreads easier, and you might feel like it&#x27;s working really well, but all it does is hydrating your skin. Everybody needs a good moisturizer. Buy the serum and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;They say the infuser helps serums and creams to absorb much better. The light massage the infuser does (or what they call \\&quot;micro-massages\\&quot;) you can do it with your finger alone. It&#x27;s not worth spending the money.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to believe in miracles but at the end of the day I did not see a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The product appears to be as advertised.  Easy to use. And only after a few uses, little lines are no longer visible.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Very fast service.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy this product when I thought I should check on the warranty offered by the retailer on amazon. I called Clarisonic and they told me that neither Amazon nor Beauty Depot &amp; More (the retailer on amazon) are authorized retailers of their products. Clarisonic honors the warranty only when buyers purchase the products from authorized retailers. Buyers Beware!</li>
    <li> I have entered my thirties so I&#x27;m now trying to take better care of my skin.   The opal was used on my eyes at a spa and I decided I needed one.   It seems to really help to drive the serum (or any other eye product you put on it) deep in to the skin.   My eyes look great.  My skin is happy and hydrated and some of those annoying little wrinkles that come with age are now less visible.    I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase.  The best part is that it give a nice relaxing little massage while it&#x27;s working.  It&#x27;s like a little bonus!   I actually use it with the serum that it came with as well as my other eye product (Neocutis Lumiere).</li>
    <li> I feel using this product and then applying my eye cream twice a day works awesome. I actually purchased mine at Dillards.&lt;br /&gt;It really removes the puffy and hollowness of my eyes. It also helps massage my sinuses in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I really love it. I have a really thin face so crows feet were starting to show. I really have noticed such a significant difference that&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel I need botox anymore. Thank you clarisonic, and the lady at Dillards.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 2 months !&lt;br /&gt;waste of money !! , I read the other reviews but i still bought it .&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&#x27;t ..</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with the charging system of this product. It cannot charge at all less than a year. Besides, the product is less effective than Clarisonic face brush.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was hoping this would be a beneficial product.  I have dark under eye circles, after two weeks of use I ultimately decided this isn&#x27;t helping.  Very disappointing considering how expensive it is! The product did arrive within the date estimated.</li>
    <li> The Sea Serum is typical of any anti aging serum. I think the sonic device is what makes the product unique. I have been using it for about a month now, where there are no &#x27;significant&#x27; changes, I do see a subtle difference. I suppose at my age (54), any help is welcome.</li>
    <li> This is pretty amazing. It really works, but you must use if faithfully every day and it does work. I use it around my eyes and mouth and I&#x27;m telling you it really really works. Lines around my eyes and mouth and are becoming very faint. I&#x27;m 63 and wow this is great!! Thank you Clarisonic for another great product.</li>
    <li> After using the Clarisonic Opal Sonic for only 4 months it stopped working. The warranty expired 3 months ago. It was a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Have used it on a daily basis with my nuface trinity and had beautiful results!</li>
    <li> Worked for about a minute, then quit. Too finicky. I tried to recharge several times, but the thing is dead!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Reducing the dark circles under my eyes.  Even when younger if I didn&#x27;t wear concealer someone assumed I had black eyes (that&#x27;s how dark there were)&lt;br /&gt;* Puffiness (not quite bags, but definitely puffy)&lt;br /&gt;* Upper eyelid droop&lt;br /&gt;* Hydration&lt;br /&gt;* Fine lines/smile wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months of daily use (I might have missed 1 or 2 days) three different people have asked if I have had some kind of plastic surgery.  All three are friends and relatives I see on again/off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Dark circles dramatically reduced&lt;br /&gt;* Puffiness reduced&lt;br /&gt;* No significant change in upper eyelid&lt;br /&gt;* Hydration definitely improved&lt;br /&gt;* No change in fine lines or smile wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an eye cream in the morning and then use their product in the evening.  I have noticed I use less of the eye cream than I did before when applying it with my ring fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been an excellent investment for me.  I am adding this review while purchasing a second one as a gift.</li>
    <li> It feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I see a difference each time.&lt;br /&gt;I like the vibrations over the eye area it&#x27;s the perfect massage for a sensitive place like that.</li>
    <li> Returning this...  Not as pictured.  Picture shows a 1.7oz bottle of serum.  This came with 1/3 of that amount.  Not okay..</li>
    <li> I have heard about this so many times I finally got it. I&#x27;m a big fan of the clarisonic cleansing facial brush. That alone really does wonders for my skin. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now (twice a day sometimes 3 ) and still have only charged it once.  It does get the serums to penetrate so fine lines are definitely less noticeable. I wish they had a bigger tip for the whole face application;)</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m a senior, smile lines and lip lines seem to appear over night.  I use my Opal daily and keep my experience lines soft and less noticiable. Clarisonic serum is used with my eye cream, double duty to be sure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to rate an item that dies within a couple of weeks.  It didn&#x27;t hold a charge and now won&#x27;t charge at all...</li>
    <li> I made a serious mistake purchasing this product. I have returned it 4 times because the unit will not charge or turn on. The company insists that there is no known problem, yet there are so many issues with this product that the wait time to talk to someone about an issue is 35 to45 minutes. I spent $185.00 and have used it less than 2dozen Times in a year. Clarifying does not stand behind this product and turn the issue to the customer. I was told to view a video on U-tube to learn how to charge this unit. AFTER THE 4th return today I received a beat up unit that was filthy.They claim that this was the unit that I returned to then after I received a replacement. I NEVER EVEN USED THIS ONE BECAUSE IT NEVER WORKED! NOT ONE USE. I Ask sick to my stomach thinking that I touched this filthy Opal. Please don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I did.</li>
    <li> I have been using store brand roller balls for under eye puffiness.  I was not seeing any results.  When I started looking into the Opal  I became hesitant due to the price and everything else i tried showed no results.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to go for it .  What did I have to lose.  If it did&#x27;nt work out i could just return it and continue on with my search of the perfect product.  After the 1st couple of treatments I noticed some of the puffiness had diminished.  I am so glad I decided to purchase it and thankful that I did not have to return it.  I recommend the opal to anyone who is concerned about the delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> Cannot see any change very expensive would not purchase again.  Bottom line save money, get a professional facial and use good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> would not repair or exchange . I have all paper work but didnt keep the box. do not buy from them.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all. Totally unimpressed. No results. I gave it away. I won&#x27;t by any more Clarisonic products ever again. I bought the Clarisonic Aria and it was awful. This one is equally as awful.</li>
    <li> Personally, think it&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this in March and it now will not charge.  Can&#x27;t return it so really regret that she bought this online from this vendor. Very expensive and now it will not work.  A 30 day return policy?  Really?</li>
    <li> I am not sure how well this product works but I am hopeful. My only concern is that the cup that holds the serum made only be applicable for the serum which comes with the product and I like to use several different anti wrinkle lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love it!  What more can you say?  It has done so much for me already, that I cannot imagine what my skin will look like after using it a few more months.  I have only been using it for about three weeks and can already see the difference!  Get product and great price for the results you see!  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was very optimistic about this item based on other reviews I had read. I wanted to be as certain as possible that this would be worth the large expense.&lt;br /&gt;But...After following directions and using the Opal with the the eye serum included with the purchase by Clairsonic for a month, the results have been terrible. Yes, some ingredient in the serum gives a nice cooling sensation, but that has nothing to do with the Opal itself. The one small area of puffiness I&#x27;ve always had under one eye was worse and the other eye has developed one! The only reasons I&#x27;ve given a rating this high, is because some of the other reviews had mentioned they had used other brands of eye serums, and I have not tried that. Honestly, I&#x27;m afraid to.</li>
    <li> pain in the neck to use every day&lt;br /&gt;i like my clarisonic cleanser b/c i can keep in the shower between charges.  this must be used out of the shower and i find it annoying</li>
    <li> I received this product as advertised. It was the best price for the product and the additional items included that I could find on the internet or in my community. I am hopeful the results will be as advertised on the Clairsonic website.</li>
    <li> How it works:  -Clarisonic Opal works by gently &amp; quickly vibrating to help massage products into skin  -Vibrations are gentle but I still got a really weird feeling having something vibrate so close to my eye, it didn&#x27;t hurt but it wasn&#x27;t something that I looked forward to using everyday - others however may enjoy the sensation  Look/ease of use:  -Nice design, ergonomic, easy to hold and operate - there&#x27;s only one button on and off  -Simple to charge, magnetic charge clicks onto base unit  Results:  -Very minimal to no change in 3 weeks to wrinkles/lines under eyes - more moisturized than usual but I wasn&#x27;t using a special cream at all before using the device so I can&#x27;t attribute the extra moisturization to just the device  -I mainly purchased this for help with dark circles under the eye - no change at ALL  -Device stopped holding a charge after 3wks even if I tried to charge it for 24hrs straight, it would not work; since there were no results &amp; I didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy using it I did not bother to try to get a replacement.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews where the device has stopped holding as charge as well.  Be wary of the reviews on Clarisonic website - I posted a review on their site and they would not publish it because it was not positive; they also would not publish my comments that I made on other people&#x27;s reviews that did not rave about the product.  Careful when deciding to purchase or not - there seems to be quality issues with the manufacturing - make sure you register the product or buy it from somewhere that you can return it if you don&#x27;t like it or if it breaks (I returned mine to Ulta after 3 wks no problems).  I think that getting a good eye cream &amp; being consistent with your routine is the best bet.</li>
    <li> First off. . .I have not purchased this product but will be doing so (saving up for it; added to my wishlist).  I do however want to review the results of it after only one use.  I visited a local spa and they used this little baby on my eyes, what a difference!  I immediately noticed the difference.  The Esthetician who did my facial prepped one eye and showed me with a mirror the immediate difference.  She then continued on the second eye and truly what a difference i noticed.  The eye area was youthful!  This effect lasted for about 48 hours.  Like the other reviews I&#x27;ve read here, this is not a miracle cure but it does give a youthful appearance to your eye area.  It plumps the area reducing fine lines.  Can&#x27;t wait to order this!  I bought the serum and it does feel great but i&#x27;m not getting the same results without the Sonic Infuser.</li>
    <li> I saw this on The Revolution TV show...it&#x27;s supposed to get the new serums into your skin.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but I really like it.  Easy to use and it shuts off after the appropriate amount of time.  Whether it really works is to be proven, but it can&#x27;t hurt.  All the new MIRACLE wrinkle creams - those that promise instant results - tell you to tap into the skin.  This does that for you.  Is it a must have?  Not necessarily, but it sure beats me tapping on my face in the mirror like a moron.  It feels like it&#x27;s doing something.  Expensive, yes.  But it&#x27;s your face -- if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;d spend a small fortune to try out the new things to get rid of the old things -- wrinkles.  Try it.  you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a few months to let people know if I actually see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have had my Opal for 4 years.  4 years ago I had bags under my eyes (I was 44) I went to a plastic surgeon and he was honest enough to tell me to come back when I was 50.  The lady I worked with kept pointing the sagging skin under my eyes.  She had surgery under her eyes and tried to get me to do the same.  Her surgery was amazing.  I thought about going to a different plastic surgeon, but after hearing that it was $3000 dollars to do the surgery I opted for the Opal. I bought it at a high end salon for $199.00  It took almost a YEAR of use before really seeing a noticeable difference.  I use it everyday.  4 years later my eyes are tight, firm and people cannot believe I am 48.  Most people tell me I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s.  This product takes a long time to see results.  The more you use it the better.  I think what really works is the massage you get under your eyes more than the product penetration.  I think the vibrations break up the fatty tissue under the eyes, but this takes a very long time to work.  The Dr. I visited explained that the surgery will suck out the fatty tissue that causes the bags, but then some people end up with a hollow look under their eyes which is very displeasing.  So why not take the time to use the product and get rid of the fatty tissue slowly.  NOTHING except plastic surgery will work immediately.  It took years to build up the fatty tissue, so it will take a long time to get rid of it.  Also, the first one I bought would not recharge.  Clarisonic WILL send you a new one.  I went through 3 before I realized I was not charging it right.  You have to line up the silver with the silver when recharging and make sure it does not move while recharging.  After returning 3 devices, I finally figured out how to charge properly.  My current device has been with me for 2.5 years and is my best friend.  I skip some beauty routines, but NEVER my Opal.  Just give it time, time, time........</li>
    <li> pricey but appears to be a good delivery system for eye creams. Have only been using for a little over 30 days so I haven&#x27;t seen any visible changes yet but I&#x27;ve always worn eye creams so my lines were not that pronounced to begin with.</li>
    <li> I have used the Clarisonic facebrush since it came out. It is amazing. The Opal is good too, although it not easy to judge how much serum the tip needs for both eyes. I have used the Opal once a week and can see a difference. So I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a beauty junkie not in the sense of quantity but more in the aspect of always seeking quality means to look my best while remaining surgery free. I came into the skincare game.. sleeping with full makeup, never moisturizing, washing face with bar soap until I turned 25. Then I turned 30 and splurged on the opal (happy birthday to me!). A year later, I continue to believe this was the best decision ever. The few fine lines around my eyes and two tiny lines on my forehead are all but gone. The expression/smile lines have significantly improved also! Coupled with Restorsea eye cream and EVOO this tool can get you back to those youthful days. Ive gone back to being confused for being in my early 20s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This birthday I splurged on the Clarisonic Mia - it definitely helps your skin absorb your products better and feel super soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about a week, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic facial cleanser for a year and love it.  So far, my eye area is staying nicely moisturized, and I have high hopes that this will improve the texture of the skin.  I&#x27;m also using it around my mouth area.  So far I really liking it, and am going to get one for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I like the Opal system.  I feel that my &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; are disappearing if I use it every day.  The problem is I work nights and do not use it every night.  Also, because I have allergies, it does make the swelling go down a bit.  I do not use it twice a day.  If used in the morning, it seems that my concealer (powder) just sticks to it, even when dried.  So I just use it night!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Clarisonic face brush for a few months and really like it.  A friend of mine recommended the opal to me because I&#x27;m always complaining abt the dark circles around my eyes and the slight crows feet beginning to develop.  Although the Opal is quite pricey I was able to justify the cost since I&#x27;ve probably spent thousands of dollars over the past 42 years on various lotions and potions promising to \\&quot;erase dark circles\\&quot; which never worked.  I absolutely Love the Opal.  I swear for the first time in my life I see a noticeable reduction in the dark circles around my eyes and the crows feet seem less prominent.  I highly recommend this product! As far as the hardware itself it&#x27;s very durable and they provided extra tips and serum in the original box.  I like to use the serum with my opal and then follow it up with another eye cream.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> Love this thing! It really makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for around my eyes.  In the first few days the fine lines were diminished and my eyes feel so soft. Defnitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product charger stopped working after just three weeks. Just called Clarisonic, however, and they are sending a replacement. They were very easy to work with and I did purchase directly from Amazon. Hoping to see results when the new one arrives.</li>
    <li> I ablsolutely love what this does to my skin around my eyes.  I use it with [[ASIN:B0017W2GIO Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer(R) For Eyes With Durian Cell Reform(TM) 0.5 oz]](Recommendation from Ulta) and it makes so much more difference than the serum that comes with the Opal. The area around my eyes are tighter and firmer and my eyes look much less tired.  It really is an amazing combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it every day for 2 weeks, and then went to charge it.  It wouldn&#x27;t charge and now it is completely dead and won&#x27;t charge at all.  I am currently attempting to return it to Amazon.  I think that I might go to Ulta and buy it (it costs much more money there) because of all the reviews that state others have experienced the same as I have in terms of recharging.  Fortunately, mine broke within the window of time that Amazon allowed me to return it.  I have to give it a 1-star for durability and quality.  Seriously... 2 weeks and broken?</li>
    <li> I use it every day and love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful and I want to recommend my friends to have one.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and am not quite sold on it.  It&#x27;s a maybe in my book.  Maybe it works and maybe it doesn&#x27;t....I won&#x27;t purchase anymore.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has very high standards for her skin products. She was extremely happy with the quality and effectiveness of the system. She was very excited with its effect on dark under eye circles. Guess its different than the Mia which she also has for acne n skin care</li>
    <li> I am looking for some new serum for my eyes and would like to give this new product a try, but it is stop working after first use! I am so unlucky! But I am happy with Amazon, my favorest company in this world! Love their immidiately service!</li>
    <li> I liked the Clarisonic Opal and used it religiously for about 6 weeks. I was amazed at how long it held the charge....4 weeks of using it once a day. Then I charged it and it lasted for 1 week and stopped working. I just tried charging it again, for 24 hours, and the blue light is on, indicating that it is fully charged, yet it won&#x27;t turn on at all Needless to say, I&#x27;m disappointed and will be returning it. I&#x27;m not sure if I will replace it or not as I&#x27;m thinking that just a decent serum and eye cream would have the same effect. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> Loved the product but it stopped charging two days after I got it.  This is the second one I purchased.  The first also stopped charging after 1 month.</li>
    <li> THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE OPAL DOES NOT APPEAR TO DO ANY DAMAGE AND FEELS QUITE GOOD AROUND THE EYES.  THE BAD NEWS IS THAT I STILL HAVE THE SAME PUFFINESS UNDER THE EYES THAT I HAVE HAD. NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER AND I AM FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS IMPLICITLY. SO IF YOU ARE BUYING IT TO REDUCE PUFFINESS, DON&#x27;T BUY IT.</li>
    <li> The product itself works great and is worth a 4 star on the skin car part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the design for charging is nothing but fancy and useless and is only 2 star. It takes a FULL 24 hours to charge and last only 40-45 min of use, which last only slightly more than a week. This product is supposed to be used twice a day, so how can it take 24 hours to charge??? The designer must not have used the product but solely thinks it&#x27;s cool to use the touch pad to charge, pointless!</li>
    <li> Just in the few days I have had it and getting into the habit of using it, I love it.  I am a senior&lt;br /&gt;and need that deep moisturizer.  If it works on my skin (which is good) it will work for anyone.</li>
    <li> Suggested by my sister and she didn&#x27;t lie.  I noticed results almost immediately.  I have now ordered the sonic brush to go with it.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I literally love my Clairsonic Opal Sonic Infusion System with Anti Aging Sea Serum. It has gotten rid of the \\&quot;aged look\\&quot; that I was experiencing before I started using my Opal. Many have noticed a difference but are not sure what I have done. Thanks Opal!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift.  I don&#x27;t think I could have been talked into forking over the money for this little gadget, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed no difference.  Hoped it&#x27;d work for my crepey skin around my eyes.  Long term, it may be stretching my skin less and keeping it from sagging because I&#x27;m not applying eye cream with my fingers.  For that reason and because it&#x27;s easy to use, I&#x27;m still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the sales person did not tell me to do it this way, I move it from the inside out because I learned from getting a special face-lift facial (can&#x27;t remember what it was called) that lymph can collect around eyes and cause puffiness.  Moving it in that direction might help flush the lymph and reduce puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It often takes over 24 hours for mine to be fully charged but it does hold it for over two weeks.  (The light stops flashing when it is fully charged.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have used different eye creams with it.  I find the Clarisonic one applies best. I prefer and usually use another product, though.  I also found that I use less eye cream because it&#x27;s easy to measure out how much you need into the tip and I get it right where it needs to go.  Perhaps that will help in recovering the cost for some of you.</li>
    <li> After researching product I took the plunge.  Product is exactly as advertised, new in box.  I have only used it a couple of days so the jury is still out.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it and uses it everyday. She and I are amazed at the results.</li>
    <li> I love this gadget I use it every day to help my skin cream sink through the skin layers more effectively. It feels good on the skin as well a bit like having a small massage.</li>
    <li> I would like a full refund.  This unit does not charge properly.  I have owned other units without any problem, so I do know how to operate the device. How do I get a full refund? How do I return this defective unit. Please respond to wingmb@sbcglobal.net</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see better results but I  didn&#x27;t see the results i was hoping for with this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my wife&#x27;s 60th birthday and she absolutely loves it. She uses it almost daily. The price paid was also a great deal better than most other websites and local alternatives.</li>
    <li> Unlike a lot of women who&#x27;ve written about this product, I&#x27;m NOT a gadget junkie. I hate gadgets, am a true sceptic, and after buying this thing saved the shipping box for three weeks, assuming I&#x27;d be returning it. Last week I put the box into the recycling bin: the Opal is a keeper.  Is it going to make your bags and circles completely disappear? Probably not, especially if you&#x27;re over 50. But will it help? Absolutely. I am 53, take great care of myself, eat properly, don&#x27;t smoke or drink, get plenty of exercise and look much younger than my years. What gives my age away? The stupid bags under my eyes, which are genetic and look more pronounced as my skin thins, as have the circles under and between my eyes. The only thing that&#x27;s truly going to eradicate the bags is plastic surgery but I don&#x27;t have $4,000 to spare. The Opal has definitely helped, though, and I feel so much less self-conscious about my bags. They have not disappeared--perhaps they&#x27;ve been reduced by about 10%. However, what I believe HAS changed, is there is improved circulation to this area, so the pigmentation is closer to the rest of my skin tone; prior to using the Opal, the skin under my eyes was whiter than the rest of my skin which made the bags appear even larger. Now they tend to disappear more. I do believe the circles are also less apparent and easier to cover up with concealer, as they too have benefited from this improved circulation. An important note: a few other women have written about broken blood vessels and bruising. The instructions CLEARLY STATE that you should only use the Opal on the bone surrounding the eye, not on the soft tissue itself. If you think by pressing hard on the delicate under-eye tissue with this device you are going to eliminate your bags, you are only going to cause damage to this sensitive area. So read the instructions and use as directed.  Anyway, hope this positive review from a self-described sceptic helps!</li>
    <li> Only fair to REVISE this review:  I&#x27;ve used the Opal for more than a month now and do see results of decreased puffiness and fine lines around eyes and around mouth.  Bought more soft tips as I plan to keep using it daily (often twice a day). I&#x27;m using the suggested serum...maybe another serum would be better? However, last week I had trouble charging the unit. The charger rejected placement on the unit. After 24 hours, the unit was still dead BUT  IT WAS MY FAULT!  The hand held Opal must rest ON TOP of the plugged-in charger. It&#x27;s working beautifully and skin is definitely tighter with fewer fine lines!</li>
    <li> It broke after a few uses - zero customer service. This is a low quality product with an even lower quality company behind it. You will wait on hold forever unless you want to buy something then when you finally talk to somebody they have no authority to help you and the supervisors won&#x27;t return calls. Terrible product, terrible company - save your money.</li>
    <li> Initially, I gave this 3 stars since I believed the issue was more of finding a suitable eye cream than any issue with the Clarisonic.  I&#x27;m revising my review to 1 star.  As with other folks, after just one month the unit stopped charging and became a $174 dust collector. I never got to use it long enough to even find out if it was worthwhile or could make a difference.  Given the price of this unit, I expected it to make a noticeable improvement (it didn&#x27;t within 30 days) and DEFINITELY expected it to last more than a month before breaking.  I&#x27;m going to go back to using my finger to apply the eye cream - a lot less expensive and not likely to break in a month.  I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this gadget - I found it to be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use the Clarisonic Opal Sonic Infusion System every day. I saw this product on Dr. Oz and was not sure if it was worth the money, but my wrinkles around the eyes are diminishing and it gives my eyes a fresh look.</li>
    <li> I was a little underwhelmed with this. I have used the Clarisonic face brush for years and love it but this one is a little awkward to use and I don&#x27;t see much benefit so far.</li>
    <li> A must with anyone concerned about aging around the eyes.  Twice a day 30 seconds is all it takes.  The serum is a cooling tightening gentle treatment and you can feel and see the results.  The Opal isn&#x27;t waterproof like the Clarisonic products but it works just as well with anti-aging for the delicate lines on the face and around the eyes.</li>
</ol>
