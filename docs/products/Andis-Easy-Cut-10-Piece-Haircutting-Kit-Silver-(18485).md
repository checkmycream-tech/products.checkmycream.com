<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sooo.. I actually purchased this for my dog. And let me tell you it does the job, no need to purchase an expensive &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; labeled clipper.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Items don&#x27;t usually work after the probation period.</li>
    <li> Does not cut very well. Hair got stuck and ended up being pulled instead.</li>
    <li> Clippers do not work. Sometimes when it&#x27;s turned on it makes a loud racket; most other times it does not turn on at all. The only useful thing to do with these is try to return them.</li>
    <li> Motor is only 7200 cspm (cutting strokes per minute) which means if your a african american like me, the clippers will just get stuck in your hair, and snag it, happened over 20x during one self cut, been cutting my own hair for about 4 years, so I know what I&#x27;m doing. Their not bad, but cheaply made, and  no hook to hang it, my suggestion is save a little bit more money and buy one with 10,000 cspm or better.</li>
    <li> does the job but its a little poorly made but so far so good the attachments are good but once again cheaply made if you cut your hair once in a while its ok but if you are a neat freak buy something better</li>
    <li> They do the job. Have not had time to explore all usage of this item.  Bought to use on the dog......people clippers cheaper than&lt;br /&gt;those for pets.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Seems to be well made. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Terrible product worked once then broke do not buy</li>
    <li> It was broken a bit. It looks used</li>
    <li> I bought this article for a gift and i was sad because he did not cut  hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull the hair and this hurts</li>
    <li> I zorry is my adress.4600 sirius ave apto d 53 las vegas nv .zc 89102.please</li>
    <li> Just after a little over 3 years, the motor went dead. Oh well, at least I got my money&#x27;s worth with about 10 cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I bought a bad one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline is , stay away from this haircutting kit if you want a reliable clipper.</li>
    <li> Easy to.understand and use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son but he hasn&#x27;t said much about the kit so I&#x27;m assuming everything is fine otherwise he would have mentioned his dissatisfaction with the clippers; we&#x27;ve had Andis clippers in the past but they were more costly.</li>
    <li> all my circuit breakers tripped, scared the bajeebies out of me, i thought i was going to get electricuted, i still have flash backs, but it could have just been this one product...</li>
    <li> It has some problems,it was blunte or not sharp,staks while I was using ,but now I have fixed it.Thanks for your review</li>
    <li> The Andis model # MC-2 clipper is a heavy clipper.    This clipper is much heavier than either the [[ASIN:B001GQ3GF8 Wahl Self Cut clipper]] or [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper (Model SCC-100R)]].    The heaviness affect maneuverability during self cuts.    Hopefuly acclaimation will occur over time, otherwise the expenditure will become a finanical lost.</li>
    <li> I have had this product since march 2014... i worked well at first but the clippers have stopped cutting....it comes on but the blades are no longer moving....short term product i would say yes....but if you need something that will last ....this isnt the product for you!</li>
    <li> Very good product, recommended</li>
    <li> A great price and fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I wish it had come in a case, but oh well. Comes with some nice stuff: comb, scissors, and several adjustor things which is nice and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, has a lever for fine adjustment of cutting length, i.e. you can do .5 or 1.5 or 2.5. Saves a lot of money and works well.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent item</li>
    <li> I wanted something cost effective and this is what I found. Although it didnt have much reviews I decided to give it a shot and just wow! It works great at trimming hair, works fast and accurate, even include a hair cutting scissor and comb all at a low price so it fits my needs. It also has a nice average size cord so its easy to use and also pretty quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really recommend this product for anyone who wants good quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> So, very, heavy. Not sure about the blades sharpness for brand new. hopefully will work out kinks soon.</li>
    <li> My husband complains that it makes too much noise. It cuts the hair pretty well, but the noise it comes with takes away the good features of the product. I dont think i will buy this item again</li>
    <li> not good is chinise made stuff not original</li>
    <li> broke 20 mins after i took it out the box and started cutting some hair. the moving blade&#x27;s mount didnt fit on the arm from the motor so when it ran it seized up the motor.</li>
    <li> The scissors that come with this kit are abominable.  I used them four days ago to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair and a nerve on my right thumb is still numb.  Not only were they uncomfortable and a poor fit, they were dull and kept catching his hair and causing him pain.  Horrible. Do not buy this if you need the scissors.</li>
    <li> It works well and good price.</li>
    <li> It already paid for itself :)</li>
    <li> Works great! My husband LOVED it!</li>
    <li> Abig waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I had to take it to a friend to adjust the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;it produces loud and annoying sound while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth</li>
    <li> Worked well during the first uses but then, it works but less powerful. But sincerely I do not have to complain.</li>
    <li> Now all I have to get is get the liners. I think that&#x27;s what you call the hair cutters. hmm</li>
    <li> I was hesitant because the price was so low but they turned out to be a great pair of clippers.  No regrets whatsoever.</li>
    <li> These clippers work very well. We like all the attachments that came with it. That way we can use it for different hair cuts.</li>
    <li> THE CLIPPERS WORK GREAT THANKS.</li>
    <li> These clippers will cut your hair however if you want to get a really clean close shave these are not the clippers for you. I&#x27;m rather disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this item, but I knew if I had a problem with it, I could always return it. I&#x27;ve tried many simple hair cutters in my time and I always regret it. After one or two cuts, the other \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; brands show their true colors (namely blood red when they start tugging your hair, even when trimming your eyebrows). Whenever I go to the barber, I always marvel at their shavers. How do they cut so easily, so effortlessly, so cleanly? \\&quot;Surely, it must be that those shavers cost a fortune,\\&quot; I reasoned. When I found this shaver on Amazon, I knew I was going to be getting the best in customer satisfaction, so I knew I could take the plunge yet again on a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; shaver, and this one happened to cost less than a single haircut at the barber. When I tried it, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it cut very long hair, even very close to the scalp. Perhaps I was duped all along, and the shavers at the barber were these simple ones, and they were making a fortune off of me. Either way, I am very pleased with my purchase, and I highly recommend this to others in the same boat as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (08/14/2012)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four months later, these blades are still going strong. My father was over at my house visiting and I showed him how easy it is to give yourself a haircut using these, and I could tell he was impressed. For those of you who are having issues with these, keep in mind that Amazon will replace defective items for free. For those who have yet to buy these, just know that they should work perfectly right out of the box and (as it is with any other of these shavers) do not fiddle around with the \\&quot;indented circle\\&quot; with a screwdriver -- otherwise you&#x27;re just asking for trouble.</li>
    <li> Good for self use, cuts everything from the hair on my head to below the belt. Would not recommend for pets or commercial use.</li>
    <li> seriously good metal construction. Yes its heavier then most clippers. That&#x27;s cause it&#x27;s made of quality materials. Unlike the crap you find in the big retail stores.</li>
    <li> It got to my house fast and not only was the product easy to use but it was safe and no hard problems while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend this Item to all those to need shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005NZ6790 Andis 18485 Home Haircut 10 Piece Haircutting Kit]]</li>
    <li> I have a cordless one which is small and slow, so I got this one to speed up trimming my beard.  Unfortunately, this one is almost as slow as the cordless one.  I have to move across my beard as a really slow rate or it pulls and doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this purchase, cheap product, I would not recommend this product.  They do not cute your hair as stated.</li>
    <li> After nearly a year and a half, it&#x27;s going as amazingly as ever. We are military and this has easily saved us hudreds in haircut costs. It pays for itself after just two haircuts!!! Absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t get a close cut</li>
    <li> Well I brought this little baby off Amazon and the Andis easy cut at walmart. This one was by far better the easy cut blades got hit after 5 minutes of cutting my 4yr old hair. Got a refund for the easy cut and finish his hair off with no problems using this model. Didn&#x27;t heat up in ny hand or his scalp. Ppl don&#x27;t ldt the price fool you , glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Bad es  home not profesional not cut very expensive not power easy machine nada buena no tiene estuche de la foto</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty good, I use it for my husband haircutting, the set is useful ,and works great!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> Since I have had the Andis Easy Cut 10-Piece Haircutting Kit I hve been able to keep my hair in good shape. It is simple to use with simple instructions that don&#x27;t confuse. One of the advantages of this products is it does not require any charging time. Just plug it in and use it.</li>
    <li> Dropped it once. cheap plastic. Not bad as long as you never do anything to it. treat it like glass.</li>
    <li> I broke my Original kit buy leaving them on my hood of my car and someone ran them over!!!!! I originally paid 49.99 in the store for andis but didnt want to spend that much this time. They came in the mail pretty fast and when i recieved them they were very sturdy.They came with oil, scissors and guards great bu highly suggested if you just need something simple</li>
    <li> This thing died on my after 2 use!  After my first use, the blade became very dull and it felt like someone pulling your hair constantly. On my third use, the clipper died 2 minutes into cutting my HAIR.  This crap made me look like an idot with half my hair cut.  I can not recommend this crap to my worst enemy.  Now I am waiting for my Panasonic clipper to finish my hair cut.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> really very good haircuting and easy to use with instructions attached.I&#x27;m learnig how to have the best style.will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. This product was okay I just think I want to bag and it really really made me mad.</li>
    <li> This is a nice clipper but it was not sharp. My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t use it when he received it because the blade was dull. People gave it a good review but not happy that he couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> item buzzer broke after using once! Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Great clipper to have and cuts quite well with little effort. Andis makes great clippers. The price was right anytime.</li>
    <li> great, use twice a week.</li>
    <li> For $11.99, You can&#x27;t beat this. I expected them to feel cheap. They feel heavy and solid in the hand. And cut perfectly! The best 12 dollars I&#x27;ve spent in a long time! Well worth it!!</li>
    <li> I bought these to shave my dog who is a Chow and let me tell you, shaving that fur is just horrible no matter what you use, but these clippers were awesome. I have shaved him dry and with all his hair wet and matted down, but that was no problem with these things! They do get really hot when you use it for a long time, but since these are supposed to be for people hair, I don&#x27;t see that being a problem. I don&#x27;t like that you have to constantly put oil on it, but that also might just be because I use them on Chow fur. Anyways, good product!</li>
    <li> Worked once, Then it kicked the bucket.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even open it up to fix the thing due to the screws being so cheap and seemingly pre-stripped.</li>
    <li> Does not cut through my Bichon&#x27;s thick thick hair! I need a sheep shearer! :-)</li>
    <li> Pretty rubbish. Only 4 adjustable cutting lengths and mine is faulty, intermittently makes a loud rattling, jarring sound. Short cable. It&#x27;s also huge, bigger than other models that fit the hand nicely and don&#x27;t weigh a lot unlike this one. There are better models out there.</li>
    <li> This product works fine but is very noisy and vibrates a who;le lot will have to bring it to the technician to do a little bit of work on it.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace a clipper that functioned for five years.  This one lasted only two months and precipitously died.  Got two haircuts out of it.</li>
    <li> I have not had any problems with these trimmers. This one worked fine for me. I would recommend to anyone today.</li>
    <li> Clippers are great but the guards and cheap plastic and were bent upon reciept...4 stars because we had to replace the guards</li>
    <li> This works quite well for our needs, which is a clean shaven head.  It is not too noisy, and will save us the cost of many haircuts.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my son&#x27;s hair. I loved it. It was very easy to use. Was able to clip the different sizes on and off with a breeze.</li>
    <li> a good set of clippers. I ordered this to shave my poodle and was pleased with the results. it comes with plenty of different size guards and lube.</li>
    <li> Pays for itself the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> I brough t heses clippers they are great hair clippers to style your hair for the price its great quality</li>
    <li> These hairclippers have been through the ringer getting use on both of our dogs many times a year.  The unit doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat even if we use it continuously for 30 minutes on two very hair dogs.  So far happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price and effective for cutting hair.im required to write more and this is it done with my opinion. Happy.</li>
    <li> It gets REALLY hot really fast (in under 5 minutues) but it does its job.</li>
    <li> Excellent good quality and the color is good in this price but brings combs are very fragile. thanks bay. Thanks for product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say I got what I paid for with this item. The clippers are fairly heavy and look cheaper than the price. They cut good only on extremely dry hair, other than that it clumps up and clogs easily. The guards are much bigger than expected which only gives a few choice selections for me. Other than that the clippers are worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as my older clippers! Tends to get stuck, requiring constant oiling!</li>
    <li> came broken and remanded</li>
    <li> Ehh switch is junk...</li>
    <li> We thought it was a bad clipper. Cut very course and pulled hair. Even popped the safety power switch (or else it may have fried the unit). I see similar reviews here. But it is not bad after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the clippers just required an adjustment with the power screw on the side (and a drop of oil). Worked great today. 10x better than the way it was shipped to me. Guess there was a booklet for a reason this time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite convenient for me because I am used to have very short hair. Actually I could shave by myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give myself in between haircuts as I have a pixie cut. and for the price I received so much more than what I was expecting. great little machine.</li>
    <li> Only like four attachments came #1-4, where did 5-9 go, I don&#x27;t know. Recommend buying one from C.V.S. or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this item because my 10 year old clippers broke and I enjoy keeping my beard and hair groomed. It doesn&#x27;t come with oil to lubricate the blades nor, does it come lubricated so you will need to buy your own oil for it. There is also a tension screw on the side you&#x27;&#x27;ll need to mess with it  if its pulling your hair until you get it to where its comfortable for you. It was comfortable for me out of the box and cut my beard and hair like butter. which made for a very enjoyable shave and hair cut. Also, its nice and heavy feels very well built, I like the weight in my hand the blades don&#x27;t grind together or whine and the motor is pretty quiet, so I enjoy it, the cable length is also really nice as the plug in the bathroom is on the upper part of the wall. So, really for twelve dollars I am more then happy with these clippers. The picture on the display is correct other than you get no oil and no brush. So, I recommend buying this if you want an all in one hair cutting product.</li>
    <li> A++++ Higly recommended</li>
    <li> These cheap clippers broke after one use wish id read a review first definitely a waste of money do not buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> only works when I hold the cord a certain way</li>
    <li> It works. It is heavy, bulky and has a power cord attached to it. The price is right.</li>
    <li> I hated triming time , This huge thing pulled my beard hairs and was very heavy , Bukly big and Loud But it gets one point for cheap price</li>
    <li> This is a very low quality product. It hardly cuts at all, and when it does it feels like a constant tugging on your scalp. I would advise anyone and everyone not to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done well, and for such a great value, you can&#x27;t go wrong! I&#x27;ve been using it to cut my hair for about 2 months now, can&#x27;t complain :)</li>
    <li> First of all the pictures are misleading. It does not come with the case or DVD. It seems to be made of a high quality which impressed me. However it performs so so. I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for years and with these I have to go over the same spot several times to cut it all. Takes me twice as long with these clippers. I&#x27;ll continue using my store bought cheap clippers and keep this as a backup. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good budget clippers. If the noise scares you....you got problems. They aren&#x27;t any louder than any clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for over 15 years now. They cut fine, even with my thick hair</li>
    <li> I am very dissappointed with this kit.It doesn&#x27;t work when its plugged in.Waste of my precious money</li>
    <li> . . . because it certainly does not cut hair. If you plan on spending $10 on this product, you might as well send it to me, because I&#x27;ll gladly not cut your hair for $10.</li>
    <li> When I pulled this out of the box, the first thing I noticed was that it was heavy.  That&#x27;s a good sign, because it meant it was made of good quality materials and wasn&#x27;t going to fall apart on me.  Once the power screw was adjusted, it ran smoothly and I cut two heads of hair in a row.  My son appreciated that the razor didn&#x27;t pull on his hair like our last one did.  I wish the cord were a little longer because I pulled it out of the wall twice while I was using it, but a short extension cord will take care of that.  Our previous razor was cordless and only lasted about 30 minutes, then took a long time to recharge, which is why I wanted one with a cord.  I am really glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Was a gud machine but it messed up a couple of months later</li>
    <li> Good as the other Andis hair cutting set I ordered awhile ago.  Sure saves a lot of money every week.</li>
    <li> Awful product do not waste your money&lt;br /&gt;With this trimer it&#x27;s the worst you rather&lt;br /&gt;Go to walmart and buy the $15 one.&lt;br /&gt;The thing don&#x27;t cut hair or works at all</li>
    <li> Motor doesn&#x27;t sound as good as a Wahl; feels like these clippers will wear out quickly.</li>
    <li> like these clippers they work great, its just they keep popping the breaker in my bathroom when we use them.</li>
    <li> I really like these clippers they cut great and what  a deal for the price. I will be cutting my hair from now on .  I have own a pair Andis before and they lasted a long time. What a great buy and clipper.</li>
    <li> It broke after only having used it a half a dozen times or so!</li>
    <li> Just shuts off for no apparent reason. Really frustrating to use!!! Really sucks! Even for the price, it is crap!</li>
    <li> The packaging could be a little less &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; and brings with a plastic box to accommodate the pieces after openining the cardboard box. But for the price of this device I don&#x27;t think this should be a must.</li>
    <li> Very good, I can cut my child´s hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for trimmering hair and regular grooming tool for any man to save a little money on the side, beside spending money in barbara shop.</li>
    <li> just worked 1 day and didnt work at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very bad quality i don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone please take care it doesn&#x27;t work at all i can show you picture it&#x27;s still new and didnt work .</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price and does a great job on hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this trimmer and kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Context: I&#x27;ve never bought one before. Did some research, read reviews (beware some reviews!), then decided I&#x27;d try cheap and write it off as a learning experiment. For $12, I figured the worse that could happen is that it would flay me alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works great, providing precision trimming on face and body&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;comes with a very large assortment of blade heads and general grooming tools (very impressed), as well as tools for cleaning your trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Quiet (not silent, of course), and manageable vibration (not enough to throw off your control)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for over a month, and I haven&#x27;t found any cons yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summation: I&#x27;m terribly pleased&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped!</li>
    <li> As many have written, this does NOT include everything that is shown in the picture. It only actually includes 4 plastic guards, a comb, scissors and a lubricant. The 4 guards are 1-4, so don&#x27;t expect the ear guards. Now to the clipper itself, it&#x27;s very numbing in the hand because it vibrates so much. That combined with it overheating after 20 minutes of use equals a very uncomfortable experience. This is a fine clipper if its just a temporary fix if you&#x27;re saving up for one of the better clippers out there. In my opinion don&#x27;t even bother buying these, and just get something that&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do some in-between-haircuts-trimming but ended up just using it to cut my hair myself. It is light-weight and easy to use. The guides offer the same length control as the discount hair-cutting place I frequent.</li>
    <li> Was looking for the cheapest clippers I could find on Amazon and this is it.  Didn&#x27;t expect much since they were only $11.99 shipped, which is basically $6 for the clippers plus shipping. The magnetic motor is not very strong but it will get the job done for a quick trim. The guard attachments are somewhat sharp, not as comfortable to the touch as the ones that are included with the Wahl brand clippers. The blades do heat up after only 10 minutes of use but that is typical for magnetic motor clippers. The Andis 18485 does come with the standard blade oil, blade brush, comb and the normal attachments. This is a bargain none the less, but if it still works in a few years I&#x27;ll be even more happy.</li>
    <li> This clipper worked as expected for the price that i paid.  Im using it about once a week, and it hasnt given me any issues yet.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This clipper works great and never pulls my hair.  I also like the scissors it came with.  Great kit.</li>
    <li> really basic. if you are trying to cut your own hair, save money by not going to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works. takes little time to get going.</li>
    <li> I have used it 4 times and it keeps shutting off randomly, very poor quality. Not satisfied at all!</li>
    <li> A lot of people were saying that this cut perfect, but looks like the new batch don&#x27;t cut the hair properly and catches the hair causing a lot of pain... DON&#x27;T buy it!</li>
    <li> Good for home haircuts, nothing more than that. They work just fine and of course Andies is a great brand but they have higher lvl clippers for saloons.</li>
    <li> The blades were not in line, after some tweaking they work okay, not for salon use only at home use.</li>
    <li> Very useful. excellent quality</li>
    <li> use mostly to shave every 2 weeks or so and works great for that but not sure if i would want to cut my hair with it, maybe spend a little more money if thats what you need</li>
    <li> This is the first pair of clippers i have bought.  It was a bit complicated at first to get adjusted,  Just read the instructions and you will be ok.  I was afraid from some of the other reviews a read, but for a budget set of clippers, the are the best to buy.</li>
    <li> bought one in november 2014 used 3 times and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> it is good enough for what i brought it. i has a lot of pieces like any other haircut has</li>
    <li> Broke after two uses.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with clippers. The little battery powered ones I have owned to trim my mustache do not last long. I expect this one to last for years. My dad used one over fifty years ago to cut our hair. He broke his clippers shaving a patch off an injured cafe. We visited a barber after that. I use mine to trim my beard with the #2(?) attachment about once a week. It&#x27;s a little wide for close in trimming around my lips and in my ears, so I need to get a little battery powered one for that I guess.</li>
    <li> great product my dad really liked it alot would definately shop here again. thanks so much for good service. thanks</li>
    <li> Great quality clippers.</li>
    <li> Works great. Never cut my hair so quick before. Totally painless trim without extentions. Great price with free shipping available makes this a attractive item.</li>
    <li> For all barbers....they are good for cutting hair...lol</li>
    <li> Terrible design, I&#x27;m afraid ill get electrocuted if i don&#x27;t use the plastic on the tip of it. It shorted my outlet about 1/2 the time i used the button to turn it on. It makes a loud crackling sound when i first turn it on and then it works fine usually, BUT the button on the side is loose and if u tap it just lightly it makes the crackling sound again and may or may not short the outlet breaker. Very annoying. Poor design process. Would never buy again.</li>
    <li> They are made if metal and are heavy indicating very good quality they work great I actually bought them to shave my wife&#x27;s two Persian cats and even though there hair was very thick and there was a lot of hair they still cut it with ease all in all for the price you can&#x27;t beat the quality build of this product.</li>
    <li> product arrived in great condition and works just as expected!  Thanks :)</li>
    <li> It does its job. If you need it, get it. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I purchased these Andis hair clippers based upon the positive reviews at Amazon and the affordable price tag. I was let down big time after trying these out for the first time. My wife didn&#x27;t even get halfway done with my haircut, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. The clippers constantly tugged and pulled on my hair -- very annoying and painful at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried lubricating the blades but that didn&#x27;t help either. I ended up finishing that haircut with my trusty 5-year-old Wahl clippers that cut smooth as silk. Luckily, Amazon has an extremely easy return policy, so I was able to get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why other people haven&#x27;t had similar results?? Maybe my item was defective. Either way, I recommend spending a few more dollars to get some better quality clippers.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly weaker clipper. The blades are not powerful at all. If you try to cut your hair using the 0 length, you will have to go over the area of your beard or hair over and over and over again. It is a very weak hair cutter, I cannot stress that enough. I believed these reviews about how there is no difference between this and the other more expensive brands and I bought it thinking I had a gotten a great deal. But this is truly a cheap, cheap product in every sense of the word. You truly do get what you paid for and this hair cutting kit less than $15.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions on how to add more power and speed of the blades and I twisted it with the screwdriver ever so slightly trying to find the sweet spot until I was at the absolute maximum level and all it seemed to do was become even irritatingly loud and the out-of-control vibration from the ANDIS Clippers was absolutely ridiculous to the point where I actually stared at it for a moment or two laughing at just how sorry this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still all of the loud noise and terrible vibrating from this pathetic clipper, would have easily overlooked and dealt with if it actually made the blades do what they are suppose to do.....CUT WITH INCREDIBLE EASE AND SPEED! But it does not do that whatsoever. The blades were still running at the same slow speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly terrible product. My way overpriced $40 wireless WAHL clipper that is half the size of this ANDIS one is 10x better and is much more faster and easier on my skin and hair than this piece of junk ANDIS clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this cheaply made Toys &#x27;R Us clippers and plop down for a more expensive (but much much better quality) clipper from some other company. You will not regret it. Do not make the same mistake as me.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, but for the price it definitelygets the job done.  It is nice and heavy, and the blade cuts well.</li>
    <li> This kit had all the bells and whistles while still being quite reasonable in price. The trimmer itself looks sturdy and cuts well. All the trimmer attachments are as described, and help with cutting the proper length. For the price of one haircut you can cut hair for a long, long time. Very satisfied customers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but his hairclipper is loud.  It vibrates a lot and the noise was so loud that our kids were too scared to get their hair cut.  It seemed to cut okay, but due to the noise we are unable to use it on our kids and had to get another one.  Because I basically had to discard the product I&#x27;m giving it a 1.</li>
    <li> I bought a pair and they wouldn&#x27;t cut. I have a morkie and like to trim him up once and a while instead of going to the groomer in the winter.  I tried to send back to amazon and was too late.  I called the maker and they sent me a replacement.  They are the same. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> this is a regular machine work fine will buy again</li>
    <li> works as described.  Only a three star because it is huge and heavy.  pretty sure you could shave a horse with this thing.</li>
    <li> cuts guys hair girls hair and toddler hair perfectly</li>
    <li> i sent it to ny friend and it burnt out on the first go. i will not be buying any more electrics from you again</li>
    <li> I needed a paid flippers at a good price. This fit both bills. Shipping was timely. All in all a perfect sale. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> i love it, when i show it to others people they also love it and willing to get one also</li>
    <li> Good value for the dollar amount spend for the Andis easy cut 10pc. Andis defiantly best clipper &amp; Trimmer company.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price, make a little more noise but works good that is important. have it for more than an year and no complaints apart from the litter noise.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Easy to use and a proffesional product.Low cost for such a nice product.Would recommend purchase for use.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to cut my son&#x27;s hair, it really works great. It was very affordable and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This hair clippers not that bad but need more speed, it needs to show how many watts before you buy it, my older clippers was 15 watts and that one is 10 watts very slow.</li>
    <li> these are doing a great job! I cut my hair as short as I can every week and my hair is VERY thick. This was a great investment and its already earned more than what it cost!</li>
    <li> I live in a 70-year-old house. I have yet to find an outlet that this thing won&#x27;t trip the breaker on. It works great at other people&#x27;s houses though! Way high powered.</li>
    <li> Cook kit, but shaver got &#x27;stuck&#x27; 2/3 of the way through me using it, the motor didn&#x27;t seem strong enough to keep moving the blade after the shaver has been on for about 10 minutes or so.  Jiggling it free&#x27;d it up.  I&#x27;m considering this purchase a loss, going to spend a few more dollars on a better one.</li>
    <li> I used this trimmer exactly 2 times and its starting to cut off and on now. I think the on/off switch is going. Save your money and buy something better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this only once in my time of possession. Hadn&#x27;t used it in a month since that time, but when I tried cutting for a second time; the clippers wouldn&#x27;t cut hair at all. They would come on, but not cut.. I tried oiling the blades and messing with the power setting. Nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 5-year warrenty through the company to replace this POS, but you&#x27;ll be the one paying return shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Futhermore, everything shown in the image isn&#x27;t even included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Sad to say that 1  month after I order these clippers ;they stop working.... I really can&#x27;t complain because they were only $11.00.. think I used them 4 times....</li>
    <li> Great tool. I really like. It works just like i was told it would. I highly recommend it as a must have</li>
    <li> I have not had any problems with these trimmers. This one worked fine for me. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My son uses this hair kit to maintain his hair for his ROTC military class. We found it to be a very good quailty razor.</li>
    <li> Item became self defected after the first soft hair cut !!!</li>
    <li> Close shave even with biggest attachment.  Ordered larger attachments.  I don&#x27;t feel that the motor too noisy but it is the first I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> to all potential buyers of this product performance is electric power based meaning that the label on this product says 120 volts ac 60 hertz this means that it will work at a minimum 10% of the rated voltage and a maximum 5% of the rated voltage the values are (108vac to 126 vac )at a stable 60hz not below 60hz or above 61hz the motor of this machine is direct drive hence the need for stable power and frequency it is also important to oil blades before each use to reduce metal on metal friction and keep the blade temperature under control over all great product i am an electronics specialist with years of experience would recommend</li>
    <li> heavy and don&#x27;t cut sharp edges. need to be lighter, and not so bucky. also have cape an better cord</li>
    <li> Not for a professional. Bought it as a gift. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> The worst pair of clippers I have ever purchased. DO NOT BUY. I just tried to cut my hair and they would barely cut.</li>
    <li> It will shave your head, back, no no zone or your dogs head, back, and ...... No don&#x27;t try that.  Great clipper for the price. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> The cutting is good but not too happy with the motor noise !!</li>
    <li> It was fair for the price called for it, although the case, and the CD was missing from it. Where I&#x27;m from that is known as false advertising. I have yet to properly use this product. depending on my experience I would know if it was a good buy or not.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GOOD SO FAR, I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR TWO MONTHS NOW. BUT I ORDER 3 OF THEM AND ONE WAS MISSING THE  4 attachment combs. I TRIED TO CONTACT THE SELLER BUT I COULDN&#x27;T. THEN NOW I GOT ONE KIT I CAN&#x27;T GIVE IT AWAY AS I THOGHT I WOULD DO.THEN NOW I NEED THE COMB ANS UNFORTUNATELY I CAN´T BUY THEM SEPARATELY,</li>
    <li> Great clippers really good deal I would definitely buy them again if needed.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the clipper honesty is the key.</li>
    <li> One use.  One.  Clippers stopped dead on the 2nd use.  I would never ever buy these again or send them to anyone</li>
    <li> I have a pair of Oster clippers that I bought when I finished beauty school. I would compare these cheaper ones to my expensive ones! They are a great purchase. The clippers work like a charm, and I have yet to have someone complain of them &amp;#34;biting&amp;#34; them. I am very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price. It looks like they cost alot more.</li>
    <li> just like we use to buy out the store cheap and reliable !</li>
    <li> Andis 18485 Home Haircut 10 Piece Haircutting Kit: This haircut kit arrived in 5 days in stellar condition, and works exactly as described. I give it 5*****s! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. I used it the first time. It didn&#x27;t cut my hair properly. I thought that it would be OK the second time around. But the second time around, it&#x27;s not even working properly. When the device/machine is on, it produces some sound but hardly cuts any hair. Don&#x27;t go for this cheap product. I bought it June 27th and I can&#x27;t return it now (Aug, 25th). What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Item received  on time and as expected</li>
    <li> My husband really loves these</li>
    <li> Simply terrible--it exists to do one thing: cut hair. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with mine, but brand-new out of the box, it yanks hair out very painfully. You have to do multiple passes, and it still doesn&#x27;t cleanly cut. It&#x27;s just as likely to painfully pull the hair out or nick you as it is to cleanly cut it. I&#x27;d NEVER buy this again.</li>
    <li> excellent product, at a very good price. they cut very well</li>
    <li> I bought it on Dec, 2014. Now, it&#x27;s broken at March, 2015.Normally used it for only three or four times. I have sent e-mails requesting repair service. Amazon didn&#x27;t give me any reply until now. Maybe they just don&#x27;t want to bother me for a few bucks things. I am now contacting the Andis service station, hope it won&#x27;t be too difficulty and troublesome.</li>
    <li> but only because i want these all to myself.. forget you guys... i bought my first pair of these years ago and the cord shorted out on me.. i attempted to fix them but after seeing this price... why waste the time.. love love love these.. probably saved myself thousands over the years in haircuts and i dont have to tip myself  ;)</li>
    <li> i cut my own hair (very short). this works wonderfully, including a VERY carefully neck trim.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this you will be sorry !!!!! It hurts , it does not cut , its a pice of crap , dont waste your money !!!!</li>
    <li> Work great and still work..</li>
    <li> I would not recommend very noisy and no control for the level</li>
    <li> The first time I used these clippers they shorted out my outlet so bad that I had to call an electrician. They also electrocuted me as well. I was literally so ticked off that I wrote this review one-handed because feeling had not completely returned to my left hand. I can now recommend with the caveat that you be make sure to calibrate that power screw. This item is potentially dangerous though so be careful and make sure you know about that little power screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Update: 10 June 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a power screw on the side of the clippers and toned down the power a little bit. That seemed to have fixed the outlet blowing, excessive shakiness and electrocution possibilities. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I spent more money fixing the outlet than the clippers are worth and the effing thing shocked me. But now that I fixed it, I am satisfied with its clipping ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Update 20 July 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong after two months. I have yet to oil. As long as you give the product a sound brushing afterwards the blades stay very sharp which is a contrast to most cheap clippers I have had over the years. +1 star (last update)</li>
    <li> its okay but is not that reliable every time i use it..sound different cuts different its not that consistent...........</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product it would start and then stop suddenly but it seems to be ok now. Also it did not come with the case that is shown in the advertizement. I was disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> Decent kit for a Great price. Andis Clippers are the best.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> On 2nd use, pulls hair instead of cuts hair.  Cheap, poor quality.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I got my $ back on this product. I used it and it was trash! it cuts like s***. I tryed cutting my nefuews hair. And poor kid got a messed up hair cut. I dont recomend it. your better off spending alittle more $ for a one thats worth it. And it didnt come with everything in the picture. It didnt come with the box that is shown on the pic.</li>
    <li> Cheaper is not always the best route, especially with these clippers. Only got a couple decent cuts out of it before it started pulling hair more than cutting it. And I&#x27;ve tried every adjustment under the sun with barely any improvement at all.  Save your money on this one and invest a little more unless you enjoy hair pulls over hair cuts.</li>
    <li> IT is still working after two years.</li>
    <li> you really cant beat the price u get a bad one send it back and get a new one u will eventually get a good one if u end up having problems but mine was fine works great</li>
    <li> Was good for the first few times I used it, but the build quality has left it almost unusable.</li>
