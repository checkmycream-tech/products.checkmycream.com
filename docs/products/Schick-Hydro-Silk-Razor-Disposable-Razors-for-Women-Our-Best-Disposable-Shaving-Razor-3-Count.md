<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love how silky smooth these razors leave my legs. I also like that i dont get the red bumps from using this razor. I think it works especially great with the shaving cream that I got thanks to schick! This product is espcially great if you exfoliate before shaving. The design and handle are especially designed to help with the grip and make it more gripable in the shower. The special design of the actual razor also helps to avoid missing any spots on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I tried this product for free**</li>
    <li> I got to try these razors for free and I absolutely love them! The razor made my legs super smooth and didn&#x27;t cut my leg up at all. They also provided a close shave so I didn&#x27;t have to shave as often! I definitely recommend trying them out!</li>
    <li> I tested this out and it&#x27;s a really close shave, and great moisture! I usually get dry patches on my legs after shaving but I didn&#x27;t experience that with these. they&#x27;re everything you want a razor to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Tested product free thanks to Schick)</li>
    <li> i have been given the opportunity to try the Schick hydro silk razors out and i got to say i love it! these razors have 5 blades and have given me the closet and smoothest shave i have had! whats more is my legs don&#x27;t feel dry and itchy after i have because of the hydration strips! i have been using the same razor for about a week now and it has yet to dull which the store brand ones i used before would be useless after 2 shaves. these razors are worth it they last long and leave your legs feeling smooth with out the worry of a cut since the head moves with the curve of your legs!</li>
    <li> These are amazing quality for being a disposable and are easily comparable to a high quality every day use razor. They provide a smooth shave and glide with ease around hard to reach places. They are lightweight and are a great deal for the quality and how many you get per pack. I would highly recommend giving these a try! I am trying the product for free thanks to Schick!</li>
    <li> This razor is EXCELLENT!  The moisturizing part is wonderful!  The way it contours to curves is excellent!  The close shave is superb!  I highly recommend this razor!  Thanks Shick and BzzAgent for letting me try this out for free!</li>
    <li> I was sent these for review by BzzAgent along with a shave gel, which also promised moisture. If anything, using the two together dried my legs out more than they usually are when I shave. I also couldn&#x27;t get a close shave and kept having to go over the same areas repeatedly, which was extremely annoying. My legs stung a bit while I was shaving, but I didn&#x27;t see any cuts. There was just a mild burning that let up pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve used worse, but these aren&#x27;t worth the money. I&#x27;m glad they were free!</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this razor. I never thought I would get hooked on a razor but this razor shaves so unbelievably smooth. It has always been a challenge shaving over my knees but this razor made it feel so effortless! I am very impressed I am so glad I was able to try it for free thanks to Schick! Now I will be buying these razors!</li>
    <li> This product achieves the perfect clean shave. I doubted this disposable razor at first but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it! The serum on the razor is very moisturizing to the skin. This product is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was recently sent Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables to try, and loved the results they gave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical about disposable razors, but was pleasantly surpassed buy the beautiful results I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables hydrate like no other razor on the market! They have a water activated serum that is made from marine extracts and shea butter to leave your skin silky smooth for up to 2 hours after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curve Sensing® blades, are designed to glide over woman&#x27;s curves to give a close shave with out irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft-touch, ergonomic handle is designed to fit your hand perfectly for the perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables  are made for on the go. I love them for travel, and gym trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part; they are AFFORDABLE! At only $11.99 you can grab yours at grocery stores, drug stores and mass retailers.</li>
    <li> I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for the first time courtesy of BzzAgent, and there are some pros and cons to this type of razor. Pros: I got a very close shave, and the grip and feel of the razor was comfortable. I liked the size of the razor blade head - not too big, and not too small. Now the cons: My legs did not feel moisturized afterwards, and actually felt like the razor had scraped them (hence the close shave I guess!). In the past I have used Schick Hydro Silk Razors (not disposable) and I did not have this problem with them (although the razor head is bigger and I didn&#x27;t get as close of a shave). So it&#x27;s a tradeoff. I may purchase them in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using the replaceable version of these razors for about a year now. So when I was given a pack from Schick to try and see how it stands up to the replaceable heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few difference that I could tell about the disposables. One was the overall quality. The handles were lighter and didn&#x27;t have a great grip on them but they were good and does the job. The second difdifference was the longevity of the razor head. I can usually get 3 complete shaves from head to toe out of the replaceable heads. However I am getting about half that with the disposables which is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the 5 blades make a great difference in the way the razors shave and I could take or leave the &amp;#34;moisturizing strip&amp;#34;. It was less mosturizing and more extra gliding power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed in these razors as they are excellent for the money ( I have since purchased 2 more packs since receiving the first pack free). And work well when spending the extra money on replacement blades just aren&#x27;t an option.</li>
    <li> I got a free package of these from bzzagent.  I used a non disposable version of this razor back in 2012 and liked it but...I think it&#x27;s gotteb better.  So when I got this I was really excited until I went to pull the plastic cover thingy off and cut my thumb....I knew that it was not your average disposable razor at that moment and that more likely than not I was gonna end up butchering my legs.  Guess what, I didn&#x27;t.  In fact I didn&#x27;t end up with a single knick or cut at all, anywhere and let me say I used it everywhere.  Most disposables can&#x27;t do that and if they can, just once so...anyway I forgot about the goo to begin with but once I remembered what it is and does I was fine with it.  I have sensitive skin and usually my skin feels like it&#x27;s on fire after shaving, but I have not had that issue at all which is a big deal for me since its one of the reasons I hate shaving so much.  The handle was easy to hold and didn&#x27;t jump or slip once for me.  Overall I have a new favorite razor and don&#x27;t hate shaving so much.</li>
    <li> This razor works wonders! It is especially perfect for sensitive skin, leaving no razor bumps and minimal irritation. The 5 blades gives a close clean cut and with the added moisturizer it leaves the skin feeling silky smooth. Shaving cream is not needed! This razor blew me away because I could get a clean close shave without feeling the blades cutting away my skin. The flexibility of this razor allows me to get into discreet areas easily without having any accidents. This by far is one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used. The best part is I got this for free from Schick!</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor! I have very dry skin on my legs and I have to be careful about what razors. This gave an amazing close shave and really slid over my knees and ankles without me inadvertently slicing myself to pieces! I like the handles easy grip (didn&#x27;t drop it once, go me!) and the five blades pretty much catch any spot you miss. I always have to put lotion or baby oil gel on my legs after I shave so they don&#x27;t dry out so I&#x27;m not sure about the hydrating effect of the razor if you used it alone. I can say that it didn&#x27;t leave my legs feeling itchy and dry. I got this free to try in a BzzAgent kit, but I am going to buy these when I use my three up.</li>
    <li> I tested these over the weekend. My legs still feel silky smooth! I highly recommend them. Perfect for a busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to shave everyday!</li>
    <li> I am someone that cuts their legs at least twice each time when I shave. Disposable razors are often too rough for my skin. I received these razors to try out and review, and after using them, I am glad to do so! These are the first and only razors I&#x27;ve ever used where I don&#x27;t have lots of nicks and cuts afterwards. The lubrication makes it SO EASY to shave! I have hair that grows back quickly, but these razors leave my legs smoother than any other razor and for longer. They&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> I received a 3 pack of Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables for free thanks to Schick and BzzAgent.  It does the job but not what I was expecting.  its a good razor for a disposable.  I usually use Venus.  To me it did not shave close enough, I felt like I had stubble still on my legs. It pulls the hair under the arms and the bikini area. As far as moisturizing, I really could tell if it was the razor moisture strip or the shave cream but my legs felt kind of sticky the day after I used them together. I am going to try the razor again by itself and see if I can feel a difference.  It does have a great handle and head.  I may try this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> ready to rock your legs with the first and only disposable razor that hydrates your skin like no other disposable razor can! Here’s what you’ll want to mention when Bzzing about Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables:&lt;br /&gt;They hydrate like woah. The razor’s water-activated moisturizing serum helps give back moisture for up to 2 hours after shaving. Hypoallergenic and dermatologist-tested, it’s made with marine extracts and shea butter to leave your skin silky smooth&lt;br /&gt;They’re designed for the curves of a woman’s body. Each Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razor has contoured oval cartridges, 5 independent, Curve Sensing® blades and skin guards to help you achieve an efficient shave and prevent skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;They’re easy to handle. The soft-touch, ergonomic handle features multiple rubber grips in a ripple pattern for ultimate control while shaving&lt;br /&gt;They’re made for on-the-go use. You can bring this razor with you while traveling or for a quick touch-up at the gym&lt;br /&gt;They’re affordable. Look for 3-packs of these disposables razors at grocery stores, drug stores and mass retailers for an average price of $11.99&lt;br /&gt;Plus, if you’re tired of unsticking your razor from random surfaces every time you shave, you’ll love this disposable razor’s unique, raised handle rest! It’ll keep your razor cartridges out of water and intact for a premium shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had doubts on the quality of disposable razors. After receiving Schick Hydro Silk disposables from BzzAgent, I will never go back to using expensive razors again! My skin was so smooth and silky. I loved how it seemed to glide over my legs especially over my knees and ankles. It was a wonderful product. There were three in a pack and I am guessing that each one will last at least a week.</li>
    <li> I received this free from bzz agent. I thought that it worked really well. Cut through winter legs that hadn&#x27;t seen daylight (or a razor) in way longer then I care to admit. No cuts and my legs were not dry after the fact. 5 blades sees excessive (I&#x27;ve always heard the extra blades don&#x27;t actually make a difference) but I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to go over the same spot repeatedly, despite what a hairy monster my legs resembled, so maybe those extra blades did help. For daily use it&#x27;s probably overkill and I doubt I&#x27;d pay the price tag, but I was pleased with the result. It handled well for a disposable razor and was easy to grip.</li>
    <li> The moisturizing serum around the blades make the shaving so smooth that it almost feels as though you are shaving with a razor that has its cap on (no blades).  Yet when I checked to see if it even shaved anything, my armpit was smoother than it had been in a long time.  I was super impressed.  I don&#x27;t go near my shaving gel when using these disposables, I just don&#x27;t need it.  I was very surprised and very happy.  The serum contains shea butter and my armpits actually look better and less irritated since I&#x27;ve used these.  I&#x27;ve only been using them for about a week and a half.  I was sent them for free by Schick via Bzz Agent but plan on buying more after using these testers.  Super impressed.</li>
    <li> Received this product for free from BzzAgent and was really impressed with it. My legs were so smooth after using these razors and it lasted so long! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love these razors! They give a nice close shave and are easy to hold!</li>
    <li> This is a amazing product left my legs feeling smooth with no cuts it&#x27;s worth buying it got it for free from bzzAgent.com to try out</li>
    <li> I received these razors to test for free via Schick and Bzz Agent. I was so amazed with these razors. They were very easy to handle and gave me an amazingly smooth shave. I love that they have so many blades which ensures a smooth shave even without shaving cream ( trust me I tried) I would most definitely recommend these razors and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> The schick hydrosilk disposables are some of the best disposable razors i&#x27;ve ever used, th moisturizing strip was really nice on my preexisting dryskin and even helped it. I was left with a close shave and the razor really glides across the skin like butter.If you havent tried these, id give them a shot. The moisturizing strip is a little different than on other razors so the different texture might take some getting used to but its a really solid disposable. Thanks to schick i was able to try this product free through bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to get to try Hydro silk Schick disposable razors for free thanks to Schick! Let me just say, these razors are fantastic! I loved how smooth of a shave I got from the razors! Best part? No nicks or cuts! I love how smoothly the razor glided across my legs! Plus, the grip on the razor handle was fantastic! Unfortunately, usually with cheap or inexpensive razors, the handle grips aren&#x27;t very strong and you lose grip causing you to accidently cut yourself. Not with these bad boys! The hydro silk razors are inexpensive, yet act as a very expense razor. The name &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; says it all. You will get a silky smooth shave with these razors! I highly recommend them! The moisture these razors provide for your body is unbelievably great! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love this product so much!!  I love how smooth this product makes my legs feel!! Also, Loved htat I got this product free from bzzagent.com</li>
    <li> My search for the perfect razor ended with the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable razors which was kindly sent to me by BzzAgent. These are hands down the best razors i have ever used. The design is so comfortable with rubber handle grip which makes it easy to maneuver while in shower and prevents it from slipping. It has contoured oval cartridges, 5 independent, Curve Sensing blades which guards the skin to help achieve an efficient shave and prevent skin irritation.The razor’s water-activated moisturizing serum helps retain moisture and is hypoallergenic and dermatologist-tested. These razors are travel friendly and very affordable. I used it with the Skintimate Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel and achieved the smoothest shave without any cuts. To prevent Razor bumps i like to exfoliate my skin prior to shaving.</li>
    <li> Ok so I just tried the Schick Hydro Silk razor thanks to Schick I recieved this product for free through Bzzagent, and let me tell you this honestly make a great difference on the way I see razors. Specially with the 5 curved blades it has. It makes the shave feel fast, easy, and just smooth. The handle grip is amazing. I love this razor.</li>
    <li> I recieved these razors to try for free from Bzzagent they are excellent razors definitely makes your skin silky smooth 😊</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Razor is fantastic; my legs have not felt this soft before. I got to try this product for FREE thanks to Schick and BzzAgent.  It has 5 blades that leave you hair-less and there is no need to repeat the shave in the same area. The serum around the blades become activated with water and makes the skin get super silky which make shaving creams to be optional. The soft and comfortable handle makes it easy to reach in hard places and will not cut the skin like other razors</li>
    <li> I received this as a promotion for testing purposes. These are amazing! I got such a close shave and my legs were super smooth and hydrated after using.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know 5 blades would make such a difference as I had never tried a 5-bladed razor until Schick offered me the opportunity to try them for free. I am used to 3 and 4 blades and 5 really does the trick and 5 blades are the best in the market. I&#x27;m not one for hype, but this has been the softest and closest shave I have ever had at home; Plus it&#x27;s disposable so I don&#x27;t need to worry about refills. I&#x27;d compare it to waxing just by how soft my legs felt afterwards; minus the pain! It goes over knees easily and thoroughly and I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet. Plus, I cannot help repeatedly touching my skin just to feel how SOFT my legs are even after I&#x27;m out of the shower! This goes into my list of products that I MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> best disposable razor out there.  I seriously love how close a shave i get! I&#x27;m trying this product free from schick and it&#x27;s the best! Definitely will purchase in the future</li>
    <li> Yesterday I received these for free and I feel in love with these razors no cuts or burns they left my legs feeling soft and smooth I would definitely recommend these shavers</li>
    <li> Schick was super awesome and sent me a package of these as a freebie in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT razors!&lt;br /&gt;They give you a clean, close, easy shave. They maneuver easily around knees and ankles. And they leave your skin feeling super silky soft! I didn&#x27;t even have to use lotion after shaving because it left my skin so soft!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely use again!&lt;br /&gt;OH, and they last WAY longer than other disposables... not your typical one and done disposable! So you definitely get your money worth!!!</li>
    <li> These razors are really affordable for the quality and quantity you get. They have 5 blades unlike most brands that have three and I thought this made for a smoother shaving experience. They have little pores that are supposed to hydrate your skin as you shave and they really did hydrate!They were really moisturizing and that&#x27;s literally the best thing a razor can do because we all know how horrible and painful it is shaving with dry razors. Also a side note: Since they have the water activated moisturizing serum they are perfect for emergency on the go shaving so I always keep one into my gym bag now. But moving along, I think what I appreciate the most about these razors is the handle on them. They have a ribbed soft silicone grip and it actually made shaving easier. You wouldn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference a good razor handle makes until you try a GOOD razor handle!! I didn&#x27;t even come close to cutting myself either because of how good the handle maneuvers around the skin. Overall I think I&#x27;d probably buy these in the future since they&#x27;re super affordable and just all in all really good quality! I&#x27;m really happy I discovered these free through BzzAgent because I probably would have walked past them at the drugstore without noticing.</li>
    <li> I used a Gillette Venus for YEARS, but finally decided to try the Hydro Silk . I can confidently say that I do not miss my Venus one bit! I&#x27;ve never used a razor that plays well with my eczema, but this one absolutely does. It hydrates surprisingly well and holds true to its name!&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair easily- I.e. One pass and it&#x27;s gone. No shaving the same area two or three times.&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating- I.e. Doesn&#x27;t cause bumps or other skin irritation. A moisture additive that works would be a plus. Mobility- I.e. Flexibility of the razor head to move around curves. Totally loved it! Received it as a part of buzz agent promotion.</li>
    <li> These  Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables are fabulous!! They have 5 blades so it doesn&#x27;t miss a hair. They glide smoothly over your skin and do not catch. Your skin will feel nice and smooth for hours because of the hydrating serum. This is the best disposable razor I have used. I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Love love love this razor wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world! Check out bzzagent.com they allowed me to try it free!!!</li>
    <li> I got these for free through a Bzz Campaign and I absolutely love them. I knew I&#x27;d like these disposable razors since I loved the Schick Hydro Silk razor from my last Bzz Campaign. They made my legs feel really smooth and for once I don&#x27;t think I missed a spot! The curve sensing blades helped shave under my calf, which has always been difficult for me. However, I don&#x27;t think it made a difference with trying to get around the ankle. My other criticism is that I am not a big fan of gel strips on razors, because they often get gross and gooey after a while. Other than that, I really like this razor!</li>
    <li> I got a pack of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors free from Schick for testing purposes. I&#x27;m really happy with them! I&#x27;m way too low maintenance of a person to use a non-disposable razor that I have to bring with me when I travel and keep buying replacement parts for, yadda yadda yadda. Because of that, I frequently end up with pretty cheap plastic little disposable razors that barely get me through one time shaving without having to be tossed. The Schick Hydros are a disposable razor I can seriously get behind. I think they&#x27;re about $12 for a three pack, but each razor lasts me significantly longer than other disposables, so I don&#x27;t think the price is horrific. The quality is a million times better than the other disposables out there, the handle is really comfortable, the shave is close. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will actually become a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  Although the shaving cream wasnt needed, I used it anyway.  The shave lasted a while and i also like the scent of the shaving cream.  I wouldnt mind replacing my normal shaving products with this one.</li>
    <li> I received one of these razors in the mail as a freebie with coupons for the blades and the disposable razors. I figured it would be like all the rest of the razors that promise you something and maybe deliver for a couple of uses, then ends up being junk. I was completely incorrect. This is the best razor I have ever used. You can use it with or without shaving cream/gel. It works with just water too. It provides a close, clean shave with little to no accidental cuts. I forgot my coupon for the blades at home so I ended up buying the disposable razors. They are just as great as the ones that uses replacement blades. They last longer than just a few uses. You know when it is time to change blades or razors because the strip goes away. I am usually able to use one blade/disposable razor anywhere from 12-24 uses. They really do leave your skin silky and smooth. I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to just about everything. I have no issues using this razor as I have with many others. I do not break out, turn red, or end up itching as I do with other brands. I was able to secure a mail freebie for my mom as well and she completely agrees that this has to be the best razor ever made. In fact, I&#x27;m on here finding her replacement blades right now because she said that she would like some for Christmas. I find that the razors and replacement blades are a great price. Sometimes I buy the disposable razors of this brand because you get 3 disposable razors for the same price as the original razor that needs replacement blades. The disposable razors last just as long as the replacement blades so you may get a better value by purchasing these disposable razors. 4 blade refills for about $15 vs 3 disposable razors for about $8-both last equally as long, it&#x27;s all about preference but you do the math.</li>
    <li> I just love the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor they feel like they hug the skin, they feel almost flexible when you shave. The design is very ergonomic with excellent grip. There is this little hole at the top where you can press your index finger as you shave which really feels like you have control. After shaving I had the smoothest skin I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. Excellent product. Thank you for an outstanding product! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this item free thanks to Schick, and all I can say is amazing! For a girl with sensitive skin and very thick hair, it has always been a struggle to find a razor that works well without irritating my skin. I have tried all the different Venus razors and while some worked well, they never really convinced me. Now that I&#x27;ve tried Schick Hydro Silk, I am convinced! I get a close shave with zero irritation and zero nicks since the five blades and comfortable handle allow me to shave tricky spots with ease. I recommend these to anyone looking for a razor that leaves you smooth and happy!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my buzzkit. I opened the box right away. Poured my self a warm bubble bath and grabbed a glass of wine. I decided to exfoliate my legs first the puff and, it did and awesome job. Then I used the skintiment shaving gel all over my leg. The smell was delicious I wish they made a body spray. Then I used the razor. I have sensitive skin and tend to get razor burn bad. Not only did this combination make my skin silky smooth but, I HAVE NO RAZOR BURN!!! Never ever have I been able to safely shave my legs without one flaw but, I&#x27;ve found my God send ... I will not move on to another. From now onSchick Hydro Silk® Disposables Will be my number one and only razors. Thank you so so so much. Sasha</li>
    <li> Omg I am so excited to have gotten this trial! I got 3 Schick Hydro Silk razors, a loofah, and shaving cream! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The loofah is a pretty purple magenta color and looks so pretty and works great. It really helps create a thick lather.&lt;br /&gt; The shaving cream is for sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or dry me out, and it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt; And the razors oh wow. I haven&#x27;t got this close of a shave in a long time. It has a wide head with 5 blades and it curves and moves over your legs so easy. No cuts, no missed spots. It&#x27;s so easy to use and comfy to hold and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I love it all!&lt;br /&gt;I got these free as part of a product trial but my opinion is unbiased and based 100% off my own experience.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors. I was able to try it for free and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find very much to say about these since they were so awful. The razor was sticky hard to maneuver. I am not sure what is supposed to be appealing about making the razor gooey but it is nowhere near \\&quot;silky\\&quot;. I had to go over my legs twice  but when I rinsed I still had hairy legs. I can barely muster enough interest to shave my legs once. Shaving twice and still having hair legs is right out of the question. I also had nicks where there had been bumps on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, my legs were as dry and irritated as if I had dry shaved. So I had hairy, bloody, red itchy legs. This is a look I cannot rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass.</li>
    <li> No more dropping the razor or losing control. The handle stays in your hand when you&#x27;re trying to multi task while washing your hair and shaving in the shower at the same time. The blades leave a clean shave -- unlike many other competitors. It is a disposable razor which shaves like a regular use.&lt;br /&gt;-As received this item as part of a promotion by the brand-</li>
    <li> My package from BzzAgent, which included a 3-pack of Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors, a can of Skintimate Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel, an exfoliating bath sponge, and coupons, got here right before I was about to shower. I tried the items out immediately. The disposable razors are quite possibly the best I have ever used! I just love the easy to grip handle and how it bends so it&#x27;s easier to reach all places. I also used the shaving gel which left my skin smooth. The smell was a plus! The sponge was also an awesome bonus. Thank you, BzzAgent and Schick! #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposables</li>
    <li> I received these razors free from Bzz Agent to try out, i loved them. For a disposable razor the go above and beyond! When i was shaving I really liked the moisture strips around the razor, i felt like they kept my leg nice and silky as i was shaving to prevent cuts. The head pivots very nicely to help avoid cuts. overall i really like these razors and will be buying them in the future!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free through BzzAgent. This has to be one of my favorite campaigns through them. I tried the razor and it feels so smooth against my skin. The handle is curved nicely to allow a nice grip in the shower. The cartridge is flexible enough to go along with the curves of my legs. The five blades give my legs the closest shave they have had in years. I love this razor and am thinking of switching from my electric razor to this one from now on.</li>
    <li> Schick hydro silk disposable razors are great! They leave your legs silky smooth for hours after shaving. They give you a close shave unlike other razors. If your looking for a great razor to keep you silky smooth go with Schick hydro silk disposable razors! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I am usually pretty stingy when it comes to buying razors. When the opportunity arose for me to try these razors for free from Schick I decided to try them. The difference is noticeable compared to the razors I had used previously with only 2-3 blades. I feel like the number of blades makes for covering much more surface area which is something that&#x27;s very nice. I also feel like these razors are able to do well around my kneecaps and ankles where I usually nick myself. I did not have any trouble with these. The difference in price point is definitely noticeable and I will most likely see myself purchasing these in the future.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free from bzzzagent and I absolutely loved this razor. It came with a pink lufa and shaving creme. They were all great products but this razor definatly gives you a smooth clean shave. I&#x27;d buy more of these razors.</li>
    <li> Work really good leave u legs smooth and last long ..</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive a 3 pack of Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables for free thanks to Schick and BzzAgent.  I am always a little cynical when it comes to razors.  I mean, come on, how many blades do you need?!?!  Apparently the answer is 5.  This razor is amazing!  I have never had a smoother shave.  I didn&#x27;t even need shave gel to shave my legs.  With the &#x27;water activated moisturizing serum&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t even feel the razor.  The design is great as well.  I have a shelf in my shower where I keep my razor.  Usually the head of the razor dries out fast because it gets wet being on the shelf &amp; my razors just don&#x27;t last long.  Schick took it to another level with this razor, I can put it on the shelf &amp; not worry about it because the design of the handle keeps the head raised.  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this razor.</li>
    <li> I love love love this razor. It left my legs feeling silky smooth! It was great for those hard to reach areas which with a normal razor I would cut myself. I would totally recommend this. I got to try them free thanks to bzzagent &amp; schick!</li>
    <li> I received this razors from BzzAgent to try out for free. The razor was great. It gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had from any disposable razor. The grip was amazing the razor did not slip at all during my shave. The only reason I did not give the 5 stars was because the hydration it claims to give was not noticeable to me. After my shower my legs felt normal. Other than that this is a great razor. My favorite!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about super hydrating razors. I am already naturally a dry skin person and shaving can get a little scary sometimes. I usually end up cutting up my legs. I was able to get a closer cut with Schicks Hydro Silk razors. My legs felt really smooth and silky after I shaved. The design of the handle was extremely effective for me. I also love the appealing color choices on the razor.</li>
    <li> I recently received this in a Bzz Agent campaign and I have to say it is one of if not the best razor I have ever used! A lot of razors give me razor burn so it is hard to find one that works. This worked wonders. I had no issues with razor burn at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in shaving heaven with the new Gillette Hydro Silk Razor and Shaving Cream! The moisturizing serum in the razor is incredible! I have never such soft, silky legs after a shave in my life! The scent is clean but not over bearing and the handle is so comfortable for my grip. There is a rounded end on the razor that your thumb fits into to keep the razor at just the right angle for a perfect shave every time! I have never been able to shave and not go back for missed areas but with Schick Hydro Silk one pass of the razor is all I need every time. I received a sample razor and shaving gel to try out and I have already purchased an extra package of razors to make sure I don&#x27;t run out with summer just around the corner-I don&#x27;t thin I could switch back to my old razor after using the Hydro Silk!</li>
    <li> I have never been crazy about a razor but thanks to Schick and BzzAgent, I received a 3 pack of Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables to try for free and I was impressed! My legs felt moisturized and so silky smooth. The water activated moisturizing serum makes the shave feel more comfortable, and with the five blades you only need to go over an area once to have it perfect even on difficult areas like ankles, knees and underarms. It´s easy to control the razor because of it&#x60;s ergonomic handle features, and because the handle rest is raised it stays out of the water, all of this in a disposable razor! Really impressive Schick, Good work!</li>
    <li> I received these to test out and I must say out of all the razors I have tried these are pretty good. When the water hits them it activates a gel and it helps moisturize your legs. No shaving cream needed for me. I enjoyed them and plan on purchasing more if they weren&#x27;t so expensive for disposables.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! It has given me the smoothest shave of my life. It hydrates instead of leaving my body dry and itchy. I&#x27;ve never felt like my underarms quite get cleanly cut enough, and this is the best they have ever been.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to admit that I did get this product for free from Schick to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations for a disposable razor that has 5 blades. I have used schick brand razors before and they were very high quality. This razor has what seems to be the standard schick brand handle. I personally like the handle as it has a good grip and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my wet fingers easily. I don&#x27;t like small slick plastic handles for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor expecting a clean, close shave due to it having 5 blades. It didn&#x27;t pick up the hair as good as I thought it would have. Some areas I had to go over two to three times. In the end, my skin was red and irritated which is not normal for me and it felt somewhat uncomforable. I will keep in mind that this is a disposable razor and therefore not as high quality as a normal heavy duty $12 razor. With that being said, I would only use this razor for travel purposes where it would be an occasional need for a disposable razor and not one that I would use frequently at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it&#x27;s purpose and with the fact that it does it&#x27;s job as a disposable razor, I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I got my Schick Silk free in combination with Skintimate Silky Lotionized gel and they were amazing together. I found my new staple razor! The price is a little more than I would usually be willing to pay for disposable razors but thanks to the coupons I received with them I won&#x27;t have to worry for a while. #KeepCalmAndBzzOn!</li>
    <li> have been using the same brand razor since I was a teen. I had received a free sample in high school and never strayed from the brand. Why would I risk cutting up my legs when I had something that worked?? Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables are like heaven for your legs. They are easy to grip and maneuver and leave your legs feeling silky smooth. There is no need to lotion immediately after in order to prevent the dry skin that always seems to come after shaving for me. There was no extra work required and was super easy to maneuver. I was hesitant to try but it was definitely a happy and helpful surprise!!</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample of these from Schick to review. For as long as I&#x27;ve shaved, I&#x27;ve used Gillette Venus which has three blades. You don&#x27;t really give much thought to a razor, or at least I didn&#x27;t. The first use of these was a bit ...Saw-esque. Five blades is a lot of blades, okay? After that initial experience, I realized that these don&#x27;t need to be pressed down that hard to give you an extremely close shave. Like, smoother than I&#x27;ve felt for years! I never really give much thought to shaving and treat it like a chore - these however help me realize that with a little effort, I can have nice and silky smooth legs that stay that way for a few days! I&#x27;ve already tossed my prior razor and picked up a handle and blades from Schick. If you&#x27;re looking for a super close shave that leaves your legs feeling smoother than some other razors I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying these guys out. Just remember ...don&#x27;t press down that hard, five blades is a CLOSE SHAVE!</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors, free, to test and review. Buzz agent sent me:) the opinions are my own. I&#x27;ve always been a Schick fan, I must say.....these razors are amazing!!! I never want to use any other kind again. For the price, they are a bargain!</li>
    <li> I always loved Schick Hydro disposables, they leave my skin so smooth and i never had problems with razor burns.The past few months i wanted to try couple of brands and this one worked the best for my skin.I recently received the Schick Hydro Silk package to try the product for free thanks to Schick.</li>
    <li> I was blessed to try these razors through the company of bzzagent and I got it from free and let me tell you this very close shave its slippery is silky I would buy it again very good and it&#x27;s a plus that it is 5 blades. I would suggest wetting your desired area to shave first.</li>
    <li> great close shave with 5 razor blades, best disposable razor i have used yet. no razor burn during or after shave. leave skin smooth and soft for a great close shave. best disposable razor i have used yet  thanks schick and bzzagent for this great product to try out!</li>
    <li> Over the years, I tried several razors that promised to give me smooth and silky legs. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the appearance of my legs, but I noticed quite a difference in price. Feeling frustrated, I went back to cheap disposable razors and ignored all the hype about new razors on the market. When I was sent the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor I was curious to see if there would be any difference. I have got to say I LOVE this razor!! It is super silky to use. It didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving, which left me a little worried about how it would perform. Turns out it was actually an incredibly close shave and my skin stays silky, smooth, and moisturized for days after using this razor. The best part is that it completely affordable! I am so happy to find a disposable razor that actually gives great results without costing a fortune. I HIGHLY recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I received these razors complementary of Bzzagent. I like these razors because they give me a close shave and leave my legs feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> Prickly legs be gone! This razor saved my legs! With a new baby in the house, I hate to admit I was slacking on my shaving. My legs were hairy and totally ashy and dry. After shaving the the Hydro Silk Disposable Razor, my legs can breathe again! They are smooth and silky and hairless! With the summer coming, you need a razor that not only leaves them totally hair free but also hydrated and moisture. This razor did exactly that for me. The close shave allows me to go an extra day or two without shaving. I love it! More free time to spend with my beautiful baby girl! &amp;#60;3 Thanks Schick for allowing me to try this product for free!!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this razor. It is very hard to get a close shave, the blades are too inset. I tried one leg using the shaving cream and one leg dry shaving. The leg with the shaving cream I had to redo because it literally glided right over and didn&#x27;t shave any of the hair off. I didn&#x27;t even use much cream to begin with. The other leg was better but I had to go over it a couple times and put a lot of pressure. All in all, unless you prefer dry shaving, I&#x27;d say this was a bust. #freesample #myopinion #SchickHydroSilkDisposables</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel like a disposable razor. It is sturdy, has a nice thick handle, and a moisture strip. I got a great and comfortable shave with it. Unfortunately, the price does not reflect a disposable razor either and it seems to me that you could get replacement razor heads for cheaper than these. If for some reason you need a razor to be disposable though, I would recommend these because they are so nice.</li>
    <li> I received these to try for free from BZZAgent. I love the way my legs feel after the shave. No nicks or cuts. This will be my go to razor.</li>
    <li> I tried this as part of a promotion from bzzaenr. It was a great shave with silky smooth skin. It provides the perfect shave with 5 blades and a guard to prevent knicks and cuts. Overall great!</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free from Schick. I have used several different brands of disposables and always end up disappointed. However, these Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors impressed me. I could not believe how smooth my skin was after I shaved. The overall design is great!! These razors are shaped to fit perfectly in your hands for a more comfortable shave. Each razor has a moisturizing strip that works great for hydrating your skin while shaving and even afterwards. I would highly recommend these razors to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got got a 3 pack to try it thanks to BzzAgent and i really like it, also got the shaving gel so i had the oportunity to try them togheter and love it, i ususally get the store brand one and sometimes the Venus and this wins both of them, my skin is smother and wont irritate like it usually does after shaving but again i think is the combination of the razon and the shaving gel, amazing!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the Schick Hydro Silk razor. I am not a fan of disposable razors, I just have never preferred them. I did, however, have the chance to try this product (HUGE thanks to Schick), and I love it. It has the perfect grip for your hand and fingers. The blades do their job, and do it well. The glide is super soft and easy. Even my hard to reach spots are feeling great! It has been just under 24 hours since I shaved my legs, and they are still feeling amazing. I would highly recommend this product, even if you do not like disposables. This one has been taken to a new level.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors by far I have tried they give a close comfortable shave. The 5 curve sensing blades worked wonders no Knicks or cuts at all using them in those hard to reach places. The water activated moisturizing strip leaves skin silky smooth. I usually have to shave ever day or at least every other day I haven&#x27;t had to shave in the last 4 days and legs are still smooth and moisturized. I received these razors for free from bzzagant and schick to try out. I love them and will not use anything else</li>
    <li> Seriously after a long vacation I used the shick hydrosilk razor and it was amazing!!! It left my legs super soft and with no cuts! I didn&#x27;t think it would be as smooth as a wax or as good as refill expensive razors.&lt;br /&gt;#HydroSilkDisposables&lt;br /&gt;#GotitFree</li>
    <li> Color me impressed! I received a 3 pack of these razors for free from BzzAgent as a part of a Schick campaign. Originally, I was very skeptical as I find the more blades there are, the more I end up injuring myself. Well, I came out of my shower with silky smooth legs and only one small nick and the tiniest bit of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel like the moisture strips were a bit much, but overall, I am very happy with these razors!</li>
    <li> I love these razors. I&#x27;ll never buy any other kids again and I also got to try these out for free from a promotion from the company and bzzagent</li>
    <li> This is the nicest razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It has five little blades, really close-set, and a gel-like strip that actually seems to put something soothing on my skin. It&#x27;s kind of a jelly-like substance, without being sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put my finger directly on the strip, a little strand of gel sticks to it. I guess that&#x27;s the aloe. In any case, it&#x27;s really nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel any concern going over bony places like around my knees or over my shins. I even let my armpit hair grow out a little, as an extra test, and the hairs swiped right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very comfortable and I liked using it. I started looking for more places to shave. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor with the \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\&quot; Hydro gel razor - one for my left armpit and leg, and one for the other. While I felt the \\&quot;Women&#x27;s\\&quot; Silk razor gave me a closer shave, I really couldn&#x27;t discern a significant difference in the actual razors. Both have five blades and a gel-strip, and both razor heads flip down a little, to better follow the contours of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked between the two razors for shaving my lady garden, I immediately chose the Silk razor. Again, everything worked easily, with no fear of razor burn or cuts, for keeping things tidy. It&#x27;s not anything like a trimmer, though: this is just a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package arrives with three full razors at a good price point, and you can buy replaceable heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The package is very easy to get into - one end lifts up and peels off. You don&#x27;t need to get a knife to get into the package and risk getting one of those deep plastic finger cuts. Bravo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: This is a great razor for legs and armpits. It&#x27;s comfortable to use in the tub, or with shaving cream. The gel is soothing and the five blades shave nicely. I felt it was a pretty luxurious product for the price.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this razor.  One of my favorite features is how the head part is built on a pivot so that when it is laid flat, the moisture strips and blades do not touch whatever surface they are on.  So many times I&#x27;ve gone to use a razor for a second or third time and it is stuck to my bath tub or counter top.  Then when you try to pull it off, you end up removing half of the moisturizing strip!  My legs were moisturized and smooth for about 4 days after shaving, (then the stubble slowly snuck back in.)  I&#x27;m also someone that requires a quick shave, which in many cases leaves my legs looking like victims of some sort of attack.  I shaved both legs &amp; underarms with this razor, as quickly as possible and did not nick or cut myself at all.  This busy mom appreciates that!  (Also, I received this razor as part of a promotion for free in return for my feedback.  Thanks, Schick!)</li>
    <li> I got these razors to try out for free from schick and I was a little hesitant because I like using Venus razors. Well I used one of these schick hiydro silk razors tonight and I can say that it&#x27;s really great if not a little better than my Venus razors. This razor did not feel like it was sawing a thin layer of skin off but yet still took off all of the hair that o wanted off. I will most definitely buy these razors and might even replace my Venus razors.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample to test out form Bzzagent.  I am so in love with this razor.  It has 5 blades and leaves my legs super smooth.  It works just as well and I believe even better than the more expensive razors that require refills.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> I received a package of women&#x27;s Hydro Silk razors and shave gel from Schick for free as part of a Bzz campaign. They came the day before our first trip out on the boat since the weather has turned *warm.* Spring and summer in Florida mean lots of time swimming and boating, it&#x27;s too hot to do anything else. All this outdoor time also means I need a great razor for a good smooth shave. The Schick Hydro Silk gave me just that! The flexible head allows me to get a good smooth shave on my knees and other hard to get places. I am so glad to have found the perfect razor &amp; shave gel to keep my skin smooth and hydrated all summer long.</li>
    <li> I have to say i have never been this amazed this razor really was amazing its been five days since i shaved and my legs still ate seriously smooth the razor made my legs feel so slick and smooth no razor bumps no cuts it was great.im never going back to any other razors on the shelf. I&#x27;m so happy i got to try these from bzzagent for free im still in shock for these razors are amazing. .thank you</li>
    <li> I love the 5 Curve Sensing blades and water activated moisturizer. They leave your skin Fantastically smooth and soft. I&#x27;ve used a a lot of different razors and this is the only brand that has ever worked for me. If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet I would definitely recommend that you try them</li>
    <li> With summer just around the corner, its the perfect time for this campaign. I received these free in the mail.  Soft, silky, smooth, moisturizing shave. No need to keep buying those expensive refills when you have a quality disposable like Schick Hydro Silk disposables.  The handle even has an ergonomic quality to it.  Some of the moisturizing razors I&#x27;ve tried in the past left an almost &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling to my legs. Like the strips left a waxy residue. But not Schick. I think this may replace my Schick Quattro as my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors! When I hear the word disposable I immediately think: razor burn, cuts, pain &amp; cheap! However I was pleasantly surprised after just one use on my legs &amp; underarms! The 5 blades create a super close shave that gives my legs a silky and soft feeling that is unlike no other! I love the rubbery grip on the handle which gives me the confidence of knowing the razor won&#x27;t slip out of my hand in the shower.  The cost is very reasonable for a pack of razors compared to it&#x27;s competitors. I would HIGHLY recommended these razors to anyone looking to get a close shave with lasting results! #GotitFree</li>
    <li> I have been couponing for years, so I have purchased TONS of razors. I have seen these razors in the store, but normally I will just use any old razor, since &amp;#34;all razors are the same&amp;#34;. I received these razors as part of a BzzAgent promotion, and I am so happy that I tried them! I have tried &amp;#34;disposable razors&amp;#34; before, and I did not realize that there was any kind of difference between the disposable razors and the regular cartridge razors. Wow, was I wrong! I really liked how smoothly I was able to shave. The first time that I used it (which was the first time that I had shaved in a while), I was in a bit of a rush. Even though I did not have time to shower or exfoliate or allow the follicles to soften in the steam of a shower, the razor and shaving cream worked very well. I have sensitive skin, and normally I worry about ingrown hairs, bumps when I shave, small nicks or cuts, and missing areas from having to go over multiple times. The 5 razor blades really worked at a silky smooth shave, without having to go over the same area multiple times, which really decreased the amount of irritation in my skin. The razor handle was perfectly shaped to fit in my hand, and the shaving gel stayed put on my skin perfectly. Overall, this was a 5 star product, and I am very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I love these Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors, they provide a nice smooth shave and work great in preventing any burn or cuts. They&#x27;re gentle and last a good length of time. Definitely a recommended purchase.</li>
    <li> These razors are top of the line when it comes to legs, even on my sensitive skin, I&#x27;m never left with nicks or cuts, even when using plain soap. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something for more intimate shaving needs, a razor with a smaller head might be a better choice.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic!  It works best when combined with shave gel or cream, but thanks to the added moisturizers, if needed you can use it alone.  My legs felt softer after using the razor, and the 5 blades allow me to get a close shave that left my legs feeling smooth longer.  I would definitely buy these razors in the future.  No cuts, no razor burn, soft and smooth skin, what more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors free from BzzAgent, yet this review is completely my own opinion. #GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these razors! They left my legs feeling silky smooth all day she most razors they would be prickly within a couple hours!</li>
    <li> I got to try these free from shick and I wanted to say that I am glad that I did.  Before I got to try these I had bought another brand of disposables and they hurt so bad!  They had only three blades and I had to throw the whole pack in the garbage.  Then I got to try these and the design and the five blades made all the difference.  It did not hurt to shave, I got no cuts, and I was able to reach hard to reach spots without an issue.  Definitely worth the purchase.  I will never buy another kind again!</li>
    <li> Definitely like that it has 5 blades! Left me silky smooth. However, using the razor with the shaving cream left my skin super irritated. But when i used it again with soap and water it was much better! I got these free from Bzzagent and Schick, and am so happy i got to try them! I won&#x27;t be going back to my old razor!</li>
    <li> Love these shavers! They&#x27;re so much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried and the shave is so close and smooth. My skin usually gets irritated after I shave but it has yet to do that with these. I also really like the moisturizing strips as they last longer than others I&#x27;ve tried. I received the product for free thanks to Schick but I would totally purchase these again!</li>
    <li> this razor is amazing. i will no longer buy cheap crappy razors. it made my legs so smooth and moisturized. i had no cuts or razor burns. i tried this product for free thanks to Schick.</li>
    <li> I just started using this razor and I have to say i am impressed.  This will definitely be my go to razor. Didn&#x27;t use any shaving cream or lotion just a quick shave and it did really well.</li>
    <li> This is one of my go to razors and I buy them alot they are a bit cheaper than the exchangeable ones and they work pretty much the same.I do think there a bit pricey for disposables, though they do give me a great shave.I like a really close shave and this is pretty good but not a great as I get with one other razor,so I cannot give it 5 stars but I really so love shick and I get nice smooth skin after I use them.I love that there are always coupons and I never see that with anyone company at all ever and razors can be so much money.I like this razor for larger areas such as the legs.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free 3 pack disposables from bzzagent to test these are review them,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was in no way compensated.</li>
    <li> I received my pack of Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors as part of a BzzAgent campaign for free thanks to Schick and I&#x27;m definitely impressed! The Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors have a comfortable grip, five blades (no stray hairs with this one), a moisturizing head that leaves your legs feeling smooth long after you’re out the shower and skin guards so no more irritating cuts you get from those cheap non-brand disposable razors-which are my usual go to. I honestly didn&#x27;t think this disposable would be anything amazing, after all my legs usually stay pretty smooth with the cheapy razors I currently use and I&#x27;ve tried other brand name disposables but the Schick Hydro Silk was definitely a pleasant surprise! The moisturizing serum on the razor head really does give your legs a sleek feeling and I even used mine to clean up my bikini area and to my biggest surprise I didn&#x27;t get any razor bumps-this alone will make me purchase this disposable again. If you&#x27;re looking for a disposable razor that will give you a super close shave without any cuts and leaves you feeling silky smooth the Schick Hydro Silk is for you!</li>
    <li> I bought these from the store. They are awesome but use shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I got this razor to try out thanks to Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this razor, it leaves my legs nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a little less of the &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34; stuff.  It can be too much at first.  As you use the razor it wears away and I think it works better this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it.  I would use it again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample, thanks Schick! in the mail a few weeks ago, and I am in love! Okay so that&#x27;s a little drastic for a disposable razor, but really, it&#x27;s my favorite. With 5 blades to allow for a super close shave, I&#x27;ve found myself needing to shave less often than I did with all other disposable razors. The moisturing serum is an added benefit. It not only provides moisture for soft legs several hours after shaving, but it seems to protect skin from nicks and cuts while shaving. Schick Hydro Silk Disposables are efficient. I haven&#x27;t felt so confident in a razor yet! It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> I legitimately love this product. I had one issue where I think the serum beads melted I think but I live in Florida and I think that was a storage mistake more so than a fault of the product. It creates a clean shave and your skin is silky smooth and feels moisturized. I did get to try it free thanks to Schick and BzzAgent. I&#x27;m leaving it as 4 stars because I can&#x27;t yet speak to long term use but I enjoyed this razor personally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the beautiful sunshine state where the sun constantly dries everything out!! I recieved a goody box from Bzz Agent that let me experience what it&#x27;s like to finally have hydrated legs for longer then 20 minutes. They stayed soft and hydrated for days!! Schick did a good job on these disposables! Definitely a 5 star!</li>
    <li> I think I just found my new favorite razor!  My husband will be glad I shave more often now that I can shave without horrible razor burn.  The super soft and protectant rubber guards are thicker than standard razors and really work.  They have a awesome gel inside that will leave your legs feeling oh so smooth after!  I didn&#x27;t even have to use the shaving cream, which is great for those of you that are constantly late like I am! You can even get behind your knee, or around your ankle without hurting yourself, because the rubber pieces flex to protect!  After, you won&#x27;t have dry itching skin like I normally do, which means no more clawing your legs apart after every shave, and no more having to take extra time to apply lotion because your legs will already feel great!  I LOVE them and so will YOU!!!  I got to try them for free and received additional coupons as a BzzAgent!  I will need those coupons for the future, because these are awesome and I will be buying more when these run out.  Hope the coupons don&#x27;t expire by then, because these are going to hold up for a WHILE!</li>
    <li> I was sent these to try from Schick. I&#x27;ve been using these razors for the past week and they are some of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used to date. I&#x27;m not usually a fan of disposable razors but these were pretty good. I got a close shave and it&#x27;s easy to maneuver and grip. The handle is cushioned and not slippery. I hate when that happens! Very comfortable to handle and contours your legs effortlessly. Love the 5 blades and the moisture strips.  And for $10 you get 3 razors that will last about 3 months or more depending on how often you shave. I shave everyday in the summer months and every 2-3 days in the winter. I don&#x27;t like stubble and these razors do a great job at keeping my legs smooth.</li>
    <li> I was given these razors as a free sample to try and review and I absolutely love these razors! They gave me the close shave that I was looking for without cutting or nicking my legs.  They moisturized my legs and made them feel smooth and ready for the spring.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I expected it to be like all other razors, full of claims that don&#x27;t deliver but I was actually surprised to see how easy it glides and smooths the skin to prevent cuts. Although I got the razor free to try I can really tell it hydrates the skin and it left me with touchable pain free skin.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product through Bzz Agent and although I love the result I do not like that after one use the serum oozed out and it was just like any other disposable razor. For the price to purchase these razors to me, it would not be worth it. If this razor gave me 3 or 4 uses that were the same as the initial use I would 100% buy this product.</li>
    <li> The Wife brought these on a trip and was satisfied but not wowed.  The quality was noticeably inferior to her standard razor.  On the other hand, for a lightweight disposable to travel with they did the trick.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints, this is a great razor. It gave me a shave like my refillable and made my legs soft, it has a great handle design and moves with your body nicely</li>
    <li> I LOVE these razors! They give a smooth close shave. I have very sensitive skin and many razors irritate my skin but not these! I recived this product as a promotion from the brand but that did not change my opinion!</li>
    <li> I tried this product from a sample from Schick, and i love it! the razonr is great the stuff around the outside makes it so even if you run out of cream you dont kill your leg! i will be buying these once my sample is gone!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to a sample offer from Schick and I have to say these Hydro Silk Disposables Razors are definitely better than the cheap non-brand name razors that I use. Although it is a bit pricey, with discounts and coupons, it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase. The gel-like handle is very comfortable to hold and gives me a grip when the surface is wet since I always shave in the shower. The razor blades for a single use is very sharp, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it over and over again as I used to do since the blade do wear down. The hydro strip. The multiple blade system gives me a close shave. Although I did get a nick by accident, it&#x27;s alright to use alone without shaving gel, but I usually use shaving gel for extra protection. I wouldn&#x27;t necessary say this product is unique over other brands like Venus, but I do like the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I love my schick hydro silk disposable razors!! It leaves my legs silky smooth and ultra moisturized! I got to try them for free through being a bzz agent! Now I will never use any other brand for disposables!! I also love the fact that I can use these on the go!!!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. Thanks to schick i am trying to product for free. At first i was worried because i have tried many different products once it comes to razors and many of them the same results.Dry skin,razor bumps and tons of cuts.My surprise all there razor left me with is smooth skin and no hair. I was so happy. Also the design is so cute. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got to try these recently, courtesy of Schick Hydro and Bzz Agent, and I was really impressed. The 5 blades made it easier to get a cleaner shave, and the shape of it helped get all the tough spots. I got way smoother skin even after the shave, probably one of the best razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I tried these razors and although they leave my legs feeling super silky, they have way to much gel in my opinion. The gel tends to stay on my legs in large clumps and I need to wash it off and reshave that spot. The head of the razor is also much bigger than I am used to so it takes a few passes in different directions to get around the ankle bones and knees. I like it but I think its going to take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand but my opinions are completely my own.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hyrdo Silk Disposable Razor performs like no other disposable razor.  It performs like a non-disposible in that the quality of the handle is made with little details that enable you to hold on to the razor once you start shaving.  The razor head is movable thus enabling a close shave with out cuts i.e. most important around the knees!  Then there is the actual razor that has 5 razor blades and moisture strips giving you the most softest and closest shave you can get - disposable and non-disposible wise. (Disclaimer: I was able to try this razor free from Schick).</li>
    <li> These razors are simply amazing! I got a nice close shave and only had to go over the area once. Usually I have shave my legs twice( I have very thick hair) which bothers my skin horribly. Not this razor! I love it! I will defiantly be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> I received a three pack of these sumptuous razors from BzzAgent, and boy am I glad. For the first time in forever, I don&#x27;t find I need to use any shaving gel. They glide over curves that easily.  They&#x27;re a smooth as silk, and I&#x27;ve been able to use each razor for several occasions before needing to replace it! Overall, a big win in comfort, ease of use and smooth results! #GotItFree </li>
    <li> I received Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables complimentary from bzzagent and Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables Free for testing purpose and my opinions are on my Own . I have try Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables since i receive and I have to say I feel so good. Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables feels so soft in your skin, my legs feel hydrated after shaving for a very long time, other razor itch after shaving, but Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables the itch went away and all i feel is good. I love the 5 Curve Sensing blades it is so easy for me to shave in those areas hard to get, (you know what i mean girl). I love the design matter fat i love everything. I will recommend and keep using this ones. WooHoo Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables Other Razor Sorry But You Have To Go!!!  Best of all Got It Free thank you BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> #gotitfree from bzzagent and Schick. and I can honestly say that the Schick hydro razors live up to their claims! They give a good close shave while leaving legs silky and smooth. The head pivots to get a clean shave around those curves. I didnt have any redness, bumps or itchy legs when I used these razors. Definitely worth the little extra cost for a much better shaving experience! And when u buy them from amazon you get the great experience at a awesome low price!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for free for review from BzzAgent for an honest and unbiased opinion. I love this product, I have always loved this brand of razors and was very excited to be able to review this product and share how much I love it with others. I get a close shave with no nicks! ( I ALWAYS get nicks) I think the price is very affordable and the packaging is amazing. I have only used this product on my legs so that is all my review will be for, but I have to say I recommend this product to anyone who wants a close shave with silky summer ready legs!</li>
    <li> I have been using the same brand of shaving cream and razor for years and did not realize that there was anything else worth trying.  Boy was I wrong, this make my skin less irritated and left it smoother than my previous brand (no matter how new the razor was). And I am not just saying this because I got the product for free to test from BzzAgent and Schick. I will be making the switch to this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I received these razors from BzzAgent for free to test out and review. After expressing that I would like to state that I absolutely and giving my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen these razors advertised on TV and in every supermarket/drugstore that I have went to. I was weary to try them out because I am always so disappointed in razors that I&#x27;ve stopped wasting money trying different brands. Most women&#x27;s razors are just cheap razors masked behind pretty packaging so I had given up until I was given the opportunity to try these. Before I shaved I exfoliated my legs to get the best shave possible. I used these with the Skintimate Shaving Gel BzzAgent provided. My legs hadn&#x27;t been shaved in a week, which in my opinion, is the best timeframe to try a new razor. These razors honestly do give you such a close shave! The moisture strip helps the razor glide easily up your legs and did not dry out the first time I used it like most razors. However, I will say that the moisture strip only lasted 2-3 shaves before I noticed it had dried up. I usually only use a razor 2-3 times anyway so that really isn&#x27;t so bad to me, but I know others use razors for as long as possible. Honestly, if you&#x27;re looking for a good razor that will give you as close a shave as possible without waxing, this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product through BzzAgent but got no other compensation for this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Schick Hydro Silk (non disposable) and I liked it, I just can&#x27;t get on board with the cartridges. I like the convenience (and price) of disposables so I knew right away I would enjoy this product. The biggest difference from other disposables I have tried is the awesome rubber handle on it. It is so comfortable and makes it so easy to hold in the shower, especially with wet, shaving cream covered hands. It also stays sharp longer than other disposables I&#x27;ve tried. I can easily use the same razor for a week before noticing a difference. The moisturizing bar around the blades is really nice too. It&#x27;s super convenient for shaving under my arms when I don&#x27;t always want to use shaving cream and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. My only complaint with this razor is it is difficult to get a good shave with shaving cream the first time you go to use it. I think the moisturizing bar and the shaving cream conflict and the razor just glides right over the shaving cream without getting any of the hair. Luckily, the moisture bar makes it so you don&#x27;t even need shaving cream the first time you use it. I can shave my legs once and under my arms 2 or 3 times before the moisture bar loses some of its magic, then I can use shaving cream no problem. So I guess it&#x27;s not so much of a complaint as it is an FYI, you don&#x27;t need to waste your time with shaving cream with a this razor right away. Ooo imagine going on vacation with this razor and not needing to bring a can of shaving cream! I just thought of that, awesome! I do highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample for honest feedback definitely a good razor doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my skin like a lot of others do and calms down the usual razor irritation I get downside though would be the almost slimy residue the moisture strip leaves on skin and having to scrub it off so the razor can do its job and doesn&#x27;t cut so close the first time around but other than that a good razor over all</li>
    <li> Love these razors. Can be used with shaving cream or not, either way, no razor burn. Easily glides over ankles &amp; knees with no cuts or knicks. Thanks to an offer from schick I got to try it for free #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received this from Bzzagent for free. I&#x27;m HOOKED! This in my opinion, is by far the best razor a lady could ask for. Especially when paired with the shaving cream lotion. It leaves your legs feeling GREAT!! I recommend trying this to any and everyone. It&#x27;s a great feeling!!</li>
    <li> I’ve always had trouble finding a good razor. Given my latin background, I have been cursed with dark, course hair. Women’s razors usually do not give me the shave that I like so I’ve resulted in using my husband’s Gillette Fusion for the last several years. If anyone has ever used the Gillette Fusion then you know that the replacement blades are very costly and between the both of us, we spend a small fortune.  Although I received this razor for my review through BzzAgent, my opinions are completely my own. I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed using the Schick Hydro Silk AND it was so nice to finally have a women’s razor that worked so well and was for my use only. I even used it with Skintimate Silky Shave Gel (FYI- I’ve always been a conditioner kind of girl!) and it gave me an incredibly smooth shave. I’ve been using the same disposable for over two and a half weeks without any problems whatsoever so they do last awhile too. Affordability is definitely a plus for me!  The only downside was the size of the blade. I found it difficult to maneuver in “hard to reach areas” and even nicked myself on my knee… ouch.  However, I can’t blame the razor for my little mishap- instead I will call it a learning curve.  Ultimately, I will definitely purchase again and my husband may now have his razors back.</li>
    <li> Folks have commented that these are expensive, but unlike a few other disposable brands, these are reusable for the short term.  I highly recommend them for vacations or pretty much taking anywhere that isn&#x27;t your personal bathroom.  One of these will suffice for a week long vacation.  The blades and the head seem to be nearly identical to the regular Schick hydro (comparing them side by side as I write this), but the handle is cheaper quality, and there is cheaper, flimsier plastic on the razor head itself.  Still, it nicks a lot less than the cheaper disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts?  Great for travel.  Can be reused several times.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I received a pack of Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors for free from Schick for the purpose of reviewing. These razors provide an incredibly close and smooth shave. I&#x27;ve tried using these razors with and without a shaving gel. Even without a shaving gel the razor glides across and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have not experienced any dryness or nicks from these razors. I am so happy I got to try this out just before the summer season. With other razors I sometimes have to go over one spot more than once to achieve a smooth result, but with this Schick razor I no longer need to go over any spot more than once. The blades contour really well around the hard to reach spots. I no longer have to worry about missing spots because I couldn&#x27;t reach them. The thick handle design is comfortable to grip and did not slide out of my hands even in the shower. I will definitely be repurchasing these this summer!</li>
    <li> Amazing Razors!!! I was able to review and test these razors for free through Schick and BzzAgent. I highly recommend these razors to everyone. They leave my legs feeling great and moisturized!!</li>
    <li> This is truly a great razor that gives you a nice shave. The handle grip is smooth, and the blades glide gently on your skin. It&#x27;s very hydraying, too! I did get to try this as a brand promotion, however, I will now be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> These are the most amazing disposable razors I have ever used! They leave my skin feeling soft and amazing. I haven&#x27;t had any redness or irritation at all! I&#x27;m truly amazed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Schick I got to try this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a promo along with some coupons for discounts on future razor purchases. I am truly amazed at how well it actually works! I like to shave every day and that can be very harsh on my skin. Especially on my bikini area. So far I have used this razor for two days in a row with now breakouts or bumps. That is a first for me. I am very impressed at how moisturizing it actually felt while shaving with it. You can feel the shea butter on it which is impressive compared to other razors. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Schick sent me a package of Hydro Silk Disposables to try out free and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. The razor head and handle design makes shaving easy especially around trouble spots like knees and ankles. The 5 blade design gave me a close shave the first time I ran the razor over my legs. I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area 3 times like I do with lesser razors. The moisturizers infused in the razor head made my legs feel hydrated and silky. This razor is of a higher quality than most non-disposables, so this is a great value!</li>
    <li> So, I have been using this razor now for a few weeks. I must say, I am still madly in love with the skintimate shave gel, it is amazing! I love the hydration it provides me, especially with having very dry skin, yuck. I still will give the shick hydro silk disposable a 4 star out of 5. I think they are great, the first shave was amazing. The second, I got a bit of knicks from it and some razor burn which kinda stunk. I would say, when it comes to optimal performance with the hydration moisturizing strips, they are 100% for about 3 uses, after that, they start to wear off. About the 4th or 5th shave from this razor I was getting quite a bit more razor burn from it. But for a disposable razor, this is for sure in the top 2 out of the many, and I mean MANY, disposable razors I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free set of Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable razors from BzzAgent, and I must say that I love them! From the fun appearance to the ease of use, these razors have it all. The first few times that I used the razors, they were so soft and I actually thought that razor protector was on, but it wasn&#x27;t. The razors really are that gentle and soft!! It must be the water-activated moisturizing serum that hydrates your skin for up to 2 hours after shaving and the contoured cartridge. Also, the handle is easy to grip and is not slippery. Overall, this is a great product that will e my go-to brand and product going forward!</li>
    <li> My wife really likes these blades.  The razors are light and the lube strip definitely helps glide the razor across her legs.  She thinks this is the best disposable woman&#x27;s razor on the market.</li>
    <li> I got these to try as a #Freesample and they are the best razors point blank period! ! The close shave and moisturizing softness you achieve with a a have is incredible! ! I don&#x27;t even need to lotion when I&#x27;m done!! They last awhile and still give you an amazing shave!!♡♡♡♡</li>
    <li> I got to try out Schick Hydrosilk Disposables as part of a free campaign and I LOVE them! I usually just buy the cheap store brand because they are disposable anyway, but not anymore! I love that that the handles is curved in a way that makes it easy to hold on to and maneuver. I was pleasantly surprised that I don&#x27;t have to shave super slowly over my knees and I don&#x27;t have any cuts at all. The moisturizing strip worksite a charm as well; didn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry afterwards like other razors! I will continue to use these from now on! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I received this free from BzzAgent, and when I read the description I thought it might be a little too good to be true. Boy was I wrong.. this razor is AMAZING! The water-activated moisturizing serum is my favorite feature, because it makes me feel like I&#x27;m not even shaving. Most disposables have an uncomfortable scraping feel to them. Not only does the serum and the soft, easy-to-grip handle make the shave feel amazing, but the 5 Curve Sensing® blades with skin guards gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had! I&#x27;m usually really hard to please with razors, but Schick Hydro Silk exceeded all of my expectations. I&#x27;ll never use a different razor again, these are definitely my go-to!</li>
    <li> I really love the Schick Hydro Silk. It gives me a very close shave which makes my skin feel very smooth. Another thing I like about these razors is that I don&#x27;t cut myself and it is easy to use. It is really worth trying. I received these razors as a part of a promotion through Schick.</li>
    <li> Recommend these to all my friends now. Best shave. The handle is comfortable, and five blades glide over knees &amp; ankles</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks and am very happy with this razor. I just do a quick shave on my legs while in the shower but with my skin sensitivity i must use baby oil instead of shaving cream so I cant attest if the moisture strips really work since the oil is clearly a moisturizer. I do love the rotation of the cartridge...no cuts on my knees! It really moves well even when I rush over my knees (when I normally cut myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Received this product as part of bzzagent</li>
    <li> Thanks to Schick &amp; Bzzagent, I was given the opportunity to test this razor out. And I am happy I did! It is a really good razor. It gave my legs a great smooth finish. They felt soft and moist. Usually after shaving my legs, they&#x27;re very dry. This razor didn&#x27;t give me any cuts, nicks, or razor burn. You don&#x27;t even need shaving cream! a close smooth shave and leaves you with silky smooth legs!! And the close shave that this razor delivers is another plus! Would definitley reccomend to friends!</li>
    <li> smooth shaving, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I received these in the mail to test out for free and I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for them, honestly. I usually stay far away from disposables because in my experience they are duller and hard to maneuver. I was so surprised by these!!! They literally glide across your skin and absolutely feel like silk. I almost don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m shaving when I use it. I&#x27;ve used cartridges before that have a thick strip of shaving gel that is water activated but found those to be really messy. These aren&#x27;t at all messy and deliver awesome moisture. I believe I found my go-to razor!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor out there and it works amazing! All thanks to BzzAgent and Schick for letting me test and review it! I loved that it gave me a nice, close shave, without the razor burn and it worked great on sensitive skin too! When I was shaving I liked that the razor had a nice grip and did not slip out of my hands, which was awesome! I recommend this product to everyone and I will definitely be buying it!</li>
    <li> The most softest amazingest silkyest shave gel I have ever tried, no joke. Love it. Can&#x27;t stop using it. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin all dry and patchy. Doesn&#x27;t burn, do sent smell bad. It&#x27;s just right in every way. And the Hydro Silk Shaver with 5 blades. Is the most easyist best shaver you will ever use. It just works like a beauty. Your really missing out if you have not tried this masterpiece yet. I got mine for free from #Schick Hydro silk. ♡ you should really try it. and I&#x27;m sure like me you will never go back. And your skin stays soft and smooth for days n days nights n nights. :) oh did I mention the gel has Moroccan Oil in it that moisturizes while you shave. And leaves your skin feeling amazingly touchable. 💖 💖 💖</li>
    <li> I received this as a  promotional item and am glad I was able to try it. So far, this is the longest lasting disposable razor I&#x27;ve found. It gives a nice, close shave (maybe even too close) and leaves my skin silky smooth to the point that I forget to put lotion on afterwards. I didn&#x27;t experience the sticky gel described by some reviewers. The razor itself has a solid, weighted feel to it which helps it follow your contours without much effort.- I was a fan of the Quattro before, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with the Hydro Silk now until the next &#x27;big thing&#x27; comes out.  Perhaps the reason that the razor lasts longer than most is because there are five blades, so the &#x27;work&#x27; is distributed over twice the number of blades of some other leading brands.</li>
    <li> I received these as a promotion from the brand. I got them from a BZZAGENTI love my Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors! they are every bit as good as my reusable cartridge razors by Schick. They are perfect for when we travel and I don&#x27;t want to bring my regular razors with me the convenience of being able to throw them out and not worrying about losing them is perfect! The shave is close I love the 5 blades and I love that its a full size head unlike many other razors. I cut my shaving time in half. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good disposable razor! I will definitely be picking up a few packs for our vacations :)</li>
    <li> I love how hydrating these razors are! I&#x27;ve used several other types of schick razors before, but these are by far my favorite. As soon as I swiped over my legs with these I could tell how close a shave I had gotten. Usually I have to go over the same spot multiple times, but with these once or twice was enough. It really cut down on my shave time by alot! Not only did these work well for getting all my hair, it easily got to every curve. I noticed the hydration lasted more that two hours for me and I couldn&#x27;t help feeling how smooth my legs felt afterward. I&#x27;m glad I got to test these out after joining the campaign on bzzagent.</li>
    <li> #got it free&lt;br /&gt;Shick hydro silk razors provide a clean silky shave no knicks or cuts it also leaves my legs feeling moisturized and refreshed the design is also very sleek looking</li>
    <li> I have been using the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors for almost 2 weeks now and I am more in love with it then I was when I first tried it. I was a bit skeptical at first only because I suffer from eczema. Anything and everything will set it off, if my skin isn&#x27;t familiar with the product. Another reason I am skeptical of new razors is because 90% of the time I cut myself and at the end of the my shower it looks as if I am in the middle of a crime/murder scene in a movie. I love the fact that the the razor has a water-activated serum. This saves me from having to use so much shaving cream and provides more moisture for my skin. The razor is perfect for traveling and is easy to grip so that I am in control at all times of the device. Last, the razor provides a clean, smooth shave every time I use it and I never have to worry about cuts and razor burn once I am finished. A side note, shave with baby oil and the razor lasts longer! I&#x27;m always a bit weary of trying new razors. I believe my skin was more happy about this feature, as it should be. That&#x27;s exactly what it did! My skin (mainly my legs) were silky smooth after the first shave. There were no signs of hair on my legs at all! I&#x27;ve never been more relieved to test/try a product in my life! Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors are for me!</li>
    <li> I have coarse, dark leg hair. I have to shave everyday to get rid of it! I love the fact that these razors had 5 blades, any less and I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten such a close shave. My legs felt silky and smooth with no bumps or cuts. Try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables and you will be just as pleasantly surprised as I am! Thank you Schick and Bzzagent for letting me try this product. I will certainly be purchasing it in the future!</li>
    <li> I received these from bzzagent free to try. I am so glad that I did! I had seen them and wanted them on more than one occasion because of the price I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t like to buy something disposable and it not be really good for that price. The handle is easy to hold and it is quite possibly the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a women&#x27;s disposable razor. One razor lasted me almost 3 weeks and that&#x27;s with shaving 3-5 times a week. I usually get men&#x27;s razors because of the close shave. From now on though- I will be buying these! They are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these razors! I normally am not a big fan of disposable razors but I decided to try them out because I received them for free as a part of a campaign from Schick. I was pleasantly surprised by the close shave that I got with these razors. They are easy to hold and maneuver around the curves of my legs. I would definitely purchase these with my own money the next time I need razors!</li>
    <li> I have always love the feel of schick razors but what I love most about this product is the ability to be able to take it anywhere and be able to shave and have nice and smooth legs with the ablility to toss it away after use. No more forgetting to take my razor home.I am very glad that I got the opportunity to try this product for free by being a biz agent.</li>
    <li> I received these free from Schick and will be using these as my razors from now on. The handle of the razor is just the right size to give me firm grip as I shave the hard to reach areas on the back of my legs. The moisture strip on the razor is awesome and because of it I didn&#x27;t even have to apply lotion to my legs after I shaved. My legs are so smooth and silky after I shave with these razors. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a close, smooth shave and is on a budget.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! They last longer, shave smoother and leave my legs feeling more moisturised than the other razors I have used! I was able to try product for free thanks to Schick, but the thoughts are all mine</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get to try these as a free sample from Schick via bzzagent. I liked the Schick Hydro Dilk razors, but didn&#x27;t completely love them. What I did love was the super close shave, I&#x27;m sure due to the five blades. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had such a close shave, and it even got my knees without having to do spots multiple times! What I didn&#x27;t love was the &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34; gel. It was super slippery and almost seemed to coat my skin as I shaved. It seemed too thick, and I felt like I needed to rinse it off my legs before I continued shaving. It did keep me from getting any nicks or cuts though, so I suppose it did it&#x27;s purpose. So if you want a really close shave and as long as you don&#x27;t mind the thicker gel, these might be just the razor for you!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample with coupons...and after trying I will definitely be using the coupons to buy more! I&#x27;ve been a die hard follower of the competing popular brand, and just never thought to try something different, if it&#x27;s not broke... But I&#x27;m so glad I got to try these. I love the Hydro Silk feature. You can even use just water if you&#x27;re in a pinch. Also there is something about the blades that make you feel like you are getting a close shave, and you are. My only con, is that it&#x27;s a large blade/surface area. Can be hard to get into nooks and crannies, but overall a great razor. Glad I took the leap!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Schick and BzzAgent I had the opportunity to try these razors for free. I think these razors are pretty good.  They shave fairly well and I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same spot more than once except in a few areas on my legs.  The only real complaint I have is that it is difficult to get all the the hair out of the razor.  It seemed like no matter how much I rinsed it or banged it on the sink, there was still hairs in between the blades.  Other than that I enjoyed using these.  I would recommend these razors to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received these razors from BzzAgent for free, I love love love how silky my legs are after, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I broke out after I used them, but it was probably just because I have sensitive skin and something in the soap around the blade irritated my skin, other than that I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> FYI I was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables for free thanks to BzzAgent, however all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am lucky to have thick hair on my head, this means coarse hair everywhere else, ugh! I always had to go over my legs multiple times (irritating and causing razor burn), but no more with the Hydro Silks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is made to fit your hand very comfortably and is solid but manueverable. The head has a perfect amount of flexibility to move just right into curves. The head is shaped a little differently than other razors and I feel like the design is helping protect my skin from razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel a softness from the water-activated moisturizing serum but it washes off with absolutely no greasiness! It absolutely glided across my skin, with no pulling or scraping, and left it feeling smooth and soft! The blades have stayed sharp through many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think that all this comes at a premium, but it is completely reasonably priced for such a high quality razor. I have always been a Schick fan but this razor is a new favorite!!</li>
    <li> I got to try these for free through Bzzagent and Schick. These razors are by far my favorite. They give a close shave and keep my legs feeling mositurized. I love the grip on them. Makes the shave easy and comfortable. I give these razors 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I received this through a promotion from the Schick company, and I can say I 100% love these razors. There are no negative comments to be made. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the disposables like these, so this was perfect for me. I was able to get such a close shave without worrying about cutting myself. The razor is super easy to use, the rubber grips on the handles make it so much more comfortable for you. I love the fact that the blades are curve sensing, that assists preventing skin irritation. After I am out of the shower, it is like I already put lotion on. My legs feel so smooth! They really put life back into my legs, they were so dry and would be so irritated with the other razors I used to use. Those are tossed out, and the ONLY ones I use are the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables! These are perfect for on-the-go use too! I definitely recommend these! Especially if you&#x27;re in need of some hydration! #GotItFree #LoveThem!</li>
    <li> love this disposable razor as its handle is so good for grip and easy to use. its curve sensing technology helps to reach even hard to reach places. is keeps your skin soft and hydrated for at least 12 hours. it does not give that ugly black dots after shaving. now its my new favorite to go razor.i received this product in my bzzkit for review purposes. i would definitely buy this razor for my future use.</li>
    <li> I am trying this razor free thanks to Schick! The razor really is great. I like it because it&#x27;s disposable and I still feel like my legs are hydrated. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get dull faster than the other razors. Before I started using shick hydro, I felt like I had to shave every day-now I can go every other day because the shave is so close. I also do not have to put lotion on my legs after every shower now. Great razor!</li>
    <li> Sadly, this wasn&#x27;t the BEST disposable for me. The razor looked amazing, was pretty and the handle curves perfectly in my hand providing me excellent control and comfort. I didn&#x27;t notice my skin being hydrated after my shower but I admit- I take really hot showers so it could possibly be my fault! I liked the gel pads at first, I didn&#x27;t have to use too much of my shaving cream. But, the next day I went to shave and the gel bar adhered to my shower and when I tried to pick up my razor, there was a huge oozey goop having off of it! It was good for one shave, then afterwards I tossed the one I used. I was impressed with 5 blades, however, the head of the razor has no curve to it and it was rather difficult to shave hear and behind my knees and sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, id give this razor a 3. It did its job but the actual functionality of this razor was a bummer for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free to review.</li>
    <li> I really like these razors and will definitely be buying again. I have always been a fan of the Schick brand and when I got to try these for free from Bzzagent, I already knew I was going to like them. They arrived a few days before our trip to Florida and I tossed them in my bag as the razors I was going to bring on our trip with us. I was pretty confident they were going to work well seeing they were all I had brought with me. When I used them for the first time, I lathered my legs up and went to town. They were sharp and did a pretty good job. They have 5 blades which gives you a pretty close shave but they also have a moisturizing strip which in my case, kind of screwed up that close shave. The strip provides kind of a slimy path underneath the head of the razor that mixed with my soap that I had already been using. This seemed to make a barrier that wouldn&#x27;t allow me to shave anything but slime. After a few passes with the razor, the slime barrier had been broken and it was smooth sailing from there. Pun intended. This only happened the first couple of times I used it and as the moisturizing strip began to fade, the shave became a little easier and required less passes by the razor. I am assuming you could just wet your legs and use the strip as your soap for a smooth shave but I am in the habit of using soap so I didn&#x27;t do that. The head of the razor bends pretty far back, which allows to you get all those hard to reach places like the back of your knees and your achilles on the back of your foot. I have to say that this little guy seemed to get all those stray strips of hair I always seem to miss and then notice at the most inopportune times. These are also really nice because the blades stay sharp for a lot longer than I would expect them to, which gives your razor an extended life and puts a few more dollars in your pocket that would be used to buy new razors.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors are amazing! The design of the razor is just what I was looking for. I love the wide handle, it allows me to get a great grip and it doesn&#x27;t slip while shaving. The elevated head is genius since it has the moisturizing strips. I&#x27;ve always had problems with my razors sticking to the tub and ruining the strips but not with this one. The 5 curve sensing blades leave you with an amazingly smooth and lasting shave. The moisturizing serum strips allow for that added smoothness. The contoured head glides smoothly over every part of your leg. It goes over your shins, over and under your knees, and around your ankles with no problems. I always have trouble getting between my ankle and achilles tendon but I was able to get it done with just one swipe.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would lie in the bikini area. I wasn&#x27;t able to get as smooth of a shave as I was on my legs and I got a bit of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt; Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone! Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me to try this for free and introducing me to my new favorite razor!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive these Schick hydro silk disposable razors for free to try. I LOVE them.  Everything from the grip handle to the close shave it gives.  You get a nice lasting silliness feel. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I just started using this produCT. I can say I am highly pleased with this disposable razor. It cuts the hair off fast and in one swipe. I usually use the Venus razors but I can say this, I&#x27;m definitely switching!! #BuzzAgent #SchickHydroSilk #GotItFree</li>
    <li> They were okay. It doesn&#x27;t give the smoothest shave and it feels like you a spreading snot on you legs.</li>
    <li> I got these razors as a promotional kit from Schick and I have to say, these razors are so awesome!  I usually only use the quattro disposables because they are a little bit cheaper.  You definitely get value for the price with these though.  They curved my legs perfectly with no nicks or cuts.  I love the hydrating strip, you can really feel it working as you are shaving.  My legs usually get really dry, so this was a great feature.  I will absolutely switch to these razors for my future shaving needs!</li>
    <li> I received three Schick Hydro Silk Dispoable razors paired with Skintimate Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel for free from Bzzagent. These razors combined with the shave gel were silky smooth! I normally do not use disposable razors, because I end up having to use 2 or more to get the job done and end up nicking myself. But I was impressed with theses. The five blades really help to get a close shave. They didn&#x27;t clog up with hair and I only had to use one for both legs! I didn&#x27;t get any nicks and my skin is silky and soft. I also loved the easy grip handle and I loved how wide the razor was.</li>
    <li> Great razor for someone with dry skin received mine free for testing!  Would recommend to any woman but especially to those who have dry skin!! It is a must for every woman!  Gives a nice clean smooth shave!  #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a promo along with some coupons provided via a program ran by Buzzagent and Schick® Hydro Silk®. I think these are the best disposable razors I have ever used in my life. They caught all the hard to reach places the first time around; I absolutely love the swivel head effect on the razor, it makes it easy to get around places like your ankle and knees. I didn&#x27;t have to make any second passes and I had no nics, cuts or that irritating burning sensation thanks to the moisturizing serum that is on the blades. Just get the razor wet, and the serum is activated which is awesome for those quick in and out showers but you still need to shave your legs. My legs have never been this smooth! The handle is very nice, it fits very comfortably in your hand. I&#x27;ve had some razors, were they have literally slipped out of my hands so many times in the shower I just gave up and ran a tub of water, but not this one it&#x27;s like it was made to fit right into my hand. Hands down this is the best razor EVER! #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposables</li>
    <li> I got this product free from bzzagent for testing purposes. To be honest I  was skeptical to use a disposable razor because I haven&#x27;t had the best of luck with them in the past. I always ended up all cut up even while using shaving gel.well this time I did not cut myself at all!  This razor has a curved handle which made it super easy to grip and not slip. It has moisturizing gel embedded in this shaver which is nothing like the moisture bars that always piece off in chunks every time u shave. This one just use water and the gel activates and is like shaving gel and moisturizer in one. I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this shaver and definitely will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving these razors! I get a super close shave and they cost less than regular razors. They are also convenient for travel since it is one less thing I could forget to bring home. I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Schick!</li>
    <li> Got to try these beautiful razor from the amazing Buzzagent. First of all these razors have done wonders to my shaving routine. I do not need to use any shaving cream for them to shave which saves a lot of time as well as all the mess while taking a quick bath. It is also cost effective since I do not need any shaving cream. Love the grip and the look of it. The packaging was beautiful and also the blades are amazing. In one stroke it does the job. I do not need to go over that place again. Love this product would recommend it to all the ladies who want to save money and time and want best results.</li>
    <li> I got to sample Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for FREE from Schick and BzzAgent. I will definitely be purchasing these in the future (and I just noticed the price on here - only $10!? Awesome!). I have been using one of the three for the past three weeks and it&#x27;s still going strong! The hydration strip is amazing and doesn&#x27;t wash away quickly like other brands and the three blades allow for a close shave just in time for the warmer weather. My legs stay smooth for days. I frequently travel for work so I love to bring disposable razors with me but I usually throw them out after the trip. I&#x27;ve been taking this one back and forth because I don&#x27;t want to give it up! I&#x27;m even using it at home.</li>
    <li> These razors deserve to be all the rage this spring/summer! The shaving itself is enjoyable.  I mean it!  It is so smooth it just feels like silk gliding up your leg.  No need to go over the same spot two or three times either.  I highly recommend them for sensitive skin too which is what I have. I was fortunate enough to get to try this for free and  I will be buying these for sure!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of the Hydro Silk disposable Razors thanks to bzzagent. I was so excited to try this razor. I have always used disposable razors but never have I used one that gives you such a close shave, moisturizes your legs and leaves them feeling so soft and smooth for the next couple of days.This razor is a must try.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!! It makes my skin so soft and it gets all the hard to reach places! It goes over my knees with no problem and I will never use a different razor again!! I got this in my Bzz Agent kit for free and I will definitely be purchasing this razor when I run out!!</li>
    <li> Best razor ever! Left my legs so smooth dodnt even need lotion after! Never got razor bumps either and i did with my other razor! Love love love this razor and now this will be the only razo i use!</li>
    <li> I got to try these Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors for free and they are amazing. I have sensitive skin and these give me a nice smooth shave with no irritation! I will definitely be buying these to have again!</li>
    <li> Thanks to Schick I was fortunate enough to try this product for FREE! And it&#x27;s amazing. It gives a great smooth finish feeling to the area in which u shave. I tried it on my legs and I loved how soft and moist my legs looked and felt I will definitely buy these going forward thanks Schick!</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave. Other razors cause nicks for me, but not this one! And I don&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors are great! They come with three in a pack, each razor has five blades. The blades are great because the sense your curves and make shaving easier in hard to reach places. I love the fact that you do not even need to use cream or gel. This makes it so much easier to shave during your shower routine. I am so grateful that I got to try these razors for free thanks to Schick!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this combo! The best shave ever by far!!! ♥ I have never been so satisfied with a razor before using Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors and Skintimate® Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel.</li>
    <li> I received this fabulous disposable razor free from Schick and I am overly impressed!  If you aren&#x27;t a fan of disposable razors, this one will definitely change your mind!  It has left my extremely dry skin with a silky smooth feeling that lasts for several days.  I am very impressed by how close this razor shaves and I can for sure tell a difference in-between shaves--I can go an extra day or two without shaving when I use this razor.  I highly recommend giving it a try and seeing for yourself how fabulous your results will be.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors. I have tried other disposables before, and typically they don&#x27;t give a very close shave, the blades get dull fast and I always end up cutting up me legs. Well, not with these razors! I was able to try the razors for free as part of a promotion from Schick through BzzAgent. The razor itself is designed so it curves along with the curves in your body - no more straight disposables that miss half of the hair you are trying to shave off! I got a close shave with no nicks or cuts. The blades stayed sharp for much longer than other disposables I have used - I was able to use the razor daily for 3 weeks before I disposed of it and had to break out a new one. Overall, I am thrilled with the quality of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables and would definitely buy them again!</li>
    <li> I have tested this product for a Bzzagent campaign for purpose of review. Opinion is solely mine alone. I have to admit I really do not like these razors. Normally I love disposables, and normally Schick doesn&#x27;t let me down but these just had way too thick of a plastic border surrounding the razors. The outer rim of the razor almost blocked getting a clean cut. It was hard to get areas shaved completely the first time, I&#x27;d have to go back over the area 2 or 3 times to get all the hair. And it is REALLY hard to shave small, or concave areas like underarms and knees. I don&#x27;t believe I will be purchasing these in the future.&lt;br /&gt;“What would I want to know before I get this product?” That it was designed poorly and doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Schick and was really surprised by the quality of it. Its the best shave ever super soft and smooth totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love how quick and easy it is to shave now! My legs have never felt this smooth before with using disposable razors. My legs feel like they have been moisturized with lotion and these are so easy to hold.</li>
    <li> I do like the schick hydro razor, but much prefer the cartridges to these disposables.</li>
    <li> This is the worst razor I have ever used.  It caused painful ingrown hairs.  I need to find a better razor; I miss the Personal Touch razor!!</li>
    <li> I was able to try these Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors free from Schick, thank you Schick! I was so lucky I got to try these razors for free and I fell in love with them. I normally use cheap Bic razors and shaving gel and end up with knicks all over my legs and spots on my knees that I missed somehow. But with the Schick razor, I was able to easily grip the razor and get every inch of my legs, no missed hairs, and surprisingly no knicks! It was really gentle and easy to use, I didn&#x27;t even have to lotion my legs after I shaved, they were already soft. I will definitely be buying these razors when I run out.</li>
    <li> I received Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors for free from BzzAgent and was curious to try them as compared to my usual Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor (the one that doesn&#x27;t need shave gel/cream). I was grateful for the full-sized can of Skintimate Shave Gel, which I&#x27;ve always thought was a great product, and the next morning, in the shower, I went to work trying it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs went fine; no surprising issues, nothing special, just shavin&#x27; my legs. My underarms were a little tougher. I found that the head didn&#x27;t quite pivot well enough to get in there without my doing some weird contortionist tricks (e.g., holding the skin of my right underarm taut with my left hand while using my right hand to shave my right underarm - a little tricky!). I don&#x27;t have this problem with Gillette Venus &amp; Olay razor. Unfortunately for me, multiple passes with a razor usually means irritation. Thankfully I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, which normally happens to me quite easily, but I imagine with extended use it might become an issue. I can&#x27;t really say either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting out of the shower and drying off, the skin on my legs was fine. Not luxuriously moisturized, but not dry or irritated, which is a plus. My guess is that due to the awesome shave gel (seriously, I love Skintimate!) as compared to the Venus &amp; Olay, which does not require shave gel/cream, I have an extra layer of protection and moisture. There&#x27;s definitely something to be said for shave gel/cream as far as its moisturizing/protective abilities and its helping me not to miss spots :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I plan to show a lot of skin (e.g., going to the beach), I generally only shave every other day to save my skin from dryness and irritation. So just one day after using the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor for the first time, I was sitting in a meeting, wearing a dress with my legs crossed, and I took a glance at my legs. I saw stubble! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Thankfully I&#x27;m the boss, and my co-workers are like family (it helps that I&#x27;m married to one of them), so I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed, but in almost any other situation I would have been, had someone noticed. It looked like I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days. I went to the bathroom and checked my underarms to find the same result. I definitely don&#x27;t have this issue with Gillette Venus &amp; Olay, so I know I don&#x27;t just have an unusually high rate of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued using the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor in hopes that maybe I just did a bad shaving job the first time, but the results kept coming out the same. The next day, it looked like I hadn&#x27;t shaved in 2-3 days, and even the night of shaving my legs, they were no longer smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to eliminate any variables, I tried using a brand new Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor and Skintimate Shave Gel and shaving my legs while sitting across the bathtub as opposed to in a running shower. No more smoothness by that night, and visible stubble the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story: the shave is not close enough somehow. If I want to keep using the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor, I&#x27;ll have to shave every day. This girl doesn&#x27;t have time for that.workers are like family (it helps that I&#x27;m married to one of them), so I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed, but in almost any other situation I would have been, had someone noticed.

    <li> I received this razor free thanks to schick and I love it!  It is comparable to expensive non disposable razors.  I love the handle and the way the head curves and moves as you use it. It gives a great shave.  I used shaving gel with the razor but I think with the water activated moisture serum I would have been fine without it.  I have been using the razor for about two weeks and it still works great.  It is a great product and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables Razor and the Skintimate Silky Skin Shave Gel free by participating in their BzzAgent campaign. In my campaign box was a free 3-Pack of razors, a bottle of Skintimate Silky Skin Shave Gel, a pretty white pouf, and two coupon booklets containing five $3 off coupons for a Schick Hydro Silk Disposables Razor and five $1 off Skintimate coupons to share with my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the soft, ergonomic rippled handle that makes the razor very comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver in and around the curves of my legs without slipping, nicking. It lets me shave quickly and safely without irritating even my sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love the Water-Activated Moisturizing Serum thats gives me a really close shave and leaves my legs very smooth and silky. The water-activated moisturizing serum keeps your skin moisturized for up to 2 hours after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The hypoallergenic serum hydrates your skin and restores your natural moisture levels. The serum is made from marine extracts and shea butter, leaving your skin smooth after each shave. The serum has been dermatologist tested and is safe for all skin types, including sensitive skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even feel the blades when shaving—I think the blade guards also play a big role in this because they are designed to smooth your skin and prevent nicks and irritation—and the five curve-sensing blades really give the smoothest, most comfortable, and long-lasting shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the compact oval head that makes it easy to reach the harder to reach areas and maneuver the complex curves under my arms and behind my knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture serum does seem to wear out fairly fast but that&#x27;s O.K. because the Skintimate Silky Skin shave gel lubricates and moisturizes my skin with vitamin E, Moroccan oil, and Huile d&#x27;argan (argan oil). These nourishing ingredients helps give me the close shave while preventing nicks and irritation and leaves my skin feel so smooth and moisturized. It comes out of the can as a foam so you can spread it neatly and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro Silk Disposables Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: noticeably closer shave Very moisturizing Ergonomic Handle for A Great Grip Water-Activated Serum Keeps My Skin Moisturized For Up To Two Hours After Shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A little Pricey But Still Worth It Moisture Beads On Blades Wear Out Soon So Must use With A Shaving Cream Or Gelile preventing nicks and irritation and leaves my skin feel so smooth and moisturized.

    <li> i got these free from schick and bzzagent to try out and review i have been using them for about a month i only have to shave like one time a week because these are totally awesome razors so smooth and long lasting the handle design is on point i love these and definitely will be buying more of these in the future</li>
    <li> i really loved these razors!! they left a very close shave on my legs and left my legs very smooth all day long i totally recommend these  ** i got these for free for a review as a courtesy of buzz agent and schick but these are my own thoughts</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro silk disposable razors from bzzagent &amp; Schick to try for free. I normally use the Schick Quatro style because I usually end up slicing myself but with those I don&#x27;t! Well, I&#x27;ve been using the hydro silk ever since they arrived &amp; I haven&#x27;t cut myself once! These razors have a curved handle making shaving easier &amp; easy to grab, they  move around your curves to get all the little hairs the others might miss, have a moisturizing serum to keep legs soft  &amp; have five blades to get the smoothest shave. I must say that ever since using these that my legs stay smoother longer, are smoother than normal &amp; also I don&#x27;t get the dreaded after itch! I would always get itchy legs after shaving &amp; it would drive me nuts. That&#x27;s a great thing &amp; I think I will stick with these. If you&#x27;re wondering if you should try these razors, the answer is yes ! You have nothing to lose but have smooth silky legs to gain.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work very well.  The moisturizing strips wear out too fast.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! I received these razors free through BzzAgent and was very skeptical because I&#x27;ve never used this brand before. I was also weary because the razor contains 5 blades which causes irritation to my skin. However, I decided to give them a try just because they were free and to my surprise they left my skin feeling hydrated, nick free and clean. I can go up to 5 days before needing another shave. These are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Nice grip, but the hydro gel prevents a close shave. After sitting in the shower for a couple of days it seemed to &amp;#34;seep&amp;#34; out and clogged the blades when I shaved. This caused irritation on my hair folicles so I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave. I have gone by to using cheap disposals.</li>
    <li> I got to try these razors from BZZ Agent for free. I was sure that all razors were the same and what would this do that would be different. THe first thing I noticed was the handle and it was a good color and didn&#x27;t slip out of my hands and was really easy to grip. It has five blades and  a really close shave. It has the ability to get into those hard to reach places like knees. I didn&#x27;t get any knicks on my legs which is great! It left them smooth and silky too. I would reccommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got sent these by Schick through BzzAgent for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have used different versions of these for years when traveling and at home. I have thicker hair, so I really like that these have 5 blades so that you can get it in one swoop when shaving. I also haven&#x27;t had any problem nicking myself with them, and I&#x27;ve had an overall good version. The head is pretty similar to the Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 5 blades - can get hair in one swoop, don&#x27;t have to go over twice again&lt;br /&gt;* Handle has a good grip - so you don&#x27;t lost grip of it in shower and accidentally drop it&lt;br /&gt;* The top part rotates a bit - good for getting a close angle and harder to reach places&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The lotion part can get goopy if left wet too long, but Schick includes a little thing that you can use to hang up your razor in your shower. If you use that thing to hang it up it won&#x27;t be bad, but if you leave your razor on a ledge (in shower/bathtub) it might get goopy</li>
    <li> I am in love with these razors. I have tried every razor out there, or so it seems, and these are hands down the best. They provide a close, comfortable shave with no cuts whatsoever. I have found my perfect razor.</li>
    <li> Loved these razors. They are way better than the Venus ones in my opinion. I would definitely recommend them over the other leading brands.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor! I used to use the various Venus razors, disposable and non disposable. I never have had a closer shave! Afterward my legs are so smooth! It is also a very easy to use razor. I haven&#x27;t gotten any cuts or nicks even when I&#x27;m rushing. The gel from the razor cartridge lasts a VERY long time compared to other razors.  I&#x27;m still using the same one after 4 weeks (shaving 2x a week). The Venus ones didn&#x27;t even last 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables Razor and the Skintimate Silky Skin Shave Gel free by participating in their BzzAgent campaign. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors left something to be desired. When I first received the razors, I was extremely excited to try them. They look so sleek and the packaging made me want to try them. The design of the handle made it super easy to grip. The first time I used the razor I felt like the 5 blades were wonderful and shaved very close. The hair did not grow back near as fast because it was so short. With this I probably could easy go every other day shaving. It really eased around those hard to get areas. I felt like my legs were very smooth and soft the first time around.  I really liked the protective layer to keep from having razor burn and to keep my skin moisturized. I was pretty excited with the results. Then the second time I used the razor I took the cover off of the razor and it was stuck on because the protective layer made it stick to the case. When I finally got it off it took most of the protective layer with it. Then when I shaved I felt like there was a snotty layer all over the blades. The blades were still sharp but because of the issue with the protective layer gave me razor burn every time I used it even when using shaving cream. I also felt like my skin was drier than before.  I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Schick and BuzzAgent and would not buy this razor again.</li>
    <li> As a long time user of the Schick Hydro Silk refillable razor, I was interested to see how the disposables from the same line compared. The moisture serum beads along the top and bottom of the razor face are to die for. You could easily shave without your shaving cream/lotion/soap of choice for a quick touch up (which I&#x27;ve totally done); no burn or knicks, glides silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber handle is fantastic! Just squishy enough to make it easy to hold, even with slippery shower hands. The handle is designed in such a way that the face of the razor doesn&#x27;t end up in a puddle of water and get rusty/dull/icky, which I really love. This feature also seems to really extend the life of the blades and the moisture serum. Other razors I&#x27;ve used with built-in moisturizers have sometimes had issues with the razor face sitting in water on the shelf in the shower, which turns the built-in moisturizer in to a funky puddle over time - no bueno!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the real question is, why buy these instead of the refillable? The biggest complaint I&#x27;ve had with the refillable version of these razors is this: I wear glasses and have pretty little spatial awareness in the morning without them on. If I bumped my refillable Schick Hydro Silk in to the shower wall or dropped it, the refillable head would pop off. Not a deal breaker, obviously, as I&#x27;ve kept using them! I can&#x27;t help it; the shave I get with these razors is bar none. But now with these disposables, I get the benefit of a single body piece! As an added bonus, when I travel with these I won&#x27;t have to worry about losing the body...which might have happened more than once with my refillable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a package of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors as a Bzzagent to try out the product. All opinions are my own :)</li>
    <li> Absolute best disposable razor I have ever used. I usually end up with cuts all over my legs after using a disposable, but not with this razor. They&#x27;ve proven to me again why I LOVE the Schick brand :) I was able to try this for free thanks to BzzAgent</li>
    <li> My favorite razor by far! I am able to get an extra close shave, and the razor lasts a good amount of time. I never have to worry about razor burn with this type either!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product as a free sample from BzzAgent thanks to Schick, I was not very impressed with the power of the razor. Since I live in southern U.S., it&#x27;s very important for me to not have stubble and have smooth legs, especially during the summer months. I found with the Hydro Silk Razor that I would have to go back over my legs to get a close shave. It also did not work on my bikini line and it&#x27;s important for me to have one razor that can do it all.  After about a week of use, the razor quality improved (oddly enough). The gooey gel strips that go about the actual razor part needed to be pulled off because they were leaking from their holes. Once I managed to pull all of that off, I got a much better shave with shaving cream.  Since I am an avid shaving cream user, I would probably recommend this razor for people in a hurry (maybe busy moms) or people who just dislike using shaving cream. You&#x27;ll still have to go over it a few times and be careful you don&#x27;t nick yourself, but your legs will be soft because of the included gel.</li>
    <li> I got these razors for free as a sample to try them out, so to say the least I was a little skeptical. Boy was I surprised! These razors are the best! I used to only use Venus razors, but these are seriously a step up. They last longer, they&#x27;re moisturizing, and when you set the razor down on a flat surface, the blades and moisture strip don&#x27;t touch where they&#x27;re resting. The razor engineer who came up with this design is a genius and deserves a medal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same disposable razors for years &amp; was hesitant to try something new. Wow, am I glad I did! These are my new go-to razors. They give an extra close shave due to their 5 Curve Sensing blades, making it so you have to shave less often. They also help get a nice close shave around ankles and knees without knicking the skin. The handle is easy to grip in the shower &amp; is comfortable in your hand. The hydrating strip left my skin feeling silky smooth, even without moisturizer following my shower. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely impressed with my experience with this razor. I&#x27;m a believer and new Schick customer! Thanks for letting me try it for free through BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> Love this razor! Easy to get all the hard to reach places like my knees. Close and smooth shave. Also my legs felt silky smooth all day after my shave. My new favorite razor!!  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I have SUCH a hard time finding disposable razors that do not slice my legs to pieces. I received these razors as a part of BzzKit, free from Schick. The disposable Schick Hydro Silk razors not only did not cut my legs, they left them smoother and moisturized for days after shaving. They work as well, if not better than most expensive razors. I am really sick of spending money on a razor and then having to purchase replacement blades all of the time. These disposable razors are the perfect solution: affordable, work well, and DO NOT leave razor burn or cuts/nicks.</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing! I have never had a closer shave with a disposable razor. I live that there are 5 blades and that my skin is left feeling soft and smooth. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was selected to review this product on BzzAgent. In my opinion this is a great product, I had zero razor burn, and it feels as if the blade is barely there (that&#x27;s a good thing). The moisturizer serum, is great, if you&#x27;re just needing to do a little touch up, you really don&#x27;t need shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I am a disposable razor user exclusively and this one is awesome!! I received this for free through BzzAgent, and this is one of the first ones that I&#x27;ve used that hasn&#x27;t caused me to nick myself, or end up with razor burn in places (thank you curve sensing blades!!). I love how close it shaves and how soft my skin feels afterwards. I normally have dry skin, so it was awesome to have my legs feeling soft and hydrated the next day even!! The handle let slightly odd to me, it didn&#x27;t fit my hand as well as some Schick razors I have tried in the past, but it was still easy to hold. The head of the razor is a great size and easy to use!! I have recommended this razor to many of my friends including my shave-happy sister ;)</li>
    <li> I loved the experience I had with these razors. They offer a smooth and clean shave without nicks and cuts or irritated skin after. I used these to shave all the areas I normally do and had no issues at all. The razors took off the hair with ease, and left the skin feeling soft and smooth. I like the  5 blade option to get as much hair as possible with fewer swipes. I didn&#x27;t have to go back over areas again and again to get all the hair. This works especially well around the knees and ankles, where I normally end up with cuts every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combined these with the shaving gel for those sensitive areas and didn&#x27;t experience any bumps or infected hairs after use. This is a huge plus for bikini lines or keeping that area hair free and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample item, but was not required to leave a review. The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I have never been a major fan of disposable razors.  It felt like i was always getting nics every time I used them.  I recently received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors for free as a promotion from Schick and boy has that changed my mind.  i was sure I was going to hate them but my legs feel amazing and i have no nics!</li>
    <li> I use to get these razors all of the time; they were my favorite. Then money issues made me turn to a cheaper brand. Recently, Schick sent me some of these razors for free as part of a promotional deal, and I feel in love all over again! ;-) These razors are my favorite. Super easy and smooth to use, gets the job done quick just like the intuition blades, but is small and safe to use in bikini area like the venus blades. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a razor. Simply the best! Since trying them for free, I have been back to the stores several times and purchased at full retail price. Let me tell you, the price is worth it. The results from these razors simply can not be beat! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I revived these free for testing from bzzagent but opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these razors. I usually have a hard time with disposable razors because they cause my legs to break out in a rash but not these. These leave me with a close and smooths shave. I really like the moisture strip too. These are great razors!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice and affordable razor.  My legs feels so smooth every time I shave with this 5 blades.  I thought 3 blades were good, but 5 is even better!  I strongly recommend it for you girls out there!  If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I suggest you do!  You can buy it at Walmart for a decent price. #gotitfree #bzzagent #hydrosilkdisposables</li>
    <li> These razors are AMAZING!! My legs have never felt so silky smooth after shaving. When I first passed the razor over my leg, it was so smooth, and soft that I had to check and make sure that I had removed the protective cover. They glide so easily thanks to the 5 blades and the water activated Moisturizing Serum, also best when paired with Skintimate with Moroccan oil shave gel, you&#x27;ll get the best shave ever!! I highly recommend these!! Thanks to Schick and BzzAgent.com, I was able to try them free, and I am in love, I will be buying these from now on!!</li>
    <li> Great razor overall! Gets a really nice close shave and its almost impossible to nick yourself because they are so well lubricated! The head is a bit large if your planning on shaving any hard to reach areas it is substantially bigger than the average disposable.(disclaimer:I got these for free to test out via bzzagent)</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. the shaver gives one of the closest shaves that I have gotten in a very long time. I will purchase this item.The shaver proves for an incredibly smooth silky experience. The feeling after the first shave was what every girl dreams about. I mean I had been raving about the closeness and smoothness of the shave so much that my husband who is bald headed has stopped using his gilette and is now digging into my product which I get angry about every day btw. lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so thankful to have been able to try this product for free #GotItFree ! #HydroSilkDisposables There&#x27;s nothing I like better than a clean close shave that leaves my skin silky smooth and hydrates my body up to 2 hours after the shave! That is awesome! I was beyond satisfied with these razors and will definitely buy them in the future. Way to go Schick for producing so awesome features in a razor.</li>
    <li> I am so lucky to have tried Schick hydro silk disposables, thanks to Schick/BuzzAgent. This is the best razor I have ever used! I have very senstitive skin so I love how the razors have an activated moisturizing serum that hydrates the skin for up to 2 hrs after shaving leaving my skin so silky &amp; smooth! This razor is definitely designed for the curves of a women! The oval cartridges, 5 independent, curve sensing blades &amp; skin guards help you achieve an effective shave &amp; prevent skin irration. (Definitely helps to get in those hard to shave places).  The soft touch, ergonomic handle features multi rubber grips in a ripple pattern for ultimate control while shaving! My legs are left feeling amazing hours after shaving!</li>
    <li> Love this rasor. It&#x27;s easy to use, works great, it gives you that close, smooth shave we all wabnt. Plus it leaves your skin super soft and mmoistured. I got to try these rasors free trough BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> I love these razors they give you such a smooth and close shave!  I love the hydro strip as well, it makes it to where I don&#x27;t have to use shave gel if I don&#x27;t need to. I used these razors and two days later I still felt like I just shaved I loved it!!  This is one of the best disposables I have used, it might be a little more pricey then some but its worth the buy. I used one razor longer then other disposables so in the end it all evens out. The handle is also great and the head works to reach those hard to reach places. I highly recommend this product. Thanks to Schick and Bzz agent I get to try this product for free. All Opinions are 100 percent my own!</li>
    <li> I got these Free Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor from bzzagent and I have try these for almost a month now. These disposable razor does come in a 3 count package and once you use it you just throw them away. I do notice how it does shave well on those hard to reach part of the body and how it leave my legs feeling smooth. These (5) blades are kinda sharp for me and I have to press lightly on my skin so I won&#x27;t accidentally cut myself with these shaver. It does leave my legs feeling a whole lot smoother because of the close shave it give you and it doesn&#x27;t leave my legs feeling dry or itching. Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t leave me any razor bump even though my skin is consider very sensitive. It does have a silicon base on the handle to give you a better grip while holding the shaver. I gave this Disposable Razor a four is because once the blades touch the water it produce a slimy gooey texture on your skin and I know it&#x27;s their Schick hydrate skin serum but it just feel weird. Overall, I do recommend on giving this shaver a try for your own experience. You won&#x27;t know it unless you try&#x27;d it. Right?</li>
    <li> so the schick hydro silk disposables came with shaving cream , and let me tell you it was perfect time , i tried them and they are amazing smooth skin , no scarves no blood , no rash , no redness or anything am really amazed knowing that i have sensitive skin and not a lot of disposables work with  me , am really thankful , and am really going to buy again and again , i told all the people  i know about it , and when i see someone at the durg store or supermarket i tell them to buy  ,because its great and worth the money , my husband knew that i have tried something new , when he saw how happy i am with my skin , and he was happy too.:).my little one also said nice to all the goodies i got , and then after i finished she was like wow mommy nice , and shes only 2 lol</li>
    <li> Overall, I would recommend buying Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor.  I like that this razor has 5 curve sensing blades. It helps me get a close a close shave without my skin feeling irritated.  The design of the razor makes it shave in curved areas, such as your underarms.  I like that this product also has a moisturizing serum built that helps keep my skin moisturized and smooth.  I often experience irritation when shaving and with this razor I don’t experience any irritation.  In addition, I like that the handle is easy to hold and soft.  The color and design of the handle also is trendy and visually appealing. I love the blue color. I am glad I was able to receive this product for free thanks to Schick and Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! I was sent this razor in a sample kit, part of the Bzzagent campaign. This is my review of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor. The razor covers are sturdy, and actually stay on the razor. With each stroke the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor leaves a light layer of moisture on the skin. These razors leave a silky smooth wake in their path! My legs stayed smooth for over 2 days. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> just got my box from #BzzAgent, which included a 3-pack of Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors, a can of Skintimate Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel, an exfoliating bath sponge, and coupons, got here right before I was about to shower. I tried the items out immediately. The disposable razors are quite possibly the best I have ever used! I just love the easy to grip handle and how it bends so it&#x27;s easier to reach all places. I also used the shaving gel which left my skin smooth. The smell was a plus! The sponge was also an awesome bonus. plus my legs where amazling stillsmooth the next day very unusually  Thank you, BzzAgent and Schick! #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposables</li>
    <li> I had the privilege of trying this product out for free thanks to Schick. I have the hardest time finding a razor that actually works. Most of the time I have to settle for men&#x27;s razors because they actually get the job done. I have to say that I was extremely impressed with these razors. I was able to test out the shaving cream with it and it&#x27;s the perfect combo. I cannot find a single hair that I missed and my legs feel so soft. I&#x27;ve never had a razor make my legs feel like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m even impressed with the price which is what usually turns me away from the good razors. It&#x27;s hard for me to give up that much money. 3 razors for this price is great, especially with the coupons that I&#x27;m always finding for Schick brand. Can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of disposable razors, but never before have I had the moisture and softness from a disposable razor like I did with Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables and Skintimate SkinTherapy Shave Gel. The Curve Sensing blades work wonderful on my hard to reach and cut-prone areas, like my knees and ankles. The 5-blade razor gives the most close-cut and smoothest shave I have ever experienced. These blades work so well, I didn&#x27;t realize the razor was even shaving. I ended my shave with the smoothest legs I&#x27;ve had in years and the added bonus was that I didn&#x27;t have a single cut or knick. The razor handle is shaped perfectly for the smoothest shave and the most comfort and the 5 blades create a comfort in shaving I didn&#x27;t know could be possible with a disposable. I didn&#x27;t experience any razor burn or bumps and my legs felt lotion smooth for the entire day. The quality of Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables is not met by any other disposable razor; these are a must-have for  smooth and silky (and well-moisturized) summer legs! This razor has even made me confident enough to wear shorts again (something I haven&#x27;t done in over five years)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a 3 count package of Schick HydroSilk Razors for free from Schick in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for Free as a review Thanks to Schick. These razors are Amazing!!!! The razors that I used before just doesn&#x27;t top this razor. It was easy to shave my legs the hair came right off. My legs were smooth after using these razors. I would recommend these razors for sure. The razor glided on perfectly and I didn&#x27;t cut myself like I have with other razors. Give them a try you won&#x27;t be sorry. Loving my Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor :-) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> These razors have the water activated gel pores around the outside for protecting your delicate parts! I used one razor for a whole body shave you can never do that with a regular disposable razor. Not to mention you almost don&#x27;t need any shaving cream. Schick Hydrosilk is my new razor for sure!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Schick I had the great opportunity to try these and now I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Bzzagent give me a razor to try. Because of how sensitive my skin is and the trouble I was having finding a good razor, it was seeming impossible to find a good razor. I am so thankful that I have it and that I tried it. I have very sensitive skin and have had issues with finding razors that do not cut me and that do not give me horrible razor burn, thee razors have never given me either. I always recommend them to everyone and my 2 daughters use them as well. Am sad that the price is so high for them, but I think that having clean shaved legs that don&#x27;t hurt me is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have never been so crazy about a razor until BzzAgent gave me the opportunity to try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor, and OMG! This razor not only left my legs feeling moisturizer for 16 hours, the shape helped me reach my legs to shave them a lot easier then any other razor! I almost always nick my skin with other razors because I have A hard time reaching my legs but I no longer have to worry with the new Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor! In fact, I really wish I had thesetowards the end of each of my pregnancies! !! Would have been a total life saver! ! I will never buy another kind of razor again!</li>
    <li> I tend to have very very dry skin especially on my legs. I have been using these razors for about a month and I can definitely tell a difference!! My legs stay smoother much longer and more hydrated!! I got this product for free from Schick from BzzAgent but this is my honest opinion review!!</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. I did not get any razor burns or cuts when I used this. I do hate the fact that they are disposable but they are really good. Before using this razor on a really bushy area, you have to cut down the bush first before shaving or the razor will get clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for my review from Schick. #gotitfree #schickhydrodisposables</li>
    <li> These are so hydrating! I received these to review for free but expected them to be no different than every other disposable razor but other than being a little lighter, they look and feel like an actual reusable razor. Love it</li>
    <li> So the first time I used it I used it on my underarms with only the moisture strip on the razor. It did a wonderful job. When I used it on my legs I used the shave gel with it. Had no issues until I got to my knees. I have been using Venus Embrace razors for the most part for about two years now  and have not once cut myself shaving. With this Schick razor I cut myself on my knees. The second time I used the razor I repeated the same process and had the same results, great on my underarms and cut myself with gel on my knees. The third time I used it I used gel on my underarms and my legs. The razor was starting to lose it&#x27;s moisture strip so I played it safe and used the shave gel. Underarms were okay, but this time I just my back of my leg just below the knee so bad I had to have help patching it up. I won&#x27;t even use the rest of the free pack now, which I got thanks to BzzAgent and Schick. I have the ability to sit down comfortably in my main shower to where I do not need to worry about getting access to all my leg which makes shaving way easier. These Schick razors did not have flexible heads nor did they even come close to contouring to my leg. I did not press hard, nor did I go over the same spots over and over, which tend to lead to cuts. I am very unhappy with this razor and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this new razor! This is the only razor so far that has given my legs the closest shave ever. I use to have problems with my shavers because it left my legs with razor bumps and irritated my legs badly that it made my legs itch like crazy.This razor has given me the softest and most hydrated legs in the world. The hydration was so strong that I didn&#x27;t need to put on lotion for the day. The shaver gel matches the water hydration theme the product has. Which is also favorable from this product. This is the definition of a great shaver you can get. I am totally satisfied with this razor and I will recommend to all. If your looking for a shaver that get the closest shave to your legs.Then this is the razor you want to buy. Plus, with benefits of hydrated silky smooth legs.</li>
    <li> I love love love this razor. I received it as a sample for inspection. The closeness of the shave was amazing.  The blades were sharp ,and the head of the blade pivots and it definitely left my legs and under arms feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time I used this nice of a razor; Now I know what I have been missing all of this time. The Shaving cream smelled great and left my legs silky and soft. I will never go back! Thanks BzzAgent for my free sample... I will be a lifetime customer of Schick HydroSilk Razors!</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors for free courtesy of Schick and BzzAgent. This easy to grip razor has 5 blades that provide the closest shave that I have ever seen. I&#x27;ve used similar Venus products that don&#x27;t provide as close of a shave as Schick. I couldn&#x27;t get over how smooth my legs were and I am very impressed with the silky feeling lasting for 12+ hours. I would highly recommend purchasing this razor before summer hits. It is easy to take with you while traveling and disposable, not to mention how great your legs would look on a beach or poolside!</li>
    <li> Long story short: This razor is incredible. I honestly cannot remember a time when my legs have felt this smooth getting out of the shower.  The hydrating gel is incredible, and I still felt its effects the morning after a night time shower. I will be purchasing this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review: This is the nitty-gritty: I have extremely positive thoughts about this product (of which I had not tried before, nor was I too familiar with the brand itself) and a few things that could be improved outlined here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hydro gel is amazing. It not only made my legs feel silky smooth, but it also left a very nice shine on them. Even better, my legs didn&#x27;t feel like they had some filmy sheen on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine that was left after shaving made my legs look GREAT in pictures. The lights reflected off my legs and created a highlighted contrast to everything and gave me great definition - my legs have never looked better in photos. This might be worth considering pointing out on the packaging/advertisements. In an age when we are taking more pictures than ever and posting them on social media, the defining shine makes me look better than any other brand has in the past. It&#x27;s like real life photoshop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were really good. The razor I used to use would give me one or two spots of blood every time I shaved. I nicked myself once in the two months I used the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This left me with less razor burn in sensitive areas. Not obsolete, but much less than my old razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Ehh&amp;#34; (there truly was no &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that when I kept the razor in a dry place, the gel still gave its intended affect for about three weeks. However, if I put the razor back in its plastic head cover, it would remain moist and a lot of the gel would slide right off the next time I hopped in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big circle above the razor (where I suppose your thumb is supposed to go) has never made any sense to me, personally. I shave with my pointer fingers on top to guide and my thumb on the bottom of the razor stick for stability. Maybe this is just me!</li>
    <li> I am glad I got to try Schick Hydro Silk Disposables. I personally an not a fan of disposable razors for environmental reasons, but I must say that I really liked this razor. I am one that shaves everyday both legs and underarms. In using this razor I noticed that I could get away with shaving my legs every other day so it was great for days I was on the go. I loved how long the blades stay sharp too. The good thing about this razor is that it has water activated moisture. That really helped the razor glide smoothly which makes shaving a lot quicker and the moisture strip moisturizes my legs. It really is a great razor and only am giving it 4 stars because the whole razor has to be disposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got to try this product for free thanks to Schick</li>
    <li> Just used this razor and I love it! Most of the time I am in such a hurry I cut myself (I have a newborn) but with this razor it is so smooth and easy to use I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this razor!! I received them free for review from bzzagent and they are magical! Im not a fan of disposable razors, especially for women. I feel they are never sharp enough BUT these razors are a game changer! The 5 blades make for super, super smooth shave! Your legs are crazy smooth and silky hours after and the awesome grip handle will make sure it never slips out of your hand!</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a gift from Influenster, and now I&#x27;m sold! I still get a super close shave, while the beads moisturize my skin. No more irritation! I love how the moisture beads last for so many shaves. These are my go-to razors from now on!</li>
    <li> This Schick Hydro silk razor is light weight and good enough for eyes to see the style. The shave head is good enough to shave at all angels. And because of its 5 curve sensing blades, it gave smooth shave. Also the serum is long lasting, that was really impressive because generally it would have expected for good through 1 to 2 shaves and then either change razor or use without serum. I am a Gillete Razor  lover. I have used mostly Venus spa razors which are great for me always. I had used Schick razors 2 years back. Now I again gave a chance to Schick Razor because of Bzzagent campaign where I get it free and this one fulfill my requirements very well. This is a good disposal razor for on the Go and trips.</li>
    <li> i love this product :)</li>
    <li> Silky Smooth :) I got this product  to try for free during a campaign by Bzz Agent.This is such a wonderful product. I have been using Schick prodcts on &amp; off but this one by far is their best! Makes shaving so effortless &amp; fun. The skintimate shaving gel makes the blades just glide &amp; I was able to do my legs in 5 min without any irritation.The handle is of soft rubber  with multiple grips for ultimate control. The blades are designed to shave closely &amp; are infused with marine extracts, probably the reason you get so silky smooth legs,even I couldn&#x27;t stop admiring my legs ;) Thanks Bzz agent for sending this campaign my way! Schick now you are a keeper too!!</li>
    <li> This thing is so amazing! I was lucky enough to test this product for free thanks to Schick! I could not be happier with this razor. This is hands down the best disposable razor I have used, EVER!</li>
    <li> I really liked the razor. I got a sample from Bzzagent to try and used it in the shower that evening. The handle is shaped well and fit comfortably in my hand, and the cartridge was big enough where I didn&#x27;t need to go over the same areas repeatedly. I didn&#x27;t get any nicks- the head swiveled over my knees and ankles without an issue. The five blades kept things smooth, and I haven&#x27;t needed to shave in a few days.</li>
    <li> I got this product a few weeks ago though bzzagent, a company that sends me products to try and leave reviews. I have tried Schik razors before on my own, but never this one. I typically do not use shaving cream but my trial came with it. When I used both of them together it was an awesome duo! In the past I have had issues with &amp;#34;infected folliculitis&amp;#34; (basically&lt;br /&gt;Ingrown hairs mixed with razor burn). Since starting using this product, I have not had any problems!&lt;br /&gt;In efforts to truly try the razor on its own, I tried it by lathering my legs up really good with soap and water like I usually do (hey, I&#x27;m really lazy). I was not overly impressed. It was good, but honestly I think that it was not much different than their other razors. It is a great duo of you use it with the shaving cream, and I would recommend it over many others, but as far as recommending it over Schiks other products? I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Schiks razors in general, and this is an excellent option!</li>
    <li> Great Value!  Moisturizing!  Hydrating! Schick is an awesome brand. My  Fav!!</li>
    <li> I love the gel bar because I hate using shaving cream. This razor gave me a really close shave and left my legs so soft and silky smooth. PS- my husband loves it too! Thanks to Schick for giving me a free razor to try out!</li>
    <li> I really love the design of this razor. The way the cartridge stays in places and moves is amazing. It left my legs feeling smooth and silky. It made it alot easier to reach the places that other razors normally miss. I got to try this for free thanks to Schick!! I definitely have a new favorite razor now</li>
    <li> These are the best razors ever! I can&#x27;t wait to use my coupons and buy a ton of the razors. They kept my legs smooth and had a good, close shave, unlike many other razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. I hope the price is reasonable so I can continue buying them after my coupons run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not one to use disposables because I seem to always end up with razor burned legs and small cuts. I received these Schick Hydro Disposables from BzzAgent for free and gave them a try. These are fantastic! They perform just as good, if not better, than a reusable razor. This razor left my legs with a long lasting smoothness, a close shave and no cuts or burns! These are perfect for summer and such a great price! My new favorite razors!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so I am very careful about the razors that I use.  I was pretty confident that this razor would give me the results I was looking for and I was NOT disappointed.  It was really gentle on my skin and the razor head was much more flexible than I realized.  I was left with super soft skin and a husband who couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off my legs!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin and is looking for a super close shave.</li>
    <li> I got these razors in the mail for free to try and I love them!  Best razors ever, my new all time favorite. They leave your skin feeling like silk</li>
    <li> I received a free 3-pack of Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors as a promotion from the company to test the product and review it. I have never tried this product before and was quite anxious to see how the razors actually stood up to other disposables I have tried. I get frustrated when I buy razors and they get dull after a couple of shaves. This razor was not like others I have tried. The grip made it easy to hold on to in the shower - it did not get slippery and continuously fall like others I have used. The closeness of the shave was the best part. My legs felt soft and smooth afterward and the close shaved left my legs smoother, longer. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy, close shave. I have recommended to several of my friends already and cannot wait to hear what they have to say. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;f a fan of this razor. I felt like I had to go over the same area of skin again and again, and because of all of the blades, my underarms were all irritated and cut up afterwards. I think I&#x27;ll stick to a cheapo razor with fewer blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive theis product for free thanks to Schick and bzzagent, but the review is my own.</li>
    <li> I love the product so much ever since i got from a campaign. No irritate since the day i been using. Leaving my skin so silky smooth and hydrate for a week.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors to review the product from the brand. I found that they are much better than other disposable razors and are more comfortable to shave with. I really dislike getting nicks and cuts from shaving and I didn&#x27;t have that happen with these. The razor seemed to move flexibly and it lasted longer than I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> So I got these razors for free as a part of a promotion.  I got them a few days before I gave birth.  I finally decided to use the razor 5 days postpartum.  They left my skin feeling smooth, I had no cuts (unlike with other disposables I had used), and they were really gentle with my sensitive areas.  I was really hesistant to use them at first, especially since I was worried about how my body would react after giving birth, but everything went smoothly.  Hands down these are the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The new Schick hydro silk razors are amazing!! They have an water-activated moisturizing serum that hydrates your skin for up to 2 hours after shaving. After using the razors my legs definitely felt silky and smooth. Also because of the 5 blades you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area more than once therefore no skin irritation! Join me at Bzz agent and you too could try out products for free!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a promo along with some coupons for discounts on future razor purchases provided via a program run by Schick® Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care®. I am truly amazed at how well it actually works! I like to shave every day and that can be very harsh on my skin. Especially on my bikini area. So far I have used this razor for two days in a row with now breakouts or bumps. That is a first for me. I am very impressed at how moisturizing it actually felt while shaving with it. You can feel the shea butter on it which is impressive compared to other razors. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I was really not terribly impressed with this product. I received a three pack of these razors as a free sample, and I&#x27;m pretty glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on them. (And let me tell you, in store these razors are WAY over priced). They did make shaving a bit easier, the 5 blades managed to catch all of the little hairs that I normally would have missed. As advertised, it was a closer and smoother shave. That being said, there were a lot of issues I had with this product. The first was the hydrating strips. They worked better than most I&#x27;ve seen, but they also gooped up the blades on the razor. I nicked myself with the razor, which I haven&#x27;t done in years, and I&#x27;m pretty sure this was the reason why. While the grip on the handle was comfortable, it was also bulky, which isn&#x27;t the greatest. Overall, it was an okay product. But I don&#x27;t think I would spend so much on a disposable razor that didn&#x27;t blow me away.</li>
    <li> I was able to sample these through bzz agent as part of a promo. I really like the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor. First, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a standard disposable razor with its very chic looking design. I actual like the way the handle and blade are made (easy to grip and flexible) and the color is awesome too. The hydrating strip is definitely better than the one on the Schick Quattro razors. It left my legs super silky smooth for about 2 days. Adding lotion definitely helps it last longer. The razors last about 2-4 shaves depending on what areas you are shaving and the coarseness of the hair. I didn&#x27;t cut myself like with other cheaply made razors so that definitely was a plus. The 5 blades allowed for a close shave which was also good. I would definitely recommend giving these razors a try.</li>
    <li> They hydrate like woah. The razor’s water-activated moisturizing serum helps give back moisture for up to 2 hours after shaving. Hypoallergenic and dermatologist-tested, it’s made with marine extracts and shea butter to leave your skin silky smooth They’re designed for the curves of a woman’s body. Each Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razor has contoured oval cartridges, 5 independent, Curve Sensing® blades and skin guards to help you achieve an efficient shave and prevent skin irritation They’re easy to handle. The soft-touch, ergonomic handle features multiple rubber grips in a ripple pattern for ultimate control while shaving They’re made for on-the-go use. You can bring this razor with you while traveling or for a quick touch-up at the gym They’re affordable. Look for 3-packs of these disposables razors at grocery stores, drug stores and mass retailers for an average price of $11.99 Plus, if you’re tired of unsticking your razor from random surfaces every time you shave, you’ll love this disposable razor’s unique, raised handle rest! It’ll keep your razor cartridges out of water and intact for a premium shave. I received this as part of a a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> This is the first disposable razor I feel can do the job! I was able to get areas of my legs that not other disposable razor has been able to do! Schick continues to prove they have what it takes to make one of the best razors on the market. I cannot wait to take these with me to the beach! I will not be worried about stray hairs that I missed and could not get with any other disposable razors. Just be careful; it&#x27;s a very close shave! I have cut myself a few times, but it&#x27;s worth it for a great shave!</li>
    <li> I love the razors. Only razors i wil use now they make your skin so smooth.  I receiced the product to try out from bzzagent!</li>
    <li> You will get bumps and razor burn if you do not moisturize beforehand. Other than that the razors work as expected.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free promo from bzzagent and Schick. I really enjoyed this razor. The handle has a great design and I have a comfortable grip when Im using it in the shower. The razor head is larger enough to cover an adequate area but still the right size to keep maneuverability in check. The series of blades gets an ultra close shave. I had no razor cuts or razor burn afterwards. The added skin protection in the razor provided extra hydration and I noticed less dry or rough areas after the first shave. I really enjoyed using this product and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> I have found over the years I really hate disposable razors. I have become very brand loyal to one specific brand that I consider to be the best. It is rather expensive though. Anyway I was invited by BzzAgent and Schick to try Schick Hydro Silk Disposables along with Skintimate shaving cream. I figured why not try it. I was amazed! For a disposable razor these things are awesome. They have two large moisture strips and more than two blades. I got a close shave, smooth legs and combined with the shaving cream I got a longer lasting smooth feeling. If you think there is only one brand you like I would strongly recommend opening up and trying this product out. You might just save some money and find a new favorite!</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors free to try from BzzAgent. I have tried Schick razors before and have not been impressed. Much to my surprise these are by far better than any razor Schick or not that I have tried. Considering they are disposable they last for several shaves and give a close smooth shave every time. These are my absolute favorite razor now. I truly hate to use anything else.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try for free in the mail and I was  interested in it because of the handle design, number of blades, and the fact that it was reported to leave my legs feeling moisturized without actually putting on lotion. I usually buy whatever razor is the least expensive (however, never the 2 blade cheapie). I figured that this razor would be about the same as the rest but I gave it a shot, it was free right?  I couldn&#x27;t believe how WONDERFUL this razor was.  It had a nice handle that allowed me to grip it tightly, even when I was at difficult angles for those hard to reach spots.  It cut close, but didn&#x27;t nick and it DID LEAVE my legs feeling silky.  That is what shocked me the most.  I thought this was a gimmick but it really did work.  Very awesome razor and I no longer hold the terrible idea that all razors are created equal because they are definitely not!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Venus razors for ten years before I was offered to try Schick Disposable Razors (thank you BZZ Agent and Schick!!). I had no intention to switch to another brand but I decided to give it a try. And I did not regret it. I have a one year old baby who is very active and takes all my time. My husband works so I usually with my girl by myself. I never have time to take a long shower. That is why I rarely use the shaving cream. After using Venus razors I always had irritations. It was very annoying and they hurt. With Schick disposable razors I forgot about any irritations completely.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the close shave, Schick is again much better than Venus. They have contoured oval cartridges that help you reach the places like underarms, ankles and knees.  The handle is very soft and easy to grip. Someone earlier said that they had too much of a moister. I don&#x27;t think there is such a thing as too much of a moister when it comes to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with them was that after shaving my underarms I could still see black dots. But that’s the problem with any razor. If you want to avoid them, use an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely satisfied with them and plan on using them in the future.</li>
    <li> I recently got to try out the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors thanks to BzzAgent/Schick and they are wonderful. To give accurate info I wanted to use the razor several times before reviewing. So after my several uses (used in conjunction with Skintimate Lotionized shave gel) I would like to say that I found the same comfort the tenth time as I did the first time using these razors. I am a person that must shave daily or face Sasquatch type furry legs.  Shaving so often used to leave my legs dry and uncomfortable due to razor rash and nicks. Now I do not have that problem thanks to the contour shape, which feels a little weird at first, the five blades with skin guards and the moisturizing serum. My legs are no longer irritated after shaving, they are smooth and look better now that I do not have nicks all over. I checked the cost of these razors and found they do cost a bit more than other razors, but are well worth the cost. I would definitely purchase these razors for future use.</li>
    <li> These razors are nothing like anything I have ever tried before I did receive these for free from buzzagent but that has nothing to do with how great a razor these are, my legs have never before felt so nice I usually get red bumps after shaving and maybe a spot of blood and forget putting lotion on after it hurts my legs so bad its unreal but wow there is no reason to even use lotion these babies leave your legs supper soft and I had no bumps not even one!!!</li>
    <li> As a member of BzzAgent.com, I received a 3 pack of Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors in the mail to test. Let me just say, this is one of the BEST disposable razors I have EVER used. I shave every time I shower, and one razor has already lasted me a month! I get a close shave, and it really does moisturize my skin, which tends to get extremely dry after I shave. I have recommended this razor to friends and hope they try it as well! I think this is the brand I am sticking with from now on. It truly is a great product.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product free thanks to Schick and BzzAgent. I usually use razors that are targeted to males because they seem more durable. However, these feel durable but also comfortable to shave with. I like how it&#x27;s not like a typical razor and has 5 blades. Something else that I liked about this is that it&#x27;s actually moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling irritated. I hate when razors give razor burns, luckily this one didn&#x27;t. The fact that it comes as a 3 pack is convenient.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be chosen for this bzz mission!  When I got the kit, I immediately got ready to take a shower and shave to test out the razor.  I was stoked to see that it included the shaving cream.  The razor was nice and close to my skin, without any cuts, and using the shaving cream helped to keep my legs moisturized for days! #IGotItFree</li>
    <li> Heard so many good reviews that I was really excited to try them. I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for free by Bzzagent to try at home. Turns out it didn&#x27;t deliver a close shave like I thought they would and I got a lot of cuts on my legs.</li>
    <li> As a mother of two little girls under 4 taking a shower longer than 10 minutes is a rarity. When I do get to shave my legs it is usually a quick act. Thanks for Schick for letting me try their Hydro Silk disposable razors for free. The razors shaving my legs and arm pits so much easier. I have used lots of different disposable razors, usually whatever I can get the best deal on with sales and coupons, with that being said I would pay full price for these.  The hydro serum leaves my legs feeling moisturized so I can skip applying lotion afterwards. No more itchy legs!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I received this free from the brand to try. The handle is the best I&#x27;ve ever held and doesn&#x27;t feel like a disposable. I like how light it is, however the material doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Also the blade is better than the blades I buy to replace on my regular razor. Over all perfect razor. I am switching to these disposables for my every day shaving needs!</li>
    <li> First off- WOW! I normally dislike disposable razors because I feel they are made cheaply and don&#x27;t last. But these changed my mind for sure! Thanks to Shick I was able to try this product for free so I can give my honest feedback. They make my legs feel soft for hours after I&#x27;ve shaved, even if I&#x27;ve forgotten to put on lotion. All thanks for that goes to the water activated hydration strips... which is a great addition to make these stand out from the rest. My favorite thing about these though is the 5 curve sensing blades in the oval cartridge. The oval shape makes it easy for the blades to go around my knees and even behind them, which is amazing! The curve sensing technology is a magic worker; They give a close shave without leaving cuts or stubble. I would absolutely recommend these razors to anyone looking for an incredible product at a good price!</li>
    <li> This razor really does what it says.  It delivers a close shave without leaving razor burn and dry skin behind.  There isn&#x27;t really a need to apply cream after shaving.  I love this product.  I was lucky enough to receive these razors for free to review courtesy of BzzAgent and Schick.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of the Schick Hydro Silk, so I was ecstatic to try this for free thanks to Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. The best disposable I&#x27;ve ever used. Silky smooth, moisturizing, and long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for vacations, the gym, and anywhere else you don&#x27;t want to risk losing your expensive cartridges.</li>
    <li> I did like this razor. It is hard to me to find a good razor because I have dry and sensitive skin, but this one is amazing. It really moisture my skin and my legs look and feel very soft. You just need to be careful at first with the blades (5 of them, ouch!) but when you finally know how to handle the razor you&#x27;re going to love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a 3-pack of this razor as part of a promotion from schick, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am forever buying new disposable razors.  I never stick to the same brand, but I think that these razors may have changed my mind! My legs felt great after using them.  And they seemed to stay smoother longer than normal.  I have dark leg hair and so I am very self conscious about wearing shorts and skirts.  I really felt like I got a super close shave with these razors. My only complaint was that the next day after using the razor it seemed the moisture bar in the razor head was leaching out of the bottom.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was just a fluke because I haven&#x27;t needed to replace the razor yet.  This did not change the effectiveness of the razor though. I love them and will be purchasing in the future! Thanks to Schick for letting me try out these awesome razors!</li>
    <li> These are awesome. The absolute best razor I&#x27;ve used. I received these free from the brand in order to form a valid opinion of the razors. I highly recommend these to use and am a firm believer that these are absolutely the best out there.</li>
    <li> I was sent this razor and Schick shaving cream for testing purposes from BzzAgent. I was really impressed with these products together they gave me a super close shave. This is a pack of three disposable razors with serum to moisturizer your legs. This would leave my legs smooth for about two days which is a little longer than average. These are worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am so happy and lucky that I was chosen through Bzzagent to test Schick&#x27;s new Hydro Silk razors for free (thanks Schick!). I have used many different brands of disposable and non disposable razors in the past and this razor does just as good of a job as a non disposable razor. I always ended up going back to a non disposable mans razor which I found to do a better job....until now! The shave is not painful as some disposable razors are, thanks to the 5 curve sensing blades with skin guards. 5 blades- WOW!  The razor definitely shaves those hard to reach places with ease because of the contoured oval cartridges and I have yet to get any irritation as some disposable razors leave you with. I even tested not putting lotion on after my shower which is my normal routine, and hours later my legs still felt smooth and hydrated. I was definitely impressed and will absolutely buy these razors again. It has been almost 3 weeks since I have started using the razor and I still am getting a nice close smooth shave. Most other disposable razors don&#x27;t last nearly as long! Great product Schick! I urge you to try it!</li>
    <li> Yes honey  i recently got this product for  free for testing  and give my honest opion Love  My  Schick Hydro Silk Disposables razors and how well it moisturize my legs and it has smooth blades to get the job done I highly recommend this  razor it is good quality  and  great for travel and leaving at your honey house just if you need to touch up i have told all my family  friends  how well this product  works.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1LBDHN9BJ5JKU]]I really didn&#x27;t like this razor. Every time I shaved my head with it, I had to get another razor to finish the job. I think they tried to make this be too much like the Mach 3 razor, because it has a monstrous, bulbous head that makes it impossible to do any detail work. The blades are way too close together, too. This makes it really hard to shave a thick beard. So, definitely pass on this if your beard or leg hairs have any thickness to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Looks expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Only good for flat surfaces&lt;br /&gt;-Only good for fine, wispy hair&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are too close together, so they don&#x27;t cut hair very well&lt;br /&gt;-Does a horrible job with corners and tight edges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 19-JUN-2014**&lt;br /&gt;I just found out that this is a razor for women, so I&#x27;m changing my rating from a 1-star review to a 2-star review. If you don&#x27;t have much leg hair, then this razor will probably work just fine for you. However, if your leg hair is as thick as my beard, then you definitely want to pick another product! I&#x27;m also keeping my rating low, because there&#x27;s nothing on the front of the packaging (I actually didn&#x27;t read the back, so it might be on the fine print) that indicates that it won&#x27;t work well on a tough beard. But, even if you have thin hair, I still recommend a nice razor. The [[ASIN:B001ECQ3SG Schick Xtreme3]], also by Schick and also for women has none of the problems that this razor does.</li>
    <li> I got this product with BZZAGENT and really like it. The products 5 razors are very effective at getting a close shave and feeling comfortable against the skin. The shave is excellent and really allows for smooth legs that last for days. This product is much better than other ones I have tried and really distinguishes itself by giving a close shave.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors i got to try these for free from Bzz Agent i love them they leave a close shave and don&#x27;t cut up my legs like other razors</li>
    <li> Usually I don&#x27;t review products too often unless they&#x27;re top notch. As you see here, I&#x27;m writing a review so obviously I think very highly of these razors. Almost 99% of the time when I shave, I always cut myself. Whether it&#x27;s knee, ankle, or anywhere else, I always manage to draw blood from myself. With this razor, I have not cut myself and I&#x27;ve used them five times since I&#x27;ve had them. I know Schick is quite a reliable and known brand so that made me even more excited to try these. My legs feel absolutely great after shaving and the five blades on each razor is also really great! Sometimes my hairs can be stubborn, yet they&#x27;re no match for these razors. My legs are also pretty sensitive to the razors that I use but I found that these Schick Hydro Silk razors do not irritate my skin, which is another bonus! I&#x27;d highly recommend these razors to anyone who wants a great shave for their money! And what makes this even better? Thanks to BzzAgent and Schick partnering, I got an entire package of these razors and coupons to share with friends for FREE! Score!</li>
    <li> Good razor! It seriously does give a ridiculously close shave. The moisture bars were literally dripping shave gel, they are the real deal. The only downside is the price, hence the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I was given a chance to try these razors for free from Schick. I was pleasantly surprised by how well they protected me from nicks and cuts. I felt that they gave me a close, smooth shave, too. I like the moisturizing strip and felt that it lasted a good amount of time. These razor blades seem to dull just slightly faster than the other brand I am used to using, but overall, I was happy with the close shave I got. The moisturizing strip did help leave my legs feeling extra smooth, even after rinsing it off. I would recommend that you give these a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few razors over the years in my quest to find something that left my sensitive skin both smooth and irritation free.  I must say the new Shick Hydro Silk is a game changer.  Due to my sensitivities I can&#x27;t use most shaving creams or gels... But with this product even my usual hypoallergenic soap is unnecessary.  The aloe edges seem to be just that... Not full of chemicals or scents.  I am definitely sold on the brand.  I&#x27;m telling all my friends about the smoothest shave yet! Thanks shick and bzz agent for introducing me to this great product for review and word of mouth campaign purposes.</li>
    <li> I received a free three pack of these razors through BzzAgent. I have come to LOVE these razors for all of my shaving needs! I&#x27;ve found that they do work effectively in those hard to reach places, and I get a nice clean, smooth shave on my legs. I also love the fact that the razor handle is designed to keep the blades up when you lay the razor down. This helps is dry out and stay dry so the blades last longer than any other disposable I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;d give them 6 stars if I could! I have officially switched, making the Schick Hydro Silk disposables part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I tried the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors and at first I hated them. They have a water-activated moisturizing serum that is supposed to hydrate your skin. When I first used them I didn&#x27;t like them because the moisturizing serum made a goop on my legs that was so gross and hard to wash off. I was using the razor with soap though. I found later that if I used the razor with shaving cream it helped to keep the thick goop down some. I do like how smooth my legs are when I use the razor. I don&#x27;t know that I would purchase this razor knowing what I do about the moisturizing serum. The longer the razor sat in the shower the moisturizing serum oozed out and left a thick goop hanging out of the razor. You have to be careful how you leave the razor sitting or it will leak out. I also don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this razor to someone. I liked the way the way the razor felt in my hand and I never cut myself shaving so those were a plus. Like I said, after I started using the razor with shaving cream I noticed a difference in the goopiness of the moisturizing serum. The serum did help to keep my legs soft and smooth. I did receive this product free as a part of a promotional campaign.</li>
    <li> Does this do the job?  Yes. Does it do it nicely?  Yup.  I like the grip on the razor.  It makes getting those hard to reach spots like around your knees easier than your basic cheapy razor.  The moisturizing strip is a nice addition but I don&#x27;t really feel like it makes it that much better.  These will be good for travel but I&#x27;ll stick with my reusable razor with replaceable blades for home so there&#x27;s less packaging and trash when a blade gets dull.  **I received a free package of these as part of a review group**</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of razors in my time especially disposable razors. I liked the Schick Hydro Silk Razor over your average &amp;#34;use a few times and toss&amp;#34; razors. I will disclose that I was able to try these free as BzzAgent first but bought another pack after.  A few of the reasons I like the razors are because it has a gel like substance at the head of the razor. It helped with shaving and wasn&#x27;t extra gooey like a lot of other similar razors can be. I also liked the shape of the handle. It was easy to grip in the shower and wasn&#x27;t too small nor overly large. The razor head was easy to change. Although I was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Razor at a discount I believe they are priced well for the product you receive. I saw the razors at my local retailer for less than 12 bucks. That included 3 razor heads and the razor itself. I will definitely be buying these again in the future and the leaving the &amp;#34;use twice and done versions&amp;#34; to the side. The one down fall I had from these were that my legs didn&#x27;t feel moisturized after. I think some of that has to do with the fact that my legs have been in hiding over the winter months. My legs didn&#x27;t feel completely dry but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say not to use lotion or oil after you shave.  #GotItFree #GotACoupon</li>
    <li> I got these 3 count Schick Hydro Silk Disposable from BzzAgent for testing and review purposes. One of the first things I noticed was how well the grip on the handle was. I was able to hold it while shaving and never slip while using it. I also like how the blades glided over my legs, and did not cut me. Even though they are disposables I did use the same one a few times, and they still do the job as if I used it for the first time. I used it with and without shaving gel and it still did the trick.</li>
    <li> As a petite woman, I have small hands. Small hands that struggle in a bigger handed world. Not so with the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor which is curved in a cool way that actually fits my hands. Better fit &#x3D; better grip &#x3D; less cuts and skin irritation (since I&#x27;m also not shaving over the same area to get everything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the water-activated serum that actually gives back moisture with every stroke of the razor. I still recommend moisturizing after shaving, but it&#x27;s a nice added softness for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I received a sample of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor, but my opinions are entirely my own. I have already gone out and spent money buying the razors for my family because that&#x27;s how great I think they are for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I received these silky awesomess hydro disposable razors for free as a bzz agent. They were free for me but I am going to add them to my cart! I loved them. It never fails if I don&#x27;t use cream I get razor burn and bumpy skin. You can definitely get away with a few shaves without cream or gel. The activated serum seriously feels like silk. I was way pleased with the handle as well. It is just as nice if not better than some of the more expensive brands. Totally worth the money. They say disposable but I have been able to get several uses out of them. Even more uses than othe razors I have used in the past disposable or otherwise. With five blades you don&#x27;t need toss as soon. I almost forgot to mention how cool it is that the head is designed to not stick to the shower when rested. You can set it down and not lose all the serum to the shower shelf when you need it the next time. It keeps the blades raised. Supposed to be hype free but I can&#x27;t help it they are a breakthrough for me!</li>
    <li> Seriously, shaving with this razor is rather like a cow blew snot all over my razor and then I decided to go into the shower and use it anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;water activated moisturizing serum\\&quot; is gooey and slimey.&lt;br /&gt;However, that being said, I actually do have very smooth legs and have not cut myself at all since switching to the cow snot razor.&lt;br /&gt;So, thats why, despite the gross factor, I still gave this product 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I truly love my Schick Hydro Silk Disposables Razor that I got for free from Bzzagent and Schick. It has an amazing handle that it super easy to grip into and it keep my skin so smooth and moisturized. A perfect razor for my sensitive skin and so pleased with the results. I also love the idea that they&#x27;re made for on-the-go use which makes it easier to carry around. I also think that the price is very affordable for such a great product. It keep my skin so smooth ang hydrate for libg time, which I truly loved. My overall experience with the product is truly amazing. I highly recommend this product to my family and friends, and definitely will continue using Shick Hydro Silk razor.</li>
    <li> I got this item as a freebie from Schick. These razors have a comfortable grip and super sharp curve sensing blades that get an extremely close shave and take a lot longer than other razors to go dull. Their Hydro Silk Technology feature leaves my legs feeling better than any shave before. No complaints here. I am super happy!</li>
    <li> *I tried this product for free thanks to Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this razor! :) I usually use a men&#x27;s razor for shaving my legs &amp; underarms because I loved the close shave from 5 blades. Happy to know there is a women&#x27;s version that actually works just as well! It was light and had a uniquely shaped handle that really helped the shaving process. I liked that the moisturizing strip wasn&#x27;t too wide or big that it hindered shaving hollow, curved areas like armpits. I was in a hurry when I tried this to keep my shower time at a minimum and still I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or scrapes. Shaving over my knees was a breeze! I would buy this and definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> These razors look amazing, they feel pretty good in your hand and don&#x27;t slip when wet. That is all the good things I can say about them. This is the first time in a long time I have cut myself shaving. The 5 blades seemed like a great idea but it made the head really hard to maneuver on curved parts of the body ( underarms,back of the knees).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the tag line being &amp;#34;how easy is is to shave the hard to reach places&amp;#34; I have to call this a huge fail on Schicks part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not use again.&lt;br /&gt;Got this item free from a promotion from Shick</li>
    <li> I was asked to try out Schick Hydro Silk Disposables. I received the product for free, along with shaving cream and a loofah, to test out. The razors are available at Target and other retailers for $9.99 for a package of 3 razors. I was very disappointed with the razors. The price is way too high for disposable razors and the shave is not very close. I tried the razors with the shaving cream and with regular soap and neither way gets you the best shave possible. I am willing to shell out another $10 to get a better shave with my Gillette razors. My friends agreed that the price was way too high, especially for something that doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
    <li> I was able to sample these for free through the brand, and I am overall glad I was given the opportunity. They work great for a disposable razor. I am going on 3 weeks on the same razor, and it has not dulled at all yet. I like that there are 5 blades, and it gives a very close shave. The handle is comfortable to use, and it reaches those hard to reach areas with ease. That being said, the moisture dots are a great concept, but do not quite deliver on my expectations. I have used this razor both with and without shaving gel, and I have always had to apply lotion to my legs afterwards. I could definitely feel the stinging and itching of razor burn. They are great as a disposable, but I won&#x27;t be replacing my refillable razor any time soon.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the Hydro Silk, and I have to say, I am very impressed. There are many pros I can give this razor, but there are some cons :( I&#x27;ll start with the good things!  Pros: *I love the two moisturizing strips lining the top and bottom of the blades. It makes it feel even safer  because in addition to my shaving cream; the strips feel somewhat lubricated, so I feel like I have shaving cream protecting me as well as the moisturizing &amp;#34;lubricant&amp;#34; (I really don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s lubricant lol. it feels like it) *the razor head bends very nicely and it reflexes as well, so I feel like it follows the shape of my legs and underarms when I shave. That is very nice because I don&#x27;t have to angle my shaving arm into any weird or uncomfortable position *I don&#x27;t think my skin is sensitive or anything, but I feel so safe using this razor :) And the razor shaves so close to my skin. My legs feel like a baby&#x27;s bum after I shave. I love the smoothness so much I cant stop stroking it the first time. *It&#x27;s five blades!! Yay! I don&#x27;t notice a difference between this new 5 blades than the regular 4 blades I use, but this must be better, because... 5&amp;#62;4  Now onto cons :( *I use this razor every two days for 1 and a half week, and the moisturizing trips are gone :( Now there are just dents are there...so there is quite a short life span for the hydro silk *it didn&#x27;t come with a head protector *had so go over the some of the skin a few times so get rid of all the hair. however, this may have been due to an overlather of shaving cream  All in all, the cons aren&#x27;t that distracting compared to the experience I&#x27;m  getting from the razor. And the best thing? The box came with three razors!! Yay! Many thanks to Schick for sending the product for me to try. But don&#x27;t worry! All opinions are 100% my own. You can trust me ;)</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try this product for free from Schick. I LOVE these razors. They&#x27;re so smooth and you really don&#x27;t need shaving cream with them at all. I would highly recommend these to everyone.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this product that I received for free thanks to Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors left me with a close shave and soft legs. I found that these lasted A LOT longer than my other razors do in the shower. What I liked most about this product was the water-activated moisturizing serum. Although it did feel more on the goey side, it left my legs feeling incredible and it helped the razor move along nicely. I did end up cutting myself twice which rarely ever happens even with the cheapo razors I use. Not sure if the razor is to blame or me.</li>
    <li> I absoultly love these razors, with the water activated techonology, keeps my skin baby smooth. It moisturizes my skin for days. I couldnt expect anything better from a disposable razor, plus it goes great with the Schick silk gel shaving cream. I will have to have these stocked up in my medicine cabinet. There isnt a better disbosable razor I havet tried in years that compares to this.</li>
    <li> Great razors for a disposable!  They work great and give you a close shave.  It also has 5 blades to help get closer and it has moisturizer serum to help keep your skin smooth with out having to use soap or shaving creams.  I would definitively be buying these again. The handle on the eazor is also easy to grip and hold so no dropping!  I received these to try from shick completely free!</li>
    <li> I got this about a month ago, before using this product I was using razors for men because of the closeness of the blade, But after using this product I&#x27;m never going back! My skin stays smooth and soft! I love this product and definitely recommend to all ladies!!</li>
    <li> I received these through bzzagent Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables. I absolutely love these razors. They are sharp and you can for sure feel the closeness of the shave. The grip is very comfortable and sturdy. I totally recommend these for travel. My only con is they are disposable so in my opinion they don&#x27;t last as long. The price is decent and you can find them pretty much at every local store.#GotItFree</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk is easily one of my most razors now. It gets such a close shave that I&#x27;m no longer needing to shave daily or every other day. That freshly shaved feeling seems to last forever! I also really like how when the razor is laying down, the blades don&#x27;t actually touch anything. It helps it dry faster and the blades last longer because they aren&#x27;t getting rusty from sitting in water. And yes I like to make my razors last as long as possible so I love love love this feature. They&#x27;re also very reasonably priced and last longer than the cheap disposables that you have to constantly replace. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from BzzAgent Schick Hyro Silk Disposable Razor is great. It really does help keeps your legs soft for hours.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. They leave my skin soft, smooth and moisturized. Im happy i would definately purchase again.</li>
    <li> I got to try the razors for free thanks to Schick! I loved the closeness of the shave, especially around those hard to reach places! I would also like to point out I have yet to nick myself with this razor-which is a big accomplishment for me and this razor! I always buy disposable razors for the cost, so it was great to find a quality disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Beyond happy with these razors. I was lucky enough to get to sample these for free from a company. I had been living with the feeling that razors were razors and they all pretty much had the same job which was to remove my unwanted hair. I was so wring. I feel like this brand goes above and beyond a normal razor. My legs are so smooth and stubble free. I am just so happy and would most definitely encourage you to give it a try.</li>
    <li> wife loves them.  no longer steals mine!</li>
    <li> So hard to find a good razor. I&#x27;ve been using this and it works great!! Used a different one and got cut. I will definitely be sticking with this one!!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand to try for free. I usually HATE disposable razors with a passion, these however left me pleasantly surprised. These razors are high quality unlike other disposables that make your life harder when you have to go over the area more than twice to properly remove the hair. I usually buy the razors with the shaving cream made into the razors, while this doesn&#x27;t have that it does have a hydrating serum that will leave your skin smooth. I would  definitely purchase these in the future.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors as a promotion from Schick to test out the product and I have to say, it is a VERY good razor. I love the ergonomics of the handle and I am also a big fan of close shaves, which this razor delivers. Usually, I have to be very careful to not nick my knobby knees... not with this razor. I tell you, I took one for the team and went over my knees more quickly and haphazardly for this product. I DID not get any nicks and my knees were really smooth. I would recommend the razor, for sure. It&#x27;s also great if you are not a fan of refillable/cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> I am very thankful that Schick gave me a free sample of the new Hydro Silk razor. I have to say that as disposable razors go, these are great! They give a close shave without any razor burn. I have sensitive skin, so razor burn is pretty much a given. With this razor, I can even shave without using any shaving gel, which is nice when I just want to get under my arms really quickly. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve nicked my legs at all since I switched to this razor. The razor leaves my legs smooth and hydrated, and I feel like I can go longer between shaves. I think I have used this particular one 4 or more times, and it&#x27;s still usable. I like the shape of the handle. I don&#x27;t find it hard to grip at all. I love that the moisture strip doesn&#x27;t stick to the surface you lay the razor on since the handle is designed to keep the blades off the tub. I also like how the blade protector goes on from the top. With most other razors I&#x27;ve used, the protector slides on from the bottom. If you slip, it&#x27;d be pretty easy to cut yourself. I now that isn&#x27;t really a problem for responsible adults, but hey, it seems like a nice little feature to me. I will most certainly be buying these! I&#x27;d recommend you try them as well!</li>
    <li> These were pure awesomeness! They gave me a really close shave. This of course was because of all the blades it has. I also loved the handle because it was really comfortable for me. I feel like I have a really strong control over my shave. The price is also great. 3 razors for this price, that are actually HIGH QUALITY, where else can you get that?!?&lt;br /&gt;*I tested these out for Influenster; if interested let me know*</li>
    <li> If you like soft, smooth and moisturized legs, the Hydro Silk Shick Hydro Silk is the product for you. You can use the razor by itself or you can add moisture by using a shave gel. You will feel soft and healthy looking legs, and forget the itchy skin! it has a water-activated moisturizing serum that hydrates your skin for up to 2 hours after shaving. It has five blades that deliver a smooth shave and help prevent irritation of your delicate skin. The razor also has a easy-to-grip handle, so it is more secure to use than other disposable razors. I am trying the product for free thanks to Schick and I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand because I am a BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I received my Schick hydro disposable razors to try for free thanks to Schick and Bzz Agent! I usually use Venus disposable razors, but was so happy with these that I will be switching! First off, I love that I don&#x27;t have to use as much shaving cream as normal, and my legs feel so smooth afterwards. I also noticed that I am not having to shave as often as I was before, which is great! Definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> It gives me a noticeably closer shave, I like the slick &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; stuff and the razor itself feels better in my hand. I will definitely continue to use this over the Venus Embrace, which was once my favorite. Thanks to Schick I got this product for free.</li>
    <li> Very close shave. Leaves legs moisturizied. Great disposable razor #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I have been using Schick&#x27;s Hydro Silk Disposable razors for about 2-3 weeks and I love them. Somehow these babies leave my legs and armpits hair free and super moisturized after shaving. Other razors I would have to immediately wear lotion after a shave, but with these I don&#x27;t one less product used and one less thing to do. So this makes a busy mother happy :).  The razor&#x27;s design is pretty nifty too. The grip make shaving easy, my hands feel comfortable holding them they don&#x27;t slip. I also like the fact that no matter what way you rest the razor on a surface the blades do not touch the surface. This a great thing because I hate when razors don&#x27;t have that feature. Well worth buying these because one razor lasts along time and I use them every 2-3 days. Thank you Schick for the sample! will keep these in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> I used this razor for the first time this morning. I had such a clean shave, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my legs. I received them free to test through Bzzagent. The head is very mobile to fit in different nooks and crannies. Immediately I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t like your typical flimsy disposable, definitely easy to hold on to and use.</li>
    <li> This razor is a girl&#x27;s best friend! I was able to try this for free thanks to Schick and I am so satisfied. I have never had a closer shave than with this razor. It was easy to hold in the shower,the contoured head made it a breeze to glide all over my legs. And it didn&#x27;t leave any nicks or cuts! My legs are crazy smooth</li>
    <li> I got this razor in the mail free from Schick to try. I&#x27;m always looking for a razor that works well, has an easy grip handle, and doesn&#x27;t give you razor burn. I&#x27;ve found it, and I cannot believe I found it in a disposable razor. You definitely cannot tell these are disposable razors which I&#x27;m guessing is what Schick is going for. Having 5 blades gives me a great shave on my legs and under my arms. I love shaving right before bed and then sliding under the covers. One of the greatest feelings is have fresh smooth legs especially under soft sheets. Schick paired with Skintimate sensitive shave gel kept my legs smooth, hydrated, and looking amazing. The razor didn&#x27;t give me razor burn or a bunch of small nicks. I really like the handle, it fits perfectly in my hand and doesn&#x27;t slip. I usually dread shaving my knees and the backs of my ankles because the razor always cuts me. Not with the Hydro Silk Disposables. Shaves them easily and without blood! The skintimate shave gel that came with the razor didn&#x27;t make my legs break out and seemed to help hold the moisture in my legs which paired with the Schick razor gave me the ultimate shaving experience and result.</li>
    <li> GREAT for a disposable razor. I found that these were easy to use, had a nice grip and didn&#x27;t leave me with nicks and ingrown hairs like other disposables. It gets a really nice close shave with shaving cream and I ended up with really smooth feeling and looking legs. I saw one reviewer found the moisture strip gooey but I didn&#x27;t find that this was gooey at all. I will definitely be buying these again and would recommend these to others. Great buy for those of use who can&#x27;t afford buying the fancy razors with cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free sample of this product thanks to Schick and Bzzagent. Although I participated in a review these opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, super hydrating, no cuts, and a closer shave - everything you would want in a razor! I got to try one of Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable razors for free so I could review it, and honestly I love it. I am always left feeling so dry after shaving, but the Water-activated moisturizing serum really hydrates your skin, and you notice it!</li>
    <li> So, although I do regularly purchase Schick products, this one in particular I was actually able to try this product for free thanks to Schick! However, please know that I am giving this review as an honest customer - they are not telling me to say one thing or another. I love this razor! With the amount of blades, it gets super close to my skin so my legs don&#x27;t get little prickles as fast. Also, the silky goo that is around the razors, OMG. What ever it is, I want to put at all over my skin because it makes it so smooth. It reminds me of an in shower lotion type thing - I&#x27;m really not to sure but I love it! While I was able to try this for free, I will defiantly spend my money on this product, it is more than worth it.</li>
    <li> I was able to try these razors from BzzAgent and I was pleasantly surprised. They give a close shave without nicks - even on my knees. And they leave my legs moisturized and feeling great!</li>
    <li> I will never use another shaver as long as this one is being manufactured. It&#x27;s like silk on my legs.</li>
    <li> This past weekend, I had the opportunity to try the new Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. When I first received it in the mail for free, I was a bit hesitant. Every time I&#x27;ve ever used a disposable razor, it left my skin feeling irritated and I always regretted it. I decided to use this new razor before stepping out for a nigh on the town and I was so happy that I did! It all started with a little bit of shaving cream. As I picked up the razor, I noticed that it felt different in my hands, much different than other cheap disposable razors, it felt as though I was holding a razor that I had spent a lot of money on. The handle was very soft and easy to grab. It gave me superior control over the razor and I didn&#x27;t feel like it would slip out of my hands. I just love how it has a water activated moisturizing serum, it is almost as if there are little moisture beads under the razor. My only tip would be to keep this razor out of direct contact with the water while it is not in use to make sure that the moisturizing strip does not melt away. By keeping the razor dry while it&#x27;s not in use, you will get the most out of the razor, especially since it is such a great investment. These razors really work one thousand times better than the Bic disposable razors that would butcher my legs!  I really cannot emphasize how much I love using this razor because it really is designed for the curves of a woman! As I used this razor, it glided effortlessly over my skin with its five curve sensing blades. I think it is so cool how the blades have skin guards that let you get such an incredibly close shave without causing irritation! The flexible blades and the oval contoured cartridge allowed me to reach all of the hard to get areas like my underarm, knees and especially the ankles! I was shocked that I was able to quickly rush to shave my legs without any cuts! The special serum is made from marine extracts and shea butter which was sucha treat for my legs. I am proud to use a serum that has been dermatologist tested because I know that it is safe for all skin types, including sensitive skin so I can recommend it to all of my friends! After I used this, I noticed that my skin stayed moisturized and hydrated for at least two hours after shaving! I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky smooth my legs felt, even though I didn&#x27;t even have any lotion on! I would certainly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a fantastic, close and smooth shave that will leave your skin feeling amazingly smooth for hours later!</li>
    <li> I had a chance to use this product for free through BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m so glad! I&#x27;ve been unhappy with the razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s not a close shave, and the razor itself doesn&#x27;t last long. Trying Schick Hydro Silk going into the summer months was awesome! The five blades and moisturizing strip provide an extremely close shave without leading to cuts or razor burn. The handle is very easy to grip and the way the razor is designed, it&#x27;s easy to get around challenging spots. The best part to me was how long this razor lasted! I easily used one razor for a week, and I usually only get two good shaves out of my other razor. I&#x27;ve bought the product several times since trying it for free and have been happy with the results. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am Trying this razors that I got for free thanks to schick.  I have to say I love this razors and I do recommend. It has 5 blades and a moisturizing serum that keeps your legs silky and smooth for days.  Say good bye to razor bumps and hello to sexy legs.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! I usually buy cheap ones, but am never fully satisfied. These shave really well. I have very dry legs, and these help alot with moisture. They are comfortable to use. I definitely will be checking into these once I run out of these free ones from Bzzagent!</li>
    <li> Thanks to schick, I was able to try out the Hydro Silk Disposables. As far as disposable razors go, these are the cream of the crop. Sometimes, I even mistaken it for my refillable razors. The handle is contoured, weighty, and a feminine shade of blue. The handle has a nice grip to it and I felt in control of the razor the whole time I shaved. (Not like with other dinky disposables that get too soapy and slip out of your hand- and now a razor is falling on your foot!) The Hydro Silk Disposable razor advertises 5 &amp;#34;curve sending&amp;#34; blades. I&#x27;m not exactly sure if the blades sense my curves in any way (maybe the pivoting handle more so) but 5 blades DOES make it easy to remove the hair faster. I was also surprised how easy the hair rinsed out of the razor. After the shave, my legs were soft and not full of dry skin and I surprisingly didn&#x27;t have any nicks or cuts! I wouldn&#x27;t stop using lotion anyways because it&#x27;s not like the hydrating part lasts that long. Overall, for the roughly $10 you spend on 3 of these it is worth it. You will be able to shave head to toe only using one of these- and even still have some sharpness left to the blades. It&#x27;s great for vacationing because you don&#x27;t lose out on the quality of a good shave and don&#x27;t have to sacrifice possibly losing your expensive razor.</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free thanks to bzzagent and Schick! I loved these razors! They give an incredibly close shave and my legs were smooth for longer. The one drawback is the conditioner strip. I like to leave my razors in the shower and if you do that with this one the strip leaves a gooey mess on the tub.</li>
    <li> These tomato peelers don&#x27;t work at all.  My gazpacho looked like a massacre.  Do yourself a favor and buy a blow torch for your soup needs.</li>
    <li> I got to try these free thanks to Schick and BzzAgent and I absolutely loved them. Great close shave. Normally I can&#x27;t tell a difference when I use different razors but these are definitely my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors have really improved my shave. I always knew that the &#x27;expensive&#x27; razors with replaceable blades worked pretty good, but the jump in price from the generic 2-3 blade disposables was just too much for me to commit to, and for the past several years I have just used the &#x27;cheapies&#x27; and dealt with the cuts and uncomfortable handle and blade design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a BzzAgent Campaign to try out Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors, and at first I dreaded the &#x27;hydrating&#x27; portion of the razor. I had until recently long forgotten about past experiences of the &#x27;hydrating&#x27; strips that would dissolve and cement my razor to what ever surface it was near, thus rendering the &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; portion of the expensive razor useless. With the design of the Schick Hydro Silk razor, that problem does not occur- at all! The handle is designed to be ergonomic, and the flex and overall design of this razor makes it a breeze to use- quickly, efficiently, and without any blood loss or cuts! Averaging at about $3-4 a razor, each of which lasted me several weeks with daily use, Schick has razors figured out in all of the right ways!</li>
    <li> I was able to try these razors for free things to schick and buzzagent.  I usually use disposable razors however I usually use no more than three blades as I have noticed before that the more blades you use the more times I get Nicks and cuts.  I was pleasantly surprised with this razor because it shaved really well even over curves and hard-to-reach places.  I had no issues with nicks or cuts.  I especially liked the skin guard on the razor that made for a smooth shave.  I have been using the same razor for at least two weeks and it still shades as nice as it did the first day.  Although the skin guard is almost all gone it does not affect how well it shaves. I will definitely use this product in the future</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this razor. I was able to test it out for free and I am so happy that I did get the chance thanks to Schick. I was able to shave and not have to worry about razor burn thanks to the 5 amazing blades of this razor. My body everywhere I was shaving was able to be silky smooth with no dryness or razor burn and now I am able to get the great shave when I go out of town without have to carry around a razor I would most likely forget in the shower at a hotel. I love it.</li>
    <li> After receiving these razors for free I wanted to give them a try. The first time I used them, along with my Skintimate® Skin Therapy Silky Skin Shave Gel I loved them. They did leave a couple of red marks and a few cuts, mostly around my knees. I had to use the razor a second time to see how well it was and it wasn&#x27;t very good. I had lots of red bumps and nicks and bleeding on my shins and behind my knees and on my kneecap and behind my legs. I also had massive bumps on both of my arm pits. So while I love these disposables for one time use, they are good for just that, to be used one time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but it actually is much better than a plain shaver. The infused moisture strip makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product via BzzAgent and the Schick company.The moisture strip on this razor is nice, however, I wish it stayed attached to the razor a bit longer. The 5 blades give a close shave, and you can use this razor a good amount of times before you have to move on to the next.</li>
    <li> Through BzzAgent and Schick I was able to try the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables for free. What an incredibly close shave they give! The moisturizing strip helped to keep my legs from being too dry or getting razor burn, as well as the five blades. I tried with an without shaving cream and honestly I preferred without. And I wasn&#x27;t scared to rush through when my shower was cut short by my daughter. The handle is very easy to hold onto even with wet hands. It&#x27;s convenient in a 3pack that can last you for a good while, too.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Schick Hydro silk disposables razors from BzzAgent. I liked it the first time I used it and had a close shave but I did notice that the razor has a tendency to clog. The second time I used this razor the soap came off from around the entire cartridge and got all over my legs. It was very hard to remove and I ended up missing some which became a sticky gooey clump on my leg. I gave it a two because the first shave was alright and not the worst I have ever had but I cannot forgive the soap incident.</li>
    <li> I recently received this in the mail for free thanks to schick and it&#x27;s actually my new best friend. It shaves my legs nicely and it doesn&#x27;t gives me cuts and etc. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant when I first tried the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors free through Bzzagent.com not only because disposable razors tend to not work as well, but also because I could barely feel them gliding across my legs. I thought for sure that I would get out of the shower and still feel stubble. To my surprise, I got out of the shower only to find no hairs in sight! I was impressed. I would definitely purchase these again!</li>
    <li> I recieved this free from Schick and was so excited. I have a hard time finding a razor that leaves my legs feeling smooth. The first time I used this, I was so impressed. My legs were smoother and didn&#x27;t get irritated and dry like they usually do. I didn&#x27;t even nick myself around my ankles like I have so many times before. My biggest problem is the second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t feel it worked as well. I was hoping for a disposable that gave me a few good uses. Overall though, it was a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recieved this as part of a campaign and I&#x27;ve gotten a bzzkit with a 3 pack of schick silk hydro disposable razors. I&#x27;m used to using a lotion hair removal system which usually takes 6 mins maximum of removing leg hairs from both legs. Before that I&#x27;ve used gilette razors, which always delieverd a very close and smooth shave, now I&#x27;m going to compare that to this current schick, Which is ok, it&#x27;s comfortable to hold, and gives a close shave but i&#x27;m not a big fan of how close it is because i cut myself very easily. Even though it&#x27;s delievers a great shave, hairs regrow within the matter of days making it very time consuming for me. The gel strip is also sticky and does not glide onto my legs as it should. I feel all around safer using schick intuition razors.</li>
    <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST SHAVE EVER. Thanks to Schick I got to try this for free but I am a customer for life. I recommend this to people at the store its so amazing. Sure they are more expensive but wouldn&#x27;t you rather spend a few extra bucks than walk around with irritated skin?</li>
    <li> The first time I tried the razor I was completely amazed!!!! It really didnt feel like  I was shaving my legs at all. It really felt like I was rubbing them with silk. After my shower my legs still felt silky smooth. The razor lasts a really long time too. I have used it at least 3 to 4 times a week for the past month and just now had to replace it. Schick Hydro Silk definitely gets 5 stars from and has made me a believer. I wont be going back to my old razors! AND I got to try this free thanks to Schick!!!</li>
    <li> I like Schick razors they&#x27;re the only ones I use. These ones are very moisturizing. They haven&#x27;t cut me at all yet. I&#x27;m enjoying them. And I recommend them.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor provides a wonderfully close shave, but leaves no little red bumps from too close a shave.  I appreciated how the contour of the item made it easy to get in spots around my knee and ankle that are often hard to shave without nicking.  My teenage daughter also tried this razor and asked if I would buy them again, as the cheap little pink ones I had been buying caused a lot of ouch moments.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Shaves close without having to worry about nicks.  At one time I regularly shaved my legs with Schick Intuition. Then one day I discovered these.  The Hydro Silk is cleaner, less messy to use, and also cheaper than the intuition bars.</li>
    <li> Waoo, I got these from Bzz Agent to try out for free, and I must say they are amazingly pretty design and curves just to hold perfectly in grip , After i done with the shave on my lefs, they were awesome smooth. I did it today only, but i will write again in few days to let everyone know how many days the shave was good and i believe it will last for 3-4 days as i can feel my skin so smooth and soft than i felt with gillette and olay disposables. I really loved these.</li>
    <li> I have really tiny hand and I need like a specific razor to fit in. With the way this razor curves it&#x27;s perfect! My legs are SOOOOO freaking soft. Lol I was going around asking folks to rub my legs.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It left my skin silky smooth and it virtually got every angle and crease! The 5 blades made shaving super smooth and easy. No irritations, no razor burns, just beautiful skin! Thanks to Schick and bzzagent for the free blades!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor! I find buying disposable razors is more convenient and usually a lot cheaper but that sometimes means giving up a good shave! These left my legs feeling smooth and moisturized before applying my lotion (added tip: using coconut oil as an aftershave moisturizer is awesome!) my legs weren&#x27;t irritated or dry feeling like some other razors leave my legs. I am definitely impressed with this and will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fabulous from these razors. I felt like once you tried one, you&#x27;ve tried them all, I have to say, these razors are awesome. I normally drop my razors in the shower and this razor has a handle that is easy to hold onto. There is a moisture strip on the razor that reminds me of aloe when it glided across my skin. I didn&#x27;t even cut myself with the new razor. This is a must try. I will never go for the cheaper ones again. This razor is incredible! I received my razor from a site that sends you free products to try out for free (bzzagent). I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to try it. A few extra dollars goes far with this product!</li>
    <li> I received these free as my bzz agent kit from BzzAgent.  I normally would buy store brand razors because they are so much cheaper but after using the Hydro Silk Razors I won&#x27;t go back to store brand. you get what you pay for and these razors are awesome and blow the store brand razors out of the water. The handles are easy to grip and the 5 blades make shaving easier.  I notice my legs aren&#x27;t as itchy and dry after a day. I recommend to everyone to pay more for these razors then store brand, I know I won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> BEST RAZORS I HAVE EVER TRIED!! the 5 blades are curve were amazing for knees, ankles and armpits-and its been four days no stubble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;schick sent me this product for free through BzzAgent, however all opinions are mine expressly based on trials of the product.</li>
    <li> Love the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors! Leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth and  clean! Razors last awhile as well which is a huge plus. This has become my go to razor.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors by far I have tried that are disposables they give a close comfortable shave. The curve blades worked wonders no Knicks or cuts at all using them in those hard to reach places or if your a lazy shaver worked wonders The water activated moisturizing strip leaves skin silky smooth you can use it with or without the shaving cream because it locks in moisture I usually have to shave every day or at least every other day so that time is still normal granted not every product is for everybody but this is deff a good one for me and i have very sensitive skin got it free threw bzzagent</li>
    <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Bzzagent.com. After the first shave with this razor, my skin felt hydrated and smooth, a welcome change from the itching and irritation felt with the previous razor. I used to dread shaving, but now my skin feels smooth, soft, and absolutely clean! Before trying this razor, I always thought that there wasn&#x27;t really a difference between razors. I always figured that they all did the same thing, so they must ask be equal. Now I know that there is a razor that is superior to others. There&#x27;s no going back to other razors that don&#x27;t even compare to the excellence of Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try these razors for free thanks to BzzAgent, but that in no way swayed my review. I love the size and the grip of these razors. They slide so easily across my legs and don&#x27;t miss a single hair. I would definitely recommend them to others!</li>
    <li> These things are AMAZING as far as disposables go. You expect &#x27;cheap&#x27; from disposable. Well these are the exact opposite. They shave smoothly with no issues what so ever. I normally HATE shaving. It dries my skin out, I usually end up with razor burn from using such cheap razors, etc. These do not do that. They literally hydrate as they shave! I will never use another razor again. Highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(disclaimer - I received these items for free from BzzAgent for the purpose of testing and reviewing. My opinion is my own, and is not influenced in any way)</li>
    <li> I tried Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors thanks to a free trial from Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I have been using men&#x27;s razors for my everyday shaving needs. They are cheaper, sharper razors, and seem to last longer than those shavers aimed at women. I was interested to try Hydro Silk since I haven&#x27;t used a woman&#x27;s razor in some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive of these are the great handle design, close shave, and reduced cuts to your skin. The handle sports a wide ending for your thumb preventing slippage and cuts. It&#x27;s comfortable to keep ahold of and not as easy to drop as other razors (plus the razor head does NOT pop off when your do drop it, huge plus). The shave is very nice the first few uses, I only had to shave every few days (see negatives for more explanation), and I felt my legs were overall more smooth than they are usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the shaver dulls quickly, especially compared to the most current men&#x27;s razor I am using. After a few uses, I was back toe having my legs every day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to women as a great summer shaver that will give you a nice, smooth shave but it won&#x27;t save you much money in the end with the razors dulling so quickly.</li>
    <li> these r great but I like the grip on the men&#x27;s better</li>
    <li> I feel like this is a pretty good razor and I couldn&#x27;t even feel the blades. It was a comfortable shave! However, I didn&#x27;t like that it wasn&#x27;t close enough. I still had stubble after using. It lasts a little longer than other razors and has a comfortable grip and great design!  #gotitfree</li>
    <li> First, I want to say that I received this 3 pack for free from BzzAgent compliments of Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was how the handle was different than any I had seen before. Despite being excited to try out this new razor, I quickly became frustrated the first few times I used the Schick Hydro razor. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the handle design or maybe the amount of moisturizing that is on a brand new razor but I definitely experienced a learning curve. However, after 3 or 4 shaves I finally got the hang of things and it has been smooth sailing every since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my legs have every felt so smooth, and that is even after using this razor for a prolonged period of time. In fact there have been a couple of times when my husband has even commented on the smoothness of my legs, only to find out that I hadn&#x27;t shaved since the day before. The only other downfall besides the learning curve is that it did leave bumps around the bikini area after the first couple of shaves.</li>
    <li> This shaves my head bald so, close w/out shaver burns. Didn&#x27;t need to use my fusion pro glide.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this razor. I was skeptical because it&#x27;s disposable, but now I&#x27;m a Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor user for life! I received this as part of a promotion from the brand, through BzzAgent. I lathered up with Skintimate shaving cream, then got the closest shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The handle is great &amp; easy to hold. The blades last a long time, rinse well &amp; work great. The cover on the razor is very convenient, easy to travel with &amp; protects the blades. The color is nice, not flashy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None :)</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It lasts a long time compared to other disposable razors, gives a smooth close shave that also lasts longer than that of other razors I was given the oportunity to try them free throuh Bzz Agent, and I am a convert!</li>
    <li> Great razors! I received a sample to try from Bzzagent and these live up to the hype. I used to be one of those people that figured a razor was a razor and I didn&#x27;t need buy any particular type for a great shave but that just isn&#x27;t the case. I like to have smooth legs without the nicks and cuts and the Schick hydro silk disposable  razors give me that. The Gripping on the wand make it easy to hold while I&#x27;m in the shower and it has five blades making it so that I cover a large area at a time. It also has a hydrating strip on it too.</li>
    <li> I got the pleasure of being able to try these, along with Skintimate Skin therapy shaving cream for free from Schick themselves by being a Bzzagent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some problems with bumps and feeling itchy after a shave with the Schick Hydro Silk disposables, but after using it a few times, it works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs feel very soft and silky after a shave with these, and when I ran out of shaving cream (The Skintimate Skin therapy cream!!) it worked just as well with regular bodywash, and it was still a close, effortless shave! The 5 blades REALLY  makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS RAZOR!!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s perfect for someone like me who&#x27;s got very thick, coarse hair that grows back a day later. I Highly recommend for people who shave multiple times a week :)</li>
    <li> I think the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables are a wonderful new product. The shave was extremely smooth and stayed hydrated for hours after. These razors were a great addition to my vacation to Nicaragua, where they don&#x27;t have hot water showers. The water-activated moisturizing serum was a God-send!&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars because I was not crazy about the grip. Although this is something they are supposed to be great for, the handle was a little too spooned for me. It made it harder to hold onto the handle.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive these razors free from Schick!</li>
    <li> These are a woman&#x27;s best friend! My legs have never felt so good after shaving!  My husband even used them on his gave!  We are truly obsessed.  Even though #I GOT IT FREE from #BZZAgent, that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m giving 5 stars.  These are truly worth wp stars! If you are in a hurry don&#x27;t even need shaving cream! Just eager and the razor works awesome..</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free from Schick through BzzAgent. I&#x27;d used them before, and I wasn&#x27;t very happy with them. The first I used them, I had just been learning to shave, so I decided k would try them again just to see if it was better now. The razor is pretty okay once the gooey, slimy moisturizer stuff is gone. The slime slides down the handle and makes it difficult to grip, resulting in nicks and cuts, and leaving slime wherever you rest your razor when you&#x27;re finished. If that&#x27;s not enough, the goo aggravated my skin to no end and made it impossible to shave and actually remove any hair. I kept having to go over the same parts multiple times resulting in razor burn. It&#x27;s safe to say that I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome!  The number of blades are great, they provide a super close shave and eliminates the potential to shave the same area twice.  The moisturizer strip works like a charm - it&#x27;s NOT thick, sticky or grimy! The razor&#x27;s design is pretty flawless, I don&#x27;t drop it.. the grips are great and the head of the razor moves in a smooth pattern!</li>
    <li> When I first received the Schick Hydro Silk disposables I thought what makes you any better than the razors that I&#x27;ve used in the past?! It just looked a bit fancier than the razors that I&#x27;ve used, I didn&#x27;t think that meant much of anything but boy was I wrong! When I used it the first time without the skintimate shave cream I was very surprised. The way it glided from my ankle to my thigh not leaving one hair to chase after. I was sold from that alone! Then I felt something that I&#x27;ve never felt after shaving before...moisturized legs. My old razors left me with quite a bit of hair and some very itchy dry legs from having to go over the same spot numerous times. The Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors have officially become my favorite razors. #HydroSilkDisposables  #GotItFree</li>
    <li> When I recieved my free package from #bzzagent thanks to #shick I was pretty excited. I&#x27;m a mom of two hyper boys and I rarely get to take a shower by myself or shave for that matter. I honestly thought the Shick Hydro Dispoable razors would be the same as the disposables I&#x27;ve used before, but i was wrong. I noticed something different the second I started shaving. With the 5 blades and marine infused gel I had some of the softest legs I&#x27;ve had in a while. I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling how soft they were. I always get nicks from other razors. I don&#x27;t believe there has been one time before using these razors that I hadn&#x27;t cut myself. These, are a huge difference.... Not one cut at all. I shaved happily for once. I used only the razor and water and I didn&#x27;t need anything else. The gel was plentiful and the razors were sharp and not dull at all. The grip was the first thing I noticed as it was very comfortable. These are my new razors. They are worth the price.</li>
    <li> This three pack of disposable razors is by far the best. The handle has a lot of grip and the head moves slightly for the hard to reach or curved areas.&lt;br /&gt;It has five blades and two silk strips for hydration, one on top and one on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Among the easy open packaging for disposable razors the color scheme and design are nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I used this to shave my legs and the smoothness was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I also purposefully did not use lotion on my legs after shaving and I was very impressed that my legs did not itch at all, especially around my ankles.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and what a deal for Schick disposable razors. So easy to use and take on the go.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I got to try these razors from Schick for free because these are my new go to razors!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend ladies!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really go for disposable razors, but the razors that refill packs and I use a men&#x27;s razor. I was exciting to receive and review these razors...I was pretty impressed by how close of a shave these razors gives you...the handling of it is great also! It has curves in all the rite places, making it extremely easy to navigate. I have also used it many times in my more sensitive areas...this razor is absolutely great for shaving bikini areas, no one wants ingrown hairs, or razor burn or irritation...bzzagent and Schick sent these amazing razor free to me to review an test. Although they were sent to free, all opinions are 100% my own!</li>
    <li> Best shave of my life! Even when my hand slipped it didn&#x27;t nic me! I have nice smooth legs and arm pits and they stay that way for days!</li>
    <li> I tested this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign and found this razor to be hydrating and smooth. The only caution is not to use too much soap or shaving cream as it appears to affect the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> I received these razors for testing purposes from BzzAgent and now I&#x27;d don&#x27;t want to ever use another brand. I have the closest shave and the little moisturizing strips didn&#x27;t irritate my skin; it turn to throw on my favorite dress!</li>
    <li> I received a 3 ct pack of Hydro Silk Disposable razors free, courtesy of Schick, through Bzzagent.  I have been very pleased with how smooth they get my legs.  The 5 blade construction, coupled with a nicely shaped cartridge head, makes the razor very nice.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this one, it is a great razor, particularly for a disposable.</li>
    <li> I got these Schick Hydro Disposable Razors from Bzzagent to test them out for free. All I have to say is that these are awesome. They have like this moisture serum on the razor that lasts a really long time. How long you ask? Well I received them about two weeks ago and the only one I&#x27;ve used so far still has the moisture strip full of serum. They shave real close and leave my legs shiny and smooth. I think I have found my new go to razor. Give them a try you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really comfortable grip and handle is sturdy and strong. The blades I think would have worked just as well if it was a 4 or a 3 blade though since every new blade will tend to shave clean and smooth the first to third time around before it starts to get dull so no matter how much blades you add to this, to me, it won&#x27;t make a difference. The draw back for me is underneath the blade where there are what looks like little pockets which has a tendency to collect bacteria if water gets trapped in it and just air dries out. Safety wise, i don&#x27;t want to get a skin infection. Other wise Its a great blade overall for a few uses. Just half design flaw is all.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample and I lOVE it!!  I didn&#x27;t get any cuts, or razor burn and I have been using this product for several weeks! This razor is so smooth that you don&#x27;t even need shave cream!! It leaves your legs feeling amazing, this razor gives a close smooth shave and leaves you with silky smooth legs!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the Hydro Silk Disposable razors!!! They&#x27;ve made so many improvements that allow shaving to be less painful! I love the fact that the price is so reasonable and these have so many awesome new features. Since I have dry skin the fact that it moisturizes my skin for a couple hrs after is definitely a plus. Then the safe blades make it so you can get a close shave but also not knick yourself while doing it. The best feature of all is the fact that it  curves with the natural curves of my body. So it makes those hard to reach places much easier like my knees! I&#x27;m so glad I got to try these for free thanks to bzzagent. I will definitely purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these razors free from Schick and Bzzagent....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was impressed at how smooth the razor felt, yet wasn&#x27;t happy when I had to go over areas multiple times to get rid of all the hair. With 5 blades I wasn&#x27;t expecting to do this. I have less trouble using a razor with 2 blades! I spent way more time shaving with this product then I normally do. A few hours later I did like how smooth my legs felt, but I&#x27;ll have to see what the results are in few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever buy these. I&#x27;d imagine they aren&#x27;t cheap, and for my experience with them, I&#x27;d rather stick with something that works better.</li>
    <li> These razors are the best I have ever come across!! They leave your skin feeling silky smooth and soft and not a single cut!! Many razors also have a bad tendency of leaving razor bumps or small rashes and I have not had that problem with these. Also my legs were left feeling hydrated and I did not have to use lotion right after shaving, which with four kids running around is quite a hard task to accomplish. I love the 5 curves and was nowhere near as nervous about shaving those hard areas like knees and ankles. I am in love with the Schick Hydro Silk razors for sure!!!</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome. I got the opportunity to try these free with bzzagent. Great quality for disposable; however, the lubricant strip gets VERY gooey, and if you leave the razor in the shower and the razor gets wet, the strip will be ruined. If you are able to keep it dry in between uses this razor is great, long lasting smooth, less razor burn, no cuts in awkward locations, blades are good quality and handle is ergonomically shaped.</li>
    <li> I was send a package of 3 Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors, courtesy of Schick and Bzzagent to test for FREE. Let me just say that it is the BEST disposable razor I have used in a LONG time. The shave was so close, it was unbelievable. No cuts, no razor burn. Just a clean smooth shave! They are also very inexpensive for the quality, it is definately a cheap replacement for those crappy razors that cut my legs up! I would definately recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to give the Hydro Silk Razor a try! My legs are very dry and after using the hydro silk razor and shaving cream I saw a huge difference right away. I always cute my legs and hate when my hand slips of the handle of the razor in those hard to reach places. Hydro silk literally just glides over your legs. Hydro Silk gave me not only the smoothness but also a very close shave and a no slip handle. I found my new razor! I think the price of the razor is comparable to the other brands that are in stores.  #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposables Thanks Bzz agent</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free sample from BzzAgent and I could not have been any more satisfied with how well it worked. I have been razor brand loyal for years and had never considered switching until I gave the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables a try. The 5 blades give you an incredibly close shave with no discomfort or cuts, and my legs felt so hydrated. The handle was easy to hold and helped me get to those hard to reach places with no slip. These are my new favorite razors.</li>
    <li> I liked this razor. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is the head of the razor is bigger than I am used to. Besides that it was a good razor</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free to try and give my honest opinion on through bzz agent. I was so excited to try a disposable version of this razor! I am an owner of the Schick razor where you purchase cartridge heads to replace them, but have never tried the disposable version. The look of the razor gives you both the look and feel of an expensive cartridge head replaced type razor. It has a beefy handle to hang onto, and has a nice rack of super sharp looking razors to get the job of shaving your legs done. I loved the grasp I was able to have on the handle of the razor. Most disposables I&#x27;ve tried in the past were super skinny and flimsy feeling/looking for shaving.  I noticed right away when I started to shave that these are so comparable to the cartridges. It still leaves a nice streak of smoothness for every stroke you shave your legs with to moisturize where you just lopped off all of your leg hair. I got great even hair removal, and I didn&#x27;t have any knicks or cuts throughout my entire shave. Minimal hairs were missed after I did an assessment after getting out of the shower, and my legs felt super soft and smooth. I even noticed that my legs stayed hair free for just about as many days as they do when used with a cartridge head.  I would definitely recommend these to others. If you&#x27;ve never dabbled in the disposable world of razors these would be the best ones to try. You get a lot of use out of one razor.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Schick for letting me try this product for free. I have to say that this is one of the best disposable razors I have ever used. I don&#x27;t think I would have bought on my own, but now I am a believer with how close a shave a got and no nicks! Super excited to have these as the warmer weather is getting here. It will be my new go to disposable.</li>
    <li> Got to try out the new Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors! got this razor free as a brand promotion from BuzzAgent. I absolutely love the water activated moisturizing serum because it gives my legs the extra moisturizing feeling for several hours after shaving! With the 5 blades on this razor, I&#x27;m able to get the closest shave leaving my legs silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love these razors, I received them for free to try out and they were great. When I used them to shave my legs they were left smooth and without razor burn which is always amazing.</li>
    <li> I received these for free as a promotion from Schick and BzzAgent and they are fantastic razors! I have sensitive skin, so trying something new is always daunting, but these razors are total gems. My skin is soft and moisturized, with no razor bumps anywhere! I love the handle design as well, since it keeps your moisturizing strip from sticking to the edge of the tub. I will definitely purchase these from now on.</li>
    <li> I received these Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors to try for free from Schick. I have to say thanks much for letting me try them! They&#x27;re amazing! These are certainly the best I&#x27;ve tried! They have 5 Curve Sensing blades with skin guards for an incredibly smooth shave! They also help prevent irritation! They have  Contoured Oval Cartridges for a closer shave around those hard to reach places like knees, ankles and underarms! They have a soft handle that&#x27;s easy to hold onto  while shaving! I haven&#x27;t had any Razor burn or irritation on my legs or underarms since using these. I usually cut myself when shaving around my knees and ankles. These have made a huge difference. I haven&#x27;t had any cuts which is wonderful! I&#x27;m not afraid to shave anymore! I&#x27;ll be using these from now on! You get a close smooth shave without the irritation or cuts. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Got to try this  product for free thanks to Schick .  I honestly do not like disposable razors, since they usually cause a lot of cuts and feel cheap, but not this one!. Love this razor it glides with ease over the skin and gets those hard to reach places, it also lets you get done fast because it covers a lot of surface area which is great because I am very busy. My only regret was not having longer legs to shave. Will definitely be going with this razor from now on.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a promo along with some coupons for discounts on future razor purchases provided via a program run by Schick® Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care®.  I think these are the best disposable razors I have ever used in my life. They caught all the hard to reach places the first time around; like it had a swivel head effect on the razor. I didn&#x27;t have to make any second strokes/passes in the same area and NO nicks are burning sensation!!! Fell in love with the smooth and soft feel it gave my legs afterwards until my next shave 2 days later. So these are now my #1 winner for disposable razors on the market!! #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposables</li>
    <li> I loved how the first shave felt, it was like I didn&#x27;t need shaving cream. Then it went downhill. The second and third one all suffered from the law of diminishing returns, and it became nothing more than a normal razor  I got this for free through Bzzagent</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free to try and review from BzzAgent as part of a promotion from Schick. I just tried these razors along with the shaving cream and I am very impressed! The shaving cream is more like a lotion texture, but it foams up really well. The razors gave me a really close, really smooth shave! Usually with a new razor I inevitably nick my skin at least once or twice but I was amazed that even with getting a really close shave, I didn&#x27;t nick myself at all with this razor! I could tell the serum around the blades was helping the blades to glide over my skin much better than other blades. The handle is really easy to hold and navigate. Love these!</li>
    <li> Thee best razor ever! My legs have been so soft and silly after I&#x27;ve shaves before! No ravor burn and I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream with it. It lasts a whole and have an interchangeable head so I don have to buy a new razor Everytime!</li>
    <li> I got to try these free for my review. And I have to say, I usually buy razors from the dollar store and end up with bloody burning legs. I tried these and didn&#x27;t get 1 nic! And better yet my legs were incredible silky smooth! I highly recommend these blades!</li>
    <li> I got this item for free courtesy of BzzAgent and Schick. Now,I have never bought razors that cost more than $5. I always thought that it was very unnecessary, but boy was I wrong. I have gone through countless numbers of disposable razor but these are definitely the best razors that have ever touched my skin! It moisturizes my skin and the gooey stuff make shaving so easy! This is so amazing- I shave less and these razors last long (WHAT!?). It is a dream come true. My hair even grows back less coarse as compared to the other razors I used to used. DEFINATELY recommend!</li>
    <li> I loved getting this in my BzzKit for free. It leaves my legs so super soft and smooth. I love the gentle grip.</li>
    <li> I actually got only one of these as a freebie with a can of shaving cream I bought from a store. I tried it out, hoping it would be awesome since it has so many blades and the moisturizer strip. The shaving cream I bought with it reccomends this razor to be used so I thought maybe they would work well together&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I found. The shaving cream is very thick and if you get too much you end up with a razor clogged with shaving cream. Which is not good. I used this razor on my under arms and my legs. On my legs it did good, got a nice smooth shave but because of the shaving cream clogging it did not get everything in one stroke like it should. For my under arms it was terrible! The shaving cream was way too thick to be used for that and the blade just got clogged with shaving cream. Then the moisturizing strip would make so much \\&quot;slime\\&quot; that when I went back a second time, it didn&#x27;t even get any hair. Also I found that I had to rinse off all the shaving cream and then go over it many times to get all the hair. All of this was very irritating to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this again.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors are good razors. I like that they are disposable but different than other disposables they look and feel different. The cap for the blades was great, it snapped on and didn&#x27;t fall off. I didn&#x27;t like the way the razor felt when I shaved, I have sensitive skin so it didn&#x27;t really work for me. The shaving cream was awesome though. I loved the way it went on l, it also smelled nice and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I would recommend me this product to otherS.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using the Schick razors for years. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of them since the first time I&#x27;ve tried one. This one is great and leaves your legs feeling smooth and soft afterwards. It helps get in those hard to reach places too. I highly recommend anyone to try this razor out. It&#x27;s surely a great one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product for free. All opinions are 100% my own and may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the best disposable razor I have used! It makes your skin feel silky smooth and not have those red bumps.</li>
    <li> I got to try Schick Hydro Silk disposables thru Bzzagent, they sent it to me for free in exchange of my honest opinion, I&#x27;m a Gillette Fan, so I tried this product expecting not to like it as much as Gillete, but I was wrong, this is an excellent product every bit as good or better, my favorite part about this razor is the handle, it is so well balanced that I feel it allows you to use just the right amount of pressure to obtain a very close shave, it glides smoothly due to the moisturizing bar on the head, I didn&#x27;t like using shaving cream in addition because it makes the blades gummed up and just the bar worked great all by itself, the 5 blades are impressive and last very sharp for a very long time, shaving every day you could get a good 15 days out of every razor maybe even more, the blades do tend to clog with hair and it is difficult to get water in between 5 blades, but that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars, the rounded head is great no nicks or cuts, I tend to have sensitive skin and the blades did not give me an irritation or razor burn so that&#x27;s great, all in all a great disposable razor</li>
    <li> So I am trying this product for free thanks to Schick  and Bzz Agent. Let me just say, THE BEST RAZORS EVER! I have never had such a close, but smooth shave! I am in love, and will probably never go back to any other razor.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try these razors for free! I&#x27;m super happy I was chosen because I found my new go to razor! These razors rock and are super cute! The grip is amazing! I didn&#x27;t have one slip and you can totally get into every little spot! The shave was super easy.. The razor just glides! I got no cuts and there were no little bumps that you get sometimes after shaving! The shave was the closest shave I have ever had and left my legs extremely smooth and shiny!!! My legs felt so soft and refreshingly hydrated after using them! Great razor! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I got to try Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors for free and I love them. They glide effortlessly across the contours of your body and leave it feeling silky smooth and hydrated! Don&#x27;t fret about there being five razor blades, this actually provides for a closer and smoother shave. If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet you should definitely pick up a pack to get yourself beach whether ready!</li>
    <li> When I first took the Schick Hydro Silk out of the packaging I was more than a little intimated by the 5 blades.  For a while now I have been using the 4 blade Schick Quattro and something about the extra blade screamed &amp;#34;Danger!&amp;#34;  However, I was pretty impressed that I was able to finish the job without any nicks or cuts although I did take extreme care.  It has been 8 hours since I shaved my legs and I have to say that they are probably the smoothest I can remember them ever being.  I think the gel on the blade really did make my legs feel like silk.  I do have a qualm with the gel though - it was too slippery when I was shaving making it hard to use the precise, straight strokes I am accustomed to.  The razor tended to slip around which meant I had to shave over the same parts a few times to make sure I did not have any spots left.  The other problem I had with the razor is that the head is pretty large so it was not good for shaving  my underarms.  I had to contort in awkward ways to get the blade on the skin and even then I was not able to get a close shave.  I think for now I will stick with the Schick Quattro.  I would not recommend the Shick  Hydro Silk to the faint of heart, but I would recommend it to girls that where short-shorts and want silky smooth legs.  I am trying the product for free thanks to Schick via BzzAgent</li>
    <li> After trying Schick Hydro Silk Disposables I do not think I will buy a different razor. I am one to buy things when they are on sale, not being loyal to any brand. These razors work better than the Venus razors in my own opinion. Your skin is left smooth and very moist/hydrated. No more dryness afterwards these razors truly work wonders. The razor itself fits comfortably in your hand while sitting or standing, it&#x27;s very easy to handle. I have tried them with &amp; without shaving cream &amp; they work great either way.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the these razors courtesy of Schick. I loved them, I had never tried this brand but I will now. The razors had a nice grip and I was confident that I was not going to let go of the razors and I felt like I had more control. The razors were nice and gave me a nice clean shave and my legs were left feeling silky smooth. I would definitely recommend this for those summer days coming up.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I received a pack of these razors, containing 3 razor with 5 blades from free from Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blades glide over your legs effortlessly and doesn&#x27;t cause nicks or scrapes.  The handle is very comfortable to hold and you don&#x27;t have to fumble around getting a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your legs feel extremely smooth and moisturized after using this product.  The really isn&#x27;t anything bad that I can say about these razors!</li>
    <li> (I received this from BzzAgent for testing purposes and these opinions are my own)-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these razors. First of all, they are easy to hold. The grip is great and prevents slipping when shaving. When I shaved using these razors I didn&#x27;t cut myself once! That&#x27;s a first. The blade is flexible and is the perfect sharpness. It isn&#x27;t too sharp but not dull at all. It&#x27;s almost impossible to get cut in the knee area. Sometimes I shaved when my leg hair was short and it still got all my hair off my legs. It works well with a close shave as well as a regular shave. I used a razor with 2 blades before trying these and my legs were no where near being as soft, smooth, and hydrated. I have come to the conclusion that 5 blades are way better than 1! Overall, I really love and am impressed with these long-lasting DISPOSABLE razors.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk razor is awesome leaves you&#x27;re legs so soft and smooth. this razor works great on my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I am trying the product for free thanks to Schick.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Disposable...&lt;br /&gt;with this razor you will not be able to tell that it is disposable. one razor will literally last you over 1 month and still be just as good as the day you started using it. I have tried so many different razors and have never had a closer shave. It is absolutely amazing! The five Blades and the flex handle work together to give you the closest shave possible. I have not stopped raving about it yet. it truly speaks for itself once you use it you will not want another razor. one of the best things that I found was that it doesn&#x27;t get that gooey film on the blade after a few uses. I am definitely hooked on this one. You can quickly and safely cover a large area without cutting yourself. So grateful that I got to try it for free through a bzzagent campaign.</li>
    <li> Works really great. I received them complimentary to try thanks to Schick!! I am loving them, and will continue to be a user. My legs felt smooth for days.</li>
    <li> The Hydro Silk feels great when shaving, it is very comfortable to hold, and leaves me with smooth skin. It gives me such a close shave,  It feels like the hair is gone completely.  I received these razors as part of a BzzAgent promotion, and I am so happy that I tried them!.After using the Schick Hydro Silk razor for a week, with daily shaving, the blades are still sharp as can be! The razor has five high-quality blades, and the serum is contained in two narrow strips on the top and bottom of the blades. The head of the razor has a sort of swivel movement that allows it to glide over knees and ankle bones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so thankful I got to try these razors for free as part of a promotion from Schick and thanks to participating in a BzzAgent campaign, because I would have never realized how much I loved these razors! I hadn&#x27;t tried before the schick disposable line and after a couple of weeks of shaving with them I can say I loved the soft &amp; smooth feel left in my skin! I&#x27;ve used other brands of disposable razors in the past but most of them leave my skin irritated and with red bumps, but NOT the Hydro Silk disposable razors. They left my skin hydrated and smooth like a good regular razor would. Would totally recommend it to anyone and everyone. This definitely my fave now! ‪</li>
    <li> I received a free sample for a three pack of Hydro Silk five blade razors, First off I was really excited that the blades had five which means it&#x27;ll pick up more hair on my legs. Luckily the were hydrating which gave my legs a smooth finish. Also,they lasted long and weren&#x27;t dull. I really enjoyed them and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Silk razor is amazing. I was able to try it for free from Schick, but I will definitely purchase in the near future! My legs are super silky and feel hydrated all day long. I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion any more. The curved handle also makes it easy to get around the curves of my ankles and knees. Also because of the unique design of the razor, I know it won&#x27;t stick to the side of the tub after use!</li>
    <li> absolutely loved this razor! Thanks to Schick I was able to try this product for free and i will definately be hitting the stores for more.  The handle is comfortable to hold with a nice grip, even when wet.  The shave was close and very smooth and will recommend this product to everyone.  Even getting to the back of my legs was very easy without knicks and cuts.  I have even let my daughter use the schick hydro razor and she loves it as well compared to the regular store brand ones which gave her cuts.  And since she just began shaving her legs, I feel good about her using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this review short and sweet. Overall, I do enjoy these razors. I use disposables to shave my legs on a daily basis because I find that normal razors dull out too much within the second use and aren&#x27;t worth the price. I was sent these to review through Bzzagent and I was so excited because I normally use the disposables that come with the most razors for the cheapest price - which work very well to give me the closest shave, but are tricky to use because they&#x27;re lower quality, and thus makes it really easy to cut yourself or get a razor burn - So I had to be careful when using them. Thus, the time I took to shave in the shower was a lot longer and required more attention but I felt it was worth it. I ripped the Hydro Silk ones open the day I got them and got in the shower without much expectations. Boy was I wrong. The gel strip on these make shaving so comfortable that you could shave your legs without shaving cream if you wanted to! They really sped up my shaving time and I didn&#x27;t need to be as careful because they were almost impossible to cut yourself with. The only downside is that the gel strip kind of keeps the razor at a distance that isn&#x27;t gliding RIGHT on your leg. So the shave is a little further. It&#x27;s still really good and you probably won&#x27;t care because the difference is that small, but my cheap disposables leave me with the closest shave ever since there is no fancy gel or anything special about them. Also, I prefer the shape of my cheap disposables because it&#x27;s tiny and really precise to where I was to shave. But these disposable are more of a legs and underarm razor than a bikini razor. (Oh and the underarms were SO easy to shave compared to my cheap disposables.) Overall, I highly recommend this product and suggest you give it a go. Especially if comfort and saving time are important to you when taking a shower. The #1 thing for me is the closest shave so I will probably go back to my cheap disposables, but if I had the luxury of having this all the time, I wouldn&#x27;t complain :)</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing razor, it has smooth razors that don&#x27;t cut the knee and make my legs very smooth.</li>
    <li> really love these razors they give a close shave. left my legs feeling soft and hydrated. a little pricy.</li>
    <li> I love using these razors because they provided me a fast, smooth, and nick-free shave every time. I love that there are three razors in the package and for less than $4 each razor, the value is well worth it. I wish that each individiual razor had been in its own plastic wrapper for travel convenience. However, I love that they all included a blue cap to prevent the razors from getting damaged while in my travel case and to keep the razors sharper longer. I love that the handle isn&#x27;t a hard plastic but is very smooth and easy to grip even when wet. The first thing I noticed when using these razors is that they shave off unwanted hair very quickly. With 2 to 3 passes of the razor, the hair came off easily with no nicks or cuts nor the horrible burns that follow. I didn&#x27;t feel the blades while shaving and in fact the only thing I felt was the smooth oval cartridge. Hair always seem to get stuck in the razors I use, but I did not have this problem with Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors. As a result, cleaning the razors did not take a lot of time so I appreciated this convenience. The razors provided a close shave that left my body smoother and hydrated for twice as long as other razors I have used. Moreover, in the hard to reach places, I was able to bend and use the razor easily without any difficulty. I enjoyed using the razors and will continue to buy them and recommend them to my friends. I received a free sample from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. I have really prickly leg hair, which means i have to shave every day. this razors allows me to get a close shave quickly. the moisture bars on the razor replace shaving cream, which may be my favorite part. i am not worried about nicks and cuts. I received this pack of razors to try free from bzzagent. I am really glad that i was able to try out this product, and will continue using it. I bought two packs at target today!</li>
    <li> I think this razor is just about perfect! I have a tendency to shave in a hurry and cut myself, especially my knees!  It moves around the body contours with ease and without cuts. With this razor, it is easy to get a smooth shave without cutting myself.  I took off one star because I wish the softening agent on the razor would last longer and I also wish that Schick had a program to recycle the disposable razors. This razor is large and it feels wasteful to just &amp;#34;dispose.&amp;#34;  I can&#x27;t say enough about how smooth it makes my legs.  I wish I would have had this when I was pregnant!  I highly recommend these razors.  I got this product free to try it but these are my personal thoughts.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Pros first: My absolute favorite part of this razor is the handle design. It has a little foot on the underside that raises the head up so the moisture strip don&#x27;t stick you your tub. Such a small thing, but it makes a big difference to me. Next, I thought this razor did an amazing job on my legs. Sometimes I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was even shaving since it just glides over my skin. I&#x27;m used to feeling the resistance of stubble when I shave, but this razor just glides through like a knife through butter. So mega 5 stars on smooth close shave. As for the moisture strips, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference after shaving. I still needed lotion. But to be fair, I have hard water that leaves my skin dry and itchy no matter what I use. As for the cons, I only have one. I found the head to be to bulky for bikini line shaving. I couldn&#x27;t manuver it well for precise lines or really small areas. But honestly I like this razor enough to keep it for my legs and underarms and just use a different one for my bikini area.I&#x27;m really happy I got to try this product free thanks to Schick and BzzAgent. I&#x27;ll definately be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to try for free by Schick but I refuse to do a fake review just because something is free.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, these razors are AWESOME SAUCE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Being part Hispanic + having PCOS, I tend to be a bit of a hairy lady. My leg hair especially is thick, black and very course. We&#x27;ll just say man legs. &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; These razors do a fantastic job! Smooth, silky, soft legs. What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, does great for my under arms too!&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they were cheaper to purchase but you get what you pay for so, I digress.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for FREE thanks to Schick. I am very impressed with how smooth my legs felt afterwards. I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> When I first tried the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor I was surprised by how nice of a shave I got. The hydro silk gel left my legs silky smooth and the razor moved over the curves of my legs nicely.  These features definitely made the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor better than most disposables out there. Upon the second shave with the same razor I was reminded of why I just don&#x27;t like disposable razors. It was already so dull that it pretty much needed to be thrown away. I  dislike throwing a whole razor away after a single shave. Ijust don&#x27;t think that a disposable razor will ever win me over. (Note: I got the razors free as part of a campaign.)</li>
    <li> Please DO NOT buy disposable razors if you can help it. There is absolutely no reason to use a disposable razor - the non-disposable sort are much better quality, last much longer, are much more cost effective, AND produce far less unnecessary garbage that is chocking the natural world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disposable items are a ploy of merchants who want you to keep buying poor quality items at a lower cost, making you think you are getting a deal but you are not. You will end up paying more over time. And in the process, you will create garbage that ends in landfills, sitting there without degrading for hundreds of years, destroying natural habitats that wild animals need. If you want to live in a world devoid of nature, with poisoned air, soil, and water and filled with mountains of trash, go ahead and buy disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used one Gillette Embrace razor for two years ($9 or so), and have purchased about 3 replacement cartridges since. It still looks and works like new and provides a very fast, perfect shave. Why would you want disposable?</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor to sample and I have to say that this is one of the best razors ive ever used! I have personally decided to exclusively switch to this line by schick. It is so easy to use, 5 blades leave me with a smooth and close shave, and the serum with the first initial use makes it easy to glide and coats your legs making them feel like silk. You can shave without shaving cream the first time! The greatest feature for this product has yet to come, they are afforable for GOOD quality.</li>
    <li> I absoluetely love this razor! I have only ever used the cheapie razors from walmart so I was SUPER excited to get this razor..I am not typically one who can justify spending money on razors...Now that I have tried something much nicer I will be spending the extra money its well worth it!! I shaved my legs last night and they still feel super smooth and very hydrated!! #gotitfree #bzzzagent</li>
    <li> i got these for free to review through bzzagent and I fell in love with these! seriously one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever used. No lie the first time I used it, definitely made my legs feel silky smooth not only all day but the following day as well. it didn&#x27;t cut me once and it even got in the hard to reach places with no problem. it&#x27;s such a nice smooth shave id recommend getting these if you are looking for a disposable razor!</li>
    <li> I had the chance to test out the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor through Bzzagent and am trying the product for free thanks to Schick&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say this is the Best razor I have tried yet! it left my skin silky smooth helped prevent skin irritation plus it is affordable at only $11.99 for a 3 pack</li>
    <li> I received this razor thanks to Schick and BzzAgent! I could not believe the difference from the cheapy old razor I was using to this one! My legs were so super smooth and didn&#x27;t need lotion after like they ususally do! This razor hydrates your legs up to 2 hours! With the awesome handle gripping is no problem and shaving is a breeze! You can tell Schick really thought about how this shaver was designed when they created it, ment for a womens body who has curves and bumps! The price is very affordble for this excellent razor as well as the sleek design fits perfectly in my gym bag!</li>
    <li> These were amazing.  Loved them!  I have super sensitive skin and usually have a reaction to most razors, but these didn&#x27;t do any damage whatsoever.  They kept my skin nice and moisturized long enough for me (I&#x27;m super absent minded and have a short attention span) to slather some lotion on my legs.  P.S. - I received a package of 3 disposables for free to try from Schick.</li>
    <li> I got these razors to test out for free courtesy of bzzagent.com and I absolutely love these razors. They give a close and smooth shave. My legs have never looked this good after shaving them until I used these razors. The only downside is that they are a little pricy for disposable razors but I would definitely reccommend using them.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the Schick hydro silk!  I got to try this free thanks to Schick! I got a really close shave with very little fuss, easy to hold and very smooth.  It is one of the nicest disposable razors I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Best disposables I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin feels really soft after every shave. I&#x27;m currently trying  it for free, thanks to Schick :D</li>
    <li> I LOVE these razors. They offer a really smooth shave even without any additional lubrication. The razor also stays sharper longer, I&#x27;ve noticed. And I didn&#x27;t nick myself nearly as much as I usually. I will definitely be buying more of these razors. I also liked the way the head moved as I shaved. I suppose that is one of the reasons why I did not nick myself quite so much. [[ASIN:B00AHF1GTM Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor, 3 Count]]</li>
    <li> LOVE these razors!! I have never gotten a more silky and smooths have from a disposable razor as with the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables!! I got these razors free from Bzz Agent to try and now I hooked!!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposaes for free for my review and honest opinion.  I absolutely loved them from the first shave.  The result was smooth and my skin felt much more moisturized after than other disposables.  I have purchased more since then and they are truly affordable!!  I will continue on this shaving path with a smile (and smooth legs without razor burn)!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of these razors to review from Bzzagent. I have used a lot of different disposable razors in the past and using Hydro Silk disposables have been my best experience with disposable razors so far. They get a very close shave and my legs are very smooth after using them. I also found that I don&#x27;t have to have as often because my legs stay smoother longer. The blade glides along my skin rather than feeling as if it is scraping the skin. I do not have to worry about getting nicks or cuts. These are worth investing in and I am switching over to Schick as my go-to disposable razor!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Schick and I love using it much better than the cartridge razors that I usually use. It was so easy it use especially in those hard to reach places with the curve sensing blades. It was also easy to handle with its unique design. After shaving my skin was so smooth and it left my skin hydrated all day. I can&#x27;t see myself using any other razors now!</li>
    <li> I got these free from Schick and BzzAgent to try.  I usually use whatever razor is cheapest (though I do steer clear from a couple of brands because they simply slice up my legs terribly).  I have to admit that this is now my favorite razor now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few months. It takes some getting used to. It was weird shaving at first because I wasn&#x27;t really able to feel the blades on my skin. Not a great feeling, but I knew then I was getting the job done. This one just glides over and while it&#x27;s shaving really well, it&#x27;s a feeling I&#x27;m not used to. It&#x27;s a lot more gentle than all other razors I&#x27;ve used. I get minimal cuts when I get any at all. They last a long time. Longer than I should probably be using it but I don&#x27;t throw them out until they stop working... I noticed that this one, the lubricating thingies on the top and bottom actually disappear over time. I&#x27;ve never actually seen a razor do that (though many advertise that they do... but they don&#x27;t). Anyway, I hope to continue finding these and using them. The only issue, honestly, is that they&#x27;re unwieldy when shaving your bikini area.... but what isn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with the Schick Hydrosilk disposable razors, they have changed my views on disposables forever! My legs arke flawless, even after a month of not shaving! No cuts, bumps, or stubble!! Thank you for making a high quality product, within budget! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing razors! I got to try this product for free thanks to Schick and I am now hooked. Great value for price. Leaves skins smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. No irritation or razor bumps! Amazing.</li>
    <li> I think my love and hate relationship with disposable razors is over. I love the performance of this Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor. The design is great, you can get to those hard to reach places. No razor burn and silky smooth. The added moisturizer that is activated with the water is one of the many benefits of this disposable razor; It says it last for two hours after shave, but I didn&#x27;t even notice, because my legs where still silky smooth at the end of the day. I will definitely purchase this Schick Hydro Silk Disposables from now on. Thank you Schick for providing this product for free.</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try this product thanks to BzzAgent and this is an amazing razor, its just silky smooth and it glides so amazing on my skin that i just LOVE IT, highly recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Please note the opinions and views in this review are solely my own, I was given this product for free as a promotion from Schick. This is by far the best razor I have ever used. I don&#x27;t use any razor with less than 4 blades as I get nicked out the wazoo with razors that have less than 4 blades. I have tried the Venus razor and not only did I still get nicked with it I would only be able to get 2 uses max out of the blades where I can get at least 7 uses out of each Hydrosilk cartridge. You do however have to run the razor cartridge under warm water before you shave to activate it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when I received these but after my first shave I was completely impressed. I have tried numerous razors even including men&#x27;s and this one blows all of the competition right out of the water. I have even tried it without using shaving cream and I didn&#x27;t get razor burn which I am prone to getting when I use a razor straight on my skin. I don&#x27;&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any other razors ever again.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Schick.  The razor worked amazing and gave me a really smooth shave.  Despite it having 5 blades, I did not cut myself.  The clean shave seemed to last a while.  Overall, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love the easy to use handle, the moisture strips that leave my legs feeling smooth for days and the close shave I get with 5 blades. The head easily glides over curves making a close smooth shave super easy!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product from Schick.</li>
    <li> I recently got the chance to try out Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors For free. I&#x27;m excited to find a disposal razor that finally fits my needs. The water activated moisturizing serum and curve sensing blades on these razors make shavibg a breeze and leave my legs feeling soft and smooth and nik free.</li>
    <li> This is such a amazing razor! It gets around all of those hard to reach places and also provides great moisture too! It gives your legs an amazing feeling, leaving your skin feel radiant and healthy! I recieved this product for free for testing purposes only from BzzAgent! My opinion is 100% my own!</li>
    <li> I have some hairy arms as a female so I&#x27;m constantly shaving them and this razor made it so easy. It has some built in like moisture beads so you don&#x27;t need a lot of shaving cream or anything . It got an incredibly close shave. No tugging on my skin, no nicks or razor bumps. I love it!. Thank you schick and bzzagent I have a brand new favorite razor!</li>
    <li> i got to try Hydro Silk Disposables thanks to bzz agent and i love them. i normally cant use women razors because i have thick hair but these work great and are easy to hold. i normally have dry ithcy skin after shaving and with these i didnt and i didnt even use lotion after. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Got this free from BzzAgent to try and review and I have to say I love it Iam definitely switching my brand to schick my legs are so smooth no razor burn at all great job schick:)</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get to try this product for free thanks to Schick. I can happily say I have a new go to razor. It is great for shaving around ankles and knees and I didn&#x27;t nick myself once. It was the smoothest shave I have gotten in a long time and my legs will always be summer ready now!!! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and yes I got it for free from a promotion from the brand. It&#x27;s very easy to use and also it go on smoothly. I use it everyday to shave my legs and love it. After use, use some lotion and OMG my skin feels so smooth and comfortable. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I just got these razors as a free promotion and I like them. They are easy to hold on to for shaving, have a nice look, and work well.  I do think they would be better if they just had one handle that came with many disposable heads. And then gave us the opportunity to buy boxes of just more disposable heads. If they did this, it could cut back on waste disposal and be (somewhat) better for the environment. But as far as how well they work, they do shave well.</li>
    <li> I have used many disposable razors and I have to say that the  Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor I got for free to test form Bzzagent has by far been the best disposable razor I have ever used. It glides effortlessly across the skin for smooth silky shave in one pass. The handle design fits perfectly for easy use and the cap for it is child safe yet easily removed by an adult. I have sensitive skin and this razor left me with no irritation even in those hard to reach places, and leaves the skin smooth not dried out after wards.  I have to say I am quite pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> i received this product for free from bzzagent! and i absolutely love it. it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin but it also leaves your skin silky smooth!</li>
    <li> This product couldn&#x27;t have arrived on a better day! I was in such a hurry that morning I had forgotten to shave my legs. I spent all day annoyed by the fact that my legs felt like a cactus. When I got home that evening to find the box from BZZAgent waiting for me, it truly made my day. I had recently in an effort to save money switched to barborsol. It worked okay, but it always left me skin feeling dry, and it seemed like a used a whole bottle of lotion afterwards. With the moisturizing strip on the razor and the shaving cream, my skin felt silky and moisturized. I had been using a different brand of razor and was annoyed with the fact that my razor had a lot of useless parts floating around the actual blades. It made it hard to shave some of the hard to reach area&#x27;s that as a woman you worry about. With the Schick blade it was easy to make sure everything was completely shaved and smooth. Everything about this razor made it easy to get through my morning routine!</li>
    <li> #GotItFree Thank you #Schick for picking me to try the #SchickHydroSilkDisposables from #BzzAgent!! My new favorite razor!! Seriously works great!!</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Super smooth shave without the razor burn!  The moisturizing strip is great too.  Provides a very close shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that im truly loving these razors. I recieved them free for testing and review purposes so that was impressive in itself.&lt;br /&gt;Love the design of the razor along with the five blades because it helps to give you a great close shave. I tried these with the shaving cream and they work in complete harmony. The foam is thick and smooth, comes out and goes on easily, it has a nice smell to it also. I used the shaving cream along with the razor to shave my right leg, it glided with ease and all the hairs came off it was a breeze to shave around my knees and ankles because I usually get cuts their, but I got none after using both the razors and the shaving cream together. After shaving my legs were also much smoother and moisturized even before getting out the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor and soap to shave the top half of my left leg and although it was easy to glide the razor across my skin I got lots of cuts around and behind my knee, my left leg was also not as moisturized as my right. I tried shaving the bottom half of my left leg with just the wet razor but I found it difficult, even though using the razor by itself is very smooth, it was not gliding on my skin in the way it did when I used it with the shaving cream and I also got a few cuts on my ankle. My experence with this razor is very positive and I find it you use it with the shaving cream you will get the closest and smoothest possible shave. Will DEFINITLY be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the way this made my skin feel. I didn&#x27;t need any shaving cream at all. I am always wary though of razors like this that have moisturizing beads or soaps. I find that they typically get grimy quickly and the moisturizing agent funs out faster than the blades. I will have to see how it holds up in the next couple of weeks. I tried this product through a promotion from the brand. I #gotitfree on Bzzagent.com</li>
    <li> These are some of the razors I have ever used. They glide over the skin and leave it silky soft. The curves on the handle make it especially nice to hold even on those personal places. Love these.</li>
    <li> Great job with these disposable razors! I definitely recommend these I received a pack free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received these courtesy of Shick via BzzAgent. These razors are soooo smooth. I couldn&#x27;t even feel them working. I thought they weren&#x27;t shaving b/c I literally felt nothing, but when I rinsed the blade and saw the hair that was shaved, I was shocked! I&#x27;ve only tried it with shaving gel, but I will also try it alone and update the review, if necessary.</li>
    <li> I love these Schick disposable razors i received free from Smiley 360 website. They send free full sized products for our honest opinions. I always used mens shavers since i was a preteen. I always thought disposable razors were cheap and not worth the money but after i received these razors i thought id give them a try. I was pleasantly surprised how great and efficient they were. It has a a moisture strip thats lasts the life of the blade. It gives you such a close smooth shave that lasts for days not hours like the shavers i used in the past. Im greatful that i received these razors because now i will buy nothing else. I hope this will help other woman realize how great disposable shavers are expecially these Schick disposable razors.  Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> What I really like for this razor the most is the serum that gives you the moisture your skin needs when you shave it doesn&#x27;t dry skin at all. It is a really good choice for a disposable razor. Thanks to Schick i tried them from free and I am very happy!! I definetely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I recently got to try  Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables for free thanks to BuzzAgent and Schick. I was at first hesitant to try them since most razors that have serums or add-ons tend to give me rash. However after using the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable along with the Skintimate® Silky Skin Shave Gel  I can honestly say that this is the first razor that hasn&#x27;t given me a rash. It has five blades so it gives you a close shave and is easy to move so you can reach those hard to reach places like the knees and behind them. They are cheap and cute plus they also work for shaving under your arms and for the bikini area. I am going to buy them after I used up the three disposables razors the package brings.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as part of a promotional campaign with Bzzagent. The razors really do give a super close shave while moisturizing at the same time. It gets areas like the knees and behind the knee easily without any nicks. Overall, its a good product if you&#x27;re looking for a disposable razor that&#x27;ll give you smooth legs.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth no joke! Packaging: Awesome package Good to paired with the shaving gel The smell is awesome, no werid stinky razor or maybe that&#x27;s just me that happens to. It leaves a smooth clean feeling after. I like the lasting shave which has been difficult for me to find in a razor lately. I received this a s promotion from bzzagent! I love it greatest in a while !</li>
    <li> These Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor were sent to me for free by bzzagent, the thoughts and opinions of the product are that of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables Pros: 1. Cheaper than my usual brand. 2. Five Blades provide, close shave. 3. Each shave is as smooth, close as the first. 4. Nice cushiony grip on the handle, easy to hold without being slippery. 5. Unscented. Cons: 1. Didn&#x27;t provide moisture. 2. Too much of pivot for my liking. 3. Colors of the handle. Skintimate® Silky Skin Shave Gel Pros: 1. The smell is amazing. 2. A little goes a long way. 3. Rinses clean, without leaving any residue or stickiness. 4. Can doesn&#x27;t leave rust rings. Cons: There are no cons, this stuff is DIVINE. The Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables boasts: Water-activated moisturizing serum hydrates your skin for up to 2 hours after shaving 5 Curve Sensing® blades with skin guards deliver an incredibly smooth shave and help prevent irritation Contoured oval cartridges allow for a closer shave around hard-to-reach places like ankles, knees and underarms The soft, easy-to-grip handle provides superior control The moisturizing serum did absolutely nothing for me, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin more than my normal razor. To be perfectly honest after the second time using the razor I didn&#x27;t even notice the serum. This wasn&#x27;t bad thing for me because, I don&#x27;t have dry skin and I moisturize religiously. The 5 Curve Sensing® blades perform just has promised I haven&#x27;t experienced in nicked myself once and, considering the fact that I shave daily my skin hasn&#x27;t experienced any irritation. Also the fact that I used the same razor for well over a week, and my shave is still as close as when I took it out the package. The Contoured oval cartridges allow for a close shave but, they could be a little more stable, the pivot is wobbly. The grip is amazing, it&#x27;s soft, has ridges easy to hold doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free as part of a promotion. I&#x27;m glad I got it though. The smooth shave lasts for 5 days. That&#x27;s a big deal for me because I have a 5 year old that makes it to where I get no free time and I have pcos. With PCOS, my hair grows back quickly and makes it to where I have to shave more often.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables from Schick and BzzAgent. To give them the ultimate test, I used them for a few days without using shaving cream. The first time I used the razor, I was impressed with how it feels to use. It&#x27;s a smooth shave and seemed to really get all the hairs in one swipe. I felt hydrated, even without shaving cream! The handle made it easy to store without the blades staying wet. I used the same razor daily for over a week before I noticed the hydration had diminished. These are a great option for razors and will be fantastic for going on vacations - I won&#x27;t have to pack more than one razor and won&#x27;t have to worry about trying to remember to bring it home at the end of the trip! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different brands of razors over the years, but Schick Hydro Silk Disposables are by far the best. They provide as close of a shave as refillable razors and leave my legs just as silky and smooth. The handle is extremely comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip when holding it, and the blade cartridge moves around enough to get a close shave even around curves. The exfoliating sponge that came in the package was very nice as well and did a great job leaving my skin soft and ready for shaving. The moisturizing serum on the razor works well on its own, but when used with Skintimate Silky Skin Shave Gel, it&#x27;s even better. After shaving, I didn&#x27;t even need to use lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price. At around $10-12 for 3 razors, it&#x27;s kind of steep. The razors do last through quite a few shaves, though, so you may only need to buy them once every month or two. After experiencing the superior shave these provide, I doubt I&#x27;ll go back to using any other razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I received these razors, the shave gel and an exfoliating sponge for free through BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I received these razors from bzzagents.com and I loved them.  I usually try to buy the cheaper products to save money, but I have to admit that these work so much better than the cheap razors.  I got a much closer shave with them.  When using the cheap ones,  I can shave at night by the next evening, my legs feel a little prickly.  I didn&#x27;t have that problem with these.  By the next evening, my legs were still feeling smooth.  Take my advice, put down those cheap razors and pick these up.</li>
    <li> It can be a big hassle to shave. Finding a great razor to do it is a whole different story. My skin likes to act out (sensitive &amp; dry skin) on top of the eczema thats always there. Anyways I end up using my husbands shaver because it works well on my skin &amp; never leaves a hair behind. I&#x27;m happy to say that these razors do the same for me &amp; a plus is that they aren&#x27;t too bulky where they are too big to hold. Perfect size gripper for my little hands. Its nice to find a disposable that has more than 1 or 2 blades. Great find ladies!&lt;br /&gt;*Received complimentary to review*</li>
    <li> Thanks to Schick, I got these awesome razors to try out for free. I absolutely love using Hydro Silk Disposable razors. My legs feels so smooth and hydrated days after shaving. The handle makes it so simple and easy to shave especially the hard-to- reach places. Hydro Silk disposables are simply amazing.</li>
    <li> For years I have been using store brand razors.  They get the job done, but I was never really excited about them.  When I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors to try as part of a BzzCampaign, I was curious to see what made them different from what I had been using.  Let me just tell you, the difference was night and day!  I have been blessed with some incredibly bumpy knees, which have always made shaving that area a little difficult.  But not with these razors!  They glided over my knees leaving them more smooth than they have ever been.  I really was amazed by this product!  I don&#x27;t usually sit around discussing razors with my friends, but I couldn&#x27;t help it after using this product.  After they tried them, my friends have told me that they love them as much as I do.  These razors are fantastic &amp; I will never go back to purchasing my crappy store brand razors again!</li>
    <li> I got these for testing purposes. I loved these razors! The grip on the handles are amazing. Other razors would sometimes slip so easily out of my hands, causing me to cut myself while shaving sometimes. The hydrating serum leave my legs feeling so amazing. I shaved around midday and by the night my legs were still feeling great. Other razors I have to shave the same spot at least 3 times to get a good shave, but with these I just need to do it once.</li>
    <li> I recieved some of these for free from Schick in my Bzzkit. I must say I got a super close shave and my legs felt super soft into the next day. I gad no knicks, even in the knee area. Which is a huge plus for me. Also it didnt irritate my sensitive skin! I will definitely be repurchasinf these</li>
    <li> These razors are great. They are disposables, but very high quality. Just as good as a non-disposable. They have five blades, and get a very close smooth shave. I&#x27;ve used them several times already and haven&#x27;t knicked myself once. They have a serum that leaves you&#x27;re skin very soft, and until the serum runs out there is practically no need for shaving cream. I also liked how the razor was contoured so that when I set it down in the shower, the blades are never laying flat. Thanks Schick! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> With spring here and summer around the corner I have had to shave my legs a lot, I am Italian after all. I usually run into the issue of my legs getting irritated and I have to switch to jeans for a few days. Since using this razor and the accompanying shaving cream my legs are still smooth and no bumps or irritation at all. The closest shave I have had in a while. I received a sample of this product to try but this is my honest opinion and I will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> These are the best disposables i have ever used! They get a close shave without giving you razor burn. And they left my skin feeling silky smooth! I got a free pack thats to shick and buzzagent!</li>
    <li> I love these razors my legs are very smooth and no nicks or cuts! I have definitely switched my razors! #gotitfree #SchickHydroSilkRazors!</li>
    <li> yes!!! finally a razor that doesn&#x27;t break me out and set my legs on fire. it is really great and it seems like the blades last a lot longer than my usual razor. If you have sensitive skin i highly recommend it. Thanks to BzzAgent for sending it to me for free :)</li>
    <li> Even though I got a pack of these free to try for a promotion, I still started off a bit skeptical with these...so skeptical that I almost declined the free try.  I have very sensitive skin and most disposable razors leave me either broken out, itchy, and/or cut to ribbons.  I was almost out of razors and broke, though, so I thought &amp;#34;let&#x27;s give it a go&amp;#34;.  These provided a smooth, close shave and gave me no irritation whatsoever.  They leave your legs feeling soft and hydrated and the handle design gives you a nice grip that isn&#x27;t slippery even after you&#x27;ve got 14 pounds of soap, bath gel, or shaving cream on your hands.  Definitely recommend these and it is something I&#x27;ll be repurchasing in the future as I&#x27;d MUCH rather have a disposable razor than fiddle with the stupid cartridges.</li>
    <li> What I like about this razor is how my skin after shaving, it feel soft like a baby. Also that it have 5 gillette and is disposable.</li>
    <li> I received Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable blades for free to try them out. Let&#x27;s just say they are AMAZING! I get such a clean shave with them. My legs are knick free and soft and as smooth as silk! If you haven&#x27;t tried these, you are missing out!! Pamper your skin and get them!!</li>
    <li> LOVED the new Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors! They are contoured to give you a great shave in the hard to reach places and with 5 Curve Sensing blades and skin guards, they really give a smooth shave without worry! The water activated moisturizing serum keeps your skin hydrated for a long time after using - the only problem with this is that if you leave them in the shower to long it gets really gross and sticky! ‪#‎gotitfree‬ with BzzAgnet</li>
    <li> Until recently i had all but given up on using disposable razors to shave my legs and forearms. They left my hair follicles dry, scaly, irritated and did not provide a close shave after multiple passes.... but then i received a free sample of Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors to try from Bzz Agent. Let me say i am super impressed with the close, smooth silky shave. no longer does my legs and arms look like i was trying to shave while balancing on a beach ball. Hair removal is now a breeze and my skin is not as irritated as before and the best part no more razor burns and nicks. yayyy my legs are happy... im happy and i have gotten multiple uses out of these. Worth the money when i decide to buy them...  #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I used this razor and really liked it. The razor left the skin smooth and cut very close to the skin, however I did get a small cut.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good for back-up razors, but I still like my Gillette Venus as my favorite. I received these as a Bzz campaign along with a shaving kit of cream and bath puff. Overall, everything was pretty average but definitely better than a regular disposable razor. It would be my second runner-up. :)</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for many reasons... Yes it obviously does a great job shaving. It couldn&#x27;t be a great razor without doing it&#x27;s job. Other things I like about this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room when traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I love the most is that the head is raised up (so it don&#x27;t stick to surfaces!) -I will attach a picture so you can see what I mean... My other razors didn&#x27;t have a lifted head like this! I think this really helps the razor last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is so light weight, it also helps make shaving comfortable. My wrist does not get tired and the razor hugs every curve! Usually when I try a new razor I end up getting nicks and cuts, but not with this one! This is my new favorite brand! I love everything about Schick&#x27;s Hydro silk!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product FREE! thanks to Bzzagent and Schick&#x27;s! But I continued to buy this razor, because I really like it that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy Venus with the disposable heads, but they were SO expensive... This razor has the same great quality without the expensive price!&lt;br /&gt;This whole razor is disposable... So when it is dull you through away the handle, head and all of it! and grab a brand new one :)</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty bomb. I don&#x27;t have any issues with this at all. As a mom, its hard to find time to shave but this makes it so easy and fast. I don&#x27;t have to worry about nicks, razor burns, or cuts when shaving quickly. After many weeks of use, the razor is still in new condition. While it is disposable, it lasts much longer than any non-disposable I have ever used. I will definitely continue to use this and will purchase it in the future. I received this through a bzzagent campaign initially but I am definitely SOLD!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! These razors leave my legs feeling wonderful afterwards. I plan on replacing these for my old razors! I love how there is a long after moisturizuring that keeps your legs feeling smooth for a longer time. Thanks bzzagent for letting me test and review these products for free! I also love that the razor gets close as possible and also gets the hard to shave places as well. I would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> These razors are pretty good on legs and underarms but not the bikini area...the moisturizing serum is great if you have to shave in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to slather yourself in shaving cream. Little to no nicks. An overall pleasant experience with these! I got these free to try from BzzAgent, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a disposable razor, this is a great one! It&#x27;s often hard to find a disposable razor with 5 blades that doesn&#x27;t cost almost as much as a non disposable. I love having 5 blades, as it provides a closer shave. The Schick Hydro Silk Disposables also has a pivoting head that moves up and down to help contour to your body. The grip feels nice in your hand and prevents it from slipping. They also have a moisturizing strip on them, sometimes I don&#x27;t like those because they make my skin feel slimy, but this one I actually feel like it hydrates my legs. I use this in conjunction with Skintimate&#x27;s Skin Therapy Shaving Gel with Moroccan Oil. My legs haven&#x27;t been dry since I started using these products together and shaving once every 2-3 days. I have 4 kids and don&#x27;t rarely have time to shave every day, so it&#x27;s nice that I can go a few days and still have a close shave and moisturized legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product free as a member of BzzAgent.com who receives free or discounted products and services in return for honest feedback of products.</li>
    <li> Loving this shaver i get to test out free thanks to Schick! There is really no comparison the the quality and durability of these shavers. Only thing that i found gross was how the gel stuff oozes out while shaving and continues to.. BUT i would recommend this shaver to  anyone! These will outlast any of your basic shavers by 10x!! love it!!</li>
    <li> I received these from Schick to try and I love these razors!  My legs feel so smooth and hydrated after using them! I am used to disposable razors wearing out and feeling very uncomfortable after less than a week, but these razors are still smooth and comfortable after well over a week, and they still shave just as close! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the 5 blades or the moisturizing serum or a combination of the 2 but these razors feel great while using them! Worth the extra money over the cheapo disposable razors!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this razor. My legs felt so smooth and moisturizer after I used it. I was able to try this product for free from @hydrosikkdisposables. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> This is a really great razor, it&#x27;s very easy to use. This razor has 5 amazing blades thats get rid of the hair you don&#x27;t want. The Schick hydro silk razor leaves your legs smooth and shiny giving your legs a clean feeling. I received these for free from Bzzagent and since then I&#x27;ve been purchasing these must buy 😊</li>
    <li> Best disposable razor on the market currently.  I received a free box to try from BzzAgent and Schick.  Great close shave with no razor burn.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Disposables don&#x27;t even feel like disposables. It&#x27;s a great quality product for a low price. The hydrating strip is amazing and is key here and much more superior than others. It makes your legs fell so soft and smooth all day long! And with this razor you get a really close shave. The handle is also very easy to hold and grip.  ‪#‎thanksbzzagent‬ ‪#‎gotitfree‬</li>
    <li> I have always been one of those people who would change their razor brand every time I would need to buy some new ones because I could never find one that could give me a close enough shave. I received these razors as part of promotion for the brand through BzzAgent, but that definitely does not effect my opinion of the product. Trust me, this will give you an amazingly close shave that lasts for days. I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion every time I shave, because these razors do an amazing job at moisturizing my legs! If you have a problem finding a razor that can give you a close shave and soft, silky legs, get these immediately!!!</li>
    <li> I really do like these razors. Schick sent me these razors to try for free and I used all the coupons to go buy more right away. They do have a very gooey hydrating bar that lasts quite a while. The shape of the handle is super nice and it does not let the blade or moisture bar touch anything to get stuck to it when laying it down. I had no problem with razor burn, so all 5 razor blades are super sharp. For a disposable razor I was very happy with this product, especially with the price point!</li>
    <li> Love these disposable razors! Close, smooth shave every time. Easy to shave those hard to shave areas, and leaves you free of nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is when using these razor with some shave gels, because of the moisturizing serum from the razor it would takes a few rinses to remove excess product. I would often omit shave gel from my shaving routine because of this, but continued to get a nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand, but opinions are 100% my own #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors! My legs felt hydrated after shaving and lasted for days!  The blades glided smoothly along my legs and we so easy to shave those hard-to-reach places.  The blades also glided along my ankles and knees without cutting the skin!  The handle and cartridge design make shaving easy!  This is my new go-to razor from now on!</li>
    <li> These disposable razors are good to use, they do a good job. The Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors gets all the hair that I want to get removed and leaves my skin feeling great. It was easy to use and I didn&#x27;t feel no irritation during or after using it. I just wanted to state that I got a free sample to try thanks to Schick.</li>
    <li> Best Razor I&#x27;ve tried!! Moisture strip does not interfere with closeness of shave, but has enough moisture to not need shave gel! No razor burn and super smooth legs!  I received these for free as part of a promotion from the brand, however I have continued to buy them regularly! LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I would give this razor 4.5 stars if I could. I&#x27;m impressed on many levels on the performance of this disposable razor. Here are some things I judge a razor on and how this one stacks up: Blades - this razor has 5 blades and I will tell you they are very sharp. I&#x27;m a quick shower shaver and the first use I did get one cut on my leg. I definitely took my time on my underarms! It is a very close shave as well, meaning it only took one pass to get all the hair. Handling - comfortable to hold and maneuver. The head moves with your curves. The handle has the look and feel of my normal razor; not the cheap plastic stick you find with most disposables. Razor Burn/Dryness - after several uses with one razor I have not experienced any razor burn. I contribute this to using a good shave gel along with the moisturizing serum. I did have a little dryness above my ankles after one of my shaves, but I typically use a lotion immediately afterwards and that time I didn&#x27;t. Overall this razor meets my needs and lasts longer than just a few shaves. It even works well at &amp;#34;delumberjacking&amp;#34; after those winter months! Ladies you know what I&#x27;m talking about :)   I was able to try this product free thanks to Schick, however, this did not sway my review.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from BzzAgent to try, and i&#x27;m glad I did!! I usually just steal....I mean barrow one of my Bf&#x27;s disposable razors but the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable is sooooooooo much nicer. I love the handle on it, because sometime when i use the razors with the really skinny boxed shaped handles in the shower I usually end up dropping the razor 5,000 times. The 5 blades allow me to get a smoother shave....and in less time and my skin feels moisturized after i&amp;#34;m done.</li>
    <li> My biggest worry about using razors is the fear of cutting myself.  Fear no more - these Schick Hydro Silk Razor helped me be nick/cut free.  The handle is not bulky or flimsy and has a rubber like handle for a perfect grip.  The 5 blades plus the handle allow me to get a real close shave, only having to go over the area once w a light press to my skin.  Its also durable as I have had razors in the past where i have had the head of the razor break off if I dropped it even once in the shower- this i didnt have to worry about. It feels great when shaving and afterwards leaves me with super smooth skin. Definitely give these a razors a shot. I received these razors as part of a free promotional campaign and was so pleased they worked</li>
    <li> These were just OK. The blade sharpness was great (as was the quantity of blades), however the hydrating stick became goopy and disintegrated within 2 shaves. This made shaving difficult because it was all caught up in the blades. The shave would have been just as smooth without the strip. I was also a little bummed that after only a week and a half in the shower, the blades started to rust. I had the sheath on and everything but water still leaked in. Nonetheless, not bad for a free razor, compliments of Bzzagent. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for those wanting to try out nicer disposables. I got to try this free from Schick through BzzAgent and they have changed my mind about disposables. I have a tendency to rush while shaving, which results in cuts and razor burn, but even if I rush, this razor leaves everything very smooth. It pairs even better with a shaving gel and keeps my legs from over-drying or looking ashy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars is because I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to and it has encouraged me to try similar products. All my previous disposable razors were dirt cheap in both price and effectiveness, so I&#x27;m looking forward to trying &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; disposables like this one!</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors are my new favorite for summer legs. Not only do they give a close shave but I didn&#x27;t get any knicks on my knees either! They are so moisturizing that sometimes I don&#x27;t even shaving cream to get a great shave. Now I can rock my short shorts without having to worry about yucky stubble. Thanks Schick for letting me try these for free!</li>
    <li> When I first received these shavers free from BzzAgent I was so excited....I loved the sleek design and 5 blades.  After using them for a few days my legs started itching like crazy.  I continued using them for awhile longer because I thought that it was maybe due to dry skin.  After a week, the moisturizing serum had fallen off...the shaver is still usable after that...so that&#x27;s a good thing.  On the bright side once it did fall off...my legs didn&#x27;t itch near as bad.</li>
    <li> I got to try a sample of these razors free from Schick and through BzzAgent. This product works just as well as the Non-Disposable version (which is what I was using before trying this product)!  This product is great for those who have sensitive skin as it has a moisturizing serum which helps soothe skin for a few hours after shaving. It is also a durable razor, which is good for getting your money&#x27;s worth, the razor stays sharp for a good amount of time. I enjoy this product and other Schick Hydro Silk products. I would recommend them to all women. The 5 curve hugging blades give a close shave and the easy grip handle makes shaving a breeze. For being a disposable razor, this is the best razor I have used.</li>
    <li> These are the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever used. They leave my legs feeling super soft, smooth, and hydrated! These razors don&#x27;t leave my skin with razor burn like other disposable razors have before, and they&#x27;re very inexpensive! When you pair them with a good shaving cream, it leaves your legs 10 times smoother and more hydrated for at least 2 days! The 5 blades are curved which is perfect for getting those hard to reach places without cutting you! I&#x27;ll never go back to the terrible disposable razor brands that cut my legs and leave me with terrible razor burn. Schick Hydro Silk razors are the way to go!  I was able to test this product for free thanks to Schick and BzzAgent! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I  was so excited  that I got to try this razor free from Schick and BzzAgent! I usually go the cheap route, whichever gets the job done, BOY I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing!! This razor gave me such a close shave and I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area time after time. I also love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream if I&#x27;m in a hurry because of the moisture strips. The handle is another favorite, it has a nice smooth grip and I don&#x27;t feel like it could slip out of my hands as easily as others could. I&#x27;m definitely switching over!  was so excited  that I got to try this razor free from Schick and BzzAgent!

    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor as a test product from Schick through BzzAgent.  I honestly didn&#x27;t have very high expectations for this razor because I thought it was going to be &amp;#34;just another disposable razor&amp;#34;. Boy was I wrong!  And how pleasantly surprised I was!  The handle was easy to grip and fit comfortably in my hand.  With the 5 Curve Sensing blades, not only did I experience the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever received from a disposable razor, but also no nicks, scraps, or cuts.  It easily contoured to the hard-to-reach places and didn&#x27;t miss a hair.  My skin felt so smooth and hydrated throughout the day.  The razor doesn&#x27;t ever seem to get dull and lasts a really long time.  This little gem performs as well, if not better, than regular, non-disposable razors!  This is definitely my new go-to razor!</li>
    <li> i got to try the product for free thanks to Schick and all opinions are my own being a woman you go through alot of razors in your life time ive tried many brands over there years some better than others if your like me always on the go you look for a razor that does the job right  sometimes if im in a huge rush ill dry shave fast and other razors with nick and tear my legs up Schick Hydro silk razor glides over my legs and does not tear me up at all the mositure bar does its job well  so if your looking for a good razor  buy it and test it out your self</li>
    <li> I received my first razor as a free trial from BzzAgent, but instantly fell in love with how close of a shave I got. My skin is left smooth and soft immediately after the first shave. I love this razor so much I have bought multiple packs.</li>
    <li> Got this product from bzz agent. Best razor so far! I was able to keep the same blade much longer than normal. Not only did it not turn dull quickly but i didn&#x27;t even have to use cream! The water alone with the razor was fine. Thanks!!!! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Three razors were delivered April 25 2015 and I started using one right away, shaving my face every day and my head approximately every other day. This morning I realized the first razor was not as smooth as before so I tossed it and started using a new one.  So the first lasted 48 days, from April 26 to June 13, or about 7 weeks,  so 8 razors should get me through a year, at a cost of about $25 for the year.  Some razors might cost less, but this one is beautifully designed and smooth and gives a very close shave.  It is particularly good for shaving my head, without any nicks.  I will be re-ordering.  UPDATE, AUGUST 8 On June 14 I discarded first razor.  Now, 16+31+8 &#x3D; 55 days, nearly 8 weeks  later, discarding second. The second is still shaving, and I could go on using it. But it&#x27;s definitely taking several swipes where a new razor would take just one.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product free in my bzzkit and it is amazing! The razor gives me such a close shave without any cuts. And my legs are so smooth and moisturized afterwards. I don&#x27;t have to shave as much as I would with another brand. I will definitely continue to buy there razors and I am definitely going to recommend these to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I tried these razors and absolutely loved them. I received them to try for free thanks to Schick. I was not disappointed. It left my legs very hydrated. It was a smooth shave. I was able to go faster than usual as well, I didn&#x27;t have to shave the same spot several times to achieve smooth results! I happen to love the look and feel of the razor as well. It is a natural fit and I don&#x27;t drop the razor over and over like some other brands. Will definitely be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I was a bit adamant to receive these razors as a promotional item from BzzAgent. The only experience I have had with disposable razors was back in middle school when I first started shaving my legs and used a Lady Bic that resulted in also using an entire box of band-aids afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, these razors were very soft and moisturizing as well. I even did the ultimate test by using only soap and water for one shave, and the razors worked just as well. I would definitely buy these in the future.</li>
    <li> The product to be use any where on your body doesn&#x27;t sting or itchy like other product cause I got sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I got these free in a bzzagent box and I usually don&#x27;t lie anything but Venus but they actually made my legs silky smooth love them</li>
    <li> Looking for a close shave that requires no shaving gel? Schick Hydro Silk is your razor. This razor has hydrating serum that makes your skin silky smooth! Unlike other designs that have a similar moisturizer built in that get stuck to every surface due to design, this one will not! It has a unique raised handle that keeps the razor head out of water and intact to ensure every shave is a great shave! While five blades seems a little overkill, I really feel that you get a close shave incomparable to three blade razors. Definitely give this razor a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry you did! Close, shave and smooth skin? Definitely a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for testing purposes for free from Schick and BzzAgent. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I love my new Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor. I received them free, through BuzzAgent.com, as a part of the brand promotion, and i have got to say this is the best disposable razor i have used yet. No razor burn, no messy cream, and a perfect shave. Its movable head (which is not common for a disposable) let me get every hair without trouble. I will for sure be buying these in the future! Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from a BzzAgent campaign. This razor is of such good quality. It&#x27;s durable, fits very nicely in my hand, one swipe and all the hairs were gone! no going over the same spot multiple times. I felt very comfortable with it knowing that I was not going to get cut using it. The razor is probably one of my favorites i&#x27;ve ever used and I will definitely purchase this product again. Luckily the 3 I received will last me a good while :)</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample from bzzagent.com and after using hydro silk razors I noticed immediately how soft and silky it made my legs feel and how there was no left over stubble because of the closeness of the 5 blades! I always get razor burn, and it did not happen this time! So incredibly impressed, I definitely recommend hydro silk disposables.</li>
    <li> I was so lucky to get these for free from Shick to try out and fell in love! The shave is so close and glides so smooth! My skin really felt hydrated for hours!</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro Disposable razors are extremely similar to the non disposable version. They have the same serum around the blade of the razor. Because of that it can feel a little goopey and make it a little hard to tell how close the shave is until you rinse it off. But it is a close shave without a lot of razor burn. When shaving my legs there was no razor burn but there was some under my arms. I tend to have very sensitive skin so this wasn&#x27;t a surprise for me, but it was less that most razors. The handle is the same shape as the non disposable version. It has a nice grip and does not easily slip out of your hands when wet. The handle might be a little less stiff than the regular version but not noticeable unless you are really pressing down on it. The head of the razor basically identical to the non disposable version. The only difference I noticed was that it was a little stiffer. The head seems to not move as freely as non disposable. The one thing the disposable has that the regular version doesn&#x27;t is a cap that covers the razor when not in use, while the non disposable has a suction cup for the wall instead. Overall the razor provides a good shave with minimal razor burn issues. I tend to fall on the extremely sensitive skin side of the scale and this razor did not give me any issues. Compared to the non disposable the shave is identical, so if you like those razors you will still like these. So if you have sensitive skin and are looking for a disposable option this is one I would recommend trying out.  I received this product as part of a promotional campaign.</li>
    <li> These razors are absolutely perfect! they not only leave my skin feeling so smooth but they really love move with your leg! these are perfect fro traveling and EVERYDAY use! i absolutely love them! i got them as a free samlple from bzzagent and i will definatly be buying these! well worht it!</li>
    <li> I love these new razors and shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love the water activated moisturiser. It makes shaving feel much more comfortable and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five blades mean you really only need to go over an area once and it&#x27;s super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my ultimate favourite thing about these razors is the amazing shape of the handle and head. Something about the way it&#x27;s designed makes it really easy to control. It&#x27;s so easy to get a great result around my ankles and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave gel feels luxurious and smells lovely. Together these razors and shave gel make shaving feeling like pampering rather than a chore! Love them!</li>
    <li> I recieved these in a bzzagent campaign, Used them as soon as I got them. It was amazing. I shaved 3 days ago and my skin is still super soft. These were the first razors that didnt leave razor burn on my skin.</li>
    <li> Honestly,  I  am  normal  very stuck  up  about  razors  but I  got  this  for  free to  write  an  honest  review from  BzzAgent.com so  I  figured  I  will try  them  and  am  so  glad  I did.  I  seriously  love  them  and  am  shocked  they  are  disposable  razors!! I  have  extremely  sensitive  skin  on  my  lady  parts  but used  a  new one  and  it  worked  better  than the  razors  I  spend  alot of  money on to  get  a  better  shave  and  best  of  all  days  later  NO  RAZOR BURN!!!  My  skin  on  my  legs  is  the softest they  have  ever  been!  So  glad  I  found  these  much  cheaper  razors  that  actually  work  better  than  high  priced  one&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> First off.. Five blades. I almost don&#x27;t even need to go any further! The more blades the better in my book. The razor shaves like a dream and I have muscular legs so the blade hugged and grooved the curves in my leg effortlessly. Normally after a shower I rub my legs down with lotion but for the sake of trying this free sample, I opted not to. I didn&#x27;t expect much (probably the regular dry ashiness of no lotion.. But my legs were surprisingly not too bad. Super impressed. I also liked the blue color.. Pretty. And I liked the curved grip handle, that was nice too. I was given the opportunity to try this product for free and my opinion was my own.</li>
    <li> I want to let everyone kno that these razors are amazing! I have never had a closer shave. I had the opportunity to try the razors free through shick and i thank them for the opportunity because i was introduced to an amazing product! It leaves a slick smooth surface in its place where ever it goes. I will totally be buying more of these with confidence I am getting a great product! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I think this is a great razor! It&#x27; has water-activated moisturizing serum that hydrates your skin &amp; helps give back moisture. No dry skin for these upcoming warmer months. It gives you a close smooth shave, is disposable and the price is very reasonable. I would recommend these razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try this product for free thanks to Schick!</li>
    <li> I am over the moon about these razors! I just recently received a full sample pack, thanks to Schick, and am sold on these. I have always been prone to razor burn but Ive shaved with these twice, and both times there was no razor burn in sight! I also noticed a nice scent to them. They defiantly left my legs feeling silky smooth, but I still applied lotion after the shower for extra moisture. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was because after the first time using the razor, the little moisture beads were kinda gooey and stuck on my shower shelf. No big deal tho. I highly recommend these razors!</li>
    <li> I have been using Schick Hydro razors since they came out in 2010 and have loved them every since. I refuse to use any other razor, I no longer get razor burn or cut myself. Thanks to the water-activated moisturizing gel I no longer have to worry about putting lotion on my legs every time I get out of the shower! And now with them being disposables I don&#x27;t have to worry about changing the blade and possibly cutting my finger or having the blade pop off while shaving. My only wish is for more then 3 to be in the box!   I also got my latest box free from Schick.</li>
    <li> This is legitimately the best razor I have ever used, and not just in the family of disposable razors. It gives me a closer, smoother, and more comfortable shave than my husband&#x27;s expensive razor. I&#x27;m in love! Whether I take my time or do a quick and hurried shave (usually with my toddler in the shower with me trying to wash my shaving cream off as soon as I put it on), I get a fantastic shave no matter what. And I love the moisturizing serum! My legs feel so great when I get out of the shower! I don&#x27;t even remember to put lotion on them half the time now cause they feel so hydrated. I have found my forever razor!&lt;br /&gt;What makes it even better is that I got this razor FREE from bzzagent.com! I would have never found this razor if it weren&#x27;t for that site. Best day ever!!!</li>
    <li> My skin did not like that razor. I cut myself every time with it and end up with a rash. Regular Schick disposable works a lot better for me.</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found.  I originally purchased these at my grocer only because I had a high dollar coupon and they were on sale.  I have been totally impressed.  I shave nearly every day and my first razor lasted for months before finally having to be replaced, off setting the cost. The 5 blade technology leaves me smooth and clean with no razor burn and seemingly little chance of nicks or cuts. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to manage.  The grip is great and doesn&#x27;t slip in the shower.  This is now my new razor and I don&#x27;t see myself changing soon.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free in a bzzagent kit from Schick.  This razor is really nice to shave with the five blades and handle make for a very smooth shave.  I am cheap so i did not use the provided shave gel so i could decide if i liked the razor just using it as I normally would.  I generally just use soap and a cheap disposable razor.  I really liked the smooth feeling and my legs felt great afterward i did not need to apply lotion.  My only dislike of the product was the &amp;#34;Moisturizing Serum&amp;#34; was really intense.  Once it gets wet is turns into a slime that is extremely slick.  I had to rinse it off every swipe or it would get to slick and not cut the hair, i am not sure what would happen in you use the shave gel.  One good thing is that the blades clean out really easy so it will last longer.  Also make sure that you store it with the head up.  I accidentally left mine in a little bit of water and the next day it was stuck to the soap holder.  When i got it unstuck it had pulled a lot of the moisturizing serum on the bottom portion.  I like the razor i would purchase it again, it does have a good design and leaves your legs feeling good.</li>
    <li> i think i like shaving now.... these make my legs feel so smooth and are so amazing to use. it is sharp but so smooth that it&#x27;s not even like shaving.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing disposable razor! I received a free pack to try from Schick, and am very pleased. The handle is super comfortable. This is the smoothest shave I have found in a razor since I first tried a Venus. You can hardly even feel the razor! For a disposable razor it doesn&#x27;t get much better!</li>
    <li> I got these through BuzzAgents as a sample pack with the Skintimate Argon Oil Shave Gel.  The shave gel was nice and silky without an overpowering scent. The razors gave a nice close shave and were easy to maneuver.  The razors don&#x27;t have quite enough moisturizer on them to give a great shave without bumps.  If I hadn&#x27;t used the shave gel I would have had some razor burn going on. They&#x27;re good for travel and vacations, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I received these disposable razors for free through BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m really glad I had an opportunity to try them. There  were so many great features about the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors that I really loved to make this five stars. I really enjoyed the gripping handle and the handle itself fit comfortably in my hand. This razor is packed with a really great moisturizing serum, my first time I used them I also used a shaving cream however I found that to be a little overkill. The five blades made for a nice close shave without irritating or nicking my skin. When storing my razor I normally flip my razor over because if I don&#x27;t flip it over the serum from the razor will just ooze all over the place creating a huge mess. But with these razors you don&#x27;t have to flip the razor over, the razor has a slight curve to it to avoid that mess. The end results left my legs smooth and soft and I&#x27;m still finding it hard to believe that it&#x27;s just a disposable razor!</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for the past two weeks and I am in love! The blade gives you a close, smooth shave and the lotion beads keep your skin nice and hydrated. I will definitely be using this again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and if i dont use a 5 blade razor i break out and it just doesnt give me the close shave that i want. But with schick hydro silk its glodes over the skin effortlessly while also shaving the hairs down to give u an optimum shave.  I did try the skintamate shaving cream and even though it says that it has added lotion i still needed a moisterizer but it still got the job done. Needless to say im pleased with this product and i give it A thumbs up</li>
    <li> I got the opportunity to try this product for free from Schick, along with the Silky Skin shave gel. I was impressed with the time span between shaves. I felt like it gave me a close shave. I usually get razor bumps after a day from shaving but that did not happen with these. I liked how soft and hydrated my skin felt from using this product along with the shave gel. I didn&#x27;t find it easier to use than other razors but I did like the raised head which keeps it from sticking to the tub between uses.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Shick, I got to try this product for FREE! I absolutely LOVE it! This is the best shave I have ever gotten, especially from a DISPOSABLE razor! These have a water-activated moisturizing serum that makes it feel like you&#x27;re not even shaving! My legs felt moisturized for HOURS after using these razors and I did NOT use lotion after shaving! They are also hypoallergenic and dermatologist-tested, which is great because I have really sensitive skin! The razors have contoured oval cartridges, 5 independent, curve sensing blades and skin guards that make it easy to get an efficient shave and help to not irritate your skin. The handle has a rippled rubber grip that makes it easier to hold onto while shaving AND you can lay them blades down and not have to worry about them touching a surface! I would definitely suggest having these bad boys in your bathroom, gym bag, purse, friends house or wherever! LOVE them! Thanks Schick!</li>
    <li> These razors are FABULOUS!!! I was given a free sample of these razors through bzzagent and schick (though I am giving my honest opinion freely). I had originally planned on doing a side by side of my legs to see if these actually worked. Well, I got done shaving my first leg with this razor and after feeling how smooth this razor made my leg I decided to try that side by side later and just shave with this one. I still can&#x27;t bring myself to shave with my old razor. It leaves my legs smooth, moisturized, and looking great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received a 3 pack of these from BzzAgent to try, I did NOT purchase them. I was a little skeptical because they are disposables but I was very surprised at how nice of a shave I got from them! It didn&#x27;t feel like a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; type shave where I was waiting to be cut by the razor but it was a smooth one like I would have gotten from a normal non-disposable razor. I haven&#x27;t priced these in stores yet but I plan on buying more if its more cost effective than replacing the blades for my other razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always iffy with disposable razors. But once I tried these, I was amazed. They work great. I love them.</li>
    <li> Loving my hydro silk razor! It has given me a really close shave and made my legs super smooth! I suffer from dry skin and I found that both the razors and shaving cream give me legs more hydration and don&#x27;t dry me out. My husband is loving my smooth legs for sure!</li>
    <li> well I must say I have had my fair share of going through various razor brands and I can honestly say with past experience the disposables are never in the same league of the expensive razors with expensive replaceable heads, until now! I was STUNNED by how durable the handle and just complete razor is for a disposable I had previous purchased neutrogena disposables sitting in the way back of my under the sink bathroom cabinet and holding them both in my hands I felt like I could literally crush the neutrogena one with my bare little hand and it was a lot harder to shave with being so damn flimsy but the schick disposable feels like a real sturdy reusable razor with that big price tag!!&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve definitely let the &amp;#34;winter coat &amp;#34; go for maybe a little longer the I should have, (it&#x27;s been a rough winter ladies right ;)) and I figured even with how durable the shock disposable is, with my leg hair length it would definitely take more then just one swipe over. I was blown away and completely amazed when I went from ankle to knee in one swift motion and it was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!!&lt;br /&gt;It cut my normal routine in HALF not having to keep going on the same spots to get the stragglers that just didn&#x27;t make it!&lt;br /&gt;I had really lost all faith in disposable razors altogether thank you SCHICK for PROVING to me a razor can be disposable , durable , AND affordable!!</li>
    <li> Received free sample from BzzAgent to review, but opinions are mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems odd to get excited about a razor, I know. But when it&#x27;s something that you spend time doing every day and if you choose a bad one, it can hurt, then it&#x27;s important. I&#x27;ve used many razors-- cheap ones, expensive ones, manual ones, electric ones. I&#x27;ve been happy with some and I&#x27;ve hated others. In the past year, I started using a men&#x27;s razor and just stuck with it because it didn&#x27;t require much thought. When I received this package from BzzAgent, I immediately opened it. I don&#x27;t usually open my sampling packages right away. Sometimes it takes me a day or two. But this one, I wanted to try right away. I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for the past two weeks and I&#x27;ve liked it so far. First of all, it is bigger than the average disposable razor. I&#x27;d say about 50-75% bigger. The handle is also curved and raised and is comfortable to hold. It feels more like a non-disposable razor than a disposable one, if that makes sense. There are 5 blade. I used to think that three blades were plenty, until I experienced 4 and then 5 blades. I&#x27;m not really sure why having multiple blades makes for a more comfortable shave, but it does. I&#x27;ve been using this razor with moisturizing shaving cream and I always apply lotion immediately after. The  Schick Hydro Silk razor gives me a close shave, yet it does not hurt or nick my skin. It has all of the features that I look for in a disposable razor and is within my budget.</li>
    <li> I really like these razors. I received a trial pack free of charge from Schick and am very pleased with them. Prior, I have always used Venus razors as my underarms are very sensitive and I get bumps easily. This razor is very moisturizing and provides a good, close shave even on sensitive skin. The handle design is nice too, I haven&#x27;t had issues with awkwardness when shaving behind the legs or whatnot. Would certainly recommend giving this razor a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m here to give you a review on the skintimate shave gel and the Hydro Silk Schick disposable razors I received in the mail as a bzz campaign #gotitfree #loveit #schickhydrosilkdisposablerazor  I love this razor it is simply amazing it does everything it&#x27;s advertised to do .. The handle has a no slip grip easy and fits comfortably in your hand and feels a lot bigger than other brands I&#x27;ve tried which is a good thing for me. This razor I compare it to shaving with a stick of butter I could not feel the blades on my skin it was literally like using a stick of butter it felt incredibly smooth and felt as if I wasn&#x27;t even using a razor. I like how much quicker it is to shave with this razor the razor head moves to shave even the harder to reach places. This razor has left my legs smooth, soft, and bump and cut free and no more razor burns. I love the easy to maneuver head on the razor. I have tried almost every brand of disposable razors and none compares to this razor. I will continue to buy this razor I&#x27;m so pleased. This razor left my legs feeling so smooth baby skin soft and my legs stay smooth for days. When you get done shaving, your legs feel as if you have already put on lotion. I highly recommend this razor it&#x27;s like nothing you have ever tried before Schick definitely gained a new customer and that&#x27;s me.</li>
    <li> I received from Bzzagent and Schick a package which include (1) 3 pack of Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors, Skintimate silky skin shave gel, an exfoliating bath sponge, and coupons for razors and shave gel.  I have been using the razor with the gel (good combination) to shave my legs when I shower.  You can get 3 or 4 shave from the razor.  My legs were smooth and soft the whole day.  The razor are lightweight with an easy grip to reach the difficult places.  The blade gives you a close shave.  I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who shave their legs often.  I would purchase the razors again.</li>
    <li> I was able to try these razors as part of a promotion through a popular marketing website. Both my husband and I tried these and we absolutely loved them! I shaved my legs after not shaving during all winter and my legs felt nice and smooth. My husband is now using them to shave his face and he says it is 10x better than popular mens brands. It looks like these razors will be a keeper for us!</li>
    <li> This is by far my new favorite disposable razor. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now and it&#x27;s just starting to dull. For the last month it hasn&#x27;t been a chore to shave my legs but rather an expirement. I&#x27;ve been expecting the blades to dull and cut me for the last 2 weeks but they haven&#x27;t! Great handle design, easy to hold in the slippery conditions. I have yet to be nicked by this razor! I&#x27;m a customer for life! :-)</li>
    <li> These razors are worth the extra expense. I was able to get a closer shave that lasted longer without irritating my very dry skin. The razors also lasted longer than most brands and I easily got multiple leg shaves out of each one.</li>
    <li> She loves these razors. No burn and comes out very smooth. Can be reused multiple times.</li>
    <li> These razors give me such a smooth shave and I love them so much. I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, though.</li>
    <li> These razors work miraculously on your skin . they shave so close to leave your skin feeling so smooth and silky, I would not use another razor but this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor... it shaves... it feels nice... what else is there to say??</li>
    <li> These provide for a very live shave. Leaves my skin feeling very smooth and not dry at all. Very nice switch from the cheap disposable razors.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors ever! I got mine through buzzagent where schick let me try the product. I will now be buying them all the time. They lasted a really long time and left my legs feeling nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was leary that these would be just another mediocre disposable razor. I wondered if they really did leave your legs silky smooth after shaving or if they just dried your skin like the leading competitor razor. When I received these for free for product testing from BzzAgent I was anxious to try them. I grabbed my scrub, shaving cream, and pack headed in for due diligence. I was surprised that it was an amazing close shave, and my legs were actually silky for maybe an hour afterwards without any lotion. I didn&#x27;t have to shave as often. I am sold on these now.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when my Bzzkit arrived in the mail with free samples from Schick! I dove in right away…..&lt;br /&gt;I found that Schick Hydro Silk offers a really really close shave without any cuts, bumps or burns. The razor is easy to handle, it has 5 curve-sensing blades for a perfect silky shave with minimal irritation. There are 5 blades that can get all the hairs cut at the surface of the skin, all of them with a single pass. And they are capable of getting the hairs removed very close to the skin surface so be ready to have a smooth body.  It’s perfect for all areas of the body, including bikini line hair removal thanks to its smaller oval shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s also the water-activated moisturizer serum, which makes it perfect for dry skin and normal skin, at the same time. The serum contains marine extracts and shea butter.  While this is a great feature,  I still suggest that you use your personal moisturizer after each shave. Too much moisturizing can’t hurt your skin. I found the close shave lasts about three days for me and the blades don&#x27;t dull as fast as other razors, which means less money spent on refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great inexpensive razor that works well and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Schick through Bzzagent! I started using them about a month ago and have wonderful silky legs and a plus is I am still able to use the same razor I started with. This has always been an important factor to when I buy razors. I haven&#x27;t gotten any nicks or cuts like I typically do with new razors and the shaving cream leaves my legs extra soft! Thanks Schick k will be switching to your razors from now on!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand through Bzz Agent. And, I love this razor! The design of the razor and the handle is perfect for shaving. It aids in giving you a better and closer shave, especially for hard to reach areas and curves of your legs. The shave you get from this razor is so silky smooth, it feels like you have a new pair of legs! I would definitely recommend this razor to any female.</li>
    <li> I think this best desposable razor I have ever tried. I love the shape of the razor its comfortable to hold and easy to reach hard to reach places. It made my legs feel super smooth and got a super close shave.  I reall like the 5 blade I could tell I was going to get a super close shave and thats what I got which is important . I don&#x27;t know anyone who like to shave every day. So I got a super close shave, long last, and very smooth shave and that is why this is the best razor I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I was given a free 3-pack of the new Schick Hydro Silk disposable razors to try thanks to Schick. These are by far the best disposable razors I have ever used. It&#x27;s hard to pick my favorite feature because there are so many, so I&#x27;ll tell you about all of them.&lt;br /&gt;This is the closest and longest-lasting shave I&#x27;ve had in a while. The oval shape of the razor blade allowed me to glide around my knees without any trouble at all. The shape of the handle allowed me to get a good grip and feel more in control of the razor which led to fewer knicks. The shape of the handle is also made to raise up the razor blade so it&#x27;s not just sitting in water puddles in your bathtub rusting, and not sticking to whatever surface it dries on. It seems like I&#x27;m throwing my usual disposables in the trash right after I get them out because the blades are rusted after a couple of uses, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with the Schick Hydro Silk disposables.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing about this razor that I didn&#x27;t like was the water-activated moisturizing strip. It was extremely slimey, and I didn&#x27;t like feeling like it wasn&#x27;t washing off. Regardless of that, I&#x27;m not sure you can find a better disposable razor anywhere. This is definitely the best bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I got my razors for free from buzzagent and I was really glade I did! I have been using them for about a month and they work great. The razors five blades that I can tell really helps to get that close shave. In addition to they have a water activating serum that makes my leg feel so moisturized. They come in a pack of three and I believe their about 11.99 so definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Tried hydro silk disposables for the first time thanks to my BzzzAgent package and I love this product! I often shave my underarms without shaving cream and very little is needed for my legs! I get a smooth close shave that lasts days thanks to this hydrating razor! #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposables</li>
    <li> I received a coupon for a free 3-pack of these razors when they first came out last year. I had been using the Venus disposables and figured, why not? I&#x27;ve never really noticed much difference from one razor to another until I tried this one. It literally feels like silk on my skin. I&#x27;ve also never managed to cut myself once with these, and I do shave just about everything. Recently I decided to try out the Dollar Shave Club, because I was spending so much on these razors, but I instantly regretted it. With their mid-grade razor, I was cutting myself, and definitely not getting as smooth of a shave. The only negative is that the &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; lubricant/conditioner tends to run out before the blade is done, so you feel like you&#x27;re wasting a good blade. They&#x27;re also a little pricey, but all things considered they&#x27;re worth it!</li>
    <li> this is a really great razor to have. It has 5 blades, it&#x27;s a oval shape to curve to a woman&#x27;s natural body. It also has a water activated serum to moisturize your skin.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best razor i have ever tried. If I didn&#x27;t know, I wouldn&#x27;t guess it was disposable. I think the moisture strips is what really sets it apart from everything on the market, they&#x27;re not just a gimmick, they couldn&#x27;t work better. I took it with us recently on an overnight trip and forgot to bring shaving cream and usually i&#x27;d have cuts and nicks all over my legs if that was the case (honestly, I&#x27;m a horrible shaver even WITH shaving cream), but this preformed beautifully. I usually prefer men&#x27;s razors as I feel they are more gentle and give a closer shave since they are for the face, but this is so much better. So glad I got to try this for free from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I recently received these razors from bzzagent to review and share coupons with others to try. In my experience, these razors give you a super close shave, and I could go twice as long between shaving my legs. However, these razors left me with some nasty razor burn on my legs. The red bumps went away after a day or two, but that is just a pain to deal with, especially this time of year with the warmer weather, when I&#x27;m going to be showing my legs off. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin on my legs and these are the first razors I&#x27;ve ever experienced this with. I don&#x27;t know how these razors will do for other, but I just thought I&#x27;d leave my honest opinion in case someone was considering purchasing these.</li>
    <li> I love these razors, I have purchased them many times over, but thanks to schick and Bzzagent I got to try them for free! They leave your skin hairless, and very moisturized for a long time after using! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Received this product as a promotional item from Schick. I absolutely love this razor. I&#x27;ve already purchased several of my own since as I find they work so much better than my previous razors (simple 2 blade disposables, nothing special but they worked). Really moisturizing and I found my legs stayed smoother longer. I also found the blades stay sharper longer, so I could stretch the amount of time using each razor more than other disposables I&#x27;ve used. A great purchase.</li>
    <li> I got a package of Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for free from BzzAgent to try and give my own opinions.  I think it&#x27;s a great deal to be able to get three razors for $9.47 because that is about $3.16 per razor which is so much cheaper than buying a non-disposable razor.  Also being that it is a disposable razor it is great that you can take them on trips and vacations because you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them or leaving them behind.  My favorite feature of this razor is the moisturizing strips that are supposed to last 2 hours after shaving.  I noticed that it helped me get a closer shave because of the lubrication and it helped in preventing nicks and bleeding of my skin.  The handle also has a nice curve so i can have a firm grip on the razor which helps when you shave on those bumpy places like knees and ankles.</li>
    <li> Main Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Five blades  &#x3D; major time saver, faster shave, less stress! (actually has made me more willing to shave more often, whereas before I would always put it off for a day or two! If I could get away with it!)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Easily complete your shave on typically hard to reach areas, great design (dunno how they did this!).&lt;br /&gt;3. So smooth that you don&#x27;t even need shaving cream (although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that, but it&#x27;s really that smooth!)&lt;br /&gt;4.  They last long for disposable razors (the first one lasted me about three weeks, maybe even a month).&lt;br /&gt;5.  Deeper, fresher shave.... (although I&#x27;m more willing to shave now, my shaves definitely last longer!)&lt;br /&gt;6.  Incredibly affordable (the quality product is without a doubt a bang for your buck compared to the amount of time you will save by using these razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not one that I could find as of yet, and I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Hydro Silk Razors for over a month.  Honestly.  Maybe for this specific product, the fact that they&#x27;re disposable, but I actually prefer disposable...because I always end up breaking any type of refillable razor.  Plus they last longer than the average disposable razor, so this works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:  These razors are absolutely fantastic!  Before I tried these, I felt like there were two types of razors, crappy ones with barely one or two blades (that cost like 50 cents or something), and the higher end ones, that last a bit longer and are less likely to cut yourself with because they have more blades and are just pretty to look at.  Wow I was wrong!  This is a whole different type of razor, I never thought I could love a razor so much and be so happy with it!  My favorite thing about these is the ergonomic-type design (for lack of better phrase)....it&#x27;s easy to hold and use, but more importantly, I&#x27;m able to shave normally difficult to reach areas.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble shaving the inner-middle part of my underarm, it&#x27;s really reallyhard for me to get completely.  I know this seems like a minor issue, (if it never happened to me, I probably would think it was!), but it&#x27;s really annoying!  Standing there in the shower, trying every which way to get the few hairs that were left in the middle....I even got dizzy a few times after several minutes of frustration!  This is the first razor that I&#x27;ve been able to shave that underarm area with no issue, quick, simple and easy.  Plus they&#x27;re so smooth!  Five blades, and you don&#x27;t feel a thing!  I didn&#x27;t even need to use shaving cream!  Smooth during shaving, and still smooth after.  I haven&#x27;t had to use lotion either ...well I do anyway....but normally after shaving, my skin would be all red and cracked, now it&#x27;s smooth smooth smooth!  I&#x27;m obsessed with these!  And honestly, shaving takes a third of the time less than it used to take me.  I&#x27;m sure that has to do with the five blades, no cuts, overall so much easier to use.  A lot smoother, and better feeling than Venus, and we&#x27;ve always been big fans of Venus razors.  I have to say, going forward, I&#x27;ll be dedicated to using these razors. Once you use a great product like this, it&#x27;s kinda hard to go back!  My girlfriend is pretty set on them too, she couldn&#x27;t believe it either!  I would recommend to any woman, or even man honestly haha.  Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors for free as a sample (promotional) item (from Bzzagent) in exchange for my honest review of the product.  This has not influenced my review at all, in any way shape or form!</li>
    <li> I have always had a love hate relationship with disposable razors.  I love the convenience, but up until now I was absolutely not satisfied with the performance of disposables.  Schick Hydro Silk Disposables completely rocked my world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most disposable razors are not designed well, and lack in a lot of areas.  The Hydro Silk Disposables have it all.  They get the hard to reach places, the lifespan of the razor is impressive, and the moisturizer that is activated with the water works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs are now soft, smooth, moisturized, and happy.  I will be a continued user of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables, my first package was part of a promotion from the brand that I received free</li>
    <li> These are literally the best razors ever. So smooth. Originally bought at wal-mart but when I went to repurchase they didn&#x27;t have them in stock.. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love being a bzz agent. I was sent the Schick hydro razor,  it is amazing. I love how wide the razor itself is, the moisture stick built into the razor too.  I believe this is my all time favorite razor.</li>
    <li> I received a sample pack of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors for free via BzzAgent. These are the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever used, far better than any of the overpriced Venus disposables. The serum makes the razor glide across my legs smoothly and my legs don&#x27;t get dry and flaky afterward. Schick Hydro Silk disposables are my new go-to for this summer. The 5 blades guarantee a clean, close shave and the serum provides the perfect level of moisture. The handle design is very ergonomic and the grip-y material makes it easy to hold even in the shower, which prevents slips and nicks. Their disposable nature also makes them ideal for traveling, one razor lasted me my entire week-long vacation in Florida with nary a visible hair or a whiff of razor burn. If I want smooth, silky, hairless skin, I reach for my Schick Hydro Silk disposable.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product. I got it from bzzagent for free to try it out and it arrived just on time for me ( I ran out of my last Gillette razor ).&lt;br /&gt; Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables- Razors -&lt;br /&gt;It has good grip handle. It does not slip when your hands are soapy and wet. It shaves pretty close but compare to other razors I have used, I would say schick could do better. The skin guard and soap around the blade makes razor sticky over the time if it sits in the shower due to water. It feels like it is melting the soap around the blades.&lt;br /&gt; Skintimate® Silky Skin Shave Gel-&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gel. I love how it smells and makes my skin soft and smoother. It gets my total 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt; Overall, they can improve the razor and make it a better quality.</li>
    <li> The best disposable razor I&#x27;ve ever tried. The strips don&#x27;t goop off like other razors and I don&#x27;t get razor burn from this. This razor is superior to reusable razors. I will only be using this from now on</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of these disposable razors from BzzAgent and I love them! I can actually skip a day between shaving and my legs stay smooth.I won&#x27;t use any other disposable razor.</li>
    <li> These Shick Hydro Silk disposable razors are really great! I&#x27;ve tried disposable razors before and always ended up with bumps and my skin super irritated and red. They tore my legs up and I swore against them. But then I got the Shick Hydro Silk disposable razors from @BzzAgent to sample and the 5 blades curved over my legs and gave a nice smooth shave with no issues or skin irritation. With having a little one I&#x27;m lucky I have time to shave let alone lotion my legs after every shave so thankfully between these razors and the Skintimate shave gel my legs hydrated enough and not left dry, itchy, or burning like some other razors. I highly recommend you give the Shick Hydro Silk disposable razors a try! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by the quality of these razors. I know they are a little more than normal cheap razors but they were really worthwhile. I have always stuck with this company and although I received this from the company to try for free- believe me when I say I always love this brand and they are pretty darn trustworthy. These have lasted a lot longer than my normal razor with cartridges. That is pretty awesome for disposables.</li>
    <li> works great for the price</li>
    <li> when I purchase this item, I did not notice they were disposable razors.  I prefer &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; razors with disposable blades but, I&#x27;ll know better next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that these blades seem to last a long time. They provide a nice smooth shave, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all. Very comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> I like this because of the moisturizer strip, it helps while shaving. However, 5 blades in the razor are too many for me. I apt to knick myself more, so I prefer less blades.</li>
    <li> My wife used this a few weeks now and she loves it. She says her legs feel like silk after shaving with this. The quality is very nice, doesn&#x27;t feel like disposable ones. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and it still cuts like new.  Probably could use each one like a few months.</li>
    <li> I only bought this because there was an online discount for it. I haven&#x27;t actually used it, though, so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anything special about it.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Schick i was able to try these for free! I LOVE these razors! And for ME to say that, its a big deal because I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to razors. With these razors my legs are smooth and soft and it lasts!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor.  It has been 15 hours and I am still smooth and hydrated on my legs and arms.  With other brands I am having to use lotion after no more the 12 hours.  I also love this razor&#x27;s handle.  I usually drop razors in the shower because they don&#x27;t fit comfortably in my hand.  I didn&#x27;t have this issue with this razor.  It also got into all the knock and crannies easily and well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have tried these razors! My legs no longer feel bumpy and I can wear those cute spring dresses.I highly recommend these razors with Skintimate shaving crème for a close great shave. The quality is an A plus for me</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to review!!&lt;br /&gt;The best dispossable razors in the market, it shave so well and make legs silky smooth,, it keep legs hydrated for a long time!! and perfect curve blades to shave,,,actually i don&#x27;t use razors much, i prefer wax, but after trying this razors i don&#x27;t think i will use wax any more ;) lol,,,&lt;br /&gt;Big thanks to Bzzagent and Hydro silk for letting me try this product!! I love it :)</li>
    <li> I was sent this product by BzzAgent to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. I usually have a hard time finding womens razors that don&#x27;t give me razor burn every time I use them. This one has added moisturizer which helps keep my legs protected while getting a really close shave with those five blades. I actually went longer in between shaves! The handle is large and really easy to grip, no chance of it slipping out of soapy hands in the shower! The only complaint I have is that I feel like the moisturizer only lasted a few shaves before I felt like I had to switch to a new one. But with how affordable they are I don&#x27;t really see that as a big issue!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I got it for free from BzzAgent to try out and its fantastic.  Best razor I have ever used.  I will definitely be a future customer!</li>
    <li> When I received these disposable razors in the mail I was a little weary about using a new brand. I have extremely sensitive skin so why try something new right? Well I don&#x27;t regret trying it one bit. In fact this will be the razor I but from now on. It hydrates your skin, you get the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had and the design of the handle and cartridge is unlike other brands in a much better way. This is the razor to use! Best product I could have gotten for free through Bzzagent</li>
    <li> I Got these razors for free from bzzagent. I got a three pack to try. I have sensitive skin and normally use venus, and get a smooth shave. The shave normally feels smooth for a few days. I shaved last night, and already feel a little stubble. . think the razor did ok for on the go, however I don&#x27;t think it will replace my.every time razor.  .</li>
    <li> I have never had such silky smooth legs after shaving until I tried Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables!! The razor glides over my skin so easily, and moisturizes at the same time. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry, irritated skin, especially after shaving, but I haven&#x27;t had any skin troubles since trying Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables. These are definitely my new go-to disposable razors!!! I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Schick.</li>
    <li> I thought this razor was ok. It didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave but it was gentle. I am not a hairy person so I was suprised how many times I had to swipe with the razor. I did receive this as a test product</li>
    <li> I got these razors through Bzzagent to review and I absolutely love them. I struggle with sensitive skin and have always had a hard time finding a razor that doesn&#x27;t give me razor bumps and still gives a close shave; after trying these razors out I quickly realized they were perfect for me! The water activated moisturizing hydrant leaves my skin feeling silky smooth every time, and the five curve sensing blades help the razor slightly form to your body, giving an incredibly close shave. I also love the small razor head; it is very helpful when trying to shave those hard-to-reach places. I have also noticed that the blades do not dull quickly which I also think is important! Overall, I would recommend these razors to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this razor complimentary from Bzzagent. I was so excited to be able to try a new razor.  I am always on the look out that will beat any current razor that I am using.  Schick Hydro Silk Razors is a pack of razors containing three razors. The shaving unit of each razor has 5 blade, running in parallel to each other.  I was so excited to see that it had 5 blades. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see or feel much difference from my 3 blade razor.  Moreover, the handle has a broad ovoid base, resembling the business end of a spoon, thereby ensuring an easy grip by even the most butterfingered of users. The handle actually includes a second ovoid region, located at the mid-point of the handle, and this second ovoid region contains a little hole. The little hole further ensures an excellent grip. The entire handle is covered with an elevated layer of rigid silicone rubber, further ensuring a firm grasp, even under the soapiest conditions.  I must say, the handle was probably the best part of the razor. Thirdly, the shaving unit also has little pores that release a hydro gel. Above the five blades, and parallel to these blades, is a row of 15 pores, which resemble white dots. Also, below the five blades is another row of 15 pores. The package label reveals that moisturizing serum comes out of the white dots. Regarding the hydro gel released from the pores, because of the 30 pores in all, the amount of hydro gel was somewhat surprising. I have no idea if the &amp;#34;moisturizing serum&amp;#34; or hydro gel is intended to overcome any particular problem with shaving, or if it is intended for use with any particular skin. At any rate, it seems to enhance the shaving experience to a small extent.  When I used this razor to shave my legs, along with the included shaving gel, my legs felt surprisingly really smooth. Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was due to the shaving gel though since I usually use soap.  My legs did feel a little irritated and burned.  I then used the razor to shave my armpits.  Unfortunately, this razor doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well with hair that is more coarse. My leg hair is pretty thin, but my armpit hair is more thick.  It shaved it, but didn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as my previous razor and it also left spots of blood.  The gel was a little too much too so I had to keep rinsing it off constantly. Eventually, I had to go back to my old razor.  Basically, using this razor for anything besides your legs or arms is a no go.  It doesn&#x27;t get a really close shave with coarse hair and always leaves your skin slightly irritated.  However, I did like the shape of the razor handle as it was nice and easy to grasp during shaving.  It is also shaped to keep the blades from touching any flat surface where you might lay down the razor which is nice.  In conclusion, I will not be buying these razors in the future. If you have thin hair, then this razor will be great for you.  Otherwise, the biggest downfall was not getting as close of a shave as other razors.</li>
    <li> I got this for free with Bzzagent. There are pros and cons with this razor. I did initially like it and was excited to try it. The design was new and different. The razor has five blades, curved cartridge, moisturizing serum, and a soft grip handle. The shave was very close and nice. The serum became gooey and slimy, though I don&#x27;t think it affected the razor&#x27;s performance. In more sensitive and curvy areas, I did cut myself. I think due to the blades sticking out and the shape of the cartridge. You just have to be a bit slower and more careful. Overall, it&#x27;s a good razor with a close shave. I&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> I received Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razors from Schick (BzzAgent) to try for free, and I must say that this was one of the best shaves I have had in a long time! I was skeptical at first because I have tried many disposable razors that claimed to be &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; and it was clearly not the case. I absolutely love that the moisture serum was built into the cartridge, rather than being a strip that was &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; onto the surface. With this razor, I will never have to worry about it falling off and rendering my razor useless! My skin definitely felt smoother, softer and more moisturized after my shave; I didn&#x27;t feel the urgent need to lather my legs with lotion immediately after my shower/shave. I felt as though the oval cartridge and 5 Curve Sensing blades made it easier to shave my legs, especially around those hard to reach places. I admit that I did brace myself for a cut as I glided the razor over my knees and the back of my legs, but was pleasantly surprised when it didn&#x27;t happen. The rubber grips on the handle were soft and made it easy to hold. I would definitely recommend giving the Schick Hydro Silk disposable razor a try, if not for anything else, try it for the &#x27;built-in&amp;#34; moisturizing serum! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> These razors are simply amazing. Use them with the new skintimate lotion shave gel and OMG silky smooth legs have arrived. #igotitfree</li>
    <li> I was give the product free to try from Schick and let me just say I am in love!  The 5 blade cartridge gave me an extra close shave.  My favorite thing about it has to be the moisturizing serum on the blade.  Immediately after getting out of the shower my skin was silky smooth and no need to moisturize!  Definitely a much improved product that I am sure to buy again.</li>
    <li> Totally adorable and amazing! My legs feel so great after using these and good golly that brings a smile to my face! I recieved these via BzzAgent and am in love! Thank you again!</li>
    <li> I was able to try these as I received a free sample. I had no problems loved them. Clean close shave and no cuts or irritation. Will def be buying in the future. Finally a razor that can and does its job!</li>
    <li> Love these razors! These are the greatest razors ever. They leave my skin so nice and silky smooth. My legs don&#x27;t feel dry at all and I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion when I get out of the shower. I&#x27;ve been encouraging my husband to start using these as well because he has such delicate skin, so I think they would even work well for men!</li>
    <li> I received these razors free from Schick and personally the only wanted to try these were because they had 5 blades. My legs felt smooth for days. I don&#x27;t like the chore of shaving but this helps to not shave as often.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample pack of these razors for free from BzzAgent, courtesy of Shick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disposable razors usually aren&#x27;t anything to get excited about - they get the job done and hurt your hands, then you throw them away after your first time using them. That&#x27;s what I thought, anyway. But these Shick Hydro Silk Disposables are different. They&#x27;re built like refillable razors, so the grip is nice, soft and comfortable. Also, you can use them quite a few times! I&#x27;ve used mine at least 7 or 8 times so far and they&#x27;re still working just fine! The head really does move easily over your skin, getting a really close shave, so you only have to go over each area once. But my favorite part about these razors is the moisture-infused head. You can wet the shaver and then just go right to shaving. The moisture that the shaver head creates leaves your legs feeling soft and moisturized, and not irritated at all! That&#x27;s a really big plus for me because my legs are sometimes sensitive and get irritated when I shave them. 5/5 stars from me, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these things!</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite razor. After trying them out, my legs feel so smooth. If you are looking for a razor that makes shaving easier, look no further. The Schick Hydro Silk disposable is amazing. You no longer have to go over the same area 5 times, because this thing gets it all in one pass. You do not need to worry about razor burn because of the ultra hydrating &amp;#34;water activated hydrating serum.&amp;#34; I have very sensitive skin and normally always get razor burn, rashes, etc... Every single time that I shave but that has not been the case with this razor. You should really try this out! Thanks Schick!!! #gotitfree</li>
    <li> The Best Razor I&#x27;ve Used In My Life !!!</li>
    <li> This is a three pack of razors, with 5 blades on each razor. The handle adds to a clean shave, with a close cut that is outstanding. The handle was easy to grip, so I didn&#x27;t risk dropping it, like some others are.  I loved the moisture lock, it made my skin feel smooth and not dry like other razors. This will be my go to razor from now on.</li>
    <li> I was immediately impressed by the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor&#x27;s attractive, ergonomic design. It seems substantial and feels great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five bladed head is effective, tackling sensitive areas with ease. The cut is so close to the skin, that I could actually see it scraping off the uppermost part (yielding a color change), leaving my skin looking dry and feeling a bit tender (an hour later my leg is still burning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro Silk&#x27;s \\&quot;moisturizing serum\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the best. After running water over the razor, I could feel a slight sliminess coming off of the lines of white dots (located both above and below the blades). Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t thick enough for good protection and it quickly ran out after only a few strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I merely rub my hand across a wet bar of soap and wipe it across my skin before shaving with this razor, I don&#x27;t experience any of the dryness or sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As good as the cut is, the \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; aspect didn&#x27;t work for me, so I can&#x27;t justify the added expense. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a super-close shave with a higher-end disposable razor, I recommend it when used with soap/gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of women&#x27;s razors, I stick to using men&#x27;s razors because I felt like they worked so much better, but after trying these my opinion changed completely. These make my skin feel amazing! My legs feel so silky smooth and hydrated. These razors have water-activated moisturizing serum around the razor blades, and that serum really does the trick. I have stubborn under-arm hair that takes forever to shave off, I usually have to go over the same spot about 4 times to completely remove the hair, but this razor shaves off everything with just one swipe! I really was impressed by that, that was all thanks to the five razor blades that this disposable razor has. I highly reccomend these! Ladies, your body needs these razors :) I received these for free, for test and review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good razors. I have been using the Bic Soleil disposable razors for several years now but I decided to give these a try. I love the shape of the handle and even more, I like the way the razor itself has a little lift so when I set it down it does not rest directly on the shelf in my shower. That helps it to dry out quicker and doesn&#x27;t dull the blades. There are five blades in each razor as opposed to the three in the previous brand I mentioned. I really don&#x27;t see any kind of difference in how close the shave is. I do however really like that the blade head is flexible which makes it easier for it to glide over my ankles and knees (where I sometimes tend to cut myself). All in all these are nice razors that I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail from BzzAgent to try and review. I love these! My legs feel amazing and not a single cut (I have sensitive skin). I will be using this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> For full disclosure, I was given the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to Schick. When I first open the package I was a little intimidated by all of those shiny razors. Little did I know at the time, all of the razors helped me obtain a perfect shave, which lasted the whole day. I did not feel a tug or pull and the grip on the razor made sure it did not slip out of my hand in the shower. In addition, my boyfriend used it to clean up the edges of his beard and said he liked it so much he was thinking about searching for the &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; version. Overall I highly recommend this product for its ease of use, great design, and consistent performance.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor. Made my body silky smooth from top to bottom.  No bumps and got every hair. I didnt like how gooey around the blade gets. Thanks to Schick I was able to try this product free thanks to bzzagent and Schick.   will be stocking up on these all summer.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product by Schick.  Usually, a disposable razor leaves my legs feeling dry and itchy. I almost always cut myself if I use a disposable.  That being said, I had none of those problems with this particular razor.  There is a moisturizing strip built in that keeps my skin hydrated. In fact, I found that I don&#x27;t have to use as much shaving cream! Before this razor, I bought expensive shave gel to help my sensitive skin.  I can actually use the normal brands of shaving cream with this razor. I recommend that you store the razor with the blades facing up so that the moisturizing strip isn&#x27;t touching the shower.  When I place it blades down, there is always some residue left from where it was sitting even with the cap on.  Still, that&#x27;s a minor issue for such a great result!</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Schick! I thought this was a great product and one of the smoothest shaves I have gotten from a disposable razor. After the shave my legs were left feeling smooth and hydrated. I love the 5 blades. Definitely worth giving a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried mail order blades to old fashioned safety razors to get a close shave, but they aren&#x27;t versatile and often lead to nicks if you aren&#x27;t meticulous. This razor is for everyone; young and old. The grip and safety features allow you to cover all of your curves without accidents while leaving you with a nice shave especially if you need a fast shave. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone. Disclaimer: I received I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Really good shaver for a disposable. It is easy to use and leaves my legs smooth and silky. I have been using these for some time now and I just love the feel and no bumbs or razor cuts. My legs look awesome and my husband loves the feel of my smooth silky legs. I got this product free from bzzagent to sample and review. Please give this product a try :)</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I got the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with disposable razors using these! I love how they are contoured to reach sensitive areas like ankles, and knees. The after shave feeling was amazing, I did not have to use lotion because my legs were left so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> These were surprisingly good razors for disposable razors.  I got them free as a promotion from Schick, and I&#x27;m thankful I got the opportunity.  They left my legs feeling more smooth than they had been in a long time, and my partner enjoyed my using them!  Once the hydrating gel got wet and started working, it made the shave so easy.  Plus, I think I can go longer without shaving with these razors.  Definitely something I&#x27;m going to keep on buying!</li>
    <li> I love how close of a shave I get with these razors. The vendor I bought them from was awesome too. They even gave me a pack that had a bonus razor.</li>
    <li> I just used these last night and was very happy with this razor. I just did a quick shave on my legs while in the shower and I didn&#x27;t use any shaving lotion just to see how the moisture strips worked. It worked fine for me, and I have sensitive skin, so I was really pleased with that. I would definitely use these again, more so than other disposables I&#x27;ve tried before. I got it for free from BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about using disposable razors because usually they don’t remove all the unwanted hair until BzzAgent gave me the opportunity to try out the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors. Since Ive been using them my view of disposable razors have completely changed.I always like to shave in the shower which helps gives me soft and smooth legs.</li>
    <li> Great razor...it lasts a long time and the moisture strip lasts a long time too. I dont have a lot of time to lather up so I have to have a moisture strip. Unlike the cheap ones where the strip falls off the first use this one keeps on going. Eliminates knocks and cuts. The handle is easy to grip and the blades are just the right amount of sharp. Would recommend printing an online coupon. Would also recommend becoming a Bzzagent @ Bzzagent.com They let me try free razors shave gel shower poof and many coupons. Become a Bzzagent and see what all the hypes about! 😁</li>
    <li> I love these razors- especially for traveling! They have the quality, moisturizing shave serum of my favorite schick razor I keep in the shower at home, but I can just throw it away when vacation is over!&lt;br /&gt; I received these razors for free to sample courtesy of BzzAgent. They provide such a smooth, close shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this razor at all. I got a package of these razors for free from Schick and Bzz Agent. I used my regular EOS shave cream and shaved while in the bath. These razors really drag on the skin and don&#x27;t glide easily at all. I felt like it was giving me tiny cuts all over my leg. I guess it was a razor burn type feeling. I almost didn&#x27;t even bother shaving the other leg because it was so uncomfortable. I didn&#x27;t notice any extra moisture, if anything, my legs felt drier. I also really disliked the handle shape and design. It felt odd like it was at the wrong angle. It just didn&#x27;t feel ergonomic at all. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll ever use the rest of the razors. They made my skin feel irritated and razor burned. I like other Schick razors but this new style really missed the mark.</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Schick Hydro Silk Razor.  The positives are:  it stays comfortably sharp through multiple shaves.  It&#x27;s nice to have a razor that doesn&#x27;t irritate the underarm area even after it&#x27;s been used on the legs four or five times.  The handle is easy to keep hold of when wet and the blade rinses clean easily in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, the head of the razor it&#x27;s the best design for shaving knees.  Or perhaps my knees are bumpier than average?  Also, the moisturizing strips on this razor tend to become pretty slimy which looks gross but doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the performance.  It does make the razor glide very, very easily across the skin so it&#x27;s best to go a bit slow when first shaving with this razor so you can get used to how quickly it glides along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I would definitely buy this razor again if purchasing disposables.</li>
    <li> I received these razors to test through BzzAgent and Schick but all views are my own. I usually buy cheapo razors because I feel like there&#x27;s no reason to go expensive when they&#x27;re just going to go dull in a few shaves anyway. These have converted me to expensive razors! they are so easy to use, stay sharp for much longer than my old brand, and the moisturizing strips mean that they glide so easily over my skin. I can go longer between shaves and have less irritation since using them. Love them!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say that I got these free from Schick, but this review is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved this product - so much cheaper than my very similar but non-disposable razor and so much less scary that my normal disposables I use. Great close shave with no cuts or razor burn. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - I don&#x27;t really like to use &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; anything but I also don&#x27;t like hairy legs. So, while not eco-friendly, it&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> so i received a free pack of these razors as to try out and review. honestly i was really skeptical because all i buy is disposables and they usually suck but I&#x27;m a mom on a budget so sacrifices must be made. But I&#x27;m pleased to say smooth legs is no longer one of them. These razors are amazing for disposables! the shave is soooo close and i love the 5 blades not to mention the moisture strip! the life on the blades is great too! I&#x27;ve been the same one using for over a week now and even caught my husband using it too. The blades are still very sharp</li>
    <li> I got to try this razor through BzzAgent for free. #GotItFree. I absolutely love this razor. It makes shaving so quick and easy. I get a clean, smooth shave every time with little effort. A++</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these razors to try from Shick through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I absolutely love the handle of these razors- the shape and size are perfect for a secure, comfortable grip, even when your hands are wet and you&#x27;ve got soap or shaving cream all over. The handle is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever seen on a disposable razor, and I didn&#x27;t knick myself once while shaving. I also really like the &amp;#34;serum beads&amp;#34;- I&#x27;m not sure that they have much moisturizing effect post-shower (and I immediately use a heavier lotion anyway) but I did feel like they made the razor glide more easily. It was a very smooth, quick shave with no cuts or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside- I just don&#x27;t think it shaves very closely! My legs and underarms felt great when I was done shaving, but one day later they had detectable stubble- and generally I&#x27;m someone who can go 2-3 days between shaves even when I&#x27;m using cheap razors. I think the number of blades on this razor might have compromised the angle at which they can set them in the head, and the shave just isn&#x27;t that close. This probably contributes to the lack of irritation or cuts, which is great, but at this price I can&#x27;t afford to be shaving daily. It&#x27;s great not to have any razor burn, but not so great to wake up to stubble 24 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has the potential to be amazing- they have a great handle and the serum strips are great. But the actual blades need some tweaking. I&#x27;ll keep trying new Hydrosilk products as they come out, because they have some good concepts, but I wish they&#x27;d stop the more-blades arms race and start making the existing products better. More blades does not always equal a better shave.</li>
    <li> These are not your normal disposable razors. They have the moisture strips on them and 5 blades for that close shave. I tried these two different ways, with shaving cream and without.  When i tried them without shaving cream, I did get a little bit of razor burn but with such sensitive skin, sometimes it can be expected. With shaving cream no razor burn and a close shave. I am trying the product for free thanks to Schick!</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free from Schick to try. I never purchase Schick razors because I don&#x27;t feel they were up to par with other razors on the market. I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating but I do have to say that Schick has come a long way with this razor and it is a great step towards being competitive to other razors. After shaving my legs some parts were smooth but I still felt like some parts were missed. The new design and handle is very easy to grip, but even with pressure I found it hard to get the close shave I normally get with a competitive razor. I would probably buy this product if it was cheaper than the Venus disposable, but this wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
    <li> love the feeling of the 5 blades that come with this razor, not to mention the silkiness. its hard to come buy a good razor but these are definitely a keeper! and they&#x27;re inexpensive too!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors for free for the purpose of reviewing them thanks to Schick and BzzAgent.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like them at all because they didn&#x27;t have the shaving cream built in like my old razor, but the Hydro Silk surprised me.  Yes, you still need shaving cream for most areas, but I found the moisturizing serum was enough for small areas like my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, the handle is great because it&#x27;s very grippy, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like the 5 blades and the rubber strip that helps &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; hairs into the blades promotes a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was more serum so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream but other than that this razor is top notch!</li>
    <li> This is a really amazing razor!  Ever since I started shaving, I have been using a Venus and could never really find a good enough reason to change.  I never really understood the need for more blades, a better grip, or a smoother shave since the razor I had seemed to do the job just fine.  I was seriously missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a pack of these razors for free from the company and quickly went to go try them out.  The difference between my old razor and this one were immediately apparent once I got started.  One stroke of this beauty and I was achieving a super close shave that would have taken me two or more with my old razor.  The serum that comes out of it made my skin extra silky and moisturized, so it never even had a chance to dry out.  I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did find to be a bit of an issue came up when I got to my knees.  Because of the extra blades, there is a larger flat surface on the razor head.  If I wasn&#x27;t extra careful, I would get cuts that looked like I was taking off small chunks of skin.  However, that&#x27;s where the better grip came into play.  The handle of the razor fits comfortably in my hand, so it&#x27;s super easy to control when I get to the tricky spots, so it hasn&#x27;t been a real issue (honestly, I only nicked myself once when I tried it the first time since I was so used to how I used my Venus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend giving these a try even if you think that your current razor is just fine.</li>
    <li> First of all these razors are AWESOME! I have always used the Venus brand, which I was satisfied, but I was very excited to try these for FREE thanks to Schick and Bzzagent! I always thought all disposible razors were the same....and boy was I wrong! I have thick body hair and I would have to keep going over the area multiple times on other brands so the 5 blades made a huge difference and the hair was gone in one stroke so I shaved in half the amount of time that I normally would. The water-activated moisturizing serum made my legs look and feel smooth and silky but it did get kind of gooey which was the only con but very minor. Overall this was a smooth and sleek shave that left me moistuized with no nics or cuts and I will definately use in the future.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it has 5 razors, I love the design. For a pack of 3 the price isn&#x27;t that bad. Very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for disposables that have 5 blades for a while, and I&#x27;m glad I happened upon these. I like the moisturizing things it has on either side. definitely affordable and worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for free, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I still love it!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing and I highly recommend it. After using it my legs were smoother than ever before. They were also very soft and felt silky. With other razors I would have the problem of not being able to get every part due to the shape of my legs. This didn&#x27;t happen with this one. I even believe that I was able to go longer without shaving than I have in the past. *I was able to try this product for free courtesy of Schick and Bzzagent*</li>
    <li> These products are affordable and work great! My legs are always nice and smooth afterward! I did receive these free thanks to Schick however I currently buy them anyway!</li>
    <li> I got these for free thanks to Schick and I&#x27;m loving them. I&#x27;m being very honest as I am not being paid to promote these in any way. I received these for free so I could test out and give my honest opinion. I love the water activated moisturizing serum infused with marine extracts. It makes my legs feel so smooth during and after the shave! It makes me feel like I&#x27;m not even using a disposable at all, actually. Nice job Schick!</li>
    <li> I think these razors work like a dream! #HydroSilkDisposables are the best razors that I think I have ever used, ever! They work so well you will be double checking just to see if you missed a spot because they glide over the skin like no other. Your legs stay smooth for way longer that&#x27;s for sure! I am a customer for life now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have 5 Curve Sensing® blades with skin guards that deliver an incredibly smooth shave and help prevent irritation and the contoured  cartridges allow for a closer shave around hard-to-reach places like ankles, knees and underarms. The soft, comfy, easy-to-grip handle provides superior control. You will also love this disposable razor’s unique, raised handle rest! It’ll keep your razor cartridges out of water and intact for a premium shave.  As a BzzAgent I just #GotItFree :)</li>
    <li> So the first test of the razor was a win. I did get a little nick but I&#x27;m not good with properly lathering my legs. Sometime when shaving my legs, I&#x27;m in a rush especially at the gym. When shaving my legs at the gym I use lower end razors and my legs look like they&#x27;ve got in a knife fight and lost. The first use of the slick glide was under my arms that are moderately hairy. It felt like it wasn&#x27;t even touching me because of the serum hydration. If i didn&#x27;t see the hair in the razor I wouldn&#x27;t have even known it was touching me until the 5th stroke. Next I shaved my legs which are moderately hairy and with the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors reduced my shaving time. It took half the normal takes to shave my legs. I believe it was because I didn&#x27;t have to re-shave the same area over and over again to get every piece of hair. So my The Schick Hydro Silk® experience with legs and underarms was really nice.

The razor structure (handle) was really nice, not like the cheaper ones that have edges and can hold water. Prefect for lady hands! :)</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free, however, these are my honest thoughts. These razors are awesome. The first time I shaved with them it was like a revelation. I cant believe that I&#x27;ve been beating my legs up with cheap single or double razor disposables. It was a completely different shave than I&#x27;ve experienced before. There are certain razors (they start with a *v*) that I&#x27;ve heard a lot about, but they always seemed so expensive. These are affordable, maybe because they are disposable, but they also preform so well. The give a much closer and less painful, rough shave than other disposables. The only bad thing I could say about these razors are that they are kind of slimy because of that moisture strip. But I suppose thats why the shave is so smooth with them.  The self-adjusting head was also nice, but didnt shave those hard to reach places as easily as with a puny razor. But it is definitely worth the trade off in my opinion. All-in-all, a great, comfortable shave. Try them; your legs will thank you.</li>
    <li> Try these! Thankfully I was given the opportunity by Shick to test these out for free but even at full price I would pick these time and time again over competitors disposable razors. The 5 blades on this disposable razor ensure a close shave without the irritation. Those 5 blades glide effortlessly over hard to reach spots thanks to the curve sensing blades and contoured oval cartridges. Try with the Skintimate Silky skin gel to help replenish your skins natural moisture.</li>
    <li> I have really loved these razors. They work so well and get a close shave. The handle is easy to grip and glides easily as well. I have really enjoyed it more than my other razors. I used to use the Venus and I thought it was great until I started using this one. It really made my skin feel nice and you do not even have to use that much shaving cream. I would buy this again and again and recommend everyone try it. I originally got this razor as a promotion from the company to review it and I am I glad I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of disposable razors but I was looking forward to trying the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors. I travel a lot and need something that I can throw in the suitcase and have for the trip. I really like how the plastic cap only covers the blades and not the moisture beads. Also having 5blades is great and gets a close shave. The price is great for the quality of the razor; especially because it lasts much longer than other disposables I have used in the past. I did receive this product for free to review but I would absolutely purchase.</li>
    <li> These razors give a nice, smooth shave.  The blades are very sharp so you must be careful with them.  Its handle is easy to hold and maneuver.  I am able to reach any spot on my body with ease.  Also, for disposables, these last an incredibly long time.  I&#x27;ve been using the same one for a month and a half now and the blade is as good as new.</li>
    <li> So I have been using these razors for a few weeks now. They are comfortable to use and they do leave your legs super smooth. No matter what I do or what type of shaving cream I use I end up cutting myself though. I never have this problem with other razors so I don&#x27;t. All and all they do work and I do like the though. I tried these razors thanks to bzzzagent to test out and review.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from #BzzAgent.  I used it for a month before writing this review, and I have to say.... I LOVE IT!  This razor is super easy to hold, even when the handle gets wet.  The head of the razor tilts side-to-side as well as up-and-down to give me a smooth shave, even around my bony knees!  My favorite thing about the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor is that you don&#x27;t even really need shave gel.  I have used this razor with baby oil, soap, and with shave gel and it truly doesn&#x27;t need anything to give you a close shave. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Trying the product for free thanks to Schick! I am in love with this razor! It gives me a soft and hydrating feel for hours after shaving and it reaches those hard to shave areas to boot. I will recommend this to friends!!</li>
    <li> I went to my local CVS store with a few of my girlfriends last week. We were planning for our trip to California for our summer break. We past the female hygiene aisle and I just had to recommend this shaver to them. After trying this product for myself, I have to say that this shaver made my legs look BOMB! I use shaving cream when I shave, but the shaver was just so amazing. It&#x27;s hard to cut yourself, even if you purposely try (don&#x27;t do it by the way, unless you&#x27;re into that...but still, don&#x27;t). Thanks Schick for allowing me to try this product for free.</li>
    <li> These are a must try. With so many razor brands and new styles, there is so many to choose from.. I highly recommend you try these though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with shaving gel, Schick Hydro Silk razors double moisturize your skin. Even when dry shaving, these razors seemed to hydrate. The blades move, so they go around curves great - I have not had any knicks from these razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shave is the closest I&#x27;ve even got from any disposable razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these free through a promotion*</li>
    <li> I got these razors as a sample from BzzAgent. They provide a close shave and have a handle that is super easy to grip. Along with the Skintimate shave cream I also received my legs felt smooth with no nicks or cuts and felt moisturized. Another amazing thing is that even though they are disposable you can get several uses out of one before having to throw it away. For someone on a budget this is a big advantage. The only downfall to these razors is that the head of the razor makes it hard to shave the bikini area. Since it did so well on my legs and underarms I am okay with it.</li>
    <li> Really love the handle design here, easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand when i&#x27;m shaving. The blades really do hydrate better than other razors which is great when you have sensitive skin or psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;*got this for free to review.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as part of a promotion. At first I was not sure that I was gonna like them. When I tried them I change my mind completely. They are really nice. They leave my skin really soft and the shaved was durable.</li>
    <li> I got a great close shave from this product compared to the other brands of disposable razors I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. This razor also left my skin feeling hydrated. With the closeness of the shave I never one got cut, which was amazing. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The Shick Hydro Silk disposable razor is a very nice disposable! I was able to try this product for free by beeing a BzzAgent  and I am very impressed.  The razor has a very close shave and contours easily to my legs.  The conditioning strip works well, without leaving that feeling of sticky goo behind.  The handle fits comfortably in my hand and is easy to maneuver and keep hold of while in the shower.  This disposable actually feels like a cartridge shaver. It is heavier than most disposables I have used and gives a much better shave.  I normally do not use disposables because they have a very flimsy handle and the razors never seem to do a thorough job, these issues are nonexistent with this razor.</li>
    <li> These are one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever tried they get in all of the hard to reach places that some razors can&#x27;t do! It also leaves my legs feeling super soft which is a plus! And on a lot of razors I seem to always nic myself with them but with these razors I never have! Would recommend to everybody to give it a try and you will defiantly love!!&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to say these were sent to me for testing purposes through bzzagent and the brand Schick so thank you so much for letting me test them out and finding my new favorite disposable razor!!!</li>
    <li> For me, the single most important factor when it comes to shaving is how long can I go without bothering to do it again. I am extremely picky when it comes to hair on my body and I honestly can&#x27;t stand the feeling of having prickly hair any where at any time therefore I normally shave every single day. I am so glad that I got to try these razors free, thanks so Schick. Schick Hydro Silk Disposables get a huge thumbs up from me as I was able to go an extra day or two between shaves. That is a BIG deal and I am incredibly happy about it! I love the curved shape of the handle which made shaving super easy in all of the hard to reach places. Compared to normal women&#x27;s disposable razors, the handle on the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables is definitely the best I&#x27;ve found. The water-activated moisturizing serum creates such a smooth and soft shave and I&#x27;m certain that I now will forever need a 5-blade razor in my life. Forget shaving every day, I&#x27;m sticking with these razors!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free gift from Schick and I love it!!! It is smooth when shaving and leaves my legs smooth. The handle fits comfortably and has a nice grip in my hand. The 5 blades leaves my legs silky and smooth to the touch. Since using this razor I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts. It glides nicely over all parts of my legs. I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Love these razors! Super smooth, no razor burn. Will continue to buy!  I received these razors for free from Shick.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Schick Hydro Silk Disposables Razors with the Skintimate Silky Skin Shaving Gel and a white pouf together with coupons.  From the moment I tried Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razor I fell in love with them.  The razor makes shaving a breeze.  The handle is very comfortable to hold and easy to use.  The five curve-sensing blades give me a very close shave and with hypooallergenic serum hydrates my skin so it feels so silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I always bought cheaper disposable razors in the past. I will buy these when I run out again. They left my legs silky smooth without nicks. I like the water activate moisture serum &amp; the curvy grip handle. *I received a pack free thanks to Schick via Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I love the added moisturizing serum, it makes my skin feel softer after shaving, but note, if you leave the razors in the shower, the serum will leak and leave a mess! I loved the design of the razors, they were easy to hold and glided smoothly over the curves of my body. Though I didn&#x27;t get as close as a shave with these as other razors I&#x27;ve used, I still was left with a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received these razors complimentary from BzzAgent for testing and review purposes as part of a promotion from the brand. I take pride in leaving HONEST reviews.</li>
    <li> I like the close shave, and the ability for it to contour (especially around the knee area) but for some reason the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor leaves my legs feeling itchy. It does pass quickly. The price point is great and I like the disposable razors for when I am going on a trip so that I don&#x27;t feel bad if I accidently forget it in the hotel bathroom or such.#got it free</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor may not be the best razor out there but it does get the job done. Not only does it remove all your hair but there is that smoothing formula that on the razors that leaves it silky smooth and ready to take on and type clothing to show off your hairless legs. I would recommend it. I am trying the product for free thanks to Schick. #gotitforfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> The best disposable razors Schick has come up with so far for woman. Perfect shave, I had a smooth legs for days, with no bumps, which I usually get from other razors. I already recommended this for a couple of friends. Will buy this again in the future in a heartbeat. Give Shick Hydro Silk  Disposables a try you won&#x27;t regret it. Thanks to Schick for giving me the opportunity to test this awesome product for free.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this item for free in return for my review, all opinions are my own. I really like these razors. They have 5 blades which provide a close shave and moisturizers to protect your skin. I would venture to say these are the best diisposable razors I have used.</li>
    <li> Love these razors! I got these razors to try to free from Schick and I will def be purchasing them in the future. This is the first razor that I have been able to shave my knees without a problem. No cuts or bumps after shaving!</li>
    <li> Got this as a free sample from bzz agent to try out. And i must say...WHERE HAVE U BEEN ALL MY LIFE. It glides so smooth that you almost forget your shaving and literally leaves your legs feeling silky smooth. Highly recommended to friends and family!!</li>
    <li> First, I must say that I am trying this product out, thanks to Schick, second, I LOVE these razors! They really did provide for a smooth, close shave. And they left my legs feeling silky smooth! The only thing I would change, would be that the shave bars that are on the razors, would last longer. but other then that, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great shave!</li>
    <li> I was initially very pleased with this razor- from the cost to the angle on the handle, everything seemed to be great. However, after only three shaves, the moisturizing bar became sticky and completely fell off the product. I was still able to use it, but it was not as good of a shave without the moisturizing bar.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to shave. It is more of a hassle for me. But when I shaved to review the Schick Hydro Silk razor and the Skintimate skin therapy silky skin shave gel, I actually had a little fun. I was watching myself shave to see how the razor moves on my skin. (normally I do it quickly just to get it over with). I was amazed! It worked so well when it came to my knees. It smoothly and easily shaved around my knees. The razor was very comfortable to handle and hold. My legs were very smooth afterwards. I didn&#x27;t even apply any lotion, and I normally have to after I shave. The razor has a moisturizing serum strip that is activated by water, making it possible to shave without shaving cream. Bottom line, for disposable razors, these are awesome! I am slowly beginning to enjoy my personal time shaving ;) I have received this product free from BuzzAgent for testing purposes and review.</li>
    <li> I love this razor got it for free to try from bzzzagent  and its the best disposable razor out there have 5 blades which makes your legs smooth and water activated moisture strip that last for hours and the easy grip handle is a plus !</li>
    <li> Great handle contour, I wish more razors had it. I did however get BAD razor burn and I even used skintimate shave gel. Thank you Shick for the free sample of this to try, maybe if you took 2 of the blades off it wouldn&#x27;t cause so much friction?</li>
    <li> In all honesty I am in love with these new razors! I just cant get enough of it It&#x27;s not a pain to shave now. LOVE IT! MY legs feel so smooth and I don&#x27;t have to worry about going a bit faster because I hardly cut myself at all. It&#x27;s great! Received my Razor complementary free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my Schick Hydro Razors that I received for free as a BzzAgent. The only recommendation I have is that these razors don&#x27;t require a lot of shaving cream. If you pile on the shaving cream, I notice that you don&#x27;t get as close of a shave and may get some nicks. Because of the Hydro features, only a thin layer of shaving cream (or none at all) is required.</li>
    <li> I received these razors free as a promotional sample from Schick to try for free. I love them. The head of the razor bends for easy shaving experience and the handle is easy to grip. After shaving several times with these I noticed my skin was softer and more appealing. I would recommend these to any woman.</li>
    <li> I got these razors along with some Skintimate shave gel to try from BuzzAgent.com.  I tried them and really like them!! I usually have terrible razor burn but got a nice close shave with out the bumps and nicks I usually get.  The five blades are great for getting that nice, smooth shave that I need now that the weather is warmer and I can wear shorts!</li>
    <li> My wife used these, but pretty much feels the same way I do about the ones for men.  Better than the models you have to buy replacement blades for, and has very slick and painless action.  Makes legs nice for rubbing your face all over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a different brand for many years (Gillette Venus) and have been happy with them. But I was actually amazed what a difference there was in the Schick Hydro Silk razor. Honestly, I was sure there was a cover over the blades because it felt like I was shaving with a piece of soft felt over my legs. I had to keep looking to make sure it was actually doing something because I never once felt the edge of the blade or a scrape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how they do it but it works. This gives a clean, close shave in all areas. It has a molded contour handle for easy gripping and less chance of dropping it in the shower. The head pivots for going around curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly soft, you won&#x27;t even think you are shaving.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these and overall seemed to like them. The razors made her legs smooth and didn&#x27;t leave bumps, red marks or nicks. She liked the handle and grip, it was easy to hold while using in the shower. She did think the gel may have been a bit much however and at times it had to be rinsed off. Overall, she thought this was a good product for the money and better than most disposables out there. Recommended.</li>
    <li> These are great disposable razors. They give a clean shave, and are very comfortable to use. The lubricant is not sticky or bothersome at all. It washes away quickly and cleanly and definitely is helpful in shaving. I would recommend these razors to others.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot- I never thought I&#x27;d want a five-blade razor, but you will get a really god, close shave with them. As a plus- they last a lot longer than your average twin blade.</li>
    <li> #Gotitfree&lt;br /&gt;I received this free product, thanks to Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package has three razors, high-value coupons, which already used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the product immediately I thought I would skin allergy. But no, on the contrary it leaves the skin soft, and shaving is perfect ... so you have to try the product before you think that is not good for you.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that worried me was the width of the knife, thought I would cut. However, it was not. Having five knives allows a good finish and not have to re-shave the same place several times.</li>
    <li> When I took on this campaign, I really wasn&#x27;t that hopeful that this product would get me to change my commitment to the Venus razor that I have been using for years.  I figured I would give it a try, and from the first time I used it, I am hooked.  My legs stay smooth for much longer than when I use the Venus.  I only gave 4/5 stars because I do find that I get more nicks than usual, but I do love how much smoother my legs are and stay with this product.  I would definitely recommend trying this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have EVER used! I am prone to razor burn and I have a difficult time using 90% of razors that are on the market. I got a FREE sample of these from a website I use called BzzAgent. This razor gets a close shave and the moisturizer built into it will leave your legs soft &amp; uber touchable. SO nice! #BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I was given some Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors from the company to try for free as a BzzAgent. They came at the perfect time, as I was freshly out of my cartridges for my refillable razor and was about to buy more. I was happy to try these out in contrast to what I was currently using. As a busy mom, I don&#x27;t have much time to shave, so I don&#x27;t do it that often. In addition to the razors, I was also given Skintimate® Silky Skin Shave Gel to use. I generally just use conditioner or shampoo when I shave my legs, but gave it a shot. I didn&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference in the results between the gel and using shampoo or conditioner, but maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough gel. I did get less nicks, especially around my ankles and knees, than I have sometimes with other razors. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the water activated serum around the blades, though. While it did help lubricate the razors so they seemed to glide better, it seemed like it also sort of got stuck in the blades making it harder to shave longer hairs. Also, when left without the small plastic cover on, the serum got stuck to the shower wall and peeled off. The shave was quite close, though, and I liked that. Often, in the past, I have been left with bumps and had to go over an area several times for ultimate smoothness. The razor would catch the hair more than cut it, and I could feel as it went over the hairs. With this one, it was such a smooth shave and left my skin so smooth that I actually had to double check to make sure it worked. I have definitely been happy with how it&#x27;s helped to smooth out my underarms. I think I would prefer that the serum was more solid and harder for it to come off of the razor, but as I said, all things considered, I was definitely happy with the ultimate outcome of the shave.</li>
    <li> My first impression of the Schick Hydro Silk Disposable razors was that I knew I got an amazing product just from the look of the packaging. The packaging was super cute and feminine looking. I could also tell that these razors were awesome because they looked exactly like the regular Schick Hydro Silk razor that I usually use. These razor gave a new name to disposable razors! They were really easy to use and the hydrating serum left my legs feeling super soft and baby smooth. The five blades and flexible head gave me a close and easy shave. The five blades as well as handle design enables a smooth shave for even the hardest areas. I highly recommend that anyone looking for a good disposable razor to try these razors! I promise you will be left with amazing results!</li>
    <li> Loved the smoothness of my legs ayer shaving with these!</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors free as a promotion from Schick. I honestly thought big deal, all disposable razors are the same. I was wrong. When I first shaved my legs with this razor it felt so smooth that I literally checked to make sure I had taken the cap off. Something about the angle of the handle gives you such a close shave. I even shave less often. I won&#x27;t be buying any other razor from now on!</li>
    <li> Great shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Bzzagent, I was able to try out these razors for free. I hate shaving, but these blades make the experience go by much more smoothly, literally. The moisture activated contoured edges allows for a close shave. There are fewer knicks and and my skin is left nice and smooth when I&#x27;m done. With these blades, I get about an additional two days between each shave. And because shaving always adds time to the shower, that&#x27;s a major plus. These are a must try! #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposable</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like to shave every other day, and with the Schick Hydro Silk Disposables, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to! However, with these razors, I almost enjoy shaving. The rubber grip handle makes it easy to control and the 5 curve-sensing blades allow for a really close shave without the fear of nicking myself. I love the razor&#x27;s water-activated moisturizing serum that lasts for several uses and makes my legs feel super smooth the entire day! BzzAgent couldn&#x27;t pick a better time to send me a sample package of these razors as part of a promotion from Schick. With the beautiful summer weather approaching, I&#x27;ve been going to the beach several times a week and I feel great in my bikini! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of these and thought I&#x27;d give them a try. At first I was really excited because they have one more blade than my usual Schick Quattro razor. I have to say the moisturizing element to it does feel very good and smooth and just glides over your skin like nothing. But overall the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as my usual razor (I tried several times) and my legs always felt a little rough at the end of the day. I found that terribly disappointing because the razors are very nice for disposable and they have great handles and they feel so nice when you use them, but It&#x27;s just not the closest shave ever.</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best razors I have ever used. The handle is well designed so it&#x27;s easy to hold on to in the shower, the moisture strips actually do work and the 5 blades ensures you get the perfect shave every time! I have been a loyal consumer of these for a long time and I recently received a free sample from Schick and was thrilled!</li>
    <li> First of all, I recieved this for free from Schick and BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used disposable razors before, and this is the typical kind you can get anywhere, if you’re willing to shell out a little more for a better brand.  It really didn’t blow me away with price, that was about average for this kind of razor and brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that it did keep my legs soft and silky over the two hour mark they start, so I didn’t need lotion.  The best feature of this product was the fact I didn’t end up with those red, little razor bumps that I always get.  And if you’re wondering, my hair grew back at the same rate as with any five-blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the razor is sleek, which makes you think it will be one of a kind, but after further use, it was just a regular razor.  It really didn’t ‘feel’ different from any other disposable I’ve use in that aspect.  They claim that the design helps razor burn, if this is the reason, I don’t see how.  It reminds me a lot of their other Schicks’ in handle, comfort, and blade count.  Cheap razors slip, but higher priced ones, at least for me, have never, that’s nothing new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way it sits was a plus, the ‘face’ of the razor didn’t sit on the counter, so the sticky moisturizing serum strip didn’t get stuck and have to be pried free.  That has happened several times over the years to me.  When I’m in a hurry, I don’t remember to check if I’ll have to scrap the razor free the next day. So the raised handle rest was certainly a nice feature, and can’t say that I’ve seen that in other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;*no razor bumps/burn&lt;br /&gt;*skin stayed soft and smooth longer&lt;br /&gt;*moisturizing strip doesn’t stick like other brands&lt;br /&gt;*raised handle for unique design&lt;br /&gt;*is widely available in stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;*Price is average for disposable razor&lt;br /&gt;*Design is normal in most aspects of a razor - it shaves&lt;br /&gt;*I feel the moisturizing strip was ‘used’ a little too fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a while now and love them, they don&#x27;t cut your skin ever.</li>
    <li> I got this product to test out through BzzAgent for free to try. I would say this product is amazing. It was the first time me using these awesome easy  advanced razors. My first attempt I got great results. It was easy to get hard to reach places in no time. I shaved my body in less than 15 mins with out any pricks of blood. So it is easy to shave if you are in a rush. It had my skin so soft, silky, and smooth. It felt like I had put lotion on afterwards. Schick Hydro Silk razors are now my best friends. Lol</li>
    <li> Loved this razor!!!! I received this razor for review from Bzzagent and im so glad I did! The curved handle is amazing and gives so much control even in the hard to reach places.Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables are great for sensitive skin and extremely hydrating.</li>
    <li> These razors worked wonderfully on my legs! They felt hydrated and smooth LONG after shaving. The handle is also very nice and comfortable. It allowed for an easy shave and was not slippery at all! Compared to other disposable razors that I have tried, these razors are definitely at the top of  my list!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free as part of a promo along with some coupons for discounts on future razor purchases provided via a program run by Schick Hydro Silk. I am truly amazed at how well it actually works! I like to shave every day and that can be very harsh on my skin. Especially on my bikini area. So far I have used this razor for two days in a row with no breakouts or bumps. That is a first for me. I am very impressed at how moisturizing it actually felt while shaving with it. You can feel how silky and smooth it leaves your skin feeling.Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Great smooth shave, and easy to use. They can get around curves too! Lasts a very long time. I got a free pack because of BzzAgent and loved them so much I went out and bought more!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free from Bzz Agent and Schick.I really love this Schick hydro silk disposable razor! It left me with a very close shave that lasted for days! The first time I used it I saw a big difference from my usual razor. I really like the moisture strip it has my skin feels great right after I shave. The first time i used it I didn&#x27;t even use shave gel. It did a great job even without it! It has a good handle that keeps it from slipping.I had no problems with any cuts. It glides right over the places I usually get cuts like ankles and knees. I love that my legs feel so soft and smooth! I would buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> Great I love these razors</li>
    <li> Found these on sale and thought I would give them a try. They work well and I would purchase them again if they were on sale.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been a slight bit sensitive during and after shaving. I can not it use the Daisy shavers as they leave me feeling burned. The Bic Soleil leaves me feeling raw from razor burn. Even the Schick Intuition and the Gillette Venus have left me itchy with red bumps and the blades would get slimy. But these, so far, are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor&#x27; has a nice handle that is not angled to much so as to nick ones self easily. You can grip the handle quite well, even when in the wet and soapy/shaving cream covered hands. I like the angle of the head. Some razors seem to be more flat headed and thus I have easily nicked or gotten razor burn. A friend tried one and did not like the angles as I do, but I think she could shave with a steak knife and would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 blades. Some state this is overkill, I do not know if the 5 blades are an improvement over 3 or 4 blades. I am certain it is a significant improvement over single blade razors. My only certainty in this regards is, I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertisement states, \\&quot;\\&quot;Water-activated moisturizing serum gives back moisture for up to 2 hours after shaving\\&quot;, I do not know if that is true or not, but I do know that I do not feel the irritation I have experienced post shave as I have with almost every other disposable razor I have tried. The areas shaved feel smooth and hair free. I can run my hands over the area and not have that burning sensation I have become accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price, yes, it is steep. But I do not mind the price since I have, yet, to feel any of the discomforts I normally am left with post shave. I loved these so much, I bought a pack for my daughter who has also stated she loves them. She doe snot have the sensitive skin as I do, but she said she likes the 5 heads as she feels it better removes the hair and leaves her feeling smoother. She says she feels the skin on her legs feels softer since using the &#x27;Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor&#x27;. She has informed me these are now her favorite razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I would highly and enthusiastically recommend this razor!!isposable Razor&#x27;. She has informed me these are now her favorite razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I would highly and enthusiastically recommend this razor!!</li>
    <li> The Hydro Silk is a nice razor, though it hasn&#x27;t quite won me over to using it exclusively. Bottom line is that I get a smooth shave and haven&#x27;t experienced any cuts or nicks. The handle is comfortable and I do like that the shape keeps the blades elevated off the tub or counter. The \\&quot;water activated moisturizing serum\\&quot; did seem moisturizing, or at least lubricating during the shave, but lasted through only a couple of shaves and was gone. The razor still worked fine without it. The head of the razor is very wide, which isn&#x27;t my preference as I associate it with less control, but I did still get a good shave without any cuts so I can&#x27;t say it caused a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B004TGUKG0 Braun Silk Wet &amp; Dry Epilator]] on my legs for several years. I like it because it keeps me from having to shave as often as I used to and the hair is much finer than before. Unfortunately it is a time consuming process so when I have a last minute need for smooth legs I usually reach for a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried the [[ASIN:B00AHF1GTM Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor]] for the first time, it was in the shower.  I found the handle comfortable to hold and it glided across my legs smoothly without any catching even on areas that had not been soaped up.  And while I originally didn&#x27;t think there was going to be anything better about having 5 blades, rather than the 3 blade disposable razor I had been using; I was wrong.  It definitely provided a smoother, cleaner shave with not one nick or cut regardless of how quick and careless I might have been at moments. Additionally using this razor under my arms has also provided me with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will definitely keep using this razor for my underarms and for the occasional quick shave when I don&#x27;t have time to use my epilator.</li>
    <li> These razors are ok, but that&#x27;s about it. It is nice to not have to use a separate shave cream for your legs, but it seemed like the blades clogged with the stubble so quickly. The hair was actually harder to rinse of the razor, too. This made it take longer to shave because you have to try to unclog the blades so often. If you do try and use a shave cream with these razors, it clogs even faster and doesn&#x27;t actually shave very well. I think the shave cream mixes badly with the product that is already attached to the razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the closeness of the shave, it was pretty good. Probably about the same as Schick Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like it was best to use it for only legs though. The plastic frame around the actual blades of the razor is too wide/thick for the bikini area. Also, for some reason it didn&#x27;t leave my underarms totally smooth. I don&#x27;t usually have any issues getting my underarms smooth, so I am not sure why this razor did a less than ideal job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is ok if you just need it for your legs and do not mind having to try and unclog the blades constantly. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though unless it was on a really good sale/clearance - the hassle isn&#x27;t worth the price otherwise.</li>
    <li> I use it under shower for a quick touch ups on my legs (after years of waxing hair is weak and minimal and where there&#x27;s no time to wax I shave).&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how well it went with just a water, while regular disposable razors actually cut and hurt. These are sharp and I can use them more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shape of the handle is unique and feels really stable to avoid any cuts. I really love it.</li>
    <li> My wife tried this razor and was very pleased at the results. She liked that it was fairly light, loved the fact that it had a special lubricant that made it glide over her skin, and really appreciated the fact that it didn&#x27;t cut her. Apparently shaving one&#x27;s legs can be bloody and quite painful, and she has decided to make this razor her new favorite item.</li>
    <li> I have never been faithful to a single razor brand or type before, and usually bought the middle range generic razors at Target. My last batch from Target was really disappointing, so I thought I&#x27;d try a name brand. I love these razors. They seem very well made and are very efficient. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this razor.  I tend to buy the cheapest safesty razors around and to avoid the ones with lotion strips as they become gunky quickly.  The Schick Hydro Silk Disposable Razor clearly uses a different kind of lotion strip -- one that works.  The razor does an EXCELLENT job -- smooth shave and easy to use.  It also lasts for quite a few shaves -- and works very well for up to a week -- another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have begun purchasing this razor regularly.  The price is very reasonable, the feel of your skin is terrific, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My go to razor of choice.</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest disposable razor I have ever experienced. I used this razor to shave my underarms, legs, bikini area and arms and I experienced no razor burn and no cuts. It performs well even with dry shaving! Each razor should last you about 8-10 shaves before it gets rusty and is time to switch to the next one. I would say for a good clean shave, these 3 razors should last you about 2 months. Enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> I received these razors along with coupons as part of the Bzz Agent Site, I absolutely love these razors, they are are easy to use, they give a clean, smooth, close shave. They are easy to take on the go and use at home on a regular basis. With the new elevated handle rest they stay clear of water and debris from the shower so they stay clean for every use.</li>
    <li> These are the only razors I use. I have extremely dry skin and the moisturizing serum in the razors leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> I received a free package of these razors courtesy of Schick and bzz agent. I used one immediately after opening the package and I was so impressed! I normally just use whichever razor I grab at the store or my husbands razor but this one is going to be the one I look for from now on. I immediately noticed the 5 blades on this razor and how soft the handle was to grip. This razor was so easy to shave with that I did not have to do the normal touch up routine! It Easily maneuvered my knee cap and curves as well! The best thing is that my skin has never felt so smooth or hydrated and even hours after shaving, they feel completely amazing!!! My new favorite razors!!! Every woman should use these razors! You deserve it!!!</li>
    <li> I am trying these razors FREE from Schick and Bzzagent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my go to razors now! They a cute to begin with, the pretty purple packaging catches your eye and the razor itself is also easy on the eyes. The handle has a nice grip and is comfortable to hold. The blades really curve to your body to get you a close smooth shave, even in tricky spots. After shaving and stepping out of the shower, my legs are smooth and hydrated and it&#x27;s okay if I forget lotion sometimes because my legs aren&#x27;t dry and sore after shaving with this razor. Love love love them!</li>
    <li> I love these razors, I love how soft they make my skin and they definetely hydrate your skin and work great with sensitive skin, I got these free to try and I recommend them to all of you!</li>
    <li> I have always been a BIG venus disposable razor fan but then I tried this razor and I haven&#x27;t went back since. I got it FREE. Yes I said FREE from Bzzagent.com and they gave me some coupons to use and I definitely don&#x27;t regret it. I am in love! Definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This razor works well on all body parts and I highly recommend it. It does not leave you with any Knicks and is quick to shave with. The handle makes it easy to grip and the give of the razor head is excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s springtime! Time to break out the razors, ladies!!! Schick is my favorite brand of razor &amp; the Hydro Silk Disposables are AWESOME!! Clean, smooth shave! Thanks to Schick &amp; BzzAgent, I had the opportunity to try these razors for free &amp; I am hooked! Because they are disposable they are perfect for traveling, but I actually prefer them over my daily razor. Give them a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> received this product from Schick to test and sample. First let me start off my saying I havr very sensitive skin, I have tried numerous counts of different razors, from cheap ones to higher priced ones. All have left me unsastisfied. I always end up with cuts and itchy, dry skin.  Now I have to say that when I tried this product, I was in disbelief. I first applied shaving cream on my legs and proceeded to pass the razor. My first thought was-this doesnt work. Why? Because I COULD NOT FEEL A THING!!!! I though it wasnt shaving my hair off bc it was so smooth! No scracthing against my skin, unlike w other razors. I immediately wiped off the shaving cream, and saw it did work! Still in disbelief about how smooth and soft the shave was, I kept working down my leg and onto the other leg.  I was done in a breeze. Well I was ready to dry off and expect to see a few cuts and itchy skin. I WAS WRONG! No cuts! I just couldnt believe it. And to top ot off, my legs felt so smooth and soft without even putting lotion on. I havent been itchy or had to scratch my legs. The shave with the 5 blades is amazing!;I am really impressed with this product. I finally can have beautiful soft legs! Ladies we have a winner!!!! #GotItFree #HydroSilkDisposables</li>
    <li> Loved this razor! It left my legs smooth and soft, the only problem I had was I nicked my armpit. The handle is great, it doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> I got these razors compliments of Schick through BzzAgent.  I found that they give a really close shave resulting in silky smooth skin.  I had no issues with razor burn. I like the shape of the handle as well!!</li>
    <li> I got my Hydro Schick Disposables free to try from Schick, they are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a water activated serum that hydrates the skin longer than any other razors I tried, leaving my skin so lovable and smooth. My legs are so soft afterwards and the razors stay sharp for a long time. The 5 blades made it easy to shave in the hard places. They’re easy to handle. The soft-touch, ergonomic handle features multiple rubber grips in a ripple pattern for ultimate control while shaving.</li>
    <li> I just used these last night and was very happy with this razo and i love moisture strips first time a shaved does not irritate my skin..I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Got these razors for free from Bzzagent.  Best razors I&#x27;ve tried.  Smooth close shave.  Rippled handle keeps it from slipping.  #gotitfree</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome! I usually don&#x27;t care which brand I go with, but I was lucky to try this product free by Schick and I am totally sticking with these forever. The handle has an easy grip and it gave me a super smooth shave. They are the best disposable razors I have ever used and they last a while too. The price makes them even more perfect. An added bonus to purchase would be their shaving cream. These razors left my skin super smooth and hydrated feeling. These are a must have !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently tested out this razor for the brand and Bzzagent. I&#x27;ve tried out many razors before. My personal favorites are Gillette and Schick. So I wasn&#x27;t surprised to find out how much I would love this razor. I recently went on a weekend trip to river head and brought this razor, I forgot to pack moisturizer and I was freaking out until I realized that I actually didn&#x27;t even need it. I mean I would have preferred it but I really did not need it, You could not see any dryness on my legs and they were incredibly smooth.</li>
    <li> i am so happy using this because i always had problems, shaving my legs for summer . finally i am happy to use Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables for an instant shave and whoaa i am ready to wear shorts and can go out . its smooth for several days . excited as I #GotItFree thanks #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free through BzzAgent. And Thank goodness for them and Schick Hydro, I love this razor, feels sooooo smooth on my legs, and no cuts! It was so smooth I felt that it wasnt shaving as good, but when I got out the shower, I realized this was not the case. I have been using those simple gillette disposable razors for males because of the price, but I just realized how worth it a razor like this is.</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing, they do not irritate my skin or leave a after shave redness. They are left nice and soft with a close shave. If you haven&#x27;t tired this product PLEASE so does. you wont be disappointed at all, and the great part is that i received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.THEY ARE GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I am currently testing these razors for free thanks to Schick and am loving them. They do a great job of shaving closely without any tugging or pulling. The moving head makes it easy to shave around ankles without cutting oneself. They leave my legs feeling smooth for more days after than any other brand of razors I&#x27;ve tried. My #1 razor choice.</li>
    <li> I got these razors for free as part of a bzz campaign and from schick to test out. I absolutely love the way these razors make my legs feel! With summer coming up, I have to shave every day, to every other day, and must admit I usually dread it! With these razors I have actually been enjoying shaving. The built in moisturizer helps with my dry skin, living in the desert and all. These are definitely a summer must-have!</li>
    <li> I love these Schick HydroSilk Razors! They get so close of shave and don&#x27;t give me any razor burns. I was sent these razors to test out by BzzAgent and I am so glad! 😊 My legs are so smooth!</li>
    <li> I got the opportunity to try out these razors courtesy of Schick. These razors are seriously the best on the market! The shave is so close with 5 blades and the feeling of your legs after - silky soft. My legs felt so soft even a few hours after shaving. My Husband even made a comment about how soft my legs were! I loved the handle design and flexible razor head. I was able to get all those hard to reach places including the back of my knees without 1 knick (a very rare occurrence)! If you&#x27;re looking for a razor that will leave you feeling silky smooth for days, look no further than Schick Hydro Silk Disposables.</li>
    <li> I think the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposables razors compare well to other brands such as Bic and Gillette.  The box was easy to open. I liked how each razor had its own cover.  The first time I tried the razor it took me a couple of times of going over the hair on my legs to get a close shave.  It was nice having a serum on the razor as I shaved because it allowed me to have the option of shaving without shaving cream.  My legs felt hydrated maybe 20 minutes after shaving, but it also made my legs feel a bit itchy afterwards.  However, I did not have razor burn or any cuts on my legs.  When it came to the 5 Curve Sensing blades I did not notice them being there and it did not make that much of a difference to those hard to reach places.  The handle and cartridge design has a nice grip to them and it makes it easy to hold on to, giving ease that the razor will not slip out from your hands.  The razor has a nice color or blue on them.  As of right now I am not over the moon about the razor, but I am willing to give it another try to see if will make a difference.  Maybe I will see something I did not see before or I might have better results.  Thanks to Schick I was able to try it free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million hair removal methods and razors all leaving me with a painful burn and stubble. These are 80 percent better than the results I was getting. I have highly allergic skin and was still in a bit of pain but nothing in comparison. My legs are smooth and I was so thankful I got to try them!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of these and i have to say, they&#x27;re amazing! if i didn&#x27;t already have shaving cream, i wouldn&#x27;t use it! i like that this razor has moisturizer on both sides of the blade so you get not only a close shave, but my legs were very moisturized afterwards! the blades also last awhile. ive been using the same razor for over a week and i shave a couple times a week. these are so smooth i had to check to make sure i was removing hair. you dont get that rough scraping feel you get from cheap disposables. definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I used this shaver and only had to shave my legs 2 times in over a week. Same shavers still has activating serum and is still sharp and not dull. I have had no cuts or ingrown hairs from these shavers and it doesn&#x27;t take me as long as it did with other shavers fearing those dreadful cuts. These are definitely worth the money. I did receive this product for free to sample from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> received this product for free to review thru bzzagent. I absolutely love this product. I consider myself very hairy ( I have to shave every three days). I also have had the same reoccurring problems with every razor that I have used in the past weather they have 3,5, or even six blades. The first problem that I have is that I have to shave over an area repeatedly to get a close shave. The second problem is that I always have hair left on my hard to reach areas which is the sides of my knees, my ankles, and also the back of my thighs. I usually end up with nicks on those areas because its very hard to get the razor the grab those hairs effectively. My third problem is that shaving dries my already dry skin even more. So I end up having to put cocoa butter on top of whatever lotion I put on to keep my legs moisturized. Schick Hydro Silk nails all of these problems for me. I no longer have to step out of the shower after shaving to examine my legs and see what areas were not reached. I also don&#x27;t have to shave over the same area as often. The most exciting part is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining my outfits if I shaved right before I go out. You&#x27;d  be amazed at how much petroleum jelly and cocoa butter can transfer on clothes. I still put lotion on, and my legs are less dried out from the shaving. Another added bonus that I found from this product is that its great for shaving hair on your upper lip, it really contours to grab everything well.</li>
    <li> The hydro silk razor has been my favorite for a while now and I&#x27;m thrilled that it now comes in a disposable version. It&#x27;s more convenient for travel, trips to the gym, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry and sensitive skin and this is the only razor I have found that gives a great close shave without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> All disposable razors really aren&#x27;t alike - some give you a much closer, smoother shave, and they last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d put the Schick Hydro Silk in that class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a razor for my underarms and legs, and this is a winner for use in the shower. Works fast, head curves with your strokes and holds nimbly against your leg, and it&#x27;s easy to hold rubber handle when your fingers are soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how important the \\&quot;water activated moisturizing serum infused with marine extracts\\&quot; is. I know I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference under all the shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend (leaving off one star for price issues; you can definitely get this cheaper in your local supermarket.)</li>
