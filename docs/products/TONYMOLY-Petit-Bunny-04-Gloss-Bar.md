      <li>love this!</li>
      <li>This is a nice lip gloss bar for your lips.</li>
      <li>so I pair it with some rose salve.</li>
      <li>Which is awesome because you get to use absolutely all of your product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, and let&#x27;s be honest here...</li>
      <li>Also received a free face mask which was nice!</li>
      <li>Love these cute bunny glosses!</li>
      <li>The product goes on very smooth and the color pay off is nice.</li>
      <li>Loving this cute product.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s smooth and nicely scented and the packaging is just too cute!</li>
      <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s a very smooth lightweight gloss.</li>
      <li>The color pay off is nice and the tubes are super cute!</li>
      <li>Oh, and did I mention it&#x27;s adorable and</li>
      <li>I ordered this from SeoulGlamour the way the packaged it was fantastic!</li>
      <li>i love wearing it.</li>
      <li>However, you can increase color intensity with more application, or even wear it over some lipstick for some additional color/shine.</li>
      <li>Really cute product.</li>
      <li>The Petite Bunny packaging is SOOOO cute.</li>
      <li>we bought it because it&#x27;s cute.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>and I love the way this color looks on me.</li>
      <li>more color than a lip tint.</li>
      <li>super cute too!</li>
      <li>This product is such a pleasant surprise!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I bought it for the packaging as much as anything else, and I love it.</li>
      <li>The packaging is adorable, the color is nice and light, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It helps to hide and fill all the fine lines that come along with not getting 16 anymore.</li>
      <li>love the cute bunny, that was the main reason I purchased it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fool for great customer service and I will DEFINITELY be ordering from this seller again.</li>
      <li>The packaging is adorable and when I first opened it, I didn&#x27;t realize it was a twist.</li>
      <li>Nice sheer color and cute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute and very soft on my lips!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I got when I ordered it online!</li>
      <li>nice smooth formula, pretty, universally flattering color.</li>
      <li>The colour is a nice pinky red.  </li>
      <li>Feels nice while does last - not too sticky or slippery</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s a solid gloss it also isn&#x27;t too sticky or runny, and is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Not only was my order accurate and super quick, but they gave me a free gift (which happened to be a product I had really wanted to try) and a personalized note was attached thanking me for purchasing from them.</li>
      <li>The colors look extra bright in the package, but they apply as a very natural tint.</li>
      <li>How great was coming home to a surprise package in my mailbox only 1 week later!!</li>
      <li>However not all of the colors are consistent, the PEACH and NEON RED are great but the rest have the same consistency as chap stick.</li>
      <li>It applies very smooth and it&#x27;s extra hydrating.</li>
      <li>Arrived several weeks ahead of time, prepackaged and it&#x27;s just so cute; it has a fruity scent and the colour is just like the container.</li>
      <li>I tested it on my hand first and the shade matches the bar itself.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more colors.</li>
      <li>I had heard a lot about the brand and the packaging looked cute, but the price point is so low that I figured it was drug store quality.</li>
      <li>This was my first TONYMOLY product.</li>
      <li>This Gloss is very creamy and packs a lot of pigment.</li>
      <li>depending on how much you swatch it on it can be a tint or the color of the tube itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t add much color</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s really almost like a lip stain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very creamy and not just glossy.</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well made and sturdy.</li>
      <li>I never looked good in red lipstick but neon red actually works for me.</li>
      <li>smells nice too but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It is solid enough to have a very precise application on your lips as well.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to all ages.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the hollow cheap plastic that cracks inside of your purse.</li>
      <li>Not only comes in a cute packaging but it also looks really natural on me, definitely what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>just the right gloss and colour, especially for school wear!</li>
      <li>Overall, I think its a very wearable color during the day since its not too bold and can even look almost natural with minimal application.</li>
      <li>I got a pretty long wear out of it for a gloss, about 5 hours.</li>
      <li>You can build as much color as you want, from sheer to solid, just by putting on a couple of extra coats.</li>
      <li>The packaging is worth a few extra bucks alone.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t left bare lipped with the rest of my face done.</li>

    <li> just the right gloss and colour, especially for school wear! super cute too!</li>
    <li> this is the cutest thing ever ! I love it !</li>
    <li> Great color already planning on buying the set</li>
    <li> These Tonymoly gloss bars are cute and wonderful. Do not expect it to last all day though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lip gloss bar for your lips. It has a nice flavor and scent and the tinted coloring I think is perfect. Not too much but not too subtle either. It&#x27;s also very creamy and not just glossy. However not all of the colors are consistent, the PEACH and NEON RED are great but the rest have the same consistency as chap stick. It still tints but not as well and not at all creamy. But I definitely recommend peach and neon red. Neon red is like red but slightly lighter. I never looked good in red lipstick but neon red actually works for me.</li>
    <li> Really cute product. The packaging is adorable, the color is nice and light, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing. Also received a free face mask which was nice!</li>
    <li> very nice! i love wearing it. depending on how much you swatch it on it can be a tint or the color of the tube itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll be repurchasing this item when im out of mine !</li>
    <li> Loving this cute product. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from SeoulGlamour the way the packaged it was fantastic! in a little pink box (I ordered several items) and a lot of bubble wrap and it came way before the expected date. Not only comes in a cute packaging but it also looks really natural on me, definitely what i was looking for.</li>

    <li> This was my first TONYMOLY product. I had heard a lot about the brand and the packaging looked cute, but the price point is so low that I figured it was drug store quality. I&#x27;m really serious about my beauty products so I didn&#x27;t bother for a long time. This product is such a pleasant surprise! The Petite Bunny packaging is SOOOO cute. The photos don&#x27;t even do it justice. It&#x27;s very well made and sturdy. It&#x27;s not the hollow cheap plastic that cracks inside of your purse. The bunny is a twist up, solid gloss. Which is awesome because you get to use absolutely all of your product. It applies very smooth and it&#x27;s extra hydrating. It helps to hide and fill all the fine lines that come along with not getting 16 anymore. The colors look extra bright in the package, but they apply as a very natural tint. You can build as much color as you want, from sheer to solid, just by putting on a couple of extra coats. Like I said, it&#x27;s a very smooth lightweight gloss. It won&#x27;t get gunky our sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I got a pretty long wear out of it for a gloss, about 5 hours. And when it finally wore off it left behind a tint of color so I wasn&#x27;t left bare lipped with the rest of my face done. This is the PERFECT product. Now I need to try the rest of their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that Elephant24g was an AWESOME seller. I ordered this July 2nd, estimated delivery was August 28th. How great was coming home to a surprise package in my mailbox only 1 week later!! Not only was my order accurate and super quick, but they gave me a free gift (which happened to be a product I had really wanted to try) and a personalized note was attached thanking me for purchasing from them. I&#x27;m a fool for great customer service and I will DEFINITELY be ordering from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Stains your lips a little bit, so it lasts longer. but doesn&#x27;t fade blotchy. nice smooth formula, pretty, universally flattering color. Any who doesn&#x27;t want a bunny lip gloss??</li>
    <li> Beautiful and great quality</li>
    <li> I was afraid that I bought the wrong color but now that I have it, I am very pleased! It&#x27;s not that big but you don&#x27;t need much. Just a few swipes will do the trick. The product goes on very smooth and the color pay off is nice. Very cute and smells really good!</li>
    <li> Love these cute bunny glosses! The color pay off is nice and the tubes are super cute! I also love the way they smell!</li>
    <li> Arrived several weeks ahead of time, prepackaged and it&#x27;s just so cute; it has a fruity scent and the colour is just like the container. It lasts so long as I don&#x27;t wipe my lips or drink from a bottle, a bit drying so I pair it with some rose salve.</li>
    <li> I just used it for a few days and I absolutely love it. The packaging is adorable and when I first opened it, I didn&#x27;t realize it was a twist. I tested it on my hand first and the shade matches the bar itself. It has a glossy finish but over time when the gloss fades, my lips are still colored. So it&#x27;s really almost like a lip stain. I def will try the other shades!</li>
    <li> Color is sheer and buildable (but does not last long). Feels nice while does last - not too sticky or slippery (it&#x27;s a balm). Honestly, I bought it for the packaging as much as anything else, and I love it.</li>
    <li> Very cute. I&#x27;m a pale Caucasian girl with brown hair and brown eyes and I love the way this color looks on me. Since it&#x27;s a solid gloss it also isn&#x27;t too sticky or runny, and is very easy to apply. It smells very, very faintly of cherry candy. With the cap off, the stick is about the size of a very thick crayon. Oh, and did I mention it&#x27;s adorable and the rabbit theme goes great with my sailor moon makeup bag? Will definitely buy more colors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, and let&#x27;s be honest here...we bought it because it&#x27;s cute.  But the gloss is nice!</li>
    <li> The colour is a nice pinky red.  It smells good but it&#x27;s too drying on my lips.  I have to use a lip balm with it.</li>
    <li> I love this lipgloss! It doesn&#x27;t add much color but it&#x27;s smooth and nicely scented and the packaging is just too cute!</li>
    <li> The color is similar to what you&#x27;d see from a tinted lip balm. However, you can increase color intensity with more application, or even wear it over some lipstick for some additional color/shine. It does stain a bit with time, so I find that eating with this gloss bar on after a few hours won&#x27;t entirely remove the color. Overall, I think its a very wearable color during the day since its not too bold and can even look almost natural with minimal application.</li>
    <li> Nice sheer color and cute.</li>
    <li> love this! semi sheer with sheen. not as heavy or sticky as a gloss. more color than a lip tint. smells nice too but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> it moisturize your lips just like a regular lip balm</li>
    <li> I have not tried anything like the TonyMoly products in the U.S. I test a lot of products from Sephora and I must say that the TomyMoly products have the quality of cosmetics 2 to 3 times as expensive. The packaging is worth a few extra bucks alone. This Gloss is very creamy and packs a lot of pigment. It is solid enough to have a very precise application on your lips as well. I would highly recommend it to all ages.</li>
