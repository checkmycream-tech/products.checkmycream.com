      <li>We always use good hair products and never has that happened before or since that.</li>

      <li>When \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair becomes too silky, altho&#x27; it feels good, it tends to look \\&quot;stringy\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>However, if you have \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair like I do, this may not be a good thing.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, works better with each use, it has tamed my course hair.</li>

      <li>I love this conditioner!</li>

      <li>This conditioner is absolutely amazing.</li>

      <li>I have been using hte Alterna Bamboo shampoo for about a year and haven&#x27;t had a need to get the condition because I was still using another kind.</li>
      <li>I recommended this to my own mother.</li>
      <li>is by far the best Anti Frizz hair product I have ever used .after</li>
      <li>Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Smooth is perfect for my hair, gives it weightless bounce when I put it in hot rollers.</li>
      <li>My hair is colored and very fine and is always frizzy and when I tried this product, I was truly amazed with the results.</li>
      <li>I love Alterna but either this was counterfeit</li>
      <li>I love this one even better.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>I just love the while Bamboo line.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Great, , clean, healthy feel, and smells extraordinary.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used WEN and love it</li>
      <li>I like most Alterna products.</li>
      <li>Ok I gave it a try.....</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this conditioner after I went to my hairdresser who suggested it.</li>
      <li>Love this  conditioner.</li>
      <li>compared to Kerastase, Alterna Bamboo leaves the hair silkier, smoother, and more hydrated.</li>
      <li>This conditioner preserves my curls and minimizes the frizz in the most fantastic way!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair got very frizzy from medication and this has made a great difference.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>However, it is currently my favorite, along with the Bamboo shampoo and their styling oil.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel more moisturizer in the shower or out.  </li>
      <li>but this was just ok.  </li>
      <li>My hair has never been so healthy.</li>
      <li>Organic and healthy ingredients are an added bonus.</li>
      <li>Okay product.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo (and conditioner), makes my hair soft, tames the frizz and fly-aways, and smells great.  </li>
      <li>This product was okay, not as particulary special as some of the reviews had led me to believe.  </li>
      <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
      <li>This makes it so silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product...</li>
      <li>I have decided to try the alterna caviar instant recovery which has had great reviews.</li>
      <li>I tried using cheap shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Noticeably softer more manageable hair after first use.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s good if you have really frizzy hair and want bone straight styles, but if you just want something to smooth your hair without impacting its ability to hold curls, you&#x27;d probably want to look for something else.</li>
      <li>but the outcome is worth it!</li>
      <li>Didnt do anything special for my hair.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really seem to help with frizz, or softness, or be any better than the bargain brands.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner makes my relaxed hair so straight that it can&#x27;t even hold a curl made with the curling/flat iron for more than a day.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick and they taped up the dispenser so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.</li>
      <li>It seems to soak right into the hair and washes out cleanly.</li>
      <li>Made my hair silky smooth from the very firt use.  </li>
      <li>Love the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love how soft and manageable it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the scent</li>
      <li>It is a sponge for hair products and dries out really easily if the products aren&#x27;t rich enough.  </li>
      <li>good with less sulfates .</li>
      <li>I lugged 5 bottles of this and the conditioner back from the US to Singapore (90% humidity climate all year round!), and it made my hair silkier from the 1st wash, and smells great!</li>
      <li>It was ok, I will probably just stick to my regular Avalon Biotin Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I first saw this product advertise on QVC and wanted to try it.</li>
      <li>I love this product line, I only tried because I had a gift certificate.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft, smooth, silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>This product did exactly what it says it does..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners over the years on my frizzy, somewhat curly, somewhat wavy hair and they&#x27;d either left my hair too volumized or too</li>
      <li>Good for natural product and smoothing dry frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>It completely changed the texture of my hair, my hair lost all soft, healthy movement.</li>
      <li>My hair is super soft!</li>
      <li>my hair will be long and healthy again.</li>
      <li>I no longer have a head full of little frizzy hairs on top.</li>
      <li>I searched for it on Amazon and realized they had a large selection of products for all hair types.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would help my hair from frizzing but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I really am hooked.</li>
      <li>I can style it curly or straight, can even go a couple days between washings (wish is much healthier for the hair) without getting oily.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>The texture became very \\&quot;silky\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Dries out my hair too much.</li>
      <li>or it really just didn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
      <li>Works really welll for my very curtly tangled hair.  </li>
      <li>I really wished to like it though.</li>
      <li>I got the whole thing, conditioner, shampoo and oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this shampoo. For me it does help control some of my frizzy hair.  I also use the conditioner. Cleans well and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Works great for frizzy hair. Doesn&#x27;t not smell crazy, which I love. I recommended this to my own mother. My hair has never been so healthy.</li>
    <li> This product was okay, not as particulary special as some of the reviews had led me to believe.  Probably would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product line, I only tried because I had a gift certificate.  My hair is baby fine and this smoothed all my flyaways and did not weigh my hair down.  I love how soft and manageable it makes my hair feel.  I really am hooked. I used my old shampoo a few days later, and my hair felt try and was frizzy.  Will continue to use and it smells great too</li>
    <li> This conditioner is absolutely amazing. It makes my hair so silky smooth that I barely need any product after my shower--and I have naturally wavy/frizzy hair. I tried using cheap shampoo and conditioner exactly one time after I started using Bamboo, and my hair was an immediate mess. This makes it so silky and smooth. Worth every single penny.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t usually post a review, but for this item i bought i was encouraged to post a review for the benefit of the others....but let me tell you how it started. My friend recommend me the alterna bamboo shampoo and because i&#x27;m rushing that time instead of buying online i grabbed one from the mall and i was happy then, so i decided to buy alterna conditioner online coz im not rushing anymore... but it sucks!!! if there is a rating lower than 1 i&#x27;ll go for it!  i don&#x27;t feel like using a conditioner, instead its like using a flour mixed with water i with a little scent hmmm i think not a good one for me far far better from my regular Dove conditioner....</li>
    <li> I have dry bleached spider web thin hair. I&#x27;ve used WEN and love it but the price is unrealistic. This is a great product and I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;ve tried other Alterna shampoo and conditioner and didn&#x27;t like any of them as much. This is great for my needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners over the years on my frizzy, somewhat curly, somewhat wavy hair and they&#x27;d either left my hair too volumized or too weighed down. Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Smooth is perfect for my hair, gives it weightless bounce when I put it in hot rollers.</li>
    <li> I lugged 5 bottles of this and the conditioner back from the US to Singapore (90% humidity climate all year round!), and it made my hair silkier from the 1st wash, and smells great! I think the squeeze packaging is innovative too! Alterna, please come to Singapore!</li>
    <li> Alterna Anti-Frizz Conditioner made my hair VERY smooth and slick.  The texture became very \\&quot;silky\\&quot;.  However, if you have \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair like I do, this may not be a good thing.  Why??  When \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair becomes too silky, altho&#x27; it feels good, it tends to look \\&quot;stringy\\&quot;.  However, .... if you have thick, unruly, wiry, frizzy hair, then I can assure you, your hair will become well-tamed and \\&quot;de-frizzed\\&quot; after using this product.  BTW, if you have any CURL in your hair, this product will straighten your hair.  Not only was my hair silky, but it became bone straight. Ne&#x27;er a wave in sight.  I walked my dog while it was \\&quot;drizzling\\&quot; outside, and when I returned home, my hair looked the same &#x3D; silky AND straight. No frizz whatsoever. If that&#x27;s what you want, you&#x27;ll get it!</li>
    <li> Love this  conditioner. So hydrating and smells so good</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! Noticeably softer more manageable hair after first use. After my first bottle ran out, I got some drugstore mid line conditioner. After using that stuff my hair begged for the Alterna Bamboo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it, and as a consequence I tend to have a big poof of hair that is difficult to manage.  This shampoo (and conditioner), makes my hair soft, tames the frizz and fly-aways, and smells great.  Awesome shampoo</li>
    <li> This conditioner really does help smooth my frizzy, thick hair. My hair is EXTREMELY difficult to tame, and this actually makes a difference. I no longer have a head full of little frizzy hairs on top. I just recently bought the giant (~64oz) container, so I don&#x27;t have to keep re-ordering this every month. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very thick which I generally like because I have curly thick hair but this was just ok.  It didn&#x27;t feel more moisturizer in the shower or out.  I have decided to try the alterna caviar instant recovery which has had great reviews.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the scent but the outcome is worth it! My hair is super soft!</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it says it does.. a little too well! It smoothed my hair to the point my curls were toned way down and my volume reduced as well, but it definitely also got rid of frizz better than any other product I have tried! I wanted no frizz, but I wanted to keep my curls, so going to try the Alterna Curls one next and see if it works as well as this one!</li>
    <li> This started out ok then it  just made my hair heavy feeling. I went back to Suave Professionals used this as a body wash works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried ever known brand on both sides of the Equator mainly from living overseas and not having access to my regular brands forced me into another brand&#x27;s submission. This product is a new staple. A little goes a long way. You can feel the change in the shower. It detangles, smooths, conditions, and adds brilliance to the hair.  Even if you let your hair air-dry.  The shampoo I may interchange with Burt&#x27;s Bees moisturizing formula from time to time, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m giving up this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As compared to Kerastase, Alterna Bamboo leaves the hair silkier, smoother, and more hydrated. The hydration feels like it&#x27;s coming from within. I feel like my hair was hidden all along until this conditioner discovered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As compared to Fekkai color treated conditioning mask, the only thing Fekkai has on this one is the strawberry and champagne scent, BUT Alterna is more natural and paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;Alterna Bamboo Anti-Frizz is for you if you have thick, coarse hair or hair that is subject to frizz, dullness, or dehydration.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, smooth, silky and shiny. I use each time I wash my hair with the Alterna Bamboo shampoo.</li>
    <li> Cant say enough about this Alterna conditioner I have purchased this several times along with the shampoo and other Alterna products .This is by far the best Anti Frizz hair product I have ever used .after using this I no longer battle the frizz problem Alterna was my solution to all the bad hair days I had leaves my hair smooth  with shine .</li>
    <li> Most anti-frizz conditioners just weigh your hair down, this keeps the frizz out without the weight. I can style it curly or straight, can even go a couple days between washings (wish is much healthier for the hair) without getting oily. And it&#x27;s organic, which is a great bonus. Pair it with other Alterna Bamboo products.</li>
    <li> I usually buy it for much more at the salon but I was happy to see it offered at a lower rate!</li>
    <li> good with less sulfates . don&#x27;t have to use much. Don&#x27;t like the bottle it comes in , but the product is good</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this conditioner after I went to my hairdresser who suggested it. I have tried numerous products only to be disappointed. I have been using this product for over a year and continue to do so. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my relaxed hair so straight that it can&#x27;t even hold a curl made with the curling/flat iron for more than a day. I guess it&#x27;s good if you have really frizzy hair and want bone straight styles, but if you just want something to smooth your hair without impacting its ability to hold curls, you&#x27;d probably want to look for something else. Note that you&#x27;ll still be able to curl your hair, but it won&#x27;t last as long (e.g., I normally curl my hair and the curls last for a 2-3 days. With this conditioner, the curls last 1 day and then my hair is straight the next day)</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous...worth the money.  My hair is dry and colored and tends to have a straw feel to it. This makes it silky and shiney and no frizz!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works pretty well, however, the experience of trying to get it out of the bottle is incredibly frustrating.  I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad bottle or not, but after twisting the top open, it is extremely difficult to squeeze out the product.  I had to place the bottle on the floor and step on it to just get a quarter size amount out.  I tried to completely unscrew the top but that is impossible.  I also tried to de clog it, but it wasn&#x27;t clogged.</li>
    <li> Out of all Alterna products that I&#x27;ve tried this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all. I really wished to like it though.</li>
    <li> Great, , clean, healthy feel, and smells extraordinary. Love this shampoo...was a salon recommendation for my hair type: wavy, long, thin. I really enjoy this product...it is my go -to in hair care for over a year now.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of frizz even better than other Alterna conditioners I tried, but at the same time leaves the hair puffy and soft. Organic and healthy ingredients are an added bonus. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Made my hair silky smooth from the very firt use.  If your hair is chemically processed, dry and frizzes easly, you MUST try this!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly hair. It is a sponge for hair products and dries out really easily if the products aren&#x27;t rich enough.  This conditioner preserves my curls and minimizes the frizz in the most fantastic way!</li>
    <li> Love the product but not crazy about the bottle itself as it is a bit hard to get the product out once it goes down a bit.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would help my hair from frizzing but it doesn&#x27;t.  Dries out my hair too much.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bamboo line of shampoo, conditioner and hairspray at my hairstylists recommendation but am not that happy with it.  The conditioner seems to work ok I guess, but the bottle is frustrating to me.  It has a twist opening and is difficult to squeeze out the product.  It also seems that you need to use a lot of it to feel it on your  hair.  With the cost of this product, and the amount I need to use (I have short hair), and the difficulty of the bottle, I will not be buying this particular conditioner again. But, like I said....my hairstylist loves it.......so maybe it is just me.</li>
    <li> the product is really good...helps with my frizzy and dry hair.....i keep switching conditioners...so probably might by this again.....it goes long way....</li>
    <li> I have been using hte Alterna Bamboo shampoo for about a year and haven&#x27;t had a need to get the condition because I was still using another kind. Since I have finally started using both, i have noticed my hair feeling much softer and smoother by using both products together. Love the natural ingredients. It also does not strip the color out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Oh my gad I just hater the was product in the word I look creasy bad product really bad bad</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair. It was ok, I will probably just stick to my regular Avalon Biotin Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but the packaging is not well thought-out.  It is hard to get the conditioner out because it is really thick.  I store it upside down, and that helps somewhat.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Alerna is a great brand and this conditioner really works well for thick, coarse, dry, color treated hair.  I can&#x27;t give it a 5 because I have yet to find the perfect conditioner!  However, it is currently my favorite, along with the Bamboo shampoo and their styling oil.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  My hair got very frizzy from medication and this has made a great difference.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Works really welll for my very curtly tangled hair.  It gets the tangles out and gets rid of the frizz.  It smells really good!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a hair dresser. Cheaper on Amazon than the salon. Seems that I needed more than usual to cover my short head of hair. Just my feeling. I will give it a few more tries since it is a new product and I still need to test the frizz factor.</li>
    <li> Ok I gave it a try.....even though others said it made their hair like straw. I got the whole thing, conditioner, shampoo and oil. The oil is the only thing I would say worked. And yes my normal , soft, shiny hair turned to straw.....Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair that is oily at the roots and extremely dry at the ends. But any conditioner I used would weigh down my hair -- except this one. Not only does it leave my well moisturized for days (I only wash my hair 2x a week), it also keeps it light and manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bamboo Kendi oil, so I thought I should try their line of other hair products. This conditioner works well for my course, long hair.  It seems to soak right into the hair and washes out cleanly. It has a really nice fragrance. I just love the while Bamboo line.</li>
    <li> It was the only product of ALTERNA that didn&#x27;t work for me.It was supposed to be antifreeze but it seems that it freezes the hair</li>
    <li> Okay product.  Didnt do anything special for my hair.  Only purchased once.  Prefer products with keratin to make my hair soft</li>
    <li> High quality stuff. A little pricey but I try to ration so I don&#x27;t have to buy it too often. I like most Alterna products. The Caviar products are my favority</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really seem to help with frizz, or softness, or be any better than the bargain brands.  I went back to Suave</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy hair and this condition really seems to help.  I would buy it again and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Keeps my frizzy, naturally curly hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down or making it feel sticky or look greasy. One of the few products I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works. Shipped quick and they taped up the dispenser so it wouldn&#x27;t leak. On paper it seems like a small bottle, but this stuff goes a LONG way. One bottle of it will last me 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> HATED this!  I love Alterna but either this was counterfeit or it really just didn&#x27;t work with my hair. It completely changed the texture of my hair, my hair lost all soft, healthy movement. I gave it to my daughter and it did  the same to her hair. We always use good hair products and never has that happened before or since that. Choose your seller wisely, I probably just got some VO5 in a nice bottle.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product advertise on QVC and wanted to try it. I searched for it on Amazon and realized they had a large selection of products for all hair types. My hair is colored and very fine and is always frizzy and when I tried this product, I was truly amazed with the results. At first I was skeptical about trying it and I said to myself I&#x27;ve tried every other type of product so I might as well give this one a try also. I am glad I did. I will definitely continue to use the BAMBOO product lines since it has a large variety of products that I can use on my hair. As long as I keep my ends cut and my colored every 6-8 wks and my bi-weekly trips to the salon..my hair will be long and healthy again. Thanks Bamboo for this  magnificent product line.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, works better with each use, it has tamed my course hair. I use the conditioner and also alterna styling products.</li>
    <li> I usually use the volumizing bamboo conditioner but it wasn&#x27;t available. I have very long fine wavy hair so I don&#x27;t want anything heavy on it. I love this one even better. Less static electricity and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> Good for natural product and smoothing dry frizzy hair.</li>
