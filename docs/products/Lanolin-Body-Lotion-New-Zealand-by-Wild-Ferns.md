      <li>I was so excited when I came across this product.</li>
      <li>It is by far the best cream for dry skin.</li>
      <li>This product is gently scented, lasts for more than a day, and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>My skin is softer and has a nice, soft sheen (right word?)</li>
      <li>first, I was using the pharmaceutical grade lanolin that is used for breastfeeding, and although it worked like some amazing wonder, it was far too greasy to use every day.</li>
      <li>It is a very rich lotion which absorbs quickly, feels good on dry skin, and keeps skin feeling soft for hours.</li>
      <li>and it actually smells quite nice and is what I would call a gender-neutral scent.</li>

      <li>This was my first time ordering this product.  </li>

      <li>Koru Naturals supplies it and they are wonderfully fast.  </li>
      <li>the real thing</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, has a very light pleasant scent that disappears after a few seconds and has made a noticeable difference in my skin in only a few days.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy at all and the delicate rose scent is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Bought some when I was in Australia and New Zealand</li>
      <li>I have ordered the Parrs Lanolin Body Lotion for a couple of years after I purchased some in New Zealand.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After much research and many years of pain, embarrassment and trying to cover up my cracked, dry, scabbed and bleeding skin, I finally found out that high grade lanolin is not only naturally hypoallergenic, it is also naturally antibacterial and it is also the closest thing to the moisture in our own skin and is one of the only substances our skin will actually absorb deeply and not just plump up</li>
      <li>how long it took to be absorbed</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most of the lotions that claim to have lanolin in them, even having lanolin in their names, are actually petroleum based and only use it as a minor ingredient.</li>
      <li>and it probably irritates and dries out my skin, including all of those so-called sensitive and hypoallergenic soaps and lotions out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product because is is so delicate.  </li>
      <li>This simple lotion has replaced the super expensive facial moisturizers I have been using for years and it has given me amazing results.&lt;br</li>

      <li>No one can believe how soft and truly moisturized their skin actually feels.</li>
      <li>Within a couple day&#x27;s time my cracked, bleeding skin is actually healed and soft.</li>
      <li>Comes in very handy in the dry cold winters.</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and need a lasting body lotion.  </li>
      <li>I have such extremely dry, sensitive, allergic skin that it cracks, bleeds and scabs over from just about everything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine product but no better than store bought brands, so not worth</li>

    <li> I have ordered the Parrs Lanolin Body Lotion for a couple of years after I purchased some in New Zealand.  My whole family likes it so I replenish theirs at Christmas.  Koru Naturals supplies it and they are wonderfully fast.  I think I received my last order in two days.</li>
    <li> I really like how quickly the lotion absorbs and how it feels.  Smells good and is a very nice lotion.</li>

    <li> This lotion goes on silky smooth, not greasy at all.  Soaks in almost immediately.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Overly scented with a honeysuckle like fragrance. Made me sick until I got it washed off. However, it arrived in a favorable timely order and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> My order arrived before I even started looking for it. It is a very rich lotion which absorbs quickly, feels good on dry skin, and keeps skin feeling soft for hours. Thank you for your great product!</li>
    <li> I luv this lotion and the smell is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Here is the ingredients list for anyone who might be interested...&lt;br /&gt;Water, behentrimonium methosulfate and cetearyl alcohol, dicaprylyl carbonate, lanolin, aloe Vera, vitamin e (tocopheryl acetate), vitamin c(ascorbyl palmitate),  hydrogenated palm glycerides citrate, perfume, phenoxy-ethanol, potassium sorbate, linalool, d-limonne</li>

No one can believe how soft and truly moisturized their skin actually feels. And it really is moisturized, not just made to look like it as the awful petroleum-based products do and even a lot of the natural things do. How can I tell? Within a couple day&#x27;s time my cracked, bleeding skin is actually healed and soft. Healed. Scabs are gone, deep cracks are gone and my skin no longer looks I got into a fight with a truck load of cheese graters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this lotion everywhere, including my face. I wanted to try the Wild Ferns facial moisturizer, but it has a nut oil in it that I am extremely allergic to.

    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to use a lotion with lanolin in it. I was so excited when I came across this product. No more dry skin! This lotion is wonderful!! Im hooked!</li>
    <li> Smells good and it&#x27;s really hard to find lanolin.  Seems if anyone is allergic no one gets any.  The reason for a star deduction is the price, which is probably fair since it&#x27;s hard to find.  I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly mother who has dry skin, especially in the winter.  It has worked very well,it&#x27;s not too thick or oily, and it has a light, pleasant fragrance.  I use it with the anhydrous pharmaceutical grade lanolin for her feet and elbows, also from Koru Naturals. I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate and need a lasting body lotion.  I have found that lanolin seems to do the best job, but I don&#x27;t want a lot of additional chemicals.  This product is gently scented, lasts for more than a day, and absorbs quickly. Minimal nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering this product.  It certainly won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
    <li> I do not like to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; a lotion on my hands after I rub it in as it leaves a heavy sensation on my skin.  This lotion soaks into my skin  quickly and just leaves a soft silky feeling with no heaviness.  It is really great.</li>
    <li> I only just started using this lotion but can already see the difference in my skin. So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> This product worked to soften a rabbit skin hat with stiffened leather.  The hat is now wearable.  Plus my hands are softer!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Bought some when I was in Australia and New Zealand and it&#x27;s nice to know I can by more when I run out. Comes in very handy in the dry cold winters.</li>
    <li> I love this product because is is so delicate.  It is not greasy at all and the delicate rose scent is not overpowering. It goes a long way a small squirt is ample to moisturize my hands. forget the big name brands on tv this is the moisturizer  for me.</li>
    <li> This lotion is lovely. I was never good about moisturizing yet I had good skin... until I hit 55 or so when my skin suddenly dried out and I started to become prune-y. Yow!  So I started trying to moisturize but hated feeling greasy, disliked the flowery or medicine-y smell and how long it took to be absorbed so I rarely used lotion of any kind. I recently bought this lotion and found it met all my requirements. It absorbs quickly, has a very light pleasant scent that disappears after a few seconds and has made a noticeable difference in my skin in only a few days. My skin is softer and has a nice, soft sheen (right word?) to it. I think I will try some other products from this company soon.</li>
    <li> I would call this an ok lotion. Absorbs well with no greasy finish;however, it does not seem to have any lasting properties. I may buy again with lower expectations.</li>
