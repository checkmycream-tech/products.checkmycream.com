<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with this product. As a natural tangles are my worst enemy. This product actually made me feel as if it had melted the tangles away and the smell is heavenly. Most definatly a staple as far as i&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this product from my beautician. I found it on Amazon for $2 cheaper and thought it was a good buy at first. When I received the product I was disappointed.  The quality of this product was NOT the same.  It appeared to be watered down or mixed with another conditioner. I will not be purchasing this product from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, dry, easily damaged hair. I have tried, at least, a dozen salon, high quality conditioners on my hair and while the effects they have on my hair immediately after a condition are good, the effects always wear off usually by the end of the day. Not so with Salerm&#x27;s Wheat Germ Conditioning Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first read about Salerm on a hair care forum that I frequent and I thought what the heck I might as well give it a try because I have tried everything. I purchased this small jar of the conditioning treatment because I didn&#x27;t want to buy a large quantity in case the effects of the conditioning treatment weren&#x27;t as I had read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes beyond my expectations for a conditioner. It has literally transformed my hair. What once was dry, brittle, and damaged has been transformed into strong, soft tresses. I have been using Salerm for about a month now and although, the effects where evident immediately, the more I use, the better my hair becomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair and I got about 5-6 applications out of this small jar and I use this treatment about once a week. I usually leave it in my hair for about 15-20 minutes and the only complaint I really have is the strong smell of the treatment. Although, it is not a bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have to give it five stars because it is the best treatment I have ever come across!</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner after reading the glowing recommendations it received from users. Depending on your sensitivity to scent, the scent may be a little strong but after using this conditioner every week, once a week for the past 4 weeks, I have to say, it is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve used to date. So much so, it even softened my very tough new growth. My hair felt softer after I washed it out and had body and swing.    I have relaxed black hair which I colour every so often. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper on amazon.com---cheapest I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
    <li> This product was one of the best dominican products I&#x27;ve used. After putting this on my hair I got under the dryer for about 10 mins and did rollers. When i took the rollers out of my hair, my hair was like it has never been before. My hair was shiny and silky and my ends looked as if I had just gotten them cut...but i didn&#x27;t. I actually needed to get them cut. However, after using the treatment, I prolonged my trim. I absolutely love this product!!!!! I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for damaged hair.  It penetrates quickly and rinses clean with no residue.  I left it on for half an hour for extra conditioning and my hair was silky and soft, without feeling limp and heavy.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing it makes your hair soft and very manageable this is the best hair conditioner in the world</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim. The smell took a bit of getting used to. Think Aveda type smell, earthy....My hair felt drastically different after only one application. Soft, no tangles and I am looking forward to seeing this product work long term. 5 stars def. I have used Kerastase and at $75 a jar this is a welcome change.</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased a larger jar, but thats not a problem because I love this stuff and will be buying again. This really strengthened my relaxed and color treated hair and left it smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I am originally from NY and have gone to Rosalina&#x27;s Salon since I was 15! I loved the Salerm deep conditioner and recently have attempted to purchase it and have not been able to. It is wonderful for african american hair and leaves it smelling wonderful even days after shampooing. I am now located in NC and unable to find any Dominican salon&#x27;s so I treasure being able to use the products at home. I was amazed to find amazon had them after looking so long. My next venture is to try the salerm perm. I also want to point out this one container lasts easily a year or more since you only need to use a small amount once a month. Use a shower cap and wrap with a warm towel for 10 minutes or go under the dryer for 10 and it is fab!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Hair loves this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes hair soft</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair mask based on the amazing customer reviews. I could not have made a better choice! I used this mask for the first time this morning and as soon as I applied it into my crazy thick mane I could feel the silkiness taking over. My hair literally feels like spun silk, it is well worth the price and arrived way ahead of time. I will definitely repurchase again, I plan to use this mask at least once a week.</li>
    <li> Ah, another undiscovered Dominican hair product that is a life savor for coarse curls or damaged hair!!!! (OK, may not actually be Dominican but is a big seller in Dominican salons nonetheless). Like Baba de Caracol and Lacio Lacio, this stuff has transformed my tresses- and trust me, I have spent tons of $$$ on fancy salon products that do not work a quarter as well as this does! It is excellent with or without heat, deeply conditions and repairs, gives tons of slip and some major high shine to the most damaged or dry hair types.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product while visiting a hair forum and wanted to try it.  I am so glad I did.  This product is excellent.  My hair has been subject to all kinds of abuse from blow drying, coloring  and flat ironing.  After using this product just one time, my hair felt so much better.  It felt very moisturized and healthier.  My only complaint is that because my hair is pretty long, I used up almost half the jar with just one use, so using this product can get pretty pricey.  Also, this conditioner has a very strong scent, so if you do not like perfumed scented products, you may not like this.</li>
    <li> For dry, damaged and texturized hair i even use it with my daughter&#x27;s curly hair after the shampoo, apply it and put a cap and then heat it for 10 mins, her hair will shine and will look healthier on first use.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes your hair feel fresh bouncy and light!!! The fresh scent lingers for days! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have naturally very dry curly hair which I get profesionally straighten (brazilian blowout) twice a year, and this product keeps my hair from feeling too dry. A regular conditioner is not enough to tame my dry unruly hair so using the Salerm wheat treatment after rinsing the conditioner gives me the softness and manageability I need. Just make sure you leave it on at least 4 to 5 minutes, if you can spare the time and leave it 15 minutes it works even better, and once you style your hair it will leave it feeling smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> These were products I never got from back I&#x27;m 2012.  I submitted a claim and never got anything on it.</li>
    <li> This was just ok...not any better than my Biolage smoothing conditioner. In fact, I used Biolage before I applied the wheat germ treatment. So, not even sure it worked at all. My biggest issue is the smell. If you suffer from headache/migrane, please keep off this product because it will trigger it!</li>
    <li> Out of  all the products I have purchased and used in the past this is awesome&lt;br /&gt;  Leave your hair silky and soft thank you for making a great product :-)</li>
    <li> It definitely doesnt look appealing or something that you would want to put in your hair, but it actually softens my hair &amp; makes it more manageable for longer period of time.  I recommend! Plus it was delivered a lot faster than expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African-American with thick hair. I do process by perming, and temporoary coloring.&lt;br /&gt;Salerm conditioner keeps it soft. Doesn&#x27;t help too much with moisture,&lt;br /&gt;but I loved it.</li>
    <li> I Love it, it is the best for damage hair!</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, dry hair and from the very first use of Salerm, it softened my hair considerably.</li>
    <li> I just used this product yesterday and this is the BEST conditioner I have ever used. After shampooing I placed it in my hair for 30 minutes under a shower cap. When it was time to rinse my hair felt amazingly soft. When I blew it out it was even better. I am African American and was suffering from damage from my blond hair( which I grew out). It left my ends brittle and dry. This made my hair smooth and I dont feel it breaking when I run my fingers through my hair.I am going to use this once a week along with other Selerm products after I do a big cut on my ends to bring my hair back to glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is weird. I still smell it a little now but its worth it</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used, please don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> smells great and really moistens your hair. I have been using Salerm products for years and it really offers you moisture plus stregth to your strands.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely a 5 out of 5.  The only reason I did not rate it as such is because the shipping cost is ridiculous.  However, I did my research beforehand, and was unable to find a better deal online and stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, friend bought me this product a few years back and it worked a miracle on my hair. No other hair conditioner product has ever been able to adequately hydrate my fine curly hair as does this [not even a shampoo and conditioner I recently spent $40 each on].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely glad I found this product again.  It looks kind of gross and murky, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it&#x27;s the best hair conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Extremely great product.  WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It helps my curly course hair! If anyone lives near winnetka, Ca. Cuts Etc. sells this product. Ask for Eugenia.&lt;br /&gt;20137 Saticoy St&lt;br /&gt;Winnetka, CA&lt;br /&gt;(818) 701-0217</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter who has damage hair. We love this mask. Keeps hair silky soft. This hasn&#x27;t been the first time I used this product, but it is the first time buying it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was not conditioning. Smelled funny. I also was disappointed with the results. It is definitely not leaving my hair smooth or healthy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a heavy formula that stinks really bad. After leaving it in for the recommended time my hair shown no improvement.</li>
    <li> The product work as described I do like it&lt;br /&gt;Better than similar products I had my for several days now, working good&lt;br /&gt;Product exceeds my expectations</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past. I am unsure if the formula has changed or not, yet I do know it works!</li>
    <li> After carefully reading about the different Dominican Hair products, I purchased the Wheat Germ Conditioner and Silk Leave in Conditioner by Salerm. Wonderful, wonderful products. My hair is short (think Halle Berry) because I workout and run a lot. My hair is permed and color treated. (Sebastian Colourshines demi color)  After working out, I rinse, partially dry and apply the Salerm 21 Silk Leave-in Condtitioner and dry under a cool hooded dryer for about 10 minutes. Shampoo about once weekly.  My hair is soft and well conditioned every time. I used the Wheat Germ products this weekend after shampooing. I am still touching my hair because it is so soft. Great products.</li>
    <li> If you have damaged hair this is for you . It just gives you everything you need. Softness, elasticity, shine ,etc ! Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I actually use this along with the Carol&#x27;s daughter black vanilla shampoo an conditioning products...My damaged hair is soft, shiny and bouncy even when I desperately need my ends trimmed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any great difference in my hair using this product. It seems just seems kind of norma/regular. Nothing special, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Really like it. Does what it says it will. I think it works best if you leave it on for longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I always had very thick and resilient hair (been relaxing it every 6-8 weeks). I recently started experimenting with color (dyed it dark, dyed it darker, used Color Oops, tried to lighten it, and dyed it a few more times. Then, for good measure, I tried to bleach some high lights in my own hair) and ended up applying a relaxer on top of very damaged hair. I was combing out chunks of hair and it was scary to just wash my hair. I used aphogee two step protein treatment and baby face keratin treatment and tried to be as gentle as possible. My hair was still coming out. Using this product is the only thing that salvaged my hair. After my first use, I had significantly less breakage. I could run my fingers through my hair without having gross amounts of hair coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, one use made my hair silky soft and allowed me to comb my damp hair without clumps of it coming out.&lt;br /&gt;Miracle product and I will only be using this deep conditioner from now on.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great!  I am a product junkie, so I have tried many products. This has to be the best deep conditioner.  My hair usually feels dry after I blow dry and flat iron, but this stuff kept it really soft and moisterized.  It looks a little wierd, but don&#x27;t let that deter you.  TRY IT!!</li>
    <li> This is great for dry hair. I used it after overprocessing a relaxer. The smell is divine. It makes hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews.  It didnt work at all for me.  It left my hair smelling great...but that is all! I washed my hair, applied the product and sat under my conditioner cap for 20 mins.  After processing my hair was hard, dry and tangled.  I am stretching my relaxer and it did nothing to soften my hair.  Had to re-wash after I&#x27;d already set it and sat under the dryer.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll try again.&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE_____ I continued to use the product, only now i mix it with a argan oil mask and it seems to work better.  I do belive it has a compounding effect on my hair...meaning each time i use it, i get better results.  I am purchasing the large tub to see if continued use will get my desired results.</li>
    <li> After much research and reading the reviews, I discovered a great product and am very pleased with the results.  Since I&#x27;m on a budget and can not afford to go to a salon (only for trims) I have to shampoo and style my own hair.  Also my hair is natural (for 2 years now) and I work out 3-4 x weekly (running and hot yoga).  So when looking for a product that works, the Salerm is a definite keeper.  I&#x27;m able to continue to wear my hair straight after workouts and I know it is the results of this product.      I would agree with the other readers about the smell however I do have strong confidence that it works because I continue to smell the conditioner in my hair days after conditioning it.  Another positive about the product is that you can really feel the difference in your hair immediately following the rinse.  My hair feels soft and light (and trust me I have very course hair-4A type).  After I dry my hair, I have so much body and natural shine.  Until the next time I have to shampoo, there is very little maintence or other products needed in my hair too.    Important to note that I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a 1.5 month however only recently I started using it weekly.  Initially I started out once month conditioning with it and now I&#x27;m using it weekly.   I must admit that I&#x27;m still experiencing hair shedding but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping with breakage therefore I need to use it more that once a month or I need to reduce the amount of heat.  This is the reason why I&#x27;m now using it weekly and hoping to see a reduction with shedding.    Overall very good product.  This is a case where you can feel very good about purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I definitely am satisfied with this product.  I will  be ordering this again in the near future.  I enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser stopped carrying it, but I found it here for less! I&#x27;m glad I found it because it changed my life. :)</li>
    <li> Ordered this product based on the rave reviews and was pleasantly surprised to the truth behind them. This product made my damaged hair silky and I didn&#x27;t think that was possible.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  great price and it works wonders:) I&#x27;m really happy that I purchased this product.  Buy it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Excellent and Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> love the product love the smell dominican hair products r the best!!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product because I love the way it makes my hair feel and look.  I love the entire line for Salerm but I especially like the Mask.  Great product if you want to deep condition your hair without that greesy look and feel.</li>
    <li> only by the liter size  now.  I tried this size to rwst. makes my hair feel like butter. only buy the big one now. best deep conditioner hands down</li>
    <li> good product, quick shipping</li>
    <li> I always use this product every time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It&#x27;s perfect for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 17 year old who has dyed her hair every color imaginable and has basically destroyed her once brilliantly shiny brown hair. I have bought numerous, numerous products! I read the reviews on this product and figured I would give it a try... She has used it and it has managed to tame the frizz a bit. I use it too and love it... Shhh! It says it can be heat activated, but c&#x27;mon who has a full put your head in dryer at home? So she just leaves the conditioner in her hair, puts a shower cap on and forgets about it, then rinses it out. So far no problems... If nothing changes... I&#x27;ll post another review.</li>
    <li> My hair was softer than it has been in a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I alway used it because my hair is very dry and this is excellent for dry hair.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that they came out too expensive because they where deliver separated and I was charge for each delivery.  I won&#x27;t purchased them again online.</li>
    <li> From the very first time I deep conditioned my hair with this, I felt a huge difference, and it gets better with every wash. Once my hair dries, it is soooo soft and elastic, not brittle and dull. It is  expensive, but a little goes a long way. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Left my hair shiny and beautiful. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but it is a bit expensive, will buy again though.</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner for natural hair. Love the scent too.</li>
    <li> Like the product and order arrived sooner than what I expected</li>
    <li> Excellent, is the best.</li>
    <li> it doesnt take a lot if your hair is thin thin please add a little conditioner. it strengthens your hair especially if you use a lot of heat on your hair</li>
    <li> This conditioner is an absolute miracle worker.  It will take hair in its absolute worst condition and transform it to moist, soft, shiny and swinging every single time.  I am so addicted to this conditioner that I use it for co-washing, baggying and deep conditioning.  I will say it works best with the most stellar results the longer you leave it on.  When I baggy my ends with this and rinse it out in the a.m., I have the hair of a lifetime.  When I apply this to DRY hair with a conditioner cap and allow it to soak in for hours then rinse, my hair is absolutely unbelievable.  As a co-wash, it helps maintain the results you get from those deep conditioning methods.  ONE CAVEAT:  The smell is absolutely overwhelming.  While I have gotten used to it, I know that it is trailing behind me everywhere I go so I am going to test out another wheat germ conditioner as a co-wash and reserve this for once-a-week treatments.  If Salerm would change, remove or lessen the fragrance they would have the holy grail conditioner.  Oh well, you can&#x27;t have everything!</li>
    <li> Salerm Wheat Germ is actually a good deep conditioner. I was doubtful because my sister had tried it and wasn&#x27;t too impressed, but it actually leaves yor hair very shiny and soft. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too happy with is the smell. It smells kind of like grass or herbs. I will be buying it again and pehaps trying out more of their products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent enough money on hair products over the years to buy a new car.  Most products were either disappointing and didn&#x27;t measure up to positive customer reviews, or way too expensive for mere mortals to afford.  This product is different.  I was very skeptical before using it, but I&#x27;m truly amazed at the results. I wet my hair with warm water and patted it with a towel.  Then I applied about 2 tablespoons to my hair - starting about an inch from my scalp.  (My hair is very long and baby-fine.)  Then I covered it with a shower cap and wrapped a hot towel around the cap.  Let it sit for a couple of hours while I went about my chores and washed it out when I took a shower.  I didn&#x27;t use shampoo.  I was stunned at how conditioned and healthy my hair was.  It&#x27;s so nice to finally find a hair care product that works as advertised and as promoted by other customers.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It works great for your hair!! Plus I got it really cheap cuz other places wanted twice the price I got here!! As long as you use it the right way it works!!</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel silky &amp; supper soft! My hair looked fuller. I received sooo many compliments. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner.  It is good for someone who wants to improve the health of their hair.</li>
