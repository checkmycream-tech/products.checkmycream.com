      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I fell in love with Swedish Beauty products because of this bronzer.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>and i really enjoy it!</li>
      <li>you love me\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love...</li>
      <li>Most tanning lotions are loaded with preservatives.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love the price, too.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I was able to find &amp; at such a great price!!</li>
      <li>Love the smell, cheaper than salon.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smelll.</li>
      <li>I would love to buy more and would reccomend it to a friend.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this lotion.</li>
      <li>Its very rich creamy</li>
      <li>and it goes on nice and rich- not</li>
      <li>I already have a pretty good tan and this one is helping maintain that darkness-</li>
      <li>This is an older Swedish Beauty product but my all-time favorite!!</li>
      <li>Mild smell and nice bronzing results.</li>
      <li>I received it very quickly and i love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the consistency and texture of this lotion since my skin dries out easily.</li>
      <li>(my favorite so far) Very nice consistency.</li>
      <li>Besides the smell, this lotion is great for sensitive skin and my skin absorbs the moisture almost immediately</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s where they make their money, charging full price)!    </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve achieved such a beautiful tan from this bronzer.</li>
      <li>this is hands down the best smelling lotion ever...</li>
      <li>So nothing goes live unless u say something good about the product</li>
      <li>I love this product - 95% all natural and great for my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>and after your shower your color is rich and bronzy- not orange.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, the scent is heavenly, it&#x27;s not fruity at all, more of a rich floral scent, like a really nice perfume or cologne.  </li>
      <li>I also REALLY love the trend towards more natural products and this is SB&#x27;s first lotion without parabens and 95% natural ingredients, which makes me feel really good about using it.  </li>
      <li>so the thick coat is perfect to keep it moisturized.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; only tan</li>
      <li>This product has a lovely scent and moisturizes very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions- mostly ones from Australian Gold, which have been my favorite, this is my first Swedish Beauty lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t really break any plateau or make me a whole lot darker, but the color was nice and rich</li>
      <li>I think it adequately hydrates and protects my skin when I tan and doesn&#x27;t have any funky side effects (like lines where you might have missed a spot).</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel moisturized, but not greasy, and the quick delivery bronzers turn you brown, not orange.  </li>
      <li>I know I would use the bottle up quick and at $55 dollars</li>
      <li>Color is very natural and LOVE the smell.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m something of an indoor tanning connoisseur having tanned since I was 15, and I have to say that Take Olive me is my favorite tanning lotion by far.  </li>
      <li>Really happy to get it for half the price on Amazon versus the $55 they got from me at the tanning salon on bottle #1!</li>
      <li>First of all, it is thicker than the lotions I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>I even experimented with applying it to my arms and stomach in the car during my drive there to give it longer to absorb and I believe it did help, so it is possible that if you apply it in the morning it might work even better.    </li>
      <li>I thought at first when I put it on it</li>
      <li>While it gave GREAT color, it was too thick</li>
      <li>I actually prefer the color I get on my face better using \\&quot;shea</li>
      <li>and it moisturizes really well!</li>
      <li>The corner of the seam broke open on the top of my lotion a couple weeks after I got it.  </li>
      <li>It gives a pleasantly natural color, is relatively moisturizing, and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite scent in a tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, I would wear this as a normal body lotion daily if it weren&#x27;t so pricey!!</li>
      <li>I was nervous to try out a  bronzer because I have such fair, dry skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and glides on well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I found it for sale for 25 bucks...</li>
    <li> This lotion is AMAZING!!  It smells incredible and works very well.  Many indoor tanning lotions I have tried smell funky, but this one smells great!  It helped create the best tan I have ever had and was well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is thick and creamy and keeps your skin moisturized without a heavy fragrance.  It has also given me a great golden tan.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This lotion has an odd smell to it, which is gone after you tan, but it bothers me a bit while I apply the lotion.  It is rather thick, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very well.  I have never sweat off a lotion so badly in the tanning bed before.  But for all of its flaws, it gives some pretty good color and feels great on your skin after tanning.  It makes your skin feel moisturized, but not greasy, and the quick delivery bronzers turn you brown, not orange.  Also, it&#x27;s eco-friendly, which counts for something I suppose.  I even experimented with applying it to my arms and stomach in the car during my drive there to give it longer to absorb and I believe it did help, so it is possible that if you apply it in the morning it might work even better.    UPDATE!  The corner of the seam broke open on the top of my lotion a couple weeks after I got it.  It barely comes out now and I had to start leaving it in my car so it won&#x27;t get on my stuff.  My color has not improved on a steady basis, I usually just look dark the night that I go tanning and can&#x27;t keep the tan.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I cant wait till my order comes in.I bought one of those sample packets at my tanning salon and I fell in love... this is hands down the best smelling lotion ever... it also leaves no wierd after smell and it gave me great color and trust me im not talking about that ugly orange color &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  It smells OK and it leaves my skin feeling really nice.  My only problem with the lotion is that I don&#x27;t feel like I get much extra color from the bronzer it contains.</li>
    <li> I tried a packet of this and didn&#x27;t end up purchasing the bottle.  While it gave GREAT color, it was too thick I felt--I used the entire packet in one tanning session. I know I would use the bottle up quick and at $55 dollars that was too much (don&#x27;t buy lotions in the salon-that&#x27;s where they make their money, charging full price)!    Way too thick for me!    The smell wasn&#x27;t bad, not too strong.  I thought at first when I put it on it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing, but when I took a shower later I could tell that it was still on my skin.     Overall if you don&#x27;t mind a thick lotion, it does give great color.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell and a great lotion in my opinion, and a great value buying off amazon compared to tanning salons!</li>
    <li> I used a packet of this lotion at the tanning salon and loved it. The downside being the packet cost me $7.50 and they charge $59 for an 8.5oz bottle so I bought here instead for about half with shipping factored in. I absolutely love the consistency and texture of this lotion since my skin dries out easily. The smell is light and pleasant, not perfume-y or too pronounced. I never notice a slick or sticky feeling as with some other more popular lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; only tan maybe once a week during the summer. I&#x27;ve gone about 6 times now &amp; am really tan. It smells nice. When I&#x27;m done tanning I always wipe off the excess &amp; my skin isn&#x27;t greasy or stinky the rest of the day. I don&#x27;t have to rush home to shower! I get great results &amp; feel this is a high quality lotion!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion. The coloring you get from this lotion is great. It is a thicker lotion but I prefer that. My skin drys really fast when I am tanning so the thick coat is perfect to keep it moisturized. It smells so amazing. After I finish tanning, I smell my arms at least 100 times before I shower. I just LOVE the smell! I would recommend this lotion!!</li>
    <li> 2010 Swedish Beauty Take Olive Me is a great lotion.  It smells great,its not greasy and it gives me instant color in the tanning bed or in the sun!! It keeps my skin mosturized all day.  I always order more!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this bronzer!  I love the price, too.  This same product in my tanning salon was over 3 times what I paid for it on Amazon.  Great deal!  Also, previously, I&#x27;d been using another lotion with bronzers in it that would smell &#x27;different&#x27; after tanning and after having had it on my skin for a while.  This lotion smells AMAZING and does NOT have that odd &#x27;burnt&#x27; smell I&#x27;ve smelled in several other lotions with bronzers in them.  Before I purchased this lotion, one reviewer claimed it was too thick for their taste.  I&#x27;d like to add that I have moderately dry skin and as much as I loath greasy lotions, I have to use lotion daily (tanning or not); having that said, I&#x27;ve not experienced the Olive Me Bronzer to be too thick OR greasy.  It smooths right on, smells amazing and does a great job assisting me with my indoor tanning experience.  And, for those who like to dabble in tingle lotion, their Hot Green Tease rocks, too!</li>
    <li> I love this product - 95% all natural and great for my sensitive skin! I pair this with the \\&quot;Aloe There\\&quot; after tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> This product has a lovely scent and moisturizes very well.  It&#x27;s great to use if you have errands to run after tanning because it smells so good.</li>
    <li> This smells so good!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, cheaper than salon.</li>
    <li> This is fairly thick, so using more is sometimes necessary. Mild smell and nice bronzing results. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted! User was great and even had it wrapped in packaging! I was very impressed and would use this person again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell as it&#x27;s being applied but after tanning it smells great, a nice light fresh fragrance.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and glides on well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions- mostly ones from Australian Gold, which have been my favorite, this is my first Swedish Beauty lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  This one I am really loving.  First of all, it is thicker than the lotions I&#x27;ve used and it goes on nice and rich- not greasy- and it moisturizes really well! The moisture really lasts, especially if you don&#x27;t shower right away.  Also, since it has a bronzer- you don&#x27;t want to wash it off right away, but give it at least a few hours to work or you will just wash all that color down the drain.  I try to wait overnight and after your shower your color is rich and bronzy- not orange.  I already have a pretty good tan and this one is helping maintain that darkness- it didn&#x27;t really break any plateau or make me a whole lot darker, but the color was nice and rich, it looks very natural. I also REALLY love the trend towards more natural products and this is SB&#x27;s first lotion without parabens and 95% natural ingredients, which makes me feel really good about using it.  Most tanning lotions are loaded with preservatives.  Lastly, the scent is heavenly, it&#x27;s not fruity at all, more of a rich floral scent, like a really nice perfume or cologne.  It&#x27;s my favorite scent in a tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, I would wear this as a normal body lotion daily if it weren&#x27;t so pricey!!</li>
    <li> Great product thank you so much! I received it very quickly and i love this lotion. Its very rich creamy and i really enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It gives a pleasantly natural color, is relatively moisturizing, and smells amazing. It is a bit think but goes on pretty soft. Amazon offering this for $20 is a great price, it was $70 at my salon!</li>
    <li> Love it! I was darker than when I used the other lotions the salon pushed, it is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Gives me a good color, but it makes me stink after I go tanning lol. I prefer the smell of my other lotion.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Product works great for me as a beginning tanner with fair skin. Color is very natural and LOVE the smell. Really happy to get it for half the price on Amazon versus the $55 they got from me at the tanning salon on bottle #1!</li>
    <li> This is good for people that just want something a little extra on their skin when they tan.  It doesn&#x27;t make you tan extra like some other tanning lotions; however, it also doesn&#x27;t make you turn orange.  It smells a little weird to me after the tan, but goes away after a shower - the smell is not overwhelming regardless.  I like it.  I think it adequately hydrates and protects my skin when I tan and doesn&#x27;t have any funky side effects (like lines where you might have missed a spot).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m something of an indoor tanning connoisseur having tanned since I was 15, and I have to say that Take Olive me is my favorite tanning lotion by far.  I&#x27;ve used lotions from $20 to over $100 (yikes, I know) and this puts them all to shame.  It gives amazing color, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, and the smell is really pleasant.  The tube lasts quite a while even with my heavy application hand.  This is a must buy if you&#x27;re a tanner!</li>
    <li> If you are a person who loves lotions that smell good, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. The smell is VERY light, but is also nice if you don&#x27;t want that \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; smell. Besides the smell, this lotion is great for sensitive skin and my skin absorbs the moisture almost immediately so I don&#x27;t enter/exit the tanning bed feeling gross or greasy. Great lotion for beginners as well.</li>
    <li> So nothing goes live unless u say something good about the product</li>
    <li> I love the smell. And it makes your skin so soft. I actually prefer the color I get on my face better using \\&quot;shea you love me\\&quot;. But I will use this on my body. All their product&#x27;s are Excellent. And I am allergic to EVERYTHING!!!!!! I have no issue&#x27;s with the Botanica  Product&#x27;s no allergic reaction at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! It smells wonderful and gave me a golden tan!!! I would love to buy more and would reccomend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be skeptical every time when buying salon tanning lotion online. This is an older Swedish Beauty product but my all-time favorite!! I am so glad I was able to find &amp; at such a great price!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Sexy!  I love it and it is on par with other brands that are high end like Designer. No more no less</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Swedish Beauty products because of this bronzer. I was nervous to try out a  bronzer because I have such fair, dry skin. I thought it would leave me streaky or strangely orange. This product didn&#x27;t do any of that. I absolutely love the smelll. It&#x27;s such a fresh, clean scent. (my favorite so far) Very nice consistency. Easy to apply. I&#x27;ve never had streaking from it. I&#x27;ve achieved such a beautiful tan from this bronzer. My skin has never felt so moisturized. I highly recommend this product and I will be purchasing it again. (After I&#x27;ve tried all the other bronzers Swedish Beauty has to offer. I&#x27;m addicted.  :)</li>
