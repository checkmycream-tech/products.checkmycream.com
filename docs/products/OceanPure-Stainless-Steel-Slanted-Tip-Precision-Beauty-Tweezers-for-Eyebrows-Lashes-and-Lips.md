      <li>Great, just what I was looking for, basic tweezers like i would buy at the store.</li>
      <li>but it still works the same I think these work great no problems at all.</li>
      <li>these rock, I know they are just tweezers but what a set, precise control.</li>
      <li>one is wanting/needing better, my recommendation would be to step right up and purchase a \\&quot;Rubis Slanted Tip Tweezer,\\&quot; which we have also purchased and there, I expect one will find tweezer bliss.  </li>
      <li>Great pair of tweezers for the price, I didn&#x27;t have them long</li>
      <li>Originally I gave the tweezers three stars and considering the price of the tweezers, compared to the price of gas</li>
      <li>I would buy them again (even if they didn&#x27;t look so cool).</li>
      <li>Not to mention they come in a stylish black that looks good in my hands while tweezing on the go.</li>
      <li>Received fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These tweezers have a nice sharp point, tight tolerances, and are great for grabbing those more tenacious hairs.</li>
      <li>Have had a tough time removing my many splinters but this tweezer is great at grabbing those pesky tweezers.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;re not talking top-of-the-line fantastic tweezers, but they do the job very well.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re not talking top-of-the-line fantastic tweezers, but they do the job very well.</li>
      <li>Debated getting the well-known name brand tweezer (T-man) over this one, but it was worth a chance for the price.</li>
      <li>I just wanted some tweezers, and when these arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find they look sleek and sexy.</li>
      <li>They had a defect in the graspers that caused hair to slip right through.</li>
      <li>and they look great in black matte with a stainless steel tip.</li>
      <li>Works great and the manly black color is appreciated.</li>
      <li>I recommend them if you are looking for good tweezers that are black.</li>
      <li>They arrived with a small cloth pouch and will make a great addition to my first aid kit.</li>
      <li>Good little set</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find an exact replacement, so I decided to try these.  </li>
      <li>Overall satisfied with this purchase</li>
      <li>This product works great for keeping those suckers in line.</li>
      <li>they seem high quality, they look very nice and seem to be heavy duty.</li>
      <li>first visual inspection, this is an excellent, well made product but in the short, this tweezer has trouble handling fine hairs.  </li>
      <li>But if expecting these tweezers to regularly handle fine hairs, that&#x27;s where one may find disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very well made.  </li>
      <li>They were cheap - in fact, cheaper than we found them at the local store.</li>
      <li>very well protected during shipping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know about the quality of the stainless steel.</li>
      <li>The inner surface is relatively smooth which makes gripping a hair difficult and many times the hair just slips from the grip.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a well made product.</li>
      <li>Get these especially for the price they work the same as 10 or 20 dollar ones:)</li>
      <li>The price was decent too.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be of high quality.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Pretty good quality, though the black paint was a little off.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These tweezers are budget minded tweezers (with qualifying purchases, Prime delivery included) that will easily handle normal course hair issues but one can and will find these tweezers have the potential to fail when asked to consistently handle fine hair issues.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be well made and should hold up better than ones I have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>I have to keep buying new tweezers because I an old man</li>
      <li>The tweezers came in a neat little travel pouch (that I will probably use in the future).&lt;br /&gt;The picture is accurate and the description of the product was correct.</li>
      <li>fast action on the hair picking and don&#x27;t have to remove hairs to get the next bite.</li>
      <li>once I did I found that these tweezers work just as well as my old ones.</li>
      <li>Blows the old ones out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m really in a hurry it can also pluck multiple follicles at once!</li>
      <li>I should have spend an extra few bucks to buy a better pair.</li>
      <li>Tips are sharp and overall look and feel is precise and professional.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re slightly more expensive than this but works and lasts much longer.</li>
      <li>It actually arrived to my house early--</li>
      <li>If you have ingrowns that just barely break the surface of the skin don&#x27;t get these.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have ingrowns that just barely break the surface of the skin don&#x27;t get these.  They work well on all other hairs.  I was looking for tweezers that were big enough for man hands, but sharp enough to get those pesky hairs that keep diving back into my skin on my neck, alas these are not the tweezers you were looking for.</li>
    <li> Have bought so many and none can get the fine hairs until I bought these! So happy and they look great in black matte with a stainless steel tip.</li>
    <li> The tweezers came in a neat little travel pouch (that I will probably use in the future).&lt;br /&gt;The picture is accurate and the description of the product was correct. It actually arrived to my house early--so great shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Work well and good size</li>
    <li> These work perfectly for my purpose, making metal models. The tip doesn&#x27;t seem to deform from gripping the steel, and it grips well, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> good pluckin&#x27; deal.....they work like a charm.</li>
    <li> Pretty good pair of tweezers. Nice finish, sharp little buggers, and they come with a little pouch. Good little set</li>
    <li> these rock, I know they are just tweezers but what a set, precise control. better looking than picture.  fast action on the hair picking and don&#x27;t have to remove hairs to get the next bite.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of these tweezers. They arrived with a small cloth pouch and will make a great addition to my first aid kit. For the price you will be satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> i bought these tweezers for making coils for vaping. they seem high quality, they look very nice and seem to be heavy duty. came in a very nice OceanPure velvet bag inside a plastic covering. very well protected during shipping.&lt;br /&gt; if helpful rate it.</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers for the price, I didn&#x27;t have them long so I don&#x27;t know about the quality of the stainless steel. I gave them to a coworker who has helped me remove splinters, they seem sharp and decently built.</li>
    <li> I have to keep buying new tweezers because I an old man and I keep dropping them blunting the tips. I hope I&#x27;ll be able to hold onto these for a while.</li>
    <li> This product has great reach and grip to get out any hairs or anything that needs to be taken out.</li>
    <li> Out of the box they did not work. They had a defect in the graspers that caused hair to slip right through. Trashed them within minutes.</li>
    <li> I purchased these tweezers to carry in my bicycle saddle bag - to pluck out thorns or metal debris that get caught in my tires and cause flats.  These have saved me numerous times - and they come in a protective carrying pouch.</li>
    <li> Did not do the job it was hired to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first visual inspection, this is an excellent, well made product but in the short, this tweezer has trouble handling fine hairs.  If all one is using the tweezer for is to handle course hair, this tweezer will work just fine.  But if expecting these tweezers to regularly handle fine hairs, that&#x27;s where one may find disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one is wanting/needing better, my recommendation would be to step right up and purchase a \\&quot;Rubis Slanted Tip Tweezer,\\&quot; which we have also purchased and there, I expect one will find tweezer bliss.  But as expected, the Rubis tweezers are a whole lot more expensive.  Money well spent?  That&#x27;s up to the user to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers are budget minded tweezers (with qualifying purchases, Prime delivery included) that will easily handle normal course hair issues but one can and will find these tweezers have the potential to fail when asked to consistently handle fine hair issues.  Your mileage may vary on this point but one should be aware that in the case of fine hair, fail is a possible outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the star rating system; four stars were given.  Originally I gave the tweezers three stars and considering the price of the tweezers, compared to the price of gas, I upped one star for the delivered price.</li>
    <li> These are nice heavyweight tweezers that come with a carrying bag. I am very happy with them for the price.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d replace the tweezers I&#x27;ve owned for the past 10 years...until my wife tossed them by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Came to Amazon, read the reviews, and got this in the mail. Blows the old ones out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;Got an ingrown hair? Need to pull that jumper off the motherboard? These tweezers will take care of it in a heartbeat. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Well made tweezers.  I personally like the black edition to keep mine separate from my wife&#x27;s.  Does great job for the normal needs which are not designed to do any digging.</li>
    <li> Device works as intended would buy again</li>
    <li> For decades I have used a narrow rounded tip tweezers, but it is starting to show it&#x27;s age.  Couldn&#x27;t find an exact replacement, so I decided to try these.  At first it was a little awkward to adapt to the slanted tip, but once I did I found that these tweezers work just as well as my old ones. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Debated getting the well-known name brand tweezer (T-man) over this one, but it was worth a chance for the price. Works great and the manly black color is appreciated. No problems after months of use.</li>
    <li> These tweezers have a sleek metal finish to them, pleasing to the eyes, particularly if you are using them to match your other toiletries and grooming items. Comes in a small black pouch with the brand name on it, but the tweezers have no inscription on them which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well, plucking hairs as wanted. May not be perfect for seniors or anyone with arthritis, or any other hand grip condition for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: I will use these for the rest of my life unless I lose them.</li>
    <li> Very well made.  Has very good point to get slivers out.</li>
    <li> I love these. They work great, grabs the hair really easily but does&#x27;t rip it it actually pulls it out. Plus you don&#x27;t have to have pin point accuracy to grab a hair. Like i said. it grabs really easily.</li>
    <li> They work well, they&#x27;re high quality, they do a good job of pinching things. So ... they are nice tweezers. I recommend them if you are looking for good tweezers that are black.</li>
    <li> For some reason it seems to me that tweezers have an expiration date.  They eventually quit grabbing - like the two sides don&#x27;t come together evenly or something.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem with these and I&#x27;ve had them for several years.</li>
    <li> There are many tweezers to choose from. I ordered these for the cheaper price, but they&#x27;re not cheaper tweezers. Tips are sharp and overall look and feel is precise and professional. Recommend.</li>
    <li> good tweezers for cheap.  cant complain!</li>
    <li> I just wanted some tweezers, and when these arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find they look sleek and sexy. I felt like I was unwrapping an iPhone...but it was just tweezers. Also they come with a nice little black case (useless for me, but I guess it could be cool if you like to carry around tweezers in your purse or something, take a stab at someone&#x27;s unibrow on the bus if you think it&#x27;s out of order)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man with a pair of eyebrows that like to, when you&#x27;re not looking, creep toward each other. This product works great for keeping those suckers in line. Neat lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers have a nice sharp point, tight tolerances, and are great for grabbing those more tenacious hairs. And it&#x27;s affordable to boot! I&#x27;ll be buying these again if I ever misplace my current pair.</li>
    <li> They arrived tweezers, black, and presumably steel, though I am no metallurgist. The ends are very pointy and sharp. They are black indeed, and you will feel all the cooler for it when you are picking at your aging flesh.</li>
    <li> Came in a little velvet pouch, arrived 2 days early. Pretty good quality, though the black paint was a little off. Not really a problem to me. Good as an addon item. Overall satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Great, just what I was looking for, basic tweezers like i would buy at the store. I like the purple, and it has a grippy texture.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re not talking top-of-the-line fantastic tweezers, but they do the job very well. We&#x27;re not talking top-of-the-line fantastic tweezers, but they do the job very well.</li>
    <li> Poor quality and it didn&#x27;t last long. Yikes... Get the Revlon tweezers. They&#x27;re slightly more expensive than this but works and lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> Lost my tweezers and later found out my girl friend had taken them. Got these instead as a replacement and they are good.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, grabbing hair 99% of the time.  The price was decent too.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> They tweeze things and came with a nice felt bag to hold them. Theres not much else to say about these...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that there is such a thing as &amp;#34;Premium Tweezers&amp;#34; however these do an excellent job at removing splinters.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the description stated they were 6&amp;#34; long not 3 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Good Quality and holds each hair well.</li>
    <li> Came sooner than estimated date. Works wonderful!</li>
    <li> These are good quality tweezers and serves the purpose well.&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe is with the grip. The inner surface is relatively smooth which makes gripping a hair difficult and many times the hair just slips from the grip.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a well made product.</li>
    <li> Christmas stocking stuffer and it was perfect!!</li>
    <li> Believe it or not these tweezers tweeze! I got them to keep my unibrow in line and by golly they do that just fine. I have no problems pin pointing any specific hair follicles and then plucking them with the utmost ease. If I&#x27;m really in a hurry it can also pluck multiple follicles at once! Not to mention they come in a stylish black that looks good in my hands while tweezing on the go.</li>
    <li> Just as description says.  Seems to be of high quality.  Haven&#x27;t broken yet so that&#x27;s good. A very good deal</li>
    <li> Great packaging, and nice black color. There tweezers and they work fine. Way better than any cheap dollar store one. They grab nicely and don&#x27;t slip. The only thing is the tips were stained black a bit but it still works the same I think these work great no problems at all. Get these especially for the price they work the same as 10 or 20 dollar ones:)</li>
    <li> These are incredible, better than I hoped to find</li>
    <li> Good feel and the points and meet with great accuracy. Good product.</li>
    <li> I suppose they would be ok to remove ticks from a dog.  They are useless to remove a human hair.  I should have spend an extra few bucks to buy a better pair.</li>
    <li> GREAT tweezers!  Best I&#x27;ve found.  Have two sets now.</li>
    <li> Received fairly quickly.  Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I really needed a good pair of tweezers. These are sharp and do exactly what I need, but do be careful they are super sharp!</li>
    <li> Have had a tough time removing my many splinters but this tweezer is great at grabbing those pesky tweezers.  It seems to be well made and should hold up better than ones I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> They were cheap - in fact, cheaper than we found them at the local store. And, they work. No complaints here. I would buy them again (even if they didn&#x27;t look so cool).</li>
