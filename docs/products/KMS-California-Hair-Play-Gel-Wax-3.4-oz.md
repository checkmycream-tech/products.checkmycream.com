<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hair product for many years now. It&#x27;s one of the few products I&#x27;ve used that has a decent hold, yet doesn&#x27;t give too much of a wet look. I like that natural look that looks like you don&#x27;t have much/any product in your hair, but your hair keeps its shape in wind. I have medium-length curly hair. I&#x27;d recommend experimenting with how wet/dry you want your hair to be before putting this in. Personally, I prefer my hair to be pretty dry before putting this in. It gives it more volume and holds the shape better from my experience, as it doesn&#x27;t get weighed down the same way it would if it were wet. Great product, highly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I holds my hair in place without the greasy look.</li>
    <li> This product is everything i have been wanting for my (short/funky) hair. Holds and shapes beautifully, with no crunch and no grease.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was the product described.</li>
    <li> Love this product...adds just the amount of texture for my fine hair!</li>
    <li> IF: You have short hair, want a &amp;#34;finished look&amp;#34; that is not slimy or greasy, just &amp;#34;accurate&amp;#34;, then this is a great product.  I used to use their molding paste all the time.  I found it was difficult to keep my hair looking nice all day.  Great for a few hours, but lost its effect about half way through the day.  With the Gel Wax, I use less product, get a better hair style, and have a long-lasting effect that gets me all the way through a business day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3.4oz package (smaller than the 5+oz package I used for the molding paste) lasts as long, sometimes longer.  Its a better size for travel, and on Amazon, I save about 33% as compared to my SF-Based salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP OF THE DAY: push the bottom of the tube UP as you use the product.  You easily get another 10-15% product out of the tube.  Otherwise, you are leaving a lot of product (and money) in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years and really liked it. For a guy, it&#x27;s simple and does the job. BUT I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THIS THING IS LOADED WITH PARABENS (2 types even - read the label). If you&#x27;re a woman, that&#x27;s not that bad. For a guy though, it KILLS your testosterone for weeks (endocrine disruptor). WTF!!</li>
    <li> great, holds like gel without too much stiffness. not heavy</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The product does a nice job holding your hair, but yet looks natural like you are not using gel.  I have used other products but they all made my hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Wax gel works great for defining peices of hair.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of KMS products. Prior to coming across the Gel Wax I used to use their Hair Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gel Wax is thicker than their gel, which means I can use less. One pump is all I need to style my hair. It&#x27;s provides a great hold and helps my hair look great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any issues with flaking either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many different hair styles thought the years and the KMS Gel Wax has never let me down.</li>
    <li> Was using a gel I had to dip my fingers into.  This pump gel is easier and spikes my short hair.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for awhile. Was able to get it here much less expensive than at a salon.</li>
    <li> SOLUTIONS....FINE HAIR.  I HAVE USED OTHER KMS HAIR PRODUCTS RECOMMENDED BY HAIR STYLIST AND A FRIEND RECOMMENDED HAIR PLAY GEL WAX.  IT IS EASY TO USE WITH BASIC INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCESS.  WORKED WELL...FINE HAIR RESPONDED. FINE HAIR IS CHALLENGING.  KMS IS RESPONSIVE.</li>
    <li> I have used gel most of my adult life to style my hair but it never gave me the look I wanted. Recently at Supercuts my stylist used this product instead of gel in my hair and I was very impressed with how it holds and doesn&#x27;t weighed down my hair. If you are looking for something better then a gel this is your product!</li>
    <li> Love this gel for my hair to make it look great.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I only use this product now.  I used to use the KMS gel which is also great, but I find it takes too long to set and then it can get flaky after a long day.  The gel wax does not flake at all and leaves my hair with some flex and play but maintains its style.  Great for short hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I was ordering another product and thought I would check out the Hair Play price.  Was well pleased with the price and it was cheaper than buying from my hair stylist.  Time frame of delivery was great.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered a different product,one my husband and I have used for years, and got this one by accident.&lt;br /&gt;We actually fell in love with this, love the way it feels on the hair, and what you can create with it. We both highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> very good, better after hair styling.</li>
    <li> The product itself is awesome - 5 stars - but this is the second one I have had that the pump does not work properly and I have to spend time pumping it to get just a small amount out on my hand, need to upgrade the seals or something.</li>
    <li> This product styles the hair and gives it volume without being sticky and it has a pleasant smell.  A little dab will do it.</li>
    <li> This product works well at first but over time it get oily and makes your hair look more dirty. I like my hair product to last at least 2 days, and this doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite hair product from KMS. Shine and hold.  Gives my brown hair that black italian look. No after mess.  Will use this the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s cheaper than the saloon! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this wax. Doesn&#x27;t leave his hair too stiff or give it that helmet look. Hold his style all day.</li>
    <li> Great product without harsh chemicals. Leaves just the right amount of sheen and holds up well all day long.</li>
