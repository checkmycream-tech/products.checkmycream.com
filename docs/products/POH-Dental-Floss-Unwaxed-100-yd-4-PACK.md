<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best floss out there endorsed by top dentists. Been using it for years and I have the best teeth in large part thanks to using this floss daily for years.</li>
    <li> Very thin floss.  I like thick waxed floss, and order this for my mother because she has a preference for the thinnest unwaxed floss possible. This is her favorite. POH dental products are made in Oklahoma.  Good product and a good price here.</li>
    <li> hate that wax you get on all floss products...this is the only one I have found that is UNWAXED yet effective for flossing teeth</li>
    <li> Good sturdy floss recommended by my dentist.  Cheap store brands kept breaking.</li>
    <li> Floss met my expectations which were based on years of use.</li>
    <li> This is the floss we&#x27;ve been using for years and some times it is hard to find.  Ordering it simplifies everything.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I like the unwaxed, thin floss and this floss is the best.  One roll will last for months when you floss each day.  Very cost effective.</li>
    <li> This is the same floss that my dental hygienest uses.  I prefer the product, because it is thin and easily fits between the teeth.  I gave it 4 stars, but I have really not found anything that I like better.</li>
    <li> My old dental practice used to use it and then give me the rest of the spool to take home. When the new owners stopped that, I could not find it in stores. I tried about every other brand but none were as good. It is the only one that i can feel working its way down far enough under the gum line, especially between some of my teeth that are close together and set at imperfect angles.</li>
    <li> If you have close-spaced teeth and don&#x27;t like waxed floss, this is for you. I can&#x27;t use other floss, because my teeth shred it or it&#x27;s too thick or waxy. This is so much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve used. Really scrapes your teeth clean!</li>
    <li> I have very closely set teeth, and it&#x27;s difficult for me to use any kind of waxed floss because the wax makes it that much tougher to get between my teeth. Aside from that, the wax seems to defeat the purpose of scraping the sides of my teeth.  I love POH&#x27;s floss because it&#x27;s thin enough to easily get between the gaps, and without the wax, the floss fibers really do a great job at scraping. Ever since I was given a complementary pack by my dentist, I&#x27;ve been hunting this exact product down, and I&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon.  My only complain is that, because my teeth are so tightly set and sharp that the thread fibers tend to break while flossing. I&#x27;ll typically go through 2-3 strips of floss because they keep breaking, but to strengthen it, they would have to make the floss thicker, which would then take away the benefits of the floss being this thin. As such, I really don&#x27;t mind if it breaks, because it does the job well, and it&#x27;s certainly cheap enough (a pack of flat, waxed floss at the grocery store costs 3x this).  If I&#x27;m not mistaken, POH makes a different set of floss with a higher fiber/thread count, so that may help the problem of breaking, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. Overall, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this classic unwaxed floss, as no other floss I&#x27;ve tried even compares.</li>
    <li> This floss is thin which I like, but it shreds every time I use it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Butler used to make a shred-resistant unwaxed floss and I wish I had bought a case of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been  using this for years, the only one that avoids wax and is thin enough. Glad to have found it with you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  My intro to it was a free give away from my dental hygienist;  no other product makes my teeth feel as clean, especially waxed floss.</li>
    <li> great product, been usig for last 10years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve known that I should floss for years, but I can&#x27;t fit waxed floss between my teeth.  I had braces as a kid and was told that my jaw is too small for my teeth - so there&#x27;s nearly zero space between my teeth.  I can get standard waxed floss between maybe 3 teeth and that&#x27;s with a lot of maneuvering.  I asked my mercury-free biological dentist (!!!) about my flossing issue and he told me about this unwaxed dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of this floss is that it&#x27;s made up of many very thin nylon fibers.  This allows them to get between even the tightest of teeth.  As some other reviewers stated, the strands will separate as you are using it, but they generally won&#x27;t break.  I do break a line of floss on occasion, but my teeth are really tight.  There are about 6 spaces where I cannot get any floss in - not even this type.  And for all but 2 or 3 spaces only this floss will work.  Generally I can use one line of floss for my entire mouth, rinsing the floss when needed and moving down the line as I go.  So it&#x27;s strong enough for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this is the best floss I&#x27;ve found.  I gave up flossing for years because I could find a line that worked.  But now I&#x27;m back at it.  Thanks POH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I will be trying and then reviewing [[ASIN:B0062N3JEI POH PERCEPT FLOSS NO WAX 420]] - their thinnest dental floss that uses only 6 strands of nylon.  This may be the only floss that I can get between my tightest teeth.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find any type of dental floss other than ribbon in my area, most of it minted and waxed. The POH floss is just what I need for my close teeth: tough and fine. It doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this floss because it came recommended from one of our past dental hygienists, but it tends to fray pretty easily.</li>
    <li> My dentist gives me one at each check up, and it normally lasts me almost until my next check up, but since I haven&#x27;t been able to make an appointment in a while (long story), I ran out.  Brick &amp; morter stores don&#x27;t much carry unwaxed floss anymore, so this was a great find.  Other unwaxed flosses work basically just as well, but this one is my favorite.  Thin and strong, gives a satisfying scrape against the side of the tooth surface, sometimes I can even see plaque which has been removed.  That basically never happens with waxed floss, it just feels dirtier.</li>
    <li> POH floss is very thin and plenty strong, needs no wax -- by far my favorite.  Fits between snug teeth gaps that other floss can&#x27;t do.  It&#x27;s container is compact -- the size of a small spool of thread.  So glad to find a supplier again!  You have to do a couple more wraps around your finger cuz it&#x27;s so thin and slick (100% woven nylon strands).  Thanks, POH!!</li>
    <li> It is so hard to find unwaxed floss that is not Teflon-ey like Glide....  Mainstream drugstores never carry this type of floss anymore.  I like it because it really scrapes the plaque off, without just glossing over it like Glide or waxed flosses do.  I can hear the friction of the floss against the teeth, so I know it is actually scraping off the plaque.  Great to find this on-line!</li>
    <li> For me it works better than any other floss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strong and consists of several microfilaments to trap debris.  It does a fantastic job of scraping and it gets in between tight spaces without wax.  You get twice as much floss per container compared to other brands. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The best floss...excellent purchase experience. Reasonable price and arrived very quickly. I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using POH Unwaxed dental floss for years and was happy to see it on Amazon.  I think it is the best floss on the market.</li>
    <li> This is a regular buy and seemed this time to be a bit of a problem with pulling out a line of floss... different that previous product but adequate.</li>
    <li> This floss is hard to find locally, and my dentist gives me free samples, but I ran out and was glad to find it on line.  I received it in a timely manner, and am quite satisfied with the purchase. It is thin and can get between some of my tight teeth which is a plus. It will shred if you have any jagged teeth, but they all will. Over all, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this floss.  I have been using this floss for about 20 years and love it.  I used to be able to get this floss at all of the local drug stores, etc., but somewhere along the way, they stopped carrying it.  I thought that the company had gone out of business because I could not find it - until Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this floss because my teeth are very close together and I have a hard time getting floss between them.  I also like that it does not break apart and fray up when I use it.  Lastly, I really like that it is very, very lightly waxed or you can get the unwaxed version but the lightly waxed version of this product is so light you can&#x27;t even tell there is any wax on the product.  When I have used waxed products in the past I felt like my teeth were coated in wax and they didn&#x27;t feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I can get this through Amazon, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using POH ever since I was introduced to it when my husband and I first got married and I went to the military dentist.  It is wonderful and leaves all the others way behind.  Thank you for making it available since I can rarely find it in a store.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this product.  After having difficulty finding it locally, I successfully found it online and have been very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this at a conference this year. Maybe it was a defect in the sample design but the product container was poorly designed. It was not angled to slice through the floss, so every time I tried to cut the floss, it just ended up a big mess. Also it is too thin (even for me) If you are going to order floss off amazon and or are an adamant flosser  I would recommend dontodent from amazon.de.</li>
    <li> The old standby. Anything fancier doesn&#x27;t work as well. This is a good, thin floss that my dentists/hygenists used when I was growing up. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. The only exception I&#x27;d make for newer types of floss is the elastic-y kind--- but that stuff is pricey. This stuff just works, and is thin enough to really get in there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and gets my teeth cleaner than waxed floss.  Also, it&#x27;s thin enough to get easily between closely spaced teeth.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It&#x27;s not available anymore where I live.</li>
    <li> My teeth are really tightly spaced and I have a hard time getting floss between my teeth. This floss is very fine and gets in and out very well. It also seems to scrape the teeth and clean them better. It&#x27;s amazing that you can&#x27;t buy it in stores.</li>
    <li> Like the product and certainly the small, handy container EXCEPT it is almost impossible to cut off the material with the small &amp;#34;knife&amp;#34; on top.  Almost useless.  Would be a really great item if the manufacturer would do something about that. Until then, I will probably look for another product.</li>
    <li> not happy to thin and unravels, not a very good product, but good price.</li>
    <li> I like the sturdy multi-stranded structure of this floss, and I am an obsessive flosser.  If you, like me, can&#x27;t go to bed without flossing no matter how late or how tired, I urge you to pay extra for the black version of this floss.  You will then be completely satisfied that the job is done--the job being the complete removal of food debris from between your teeth--as black confirms your success but white does not.</li>
    <li> This stuff is useless. As another reviewer (who gave it two stars for some reason) wrote, it is too thin, and it is almost impossible to cut it with the stupid design of the thingy that you have to put it through to make the cut. It so so tight against the top, I had to struggle to get floss in, and then is shredded rather than made a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some teeth close together, so difficult to get floss between them, It was possible with the Walgreen floss I have used, but this stuff broke every time I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really aggravating is that after using it a few times, and making a cut, the end disappeared inside the container, and no way to open it as with other more logical dispensers. Useless! Not worth the trouble to return for ten bucks, so just threw them away.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted, and the price was great!  Much more convenient than driving to the closest store that carries it, 8 miles away.  Go Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  It was indeed a 4 pack of 100 yd spools, but the picture shows a spool of 25 yd.  Ignore the 25 yd on the spool in the picture!</li>
    <li> the POH floss for me is the best.  when the dentist gives out the small floss they used to give this one.  now they have others and do not like them as well.</li>
    <li> I am 75 y.o. and have used POH products for years.  Went to a new oral hygenist for a cleaning and she almost fainted because she couldn&#x27;t find anything to clean.  Used this floss every day after a whole mouth restoration of my teeth at a dental school (it took a year).  It was in their bag of goodies.  I fell in love with it and found where to order online.  I can&#x27;t use regular dental floss as my teeth and crowns are really tight.  If you want to keep your teeth, use this stuff every day.</li>
    <li> Great product for dental care. Recommend using the unwaxed version. A sample was provided by my dentist and have been using it everyday for over 20 years. Periodic checkup and cleaning is a snap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this floss for years.  I special-order it because I can not get it in a store where I live for some reason.  This purchase was very easy and I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> POH unwaxed floss is the only floss I&#x27;ve ever used that truly cleans in between my teeth, down deep where there is not much space in between them.  Waxed floss feels three times the thickness and can&#x27;t do for me what POH floss does.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by old fashioned logo. It is simple,plain and the best. I no longer use waxed dental floss. It seems to be gliding without scraping all the plaque. Without wax or flavors, I can see plaque between the fibers and can smell it. I don&#x27;t want to hide or mask the waste material came out from my teeth. So I realize that I still need to rinse and complete cleaning after flossing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thin unwaxed is hard to find, and it definitely makes the best dental floss.</li>
    <li> This is a plain, unflavored, unwaxed, fine floss that&#x27;s great for anyone with closely spaced teeth. I have a hard time using normal-sized waxy floss - this does the trick easily.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this floss for a long time and was so thankful to find it on Amazon.  It is unwaxed and unflavored and really does the job.  My teeth get squeaky clean and it encourages me to floss more often.</li>
    <li> I have always used unwaxed floss and I won&#x27;t even floss if I have to use waxed floss because it just feels like it&#x27;s sliding over the top of the &amp;#34;crud.&amp;#34;  This floss is really thin which is good because my teeth are so tight that some flosses I&#x27;ve bought in the past didn&#x27;t fit between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are very sharp and I tend to cut floss in half when using it.  This one holds up pretty well although it does fray a bit...but that&#x27;s acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be buying it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> The best.  I floss every night with this and have for years.  Much better than the waxed stuff.  The &amp;#34;best dentist in the world&amp;#34; told me to floss with this years ago and I have been ever since.  POH Dental Floss, Please Don&#x27;t ever go out of business.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. It&#x27;s a great product especially for people like me who&#x27;s teeth are very close together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon M.</li>
    <li> Spaces between my teeth are tight, and ultra thin Poh allows easy access.  Seven more words are not required for this review.</li>
    <li> dentist said to get unwaxed and this was a good deal</li>
    <li> Best floss I can find  Had been recommended by my Dentist but I couldn&#x27;t find locally&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done</li>
    <li> The floss is thin and fragile, it cut my mouth easily and the fiber stuck between teeth. What is the purpose to dental floss again??</li>
    <li> A little thin, sometimes I double it to get the multi-thread effect. I like the minimal packaging and price.</li>
    <li> Had not tried this product before.  It is very useful for me because my teeth are closely spaced, and this floss works between my teeth easily.  It does shred after doing several teeth, so use enough that you can wind your fingers to a new section after cleaning a few teeth.  I find that the unwaxed floss does a better job of cleaning, because of the slight roughness.  Price is very reasonable, especially considering that I cannot find a similar product in stores.  Overall a very good product, and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> In that floss is an item you use up and need more - any savings for multiple purchases helps.  This floss is OK, a bit thinner than my usual brand, but has been difficult finding unwaxed floss locally.  So, good purchase and works to floss the teeth I want to keep!</li>
    <li> Cannot find this in pharmacies and is highly recommended by my dentist Does a much better job of dental cleaning than the flat style floss.</li>
    <li> It works well as expected for an un-waxed floss.  Un-waxed floss is not found in most stores!</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my embroidery and sewing machine tension discs and housing. Most floss is waxed and leaves a residue in the machines. Every few days I thread the machine as normal except the needle and just drag a piece of floss through to the needle (don&#x27;t pull toward the top or you will pack more loose fibers into the tension discs instead of pulling them out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimal packaging, 4 for the price of 2, prime shipping which arrived quickly and we didn&#x27;t have to run to several stores looking for unwaxed floss.</li>
    <li> I found this dental floss at my dentists office and love it. It is the only floss that I find easy to use. It is unwaxed, which my dentist recommended, and it is made of nylon and does not break apart easily when I floss. Since my dentist left the area, and you cannot buy this stuff at CVS or RiteAid, I finally found it here (yay for Amazon) and purchased 4 rolls, which should last me years. If you care about your teeth and gums, this is the best dental floss. It is very easy to tear off and store, and is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I love this floss.  It works 10 times better than any other floss I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It&#x27;s very thin and can fit in tight spaces!</li>
    <li> I like thin floss, but this is a bit too thin. And even though it&#x27;s so thin, gets stuck between my teeth because it&#x27;s not waxed. Doesn&#x27;t shred -- it&#x27;s strong.</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it was not what was pictured on Amazon. My dentist uses this product, but I wanted more! After I returned it, I&#x27;m still waiting for my refund... where the heck is my refund!!!???</li>
    <li> My favorite floss, event though my dentist won&#x27;t switch.  Made in America, an exception to everything else.  Find product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My dentist introduced me to this very thin floss and when I floss this is the only one that I will use.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> The sticker which safety-seals the little tube also leaves behind a reside which gums up the built-in floss cutter, which seems pretty lame in how its designed.  I could take some alcohol or something, try to remove the residue, but who knows what that will do to the floss.  Anyhow.... I like this unwaxed floss better than the drug store stuff I was using before, and it seems to really get the stuff out.  Dentists likes the results.</li>
    <li> Straight from the dental hygienist&#x27;s mouth, &amp;#34;This floss is the best floss. Ever.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~K. Breeding RDH&lt;br /&gt;Dental Hygienist of 24 years!</li>
    <li> this is THIN, and gets the job done better than any other floss I have tried. LOVE IT. Don&#x27;t like waxed floss, as it will leave a residue and not remove all of the gunk properly. Plus if your teeth are tight together like mine, you need the thin floss to get in there without shredding. This one shreds sometimes but nothing at all like any others I have tried. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product and service. I bought the four pack, it&#x27;s like bulk buying, I&#x27;m set for a long time.  The flow is very thin and strong.</li>
    <li> I have tried to use POH always and this was the best deal for sure. If you have a tight spot and need a thin floss this is the one.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that makes my teeth feel squeeky clean!!!</li>
    <li> We have used this floss for more years than we can remember.  It seems to work better than the thicker floss.  Also, the no wax feature seems to clean better.  You can also order refills which can be used in the dispensers.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years. As my local source was no longer in business it was difficult to obtain. A friend suggested I try Amazon and not only was it simple to obtain but was actually a bit less expensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to use dental floss.</li>
    <li> Unwaxed, so it doesn&#x27;t leave any pesky little bits behind.  The threads separate a bit, so they can grab more particles.  Gives a very thorough, clean feeling after use.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.  I have sensitive teeth and am a denti-phobe.  Doing it yourself is the best revenge.  Using this floss, I finally had a check up where the hygienist didn&#x27;t find anything to scrape away.  Yippee!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this floss, the un-waxed variety is the best at what floss is designed for.&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t find a better floss. POH is thin and very strong. I use it every day, biannual check ups are highly praised due to POH unwaxed floss.&lt;br /&gt;Remember; you only have to floss the teeth you want to keep.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this floss on Amazon. It is by far the most effective dental floss on the market. It is a super thin nylon that literally makes my teeth squeaky clean. It gets up under the gums easily and gets at the soft plaque before it can turn to hard plaque. Why anyone would use a waxy coated floss to remove plaque is a mystery to me. The waxy stuff seems to do the opposite of what floss is intended to do...it has never worked for me. This floss was first given to me by an oral hygenist. You gotta figure she knows what she&#x27;s doing.</li>
    <li> My new favorite floss.  It feels a lot more effective than waxed or teflon floss.  Prone to tearing if you have tight clearances so I always keep some teflon floss around just in case I need it to floss out the shredded bits.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Rarely shreds!</li>
    <li> I have used POH dental floss for several decades.  I was glad to find it online as it can be difficult to find in the stores here in the Northwest.  I don&#x27;t understand why it is not sold in more stores.  Poh floss is a far better product than any other dental floss on the market.  It is extremely thin but is so strong that it has never broke on me.  It is much more effective to use than any competing product I have tried.  Would I recommend it? You bet I would</li>
    <li> I only by this floss now, 4-8 packs at a time so that I don&#x27;t have to fool with it. Great quality, both the lightly waxed and the no-wax version.</li>
    <li> POH is my favorite and my dentist stopped giving it away.  Glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades. I like that it is thin and unwaxed.</li>
    <li> What my dentist used to give me, for free.  Nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> Excellent floss for those with tight tooth contacts.  Easily goes between teeth to clean proximal surfaces.  This is the same floss used in military dental facilities for decades.  Sturdy and convenient container that holds an amazing amount of floss.  Outstanding product, thank you.</li>
    <li> My family lives by this floss for our daily oral hygene. The container is durable and one container can last you almost a year, depending on your use of course. I take this floss when I travel and give this product two thumbs up. POH unwaxed leaves your teeth feeling clean with no residue from unwanted wax. POH has not changed in all these years I for that I am grateful.</li>
    <li> Thin and strong, this is the best floss to get between tight teeth and to scrape off plaque.  Love it!</li>
