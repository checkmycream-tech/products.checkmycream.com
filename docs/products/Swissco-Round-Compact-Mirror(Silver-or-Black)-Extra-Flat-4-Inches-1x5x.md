      <li>pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Has both a regular and magnified mirror which are perfect  </li>
      <li>but this is perfect to check the hair on the back of my head.</li>
      <li>We love both of them.</li>
      <li>Love this mirror.</li>
      <li>Be sure you know what four inches looks like.&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
      <li>Great size and easy to open and close.</li>
      <li>Very nice mirror for the low add on price.</li>
      <li>great for travel…..very flat.</li>
      <li>The mirror itself may have been the 4\\&quot; diameter they reported, but the true measurement is almost 5\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
      <li>All in all happy with purchase at such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>So, it doesn&#x27;t really fit in my purse, but it&#x27;s quite functional and pretty</li>
      <li>importantly, the mirror I got looked like it was used - and none too gently.  </li>
      <li>This is just the right size to carry along with you.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very large mirror.</li>
      <li>The 4 inch diameter size is great for checking makeup or hair, especially if using with a wall mirror too, for checking your hair in the back.</li>
      <li>so you better have something to help you get it open</li>
      <li>First thing i ever baught on line, baught it for my wife for  christmas one year for a stocking stuffer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of funny because one of the mirrors has a sticker with &#x27;5x&#x27; on it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty obvious which is the 5x when you look into it and can see the fine detail of the inside of your nose.</li>
      <li>Easy to open.</li>
      <li>Huge, definitely not one I&#x27;d put in my purse</li>
      <li>A 90 degree angle (which is shown in the display) requires you to be looking at it from a lower position that is reasonable.  </li>
      <li>It was a gift and well appreciated.  </li>
      <li>and I like the way it looks, very sleek.</li>
      <li>Very slim mirror.  </li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s the only way to comfortably use this thing if you&#x27;re going to need it often.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size for travel - bigger surface lets me see whole face, but slim profile makes it light and easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;Mirror is actually black.  </li>
      <li>The combination of the regular and magnification mirrors are just right!</li>
      <li>only good thing about it is that it&#x27;s extra flat, as claimed.</li>
      <li>I love how thin and light weight</li>
      <li>The mirror is fine, however it won&#x27;t stay closed.  </li>
      <li>Had thought was silver but did get black which is fine.</li>
      <li>that I had to open the clasp with a knife the first time, but after that it snaps closed and open just fine.</li>
      <li>The mirrors are as the description says and are clear and without defects.</li>
      <li>I like that the part that makes your face larger because you see everything so clear.</li>
      <li>Wow it was way bigger than i thought !!!!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and just as expected!</li>
      <li>The case is cheap plastic and would likely break if dropped on a hard surface.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive but it was a waste considering I barely got to use it.</li>
      <li>Ordered a silver compact and got a large black one.</li>

<li> Ordered a silver compact and got a large black one.</li>
<li> you are expecting a small little compact mirror you can fit into your pocket,&lt;br</li>
<li> Case bigger than anticipated, but is flat and will serve its purpose.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s extra flat</li>
<li> BUT....it does not sit on a flat surface at an angle that is useable.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s about twice as big as I expected.</li>
<li> the metal piece holding the hinges together was so loose it just slid off.</li>
<li> They are a little bigger than I imagined, but they work.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is a little tricky to open, but the mirrors inside are good.&lt;br</li>
<li> I dropped it while it was closed and it shattered.</li>
<li> There is nothing more annoying than having a tiny mirror to put your make up on with!</li>
<li> Once you snap this thing closed, it&#x27;s dang near impossible to get back open with your bare fingers.</li>
<li> This is bigger than I had imagined so it&#x27;s not going on my small purse or clutch  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve other compact mirrors that I&#x27;ve dropped that didn&#x27;t break like this.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to open</li>
<li> This sucker is big!</li>
<li> My only complaint is the hinge, which is also not great quality and is too loose to hold its position open at an angle if you have it sitting on a table, so has to be propped up to use it that way.</li>
<li> The other did snap shut, but the hinge is a little flimsy.  </li>
<li> There are gauges in it, and scratches where you can see the black that&#x27;s under the silver color.  </li>
<li> I got a black plastic folding mirror that is 6 inches across.</li>
<li> Too bad it fell apart after my first use -</li>
<li> The actual reflective surface has no issues at all, but the opening and closing mechanism is ridiculously difficult.</li>
<li> The click close on the case is feeble but it stays closed in my purse</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s not perfect for my purse,  but not worth exchanging.</li>
<li> and I like the thin design.</li>
<li> She seam to like it and hasnt broken yet!</li>
<li> Maybe someone just threw the wrong thing in the box?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thin though.</li>
<li> I have to struggle with my fingernails (painful!)</li>

    <li> They are a little bigger than I imagined, but they work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very large mirror. Measures 4 inches in diameter but it&#x27;s extra flat so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Huge, definitely not one I&#x27;d put in my purse</li>
    <li> Just the right size for travel - bigger surface lets me see whole face, but slim profile makes it light and easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;Mirror is actually black.  Nice quality item.</li>
    <li> Fits nicely in my purse</li>
    <li> Case bigger than anticipated, but is flat and will serve its purpose. Had thought was silver but did get black which is fine. Has both a regular and magnified mirror which are perfect  All in all happy with purchase at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Wow it was way bigger than i thought !!!!</li>
    <li> The size of this is great. Too bad it fell apart after my first use - the metal piece holding the hinges together was so loose it just slid off.</li>
    <li> Be sure you know what four inches looks like.&lt;br /&gt;if you are expecting a small little compact mirror you can fit into your pocket,&lt;br /&gt;this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have giant pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little tricky to open, but the mirrors inside are good.&lt;br /&gt;Am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror for the low add on price. It&#x27;s sort of funny because one of the mirrors has a sticker with &#x27;5x&#x27; on it. It&#x27;s pretty obvious which is the 5x when you look into it and can see the fine detail of the inside of your nose.</li>
    <li> It is way larger than what I thought.  I had bought is for a purse mirror, no way.  It&#x27;s hard to open so you better have something to help you get it open, I just leave it unsnapped so I can use it.</li>
    <li> I loved the size and the magnification.  BUT....it does not sit on a flat surface at an angle that is useable.  A 90 degree angle (which is shown in the display) requires you to be looking at it from a lower position that is reasonable.  I&#x27;d have to get on my knees.  When I try to adjust it to a wider angle it wouldn&#x27;t hold.</li>
    <li> Perfect size travel mirror.  Easy to open. Every hotel has a mirror but this is perfect to check the hair on the back of my head.</li>
    <li> I was for this mirror for quite some time. I was that I did and bought it. I purchased two for myself and a friend. We love both of them. I like that the part that makes your face larger because you see everything so clear.</li>
    <li> Great size and easy to open and close.</li>
    <li> Got this for purse and travel uses. The mirrors are as the description says and are clear and without defects. The magnifying side gives an undistorted reflection. The case is cheap plastic and would likely break if dropped on a hard surface. The click close on the case is feeble but it stays closed in my purse The 4 inch diameter size is great for checking makeup or hair, especially if using with a wall mirror too, for checking your hair in the back. My only complaint is the hinge, which is also not great quality and is too loose to hold its position open at an angle if you have it sitting on a table, so has to be propped up to use it that way. For the price paid I would buy it again because it serves my purposes and I like the thin design.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and just as expected!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for your purse. Be warned, it&#x27;s big! It&#x27;s very thin though.</li>
    <li> I love how thin and light weight this travel compact is. The mirror is a great size. There is nothing more annoying than having a tiny mirror to put your make up on with!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift, so haven&#x27;t actually used it myself. But the person who received the gift raved about it.</li>
    <li> What I received doesn&#x27;t look anything like the product photo. I got a black plastic folding mirror that is 6 inches across. This is not what I thought I was getting. Maybe someone just threw the wrong thing in the box?</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and functional, but I missed the part where it says it&#x27;s 4&amp;#34; in diameter. It&#x27;s about twice as big as I expected. So, it doesn&#x27;t really fit in my purse, but it&#x27;s quite functional and pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I had to open the clasp with a knife the first time, but after that it snaps closed and open just fine.</li>
    <li> Really nice, clicks shut.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror for my chair-side table.</li>
    <li> great for travel…..very flat.</li>
    <li> This is bigger than I had imagined so it&#x27;s not going on my small purse or clutch  but I&#x27;ll keep it in my makeup bag the 5x mirror looks great.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these mirrors.  I like the larger size for my travel bag.  It is a bit too big for my purse.  But that was not my intended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for three stars is that one of the two mirrors was not constructed well and couldn&#x27;t not close to a &amp;#34;snap.&amp;#34;  The other did snap shut, but the hinge is a little flimsy.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
    <li> This is just the right size to carry along with you.  The combination of the regular and magnification mirrors are just right!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m happy it does what it said it was going to do. I&#x27;ll be keeping in my desk at work and it fits the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Product not as advertised.  Ordered a silver compact and got a large black one.</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine, however it won&#x27;t stay closed.  Just keeps popping open. So it&#x27;s not perfect for my purse,  but not worth exchanging.</li>
    <li> This mirror fell apart in my purse after a couple of weeks. It&#x27;s not expensive but it was a waste considering I barely got to use it.</li>
    <li> Very slim mirror.  Good for a purse.</li>
    <li> The actual reflective surface has no issues at all, but the opening and closing mechanism is ridiculously difficult. Once you snap this thing closed, it&#x27;s dang near impossible to get back open with your bare fingers. I have to struggle with my fingernails (painful!) or get a pen to pry it open again just to look in the mirror. So I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of just not closing it all the way, leaving it slightly open in my purse. I think that&#x27;s the only way to comfortably use this thing if you&#x27;re going to need it often.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and well appreciated.  Just the perfect size</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. It&#x27;s so big and I like the way it looks, very sleek.</li>
    <li> This sucker is big! First thing i ever baught on line, baught it for my wife for  christmas one year for a stocking stuffer. She seam to like it and hasnt broken yet!</li>
    <li> I liked it for the 2 times I was able to use it. I dropped it while it was closed and it shattered. I was hoping for something that was a bit more sturdy. I&#x27;ve other compact mirrors that I&#x27;ve dropped that didn&#x27;t break like this.</li>
    <li> The mirror was much larger than I&#x27;d envisioned. The mirror itself may have been the 4\\&quot; diameter they reported, but the true measurement is almost 5\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, the mirror I got looked like it was used - and none too gently.  There are gauges in it, and scratches where you can see the black that&#x27;s under the silver color.  The hinges are loose.&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about it is that it&#x27;s extra flat, as claimed.</li>
