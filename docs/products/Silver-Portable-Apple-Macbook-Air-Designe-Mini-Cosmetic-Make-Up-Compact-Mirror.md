      <li>but it was worth it.</li>

      <li>not expensive</li>
      <li>I love how detailed it is down to the inputs cut outs and writing on the underside.</li>
      <li>I love how detailed it is down to the USB cut outs and writing on the underside.</li>
      <li>Its pretty much what they said it was.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this is such a great gift to anyone at any age.</li>
      <li>I was super happy I actually received the silver one since other sellers send the white one instead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like my real one.</li>
      <li>looks a lot like the real thing, took forever to get it</li>
      <li>The keyboard part was very flimsy and was already splitting apart.</li>

      <li>The only concern I have about this is that when it was shipped, many of them have minor scratches on the lid of the computer and some minor paint scratches.</li>
      <li>It says high quality in the description, and this is the opposite of that.</li>
      <li>Unlike some other reviewers, I got the exact thing I was expecting.</li>
      <li>got mine in around 11 days(shipped to texas)the cons are that the bubbles on the bubble wrap were popped and that probably explains why the front of the mirror was had several scratches,and also the mirror does stand by itself BUT only on a flat surface at a precise 90° angle,but it other than that it lays flat 180°</li>
      <li>very unhappy.wanted to give as little stocking stuffer gift</li>
