      <li>I love this dryer!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I liked the coating on the drier, its a rubbery kind of coating.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I liked it while it worked and think this may be just a faulty unit.</li>
      <li>i have had this dryer for over 5 years now and i am still thrilled with it.</li>
      <li>This dryer makes my hair nice and shiny .My layers don&#x27;t frizz out when I use this dryer..</li>
      <li>I had no idea that the right (or a good quality) hairdryer could make a difference!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong and lightweight.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d say it had a great run, and was well worth the price...</li>
      <li>this, by far, has been the best blow dryer i have ever owned.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair (but alot of it), and I wash/blowdry my hair every morning.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this blowdryer!</li>
      <li>Very light weight.</li>
      <li>The shape and weight are balanced and  easy to manage either using on your own hair or someone else&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Completely satisfied, no complaints.   </li>
      <li>I still love it though and would buy it again.</li>

      <li>At around $50 you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.  </li>
      <li>Also, the Babyliss always gave my hair a nice, smooth finish, even without any product.</li>
      <li>So many have decibel levels that are obnoxious, unlike the Babyliss.  </li>
      <li>and it works on my dog too :)    </li>
      <li>I love that there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>The longer cord allows me greater flexibility for using it on him.  </li>

      <li>This dryer is not as good as my Chi dryer was (it broke) but was a much more reasonable price.</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 for a good one when I could get this great product for half a price!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This hairdryer costs more than I would have ever paid for in the past, but as I read different people&#x27;s comments I decided to buy it. I am so glad I did. It is worth the cost. It is lightweight, so much quieter than anything I have ever owned. On top of that it will dry your hair in a third of the time. And I have thick hair. It makes your hair feel softer and lays well. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Dries hair quickly without scorching.  Very long cord which adds to the ease of use.  The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting works especially well to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the style.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this hair dryer...love the color.  Blow drying is quieter than my previous hair dryer and easy to handle and not heavy.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer showed up fast and in-time and worked well, but the red color on outside if the dryer came off on my hands and wore off completely on handle.</li>
    <li> As a middle eastern woman it is so hard for me to blow dry my tresses without them frizzing out. This hairdryer was recommended to me by my hair dresser and I am in love. No friz and I can do my entire head in around 5-7 minutes! My hair usually takes 20-25 of hot air being blasted on me. This is amazing!</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t decide between ceramic and tourmaline. I bought this 2 years ago and I do feel that it&#x27;s significantly changed the period of time it takes me to dry my hair (from 1/2 an hour to about 10-15 minutes) and does a better job than any other ion dryer I&#x27;ve tried. I like the narrow attachment at the tip (which is a must for me) and the cold shot button. I use the high and hot setting to dry with my circular brush and then the middle setting with the cold shot button to finish off. A former hair stylist taught me that&#x27;s how you lock the style in place!  Bottom line -- I&#x27;m happy with this dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man and I am very rough on hair dryers. They tend to get dropped on my tile floor often. Because both my daughters and I like to use this to dry our hair it can be in use up to an hour a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of hair dryers over the years but this is by far my favorite one. To start with the features, the cold button actually works! It doesn&#x27;t just blow out slightly cooler air but it shoots out air cool enough that it almost feels like having your face in front of a fan. The heat settings all work accordingly and the back lint catcher comes on and off easily (but not too easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this it had a huge discount that made it affordable. If you see this thing on sale then I highly recommend grabbing it.</li>
    <li> My wife is blown away with how great this hairdryer is.  She says it&#x27;s lightweight but does the best job of drying her hair of any dryer she has owned.      A really great dryer at a modest price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! It is very HOT both physically looking and the heat temperature. Completely satisfied, no complaints.   I have stubborn curly hair and it straightens it well.</li>
    <li> I love the swivel cord and the heat speed options.  My hair definitely has been looking better since I started using this hairdryer.  I have normally curly hair that needs constant hair dryer attention to straighten.  Using this hair dryer in comparison to other hair dryers seems to leave my hair less dry.  Overall - I would purchase this dryer again.  I gave it 4 stars because I believe it still could be a little cheaper &amp; I hate the color red :)</li>
    <li> I owned one of these before and paid $200 at a salon - don&#x27;t buy this at a salon you&#x27;re paying way too much.  Mine pooped out so I bought this on line and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much power as the one I owned before but it does a good job.  It also seems a bit more quiet.</li>
    <li> I straighten my naturally thick, wavy hair every day, so I needed a hair dryer that would keep it soft after all that heat. Since using this hair dryer, I have noticed my hair is smoother and there is virtually no damage. The heat options (cold, warm, hot) are a tremendous help with styling as well. I would highly recommend this hair dryer to someone looking to keep their hair healthy while still getting the benefits of styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.  I always complained about how long it took to dry my hair, but it&#x27;s a lot faster with this one.  I usually start out on a cooler setting (to avoid damage) and even that only takes a few minutes to get my hair about 80% dry before I start using heat.  It&#x27;s quiet enough that I can listen to music while I&#x27;m using it, as opposed to my old dryer which apparently used jet engine technology.  Since I started using it, friends of mine have consistently commented on my hair - one even asked if I had just gotten a haircut, and she was surprised when I told her it was this dryer because apparently it looked like I had come fresh from the salon :)  I didn&#x27;t change anything about the rest of my routine (same brush, same products, etc) and this dryer has made a noticeable difference in styling and how my hair looks overall.  At around $50 you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.  Hopefully it lasts for a few years, but so far, worth it!</li>
    <li> this, by far, has been the best blow dryer i have ever owned. i will only buy this kind again. i have had this dryer for over 5 years now and i am still thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 for a good one when I could get this great product for half a price! The only problem with it is that while using it I accidentaly push the bottom button so it turns off. I still love it though and would buy it again. It dries hair pretty fast, has long cord and is pretty light.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased. The first one was a Christmas gift for our daughter. She has really long thick hair which used to take a very long time to dry. Not with this blow dryer. So when I needed to replace mine, I decided to get the same one as I too have long thick hair. Used it for the first time today and I must say I am really pleased with it. Not only did my hair dry fast, it allowed me to style my hair quickly. I did not even need to use a straightener. Now I am wishing I had gotten this months ago.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! It makes my hair so soft and smooth. The only thing is the attachment is a bit loose and falls off if hit wrong.</li>
    <li> Bought it for her for christmas and she loves it. Still works like new so no complaints. Looks good too!</li>
    <li> Babybliss has the best hair dryers. My hair is very thick and long that with an average hair dryer it can take 45 min to dry. With this hair dryer it take 10 minutes:)</li>
    <li> This is my second ionic hairdryer (I reviewed the other one as well), and I finally got what I expected. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it very shiny. Sufficient choice of settings. They advertise it as extremely lightweight, but while it is lighter than the other one it is still no featherweight. Love the angle of the handle on this one; it balances well. My only real complaint is not so much the placement of the buttons, but their \\&quot;M.O.\\&quot;. If you have buttons in that location it&#x60;s better they slide. I don&#x60;t know the technical term here, but these tilt (or dip) and until you get used to it, often by accident.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, wavy, stubborn hair that is very difficult to dry.  Using the BaByliss Pro TT, I was able to dry my hair in half the time with very little frizz!  It&#x27;s not a miracle-worker or anything, but it does definitely cut down the time it takes to do my hair and frizz reduction is always a plus.  The only con I can really think of is that the buttons are poorly placed and for me, the handle design was not as ergonomic as it could have been.  Otherwise, GREAT product!</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying anything but a $20 hair dryer and it was a success.  I have shoulder length, fine hair and was looking for something that would make it easier to style without frying it.  The BabyBliss really is a step up - it does not get as hot yet dries my hair faster without frizz.  It was so smooth after I used this that I keep touching it all day amazed that this was actually \\&quot;my\\&quot; hair done by me not the day I go to the hairdresser.  As others mentioned two very minor issues - one is that the buttons took a couple minutes to get used to and second that you have to both push and twist the barrel attachment a bit to get it to stay on but it&#x27;s not that difficult.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, and it stays wet forever when I air dry it.  I use this dryer with a diffuser, and I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly my hair is dry and looking good.  No frizz at all.  It takes less than 10 minutes to go from very damp to stylish.</li>
    <li> The buttons are in an odd place. No matter how I hold it, my fingers change the setting from hot to warm or warm to cool, high to low, and so forth</li>
    <li> This dryer has been great. It&#x27;s lighter weight yet has the power to dry my hair quickly.  I like the different settings as use them. It&#x27;s been a great value for the price.   It was shipped so fast and packaged well. I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and the process.</li>
    <li> The Babyliss Pro Hair Dryer is worth the money. I can dry my hair in half the time that it took my drug store brand to do. I love the pointed attachment! I use it to aim at the roots to give my hair some lift. I keep the setting at warm and low.</li>
    <li> Does everything I want per product description. Love that it is quiet, not heavy, has all the necessary speeds and heats, a cool shot, beautiful red finish and a long cord. A winner.</li>
    <li> I love the hair dryer, but it only lasted 18 months; the heating mechanism went out.  Maybe eighteen months is typical of hair dryers.</li>
    <li> I got this blowdryer because my other one was super loud and high pitched.  This one is not too heavy, has a nice long cord, and the noise is low pitched and not-deafening.</li>
    <li> I listen to what my wife says she wants all year long and make mental notes of it. Then when gift time comes around I get her something. She wanted a hair drier for Christmas. I like to research everything. I spent a few days looking into what makes a hairdryer good from a beauty / fashion standpoint. This one has all the basics, tourmaline, wattage, ionic, just a great drier. I liked the coating on the drier, its a rubbery kind of coating. My wife said it made her hair feel funny and dried it too fast. I think part of it was the price I paid for it although the deal from amazon was the best around and a steal at that. My wife&#x27;s hair dresser was impressed with my choice and said it was a great hair drier. I think this is a great drier but i&#x27;m a guy that spends about 10 seconds brushing his hair in the same manner i have since i was probably 12 so its trained one way and stays like that all day without anything in my hair. I don&#x27;t use driers. From what i read, this is one of the best and of the best this will probably be the least expensive.</li>
    <li> This dryer works much better than the usual drugstore brands, well worth spending a few extra bucks for quality product. The dryer is not loud, is not too hot and very comfortable to use, and my hair dries smoother, no more frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second BaByliss dryer and it is much lighter than the first one. Does a great job and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I expected this dryer to really throw alot of  hot air &amp; dry quickly....too bad I didn&#x27;t get what was expected.</li>
    <li> First off, my best friend is a stylist and very unhappy that I would shell out the money for a Pro hair dryer - BUT I am not the least bit dissatisfied with my choice!  This hairdryer is THE BOMB.  I have extremely sensitive hearing and am blissfully happy with how quiet this hairdryer is - not to mention, the speed at which it dries my incredibly thick hair is amazing!  I would give this five stars however I have noticed that the design of the switches sometimes is bothersome since it is a little too easy to switch from hot to cold.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I priced the same blow dryer at my hair salon and they wanted $104.00.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer.  It gets super hot, dries my hair in no time.</li>
    <li> My T3 finally burned up and from what I have read, the quality has declined so I did not want to spend that kind of money on another T3 and be dissapointed.  I LOVED my T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my new dryer, I decided on the BaByliss Pro TT for its positive reviews. My most important features in a hairdryer are Tourmaline, wattage, weight, and noise level.  I give this dryer a thumbs up on all. It is not overly heavy and the noise level was lower than most cheap hair dryers. I hate loud whiny hair dryers - I don&#x27;t want to subject my ears that nonsense every day. This dryer&#x27;s noise level was almost as good as my T3.  It also seemed comparable to my T3 in dry time.  With that being said, something appeared to burn up inside the dryer in the middle of drying my hair after only 4 days of use.  This is typically what has happened to me in the past on 2+ year old dryers... ya know when you smell the electrical burn an it shuts off, never to awaken again.  Anyway, I liked it while it worked and think this may be just a faulty unit. I have not ordered another one yet and the seller and Amazon were fantastic with the return process.</li>
    <li> I have heard about these dryers and seen them in the salon I go to.  My hair dries so much smoother  with less flyaways.  It is lightweight and I wish I would have got it years ago!</li>
    <li> although i like the blow dryer it so does not look like the picture. as a professional hair stylist, i hope it lasts me more than 3 months. if  they didnt have what i wanted they should have informed me.</li>
    <li> This had so much power that it blew my shoulder length hair around so much that it tangled and snarled.  It didn&#x27;t dry any faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  I returned it.  It was worse than a cheaper dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries hair quickly.  It is light and easy to handle.  I am very pleased with this product.  I have used professional dryers for many years and this equals my previous ones.</li>
    <li> Light weight and quick dry.  Has cool, cold, warm and hot settings, low and high air volumne. Reasonable price for flexibility</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer based on many reviews I read saying how great it is.  I have straight shoulder length hair.This dryer makes my hair nice and shiny .My layers don&#x27;t frizz out when I use this dryer.. Also, it is lightweight and dries my hair quickly . I love it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to pay so much more for a hair dryer.  Of course I&#x27;m used to buying dryers in the $20 - $40 range.  But I took a chance and tought I&#x27;d return it after the first use if I don&#x27;t notice a difference.  I have super thick hair long hair and it used to take me 15-20 minutes to dry it.  This dryer gets it done in 5.  And I noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I hope is that this lasts as long as the cheaper models.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected. I have had several other Babyliss products that performed much better. I am disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer can get my very thick, curly hair from wet to mostly stick straight with a brush in about 20 minutes.  Very powerful.  Easy to hold.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Did not like. Returning it today. Have bought 4 regular size dryers &amp; they work great. Travel size melted my hair.</li>
    <li> So  much for able to use abroad. First time used in UK on 250 volt setting...burnt smell and blew out. Fine in USA, rubbish anywhere else.</li>
    <li> not to big, nice dryer, love the color, their was less blow time, less damage to my hair  Thank You</li>
    <li> This is my second Babyliss dryer.  The one I had before was stolen at the gym, so I ordered this model (because it&#x27;s red!).  I will never go with another brand again as this one is the best.  I have long hair that takes quite a bit of time to dry and always required a bit more effort to make it less frizzy and straight.  With this dryer, my hair dries in about 5 minutes and I have NO frizz whatsoever.  Since I get ready at the gym, shaving 10-15 minutes off my time getting ready is huge for me.  I love this product and would definitly recommend, especially if you have frizzy hair that takes a bit of extra TLC to maintain.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this blowdryer! I previously owned an Ionic Dryer from Conair and the BaByliss Pro blows it out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Leaves hair silky smooth and healthy looking&lt;br /&gt;+ Does not scorch scalp when held somewhat close&lt;br /&gt;+ Less drying time than other blowdryers I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;+ First blowdryer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp to become oily.&lt;br /&gt;  I can now go a few days w/o washing my hair. So happy about this!&lt;br /&gt;+ Not as noisy as you&#x27;d think it would be.&lt;br /&gt;  (I don&#x27;t have to be afraid of waking up my toddler in the mornings, what a relief)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Buttons are in an awkward area, but you get use to finding a new way to grip it pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am so grateful for previous positive reviews, because that was my deciding factor on purchasing this dryer.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews about button placement, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product. But I&#x27;m glad I did. The buttons haven&#x27;t been a big problem for me, and this blowdryer works so quickly and efficiently. My main goal was to find a dryer that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair while at the same time is quiet. (My husband hated my old loud blowdryer from Brookstone, which also damaged my hair, in spite of claiming to be \\&quot;ionic\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new blowdryer, as I can put it on the high setting and dry my hair within minutes, without all the loud wailing. It also makes my hair feel soft afterward, not dry and damaged like the Brookstone. The only thing that&#x27;s not true, is that it is not lightweight, in spite of what one reviewer said. It is about medium weight, but fine. I&#x27;m glad I spent more $$ and got a decent blowdryer this time, as it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Pricey but it&#x27;s the PERFECT DRYER for me! I have fine hair and this baby dries my hair FAST! I love that there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; heat setting between the COOL and the HOT &#x27;coz it&#x27;s what I use to dry my hair. The highest heat with low speed does not dry or frizz my hair when I style/curl. I GET THE SALON STYLE AND SHINE LOOK USING THIS! I&#x27;ve read reviews about button placement but I&#x27;ve used this for a little more than 2 weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem with me. Some reviews also said that this is heavy but I guess I&#x27;ve been using heavier full sized pro dryers that this one feels light to me. All PROS, no CONS! I&#x27;m happy I decided to buy this after looking around for so long. :)</li>
    <li> I had no idea that the right (or a good quality) hairdryer could make a difference!  I&#x27;ve never been able to blow dry my hair and have it resemble a post hair cut blow out; with this and a couple new brushes and about 45 min I was amazed.  I have mid shoulder blade length relatively thick hair.</li>
    <li> Do NOT use warm or hot settings. You will FRY your hair. But just on the cool heat it works great and makes my hair super shiny.</li>
    <li> Very quiet - no loud whine. Powerful on high, without too much tangling. Good variety of settings. Long cord. Recommended by a stylist, and it meets every expectation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair dryer in winter on a daily basis and summertime almost daily.  It is compact, light, fast, and fairly quiet.  It also seems to be less damaging than the other dryers I have tried. My only issue is the buttons are at an awkward angle, and even after nine months (and 15 years of regular hairdryer use) I am still hitting the temperature button accidentally.  I read that this was a problem on different websites before I bought it and unfortunately ignored the reviews.  Another word of warning for those of you with straight, thin hair, as I have...this hair dryer will not add any volume!  On the contrary, it tends to flatten my hair more than it is, naturally.  I think it would be better suited to those with naturally thick and wavy/curly hair that like to blowdry it straight...it leaves a smooth and shiny finish.&lt;br /&gt;*2012 UPDATE* After four years, my BaByliss is still working GREAT.  Well worth the money and you *do* get used to that button placement, it turns out!&lt;br /&gt;*2016 UPDATE* My Babyliss motor has finally died. For several months it was operating loudly and with less power. The day I replaced it with the Xtava Allure, it stopped working altogether. But I&#x27;d say it had a great run, and was well worth the price...it was lighter and more compact than the Allure, and more professional all around. The Allure runs way too hot (I have to operate it on medium heat to avoid severe damage), which was never a problem with the Babyliss. Also, the Babyliss always gave my hair a nice, smooth finish, even without any product.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is compact and does a decent job of drying my hair quickly.  The cool air button did not work properly, the air was warm or hot.  Given the price it was not worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be quieter.  It&#x27;s not markedly more quiet than my old one, and this one left my hair dry and unruly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn on this dryer. On one hand, it gets the job done, on the other, it gets really, really, excessively hot, more like a cheapy dryer might. I paid I think around $70/$80 for it, but now that the price has dropped to less than $50, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a more accurate price for what you get. It dries, it doesn&#x27;t take TOO long, and the current price point I think is a good deal for it. I&#x27;ve only had a few issues with the buttons, mostly when I&#x27;m distracted and doing too many things at once, but it&#x27;s just a hair dryer so it&#x27;s not like flipping the wrong button for a few seconds is a huge deal.</li>
    <li> This dryer is really great.  I love the long cord.  At first I kept accidentally turning it off because of the placement of the switches, but after using this for over a year, I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.  I use the HOT setting when I initially begin drying to hurry and get rid of the water out.  When my hair gets partially dry, that&#x27;s when I switch the setting to COOL.  I then style with a round brush at this point and my hair dries very smoothly just like in the salon.  I read a lot of reviews complaining that this dryer is too hot, so I felt compelled to write about that.  Of course the dryer gets VERY hot; but you certainly shouldn&#x27;t be drying your hair on that setting the entire time.  You have to reduce the heat.  I&#x27;m very happy with this dryer and very happy that it is still working like a charm.  I usually have a hairdryer that burns out after 6-8 months of use.  I spent the extra money on this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It&#x27;s also quieter.  I never noticed until I recently went to help my teenage daughter in her bathroom.  I turned her dryer (Conair) on and couldn&#x27;t believe how loud it was.  This is a superb hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Very light weight. Very quiet and the drying time is quick. Easy to handle. Heat settings are great!! I love this dryer!</li>
    <li> I have owned so many hair dryers from cheap ones to expensive.  I really like this hair dryer.  It dries my hair faster than the other brands that I&#x27;ve owned and it works on my dog too :)    UPDATE:  Today, 11/4/2014, after 2 1/2 years with this hair dryer... it started to smoke.  I did drop it several times throughout the years, used it on my dog and broke the vent cover off of it about a year ago - so I think it was a purchase well made.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well. It does a great job drying me hair in less time. However, the way the buttons are positioned is a little awkward. It is easy to accidently hit the cool button or to move the heat button from where you had it. Also, not sure if I see the Tourmaline and Ionic effects from this dryer but it does a good job. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer because its light weight, quiet, and dries my hair very quickly.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The perfect 1st year Anniversary gift! Made her extremely happy! Just a heads up to all guys out there, its a great way to suprise her. Especially if she had just talked about it in conversation once or twice. They hide what they want through conversation!</li>
    <li> I never got to try this as it arrived with a sticky finish on it.  Obviously some kind of a manufacturers defect.  So, I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with it until I noticed a big portion of my hair had broken off and my ends looked sizzled. It gets really hot and I abused the heat to get my hair dry quickly. Be careful</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this hair dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t have much power, and no medium setting.  Not impressed. I expected more from this brand.</li>
    <li> Like this hairdryer.  I wish there was a medium setting because there is a vast difference between low and high.  My hair used to take 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry.  Now it takes 5 to 10 because it&#x27;s so powerful. Have to be careful that I use enough product in my hair or it comes out fluffy and frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is my second Babyliss Pro blow-dryer and that alone tells you that I like this product.  My first one (almost identical to this one, just a slightly older model) held up well for many years of daily use.  The shape and weight are balanced and  easy to manage either using on your own hair or someone else&#x27;s.  And this is a nice QUIET blow-dryer!  So many have decibel levels that are obnoxious, unlike the Babyliss.  I have a couple of attachments ( a diffuser and a concentrator) which fit this dryer the same as the original Babyliss I owned.  I like a product that doesn&#x27;t tweak little details, just to force you to discard every attachment and start over, with every new iteration of the product!  The power and temperature choices are easy to adjust.  It has a generously long cord, so you have plenty of mobility when using it.  And I love the &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; button, which is great for a final setting of the style and maximum shine.  If you&#x27;re ready to stop buying cheap drugstore blow-dryers, this is the one you want to take your hair-styling up a notch.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a hairdryer! and the price is great! It&#x27;s very strong and lightweight. I love it! The best hairdryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> My colored hair is thick and course and I thought I just had to learn to live with frizz but this dryer solved the problem. It is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  I had an old Revlon I bought at Target that still worked pretty well, but my husband complained that it was really loud.  I researched a bunch of dryers and found this one.  So far, I love it!  It&#x27;s very powerful, but much, much quieter than my old dryer.  I feel like it dries my hair faster, but doesn&#x27;t damage it any more than the old one, as well.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a month or two, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may have trouble with the buttons being on the handle, as it easy to press one on accident, however, my old model had the same button location, so I don&#x27;t really have an issue with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that I can use it on my dog.  He was scared of the old one, and he&#x27;s not a huge fan of this one, but at least he tolerates it.  The longer cord allows me greater flexibility for using it on him.  Also, because it&#x27;s more powerful, I can hold it a little farther away from him so that 1) it&#x27;s less scary/loud for him and 2) I&#x27;m not as worried about burning him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice, red color&lt;br /&gt;Rubberized for easier grip&lt;br /&gt;Long cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled easily&lt;br /&gt;Quieter than most dryers&lt;br /&gt;Not too heavy&lt;br /&gt;Cool setting + cool shot (for added shine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the button placement</li>
    <li> After having my second conair hairdryer stop working, I decided to start looking at some of the higher end dryers.  At this time, I can not convince myself to spend $100+, so when I saw the BaByliss Pro and read thru the reviews I decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve had the hairdryer for almost two weeks now, and I really do think its a keeper. I have very fine hair (but alot of it), and I wash/blowdry my hair every morning.  I do agree with the other reviews about the button locations, that is taking some getting used to.  I tend to only use the high speed on hot (although it doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly hot which I don&#x27;t mind).  I do think the drying time has decreased; but I also might be doing a better job of drying more during the &#x27;rough dry&#x27; prior to straightening my hair.  I believe my hair actually looks healthier, less frizzy at the ends (and I think a little shinier).  I have found that I am using smaller sections when I straighten my hair, and the directional attachment doesn&#x27;t seem to be very useful (since it is not that wide), so I started straightening my hair without the attachment.  It seems to work just fine. I also really love the long cord!  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly heavy to me; but, I think I might have had some heavier dryers in the past.  I really like that the hairdryer comes with a two year warranty.  I haven&#x27;t had a hairdryer last that long; so this will be a great purchase if it does!</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my hairdresser.  She always seems to dry my hair so quickly.  This product works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to impact my drying time very much.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this hair dryer simply because in my experience, after a certain point, the benefits are too minimal to outweigh the higher price tag.  However, by getting a good deal through Amazon, it was definitely worth it.  It&#x27;s lighter than expected, dries my hair quickly, produces smooth hair, AND I&#x27;m personally a huge fan of the red.  I have relatively fine and not extremely long hair, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on very long, think, or coarse hair, but for me, BaByliss lived up to its high quality expectations.</li>
    <li> This is my first ionic hair dryer I have ever purchased. I love it!! I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I am not only pleased with the quality of this hair dryer, but also the quick delivery service.  Ordered it on a Monday and received it on Wednesday.  This type of tourmaline ionic hair dryer is certainly different from the ordinary cheaper models.  It dried my hair in less than half the time. It&#x27;s also lightweight and there is no problem where the hot/cold buttons are located.  I&#x27;ve never spent this much money on a hair dryer, but it&#x27;s the technology and quality of this product that makes it worth every penny.  Hopefully this one will last longer than a year.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this blow dryer, and my hair looked and felt fantastic after.  I read the reviews, and when my last blow dryer started sparking (it was old) I bought this one.  It definitely cuts down on the frizz, and it dries pretty fast, but I am still trying to get my hair totally straight with it and a big round brush, and so far, its not really working.  An hour after I blow dry it, my hair curls at the ends (which it did not do with the last blowdryer).  I am not sure if I am not pointing it correctly, so I am going to try it without the nozzle.  My hair does feel pretty soft though.  I will update this after a few more uses.</li>
    <li> This dryer is not as good as my Chi dryer was (it broke) but was a much more reasonable price. It is a little louder and does not get as hot or make my hair shine like the chi.</li>
</ol>
