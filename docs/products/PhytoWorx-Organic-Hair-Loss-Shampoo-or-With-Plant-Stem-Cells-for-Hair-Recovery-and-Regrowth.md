<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Compared to other Hair loss Shampoos, I definitely prefer this one. It has a wonderful smell and has proven to be very effective after just 2 weeks and one bottle. I am noticing my hair is thicker, i&#x27;m not shedding as much and I am growing where I was losing it. Also, it is a product made from nature which I love.I give it 5 stars and highly recommend giving it a shot, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> Just two weeks after using the product and I&#x27;m already seeing results. My bald spot is almost completely gone! This shampoo has given me the confidence I need to live my life to the fullest.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever purchased! Says exactly what it does! Natural organic, makes my hair grow and has more life to it than it ever has had! I love it! Bouncy, full ,saw results within a week of using</li>
    <li> I received the product FAST. I am on my 3rd shampoo with this product and i&#x27;m impressed already. I can say my hair feel a lot lighter which I attribute to the shampoo cleaning the old product build up from my hair. I have very natural curly hair that is a little on the course side and live in a high humidity area so I must deal with a lot of frizz. I think this is going to be useful to tame my mane. Smells good and like fresh herbs mmmm</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo that has a pleasant smell, is organic, all natural and is keeping my thinning hair out of the drain. My hair is fuller and healthier than ever before. After using the shampoo, I have received so many complements on my hair. PhytoWorx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo is my new favorite shampoo. Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing increasing hair loss for over a year now.  I have tried many different products to try to slow down the hair loss, but none have worked as well as PhytoWorx shampoo.  Yes, the cost is a little higher than other hair loss shampoos, but this shampoo WORKS.  It has a great, herbal scent and contains tons of organic ingredients.  This shampoo does not lather like a &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; shampoo, but to achieve a rich lather most manufacturers pump their products full of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use my hair felt revitalized and full of moisture.  My hair is so dry it usually dries within minutes of showering.  After using this shampoo, my hair stayed wet for a long time.  After continued use my hair looked and felt stronger.  I have less breakage, less fly aways, and I have found it holds a style longer.  I love that it contains all natural, organic ingredients and oils and is made in the USA.  Of all the other products I have tried, I have found this one to work the best.  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to say this is a scam as I cant be sure but i will say that not only did it not work for me but every time I put it on I seemed to lose more hair. One can attribute it to a product not working on everyone however the other reviews on here were speaking so highly of it that it got me.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that most of the reviews I clicked on (after buying it) seemed to either only review products from this company, or alternatively only have 5 star reviews for  this and another 3 or four products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very unhappy with the product (i did enjoy the smell though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps</li>
    <li> What a lifesaver!  My hair has been thinning for years now and it&#x27;s always been a sensitive subject..  Since I started using this shampoo, my hair that was lost/thinned around my crown has slowly grew back! baby hairs! i was ecstatic! I don&#x27;t have a full head of hair yet but it&#x27;s 100 times better than before. and didn&#x27;t cost me thousands of dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this shampoo is sulfate free and organic is a huge plus.  Bc I always thought my hair loss had to do with the harsh chemicals in the reg shampoos they sell at the drug stores  (and still think so).  Now I feel much better about putting shampoo on my head knowing there&#x27;s nothing bad for me or harmful to my hair in there.  Natural is def the better way to go when you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo comes in a really nice bottle, smells great and easy to use/wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def buy again, and again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the hair results, as I could not bear the smell of it long enough to use it regularly.  It smelled strangely, sort of like rotten or expired food or old sour baby milk/formula on a blanket after 2 days smell.  I am not sure if I just got a bad bottle (expired?) or if all of them smell like this.  And the smell stayed in hair until it washed out (does not dissipate in hours)&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the consistency is similar to a conditioning cleanser (kind of like W*en) and does not suds.  It did get the hair clean, but I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell.  And I have tolerated many strong smelling products.&lt;br /&gt;It did NOT smell like apples or fruit.  See above description for what mine smelled like.</li>
    <li> First of all, this my first review about a product.&lt;br /&gt;I dont lose too much hair but i wanted to use a good shampoo to protect what i have. This product is not only bad. It is horrible. I can not believe that people like it that much.&lt;br /&gt;Forget about recovering my hair, i have a dandruff problem now.&lt;br /&gt;i bought it after i read the reviews. I am really dissapointed.Bye the way, 1 bottle of shampoo last 10 days.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! Let me start the fact that it is a great ORGANIC shampoo, that has a wonderful fragrance, and most importantly, it works!!! I have lots of new &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; in my forehead and all over my head, really.... It&#x27;s really exciting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of trying anything and everything anyone recommended to me for the hair loss, without any improvements,  I can&#x27;t describe how great it feels to find a product that delivers their promises.</li>
    <li> This stuff works just as advertised. I had purhased it from a hair therapy studio I went to years ago but had forgotten about it. The results aren&#x27;t immediate, but for me over a few weeks it took effect that even my girlfriend noticed. I&#x27;ve been losing hair for about fifteen years, more than half my life, and have tried a lot of products. But this one really works and is worth the purchase price indeed!</li>
    <li> In using this shampoo, I fell in love with the scent. It smells fresh and leaves my hair moisturized. I&#x27;m going to keep using this and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> What a great shampoo? First of all, I love that it&#x27;s organic - not many products are organic these days. It makes me feel so much better when I know a product is fabricated of natural ingredients. Second of all, it&#x27;s SULFATE-FREE which is such a bonus. It&#x27;s rare to find any shampoos that are sulfate free. I try to eat organic and GMO-free and realized one day, I should take care of what I put in my hair as well! Finally, it smells great and leaves my hair feeling full, stronger, and thicker. I love how I can instantly feel the results just after ONE use. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great product, and definitely worth the money. Whatever chemicals they put in here, they are definitely anti-hair loss. Who would have guessed you could use plant cells in human hair? Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 26, and so I was surprised when I recently started having problems with increased shedding. Actually, I was more alarmed than anything. While I was anxious to deal with it before it became a serious problem, I also refuse to use a product with sulfates or harsh chemicals. This fit the bill all around, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was an absolutely great purchase decision. It uses natural and organic ingredients which was indeed a plus in my book. It doesn&#x27;t contain all those harsh chemicals usually found in most shampoos and is sulfate free. Definitely purchasing again.</li>
    <li> lf You want a extremely high quality, very effective product that uses cutting edge, state of the art quality ingrediants, then I highly reccomend Phytoworx organic hair loss shampoo. This Shampoo contains all organic ingrediants, and utilizes plant stem cells as well as several natural essential oils which produce fantastic results when used consistenly, it also does not contain any harsh sulfates that can damage Your hair and scalp like so many shampoo&#x27;s do, so You can use it every day with out having to worry about a build up on Your hair and scalp and the scent is pleasant and not overpowering, a very unique, high quality hair regrowth and care product!</li>
    <li> It is really interesting that all 5-star rated reviewers are pretty much reviewed only this product... Meaning??&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, ive got it today and used it.  Doesnt have any formimg which feels real organic product, and nice scent.  I will see how it is working and come back for review</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after talking to my hair stylist about my thinning hair. She suggested a sulfate free shampoo, specifically one with peppermint, which would stimulate hair growth. I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo from my salon, so I did some research on hair growth, dry scalp, and organic shampoos. After searching Amazon, I found what I was looking for in Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo. This hair growth shampoo uses organic ingredients, including peppermint, eucalyptus, tea tree, and rosemary oils. I&#x27;ve seen shampoos with one or two of those ingredients, but I&#x27;m happy this includes all four of these effective oils. These ingredients help relieve dry scalp, stop hair loss, and help hair growth -- all problems I want to address. I&#x27;m thrilled to find a shampoo that ditches the traditional and damaging ingredients so often found in shampoos. As another reviewer commented, I don&#x27;t mind the price as I want healthier, good looking hair.</li>
    <li> Think all positive reviews must be bogus! I don&#x27;t think this is a real product!  I bought this without reading the negative reviews stating that the positive reviews are fake. From the very first use, I could not believe this was supposed to be shampoo.  I went with it for a week but I had so much waxy build up I looked like I had wet dreadlocks. My scalp had accumulated so much build-up that sadly my boss picked what she thought was fuzz near my hairline only to discover it was dandruff!  I had to wash my hair several times with a sulfact shampoo to remove all the waxy build-up.  This must be a gimmick!  The good news is that I contacted Amazon and was able to return it and get a refund. Since, I bought the RX 4 Hair Loss shampoo and it seems to be working at significantly reducing hair shed.</li>
    <li> This is an Amazing shampoo, it smells great and works wonders! I love everything about it my hair looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> This product is great, i like that it is organic and has helped me grow back my hair after some serious stress in my life.</li>
    <li> I had life less chemically treated hair from so much abuse from coloring, perms, using hair tools and on going use of extensions. Thru th0e years my hair became brittle and began to fall out. This product since using it began to restore the shine, body, and thickness of every strand. I am no longer experiencing hair loss but instead I&#x27;ve had no more shedding and are now seeing hair growth where it was once a clear passage going from hairline towards the crown of my scalp. I recommend you try it for yourself and give it sometime to see the awesome results.</li>
    <li> I used to play football thru my school years and over time the helmet started to make my hair then and fall out and I would have heavy amounts of dandruff so I would wear a lots of hats and my old football roommate was kidding about my hair losege and then he told me to wash my hair with it for about 3 weeks and tell him if I notice any difference and sure enough it was a full grown hair back but I started to see patches of hair growing in and filling in the thinning areas so I decided to buy my own bottle and have continue to wash my hair with the shampoo and it has ingredients to improve your scalp from dandruff and leaves a soothing Smell and I&#x27;m seeing slowly  but surely my hair is coming back to full strength and I feel a lot more confident and I&#x27;m wearing less hats these days and I feel like my head can breath a sigh of relief</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely exceeded my expectations. after a few uses, im noticing my bald spots in the temple area looking fuller. I have a slight dandruff problem &amp; that seems to be slowly going away also! I&#x27;d say this shampoo is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This review is from: Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo | With Plant Stem Cells for Hair Recovery and Regrowth (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;This product is great!!! First of all like the fact that it is organic...Price is very reasonable compared to other organic shampoos out there...Like the fact that it contains essential oils such as rosemary, tea leaves and so on...Like the pump option so it will not spill all over in the shower or when using it...like the fact that it will help with hair loss and breakage and make your hair more healthier and manageable...love the color of the bottle too.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I have lost faith in all hair loss/hair growth products  UNTIL I tried the Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo | With Plant Stem Cells for Hair Recovery and Regrowth - with this product my faith in hair loss/hair growth products has been restored.    I&#x27;ve been in the process of losing my hair since my early twenties, due to the daily abuse that I put it through, from chemically treating it to regularly straightening it to even gluing hair extensions in my hair and losing an enormous amount of hair when I took them out. However, the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back with my hair loss was my pregnancy - after having a child I couldn&#x27;t even wear my hair down because running my fingers through my hair would cause me to lose about 15 hairs every time. I would be mortified when I had to wash my hair because the amount of hair that was in the tub was probably enough to make a wig out of it. My hair was literally shedding EVERYWHERE.    For the past few years I have tried probably every product there is out there to help with my hair thinning problem. From vitamins/supplements to hair loss kits to hair masks to other hair loss shampoos, I even went as far as changing my diet around to help prevent hair loss and NOTHING helped until I laid my hands on the Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 2 weeks now and I already notice a difference! Ever since I began using this shampoo my hair feels thicker and fuller. In addition, this shampoo has accelerated my hair growth... I can see baby hairs beginning to grow around my hairline. Furthermore, when I go shower now or brush my hair I notice a considerably less amount of hair falling out.    There are a few other reasons why I love this shampoo over anything else I have tried. First, working full-time and being a parent, time is of the essence to me so I needed something thats quick. Using this shampoo I only have to leave the shampoo on for 5 minutes which is totally doable with my schedule and the ease of application is very simple. Second, the other products that I used leave my hair feeling oily and dirty but not this shampoo...after using this shampoo my hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily, it leaves my hair feeling clean, healthy and silky smooth. Third, the other products that I used had an awful/unbearable smell but not this shampoo - this shampoo has a pleasant smell and not overly fragrant. Fourth, this is the only ORGANIC hair loss shampoo that works. Lastly, the price of this shampoo is comparable, if not cheaper, than the other products I have tried.    I absolutely love this product and I don&#x27;t even have 1 bad thing to say about it. This product helped me save my hair and I will continue using it and recommending it to others!</li>
    <li> I found out not too long ago that I was starting to lose my hair, so I scrambled for a suitable hair loss supplement. I found PhytoWorx in my search and now, after a few weeks of use, I am getting back to my normal head of hair! The process seems to be working quicker than other supplements claimed, and I don&#x27;t have any weird side effects like skin burns or anything of the like. The smell is pleasant and I actually don&#x27;t mind having to use it, because it leaves my hair feeling clean rather than greasy as prior products had done. Being organic is also a massive plus, as I fear the types of things chemicals can do to my scalp! Consider me 100% pleased!</li>
    <li> I was desperate to find a product that would restore hair and help it grow. I have curly hair, so already I have those odds stacked against me because curly hair is notoriously dry and processed. On top of that I straighten and color my hair which doesn&#x27;t help it stay on my head. The last insult was getting a bob cut that made me look like a paige boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with this because it was organic and the word of mouth was good- and I am glad I did. I put a good amount on 2 or 3 times a week and let the plant juices tingle my head for a week or two. Then I saw some improvements- stronger hair, shinier hair and maybe not longer hair, but at least my ends wouldn&#x27;t break off and defeat my process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay with the product, massage it in to your scalp, and make sure you keep it up for a few weeks before you check on any results.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been pretty healthy. However, for the past 8 months I have been coloring my hair at home. Big mistake. My hair began falling out in the shower and felt dry and thick, like a horses mane! I had heard about stem cell shampoo and knew a local make-up artist who swore by it. I was desperate and didn&#x27;t mind spending the extra money if it worked. I was really pleased with the way my hair looked and felt after using Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo | With Plant Stem Cells for Hair Recovery and Regrowth. It really only took a few weeks for it actually to start feeling soft and silky again but definitely after a month my hair was not falling out in the shower. With organic ingredients like tea tree oil, peppermint oil, eucalyptus and rosemary oil, I knew it would have to make somewhat of an improvement, but I didn&#x27;t realize it would be so dramatic. The one thing I missed before trying this organic stem cell shampoo was the way my shoulder length hair would shine. Before I started using this hair loss shampoo, no matter what I did my hair felt thick and dry. I would try and put hair oil on it but it still felt and looked awful. This shampoo really made a difference.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product a better rating. The supplier shipped the product quickly and packaged it well. Also, the ingredients are ORGANIC! However, I found that the product did not work for my hair. It wasn&#x27;t getting clean and left my hair sticky. It was harder than usual to brush out my hair too. Maybe other people whose hair is used to organic products would react to the shampoo better?</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo! Smells great, makes my hair feel very soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss shampoos but this one is top notch and well worth the money! Was skeptical at first, but with regular use I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less hair loss. I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone who is starting to experience noticeable hair loss. You need to use it regularly and really massage it into your scalp and let it sit there for a few minutes prior to rinsing. You will definitely notice a difference after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The fact that this product is organic was a plus, and now that I have been using it for several weeks, I give it an A++&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell, my hair feels instantly thicker, and I notice it does not shed as much. I can not wait to continue using it!</li>
    <li> this is my first amazon review i bought this based on all the 5 stars review this shampoo did nothinggg its expensive and it feels like its not even cleaning my hair didnt do anything</li>
    <li> Zero Effect and a Very expensive lesson. Used for over 4 months and I have probably lost more hair in that time than in any other 4 months in my life. The only thing I can say that it does have is a paraffin like coating that it puts on your hair that prevents flyaway hair once its styled. Even taking the large Biotin supplement might make your hair you to have (and your nails) grow a little faster, it does NOTHING for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing hair loss and needed to invest in a quality hair product to help. I&#x27;m SO glad I chose this shampoo! It has helped reduced my hair loss problems and after my first wash I already had 30% less hair fall. I&#x27;ve never seen such amazing results with any other shampoo I have tried. Another plus is that its made from all natural and nourishing ingredients so there are no harsh chemicals to further damage my hair. I highly recommend this shampoo and will keep using this product to combat my hair loss problems.</li>
    <li> THE NO LATHER REALLY STREW ME OFF, USED TO REGULAR LATHERED SHAMPOO ALL MY LIFE MADE IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO FEEL CLEAN AFTER SHAMPOOING. BOTTLE ONLY LASTED  ABOUT 3 WEEKS...BUT MY HAIR WAS REALLY SMOOTH AFTERWARDS, DIDN&#x27;T SEE ANY NEW HAIR GROWING, BUT THEN AGAIN IT WAS ONLY ABOUT 3 WEEKS I USED IT. EXPENSIVE, THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER WAY OR OTHER BRAND....</li>
    <li> I am almost 60 years old. My hair was starting to thin in my early 50&#x27;s. I have tried just about everything on the market from shampoos to vitiams. I really don&#x27;t know how much I have spent, but it was a good pretty amount. I thought  my hair loss was just something I just had to live with. Came across this hair loss shampoo. I really did&#x27;t know if I should purchase it. Thought it was just another shampoo that will not give me any results. Have been using it for about a week and a half. WHOO!!!! What a difference. My hair is getting full and I am not inbarresed to go to work and out in public. I give this shampoo a 10 star and not a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I have never been so out of synch with a majority of reviews in my life.  I hate this product and can&#x27;t imagine how anyone could say it smells good or leaves your hair feeling clean! No squeaky clean feeling - more like a thick oily mess. Never again!!!</li>
    <li> I noticed that my hair was going thin. So I was seeking for a chemical free shampoo. Then I saw an advertisement of this product. I purchased this shampoo and used regularly. Day by day my hair fall was reduced and now there is an increase in quantity of my hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Smells horrid, too!</li>
    <li> This product WORKS. My hair is stronger and healthier than its ever been and my thin spots are filling in. Besides that I love the fact that its organic and safe for my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s great to find a hair recovery shampoo that&#x27;s sulfate-free. Smells awesome, too! I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> All Natural Ingredients made me feel good about trying this brand of hair growth shampoo. All good ingredients inside to make you feel like you are doing the right thing to help the hair loss condition, naturally - I mean pomegranate and avocado are in this, so it&#x27;s worth it! Not a whole lot of lather, but i don&#x27;t really want parabens and all the unnatural &amp;#34;bad for you things&amp;#34; that aren&#x27;t healthy to use, in this type of shampoo treatment.  Not filled with chemicals. Smells great! I feel healthier using this product on my head rather than some out there on the market.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I am so glad that this stopped my hair from falling out before it got any worse than it already is. As a person without your hair you just feel a void in your life and you lose comfidence in your appearance and in yourself when something this drastic changes your appearance at once. I am so happy that I can stop worrying about losing my hair and worry about other things.</li>
    <li> I have used this often for the past couple of weeks. I am already noticing a difference with I the thickness if my hair and even less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; stray hairs that seem like they never grow. I feel great knowing their are organic ingredients, rather having some random chemicals I have never heard of! It smells pretty good, and does the job! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Is this the next step of technology? I&#x27;ve been using this for a 3 months now, and it&#x27;s certainly working. I massage my hair with this every other day, and it&#x27;s so refreshing. It soothes my head and I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is a lot thicker now. I can&#x27;t wait to see how this product will be in 6 months. The price may be a little steep, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. My brother noticed that his hair was thinning, and he is in his mid-twenties. This shampoo is great. It truly makes his hair look fuller, and he has said that this is the best hair for thinning shampoo he has used. It also has a nice scent to it. The shampoo does make the hair a little brittle, so my brother often alternates it with another shampoo. We have purchased this twice now. However, the price we originally bought it at was $50 (when the product had like 8 reviews), but it seems to be just skyrocketing since then. It is a good product, but with the new pricing we are very reluctant to buy it again. It is great, but we haven&#x27;t seen any regrowth or anything like that which would make it worth paying the continuously rising pricing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo delivered its promises. I do not wash my hair everyday so it took about 6 washes to see a significant difference. However, my scalp produces a lot of oil, and this shampoo only made my hair look greasier. My solution to that problem was to wash my hair with my regular shampoo (only once per wash), and then let Phytoworx sit on my scalp for about 5 minutes not three. I figured why not let it work for a little longer! It does have a bit of a smell, kind of mediciny, but you get used to it once you see such good results.  Another drawback is that you have to use a lot of it to cover the scalp well since it does not lather, and at $50 a bottle it can be painful to my wallet, but again, it works so well that I&#x27;m overlooking that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone losing hair should buy this product. I just bought  2 more bottles, one for me and one for my friend.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Really works if you are dealing with thinning hair. Noticed results right away!</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE this stuff! It smells so good and it leaves my hair feeling super soft and thick.This product works great without leaving an excessive tingling feeling like other shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried. I was hesitant to purchase this item because of the price tag, but it is definitely worth it and I&#x27;ll be buying it again because I keep seeing results.</li>
    <li> It simply works. Was sceptical about this product at first, but as soon as few used felt the results. The scalp feels clean and hairs intact.</li>
    <li> Great organic natural shampoo. Leaves hair silky smooth after the first use. Give this shampoo time to work and you will be happy you tried this. Stay away from anything containing SLS if you want to keep your hair!</li>
    <li> Fast and easy transaction! Need to wait to see results of product so 2 weeks using it my hair looks and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> i have been using it for a week, and so far so good. i think my hair loss decrised, but it smells awful, so i have to wash my hair again by using another shampoo. Overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend, It is amazing! I saw improvements after a few days! I tried it a few times too and I feel a fuller healthier head. It is all natural containing stem cells from a special Swiss apple and has tea tree, coconut and eucalyptus oil that makes it smell superb! It doesn&#x27;t foam as much because it lacks SLS and other ingredients that are known to lather and make us think they are cleaning us more. Just make sure leave it on your head a couple minutes. It makes your scalp feel soft and hydrated and greatly reduces shedding.</li>
    <li> This Phytoworx hair loss shampoo is amazing stuff. I have struggled with hair loss for several years, and up until this product, I had experienced very minimal results at best from other products. This is by no means a cure-all quick-fix for hair loss, but for those willing to use it diligently and patiently, results seem very likely (at least that is my experience). It seems to take effect after a couple weeks of use. I am noticing more resilience and strength in my hair with daily use. Massaging it into the scalp and letting it sit for a few minutes before rinsing out, like a conditioner, allowing it to really work the magic of its organic ingredients. Like the title says, this should be seen as a medicinal treatment and not just a simple shampoo. Give it time and it seems to be a wonderful product for scalp and hair rejuvenation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other details: pleasant scent, nothing sickly or too perfumed. Comfortably aromatic for both males and females.</li>
    <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
    <li> The Phytoworx Organic Hairloss shampoo is a fantastic product. I really love that the ingredients are all natural and it smells SO good! I feel like the texture, volume, and growth of my hair have definitely improved after using this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t foam too much so I recommend adding a drop of another shampoo to spread throughout your scalp. My hair loss started after dying my hair, but this product has helped bring it back to its original, natural state. I am very happy with this product and recommend it to anyone with excessive hair loss!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a Godsend. It smells absolutely wonderful it&#x27;s rich and creamy formula make it easy to use a small portion for Max effects. After using the shampoo I noticed my hair follicles being cleansed well (tingly sensation) my hair feels 100% better soft and manageable. I notice growth starting around my problem areas my edges ....I will purchase this again. Well worth the money. A great product overall.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders on my hair!  I have almost finished the bottle in 2 months time and my hair is as thick as my little pomeranians!  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> When I started using this product I was wondering how well it would actually work. I didn&#x27;t notice an immediate difference but after about two weeks of using it I did notice a difference in the texture and strength of my hair. The texture was more smooth, had less split ends and each strand was much thicker and harder to break when I pulled on it.  My hair always comes out in the shower when I comb it through but after using this product I barely saw any hairs left in the shower. I have used similar products in the past that claim to do the same thing but did not do it as well as this shampoo did. I would recommend this product to people with brittle, weak and dull hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a great addition to other Phytoworx products.  Leaves hair feeling clean and full.  So relieved to have found this brand.  My hair is stronger and healthier than it has been in years.</li>
    <li> my hair has never felt so  full. The fact that it is organic makes me very happy. I have used products in the past that have not worked or made my head all greasy, it is on the expensive side but you will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I wish PhytoWorx Organic Hair Loss Shampooo  was available 10 years ago. It does not leave your hair strivled up and brittle but  nourishes it and leave it feeling rejuvenated.  The smell is out of this world. The best thing about this product is that it does  wondered to her preventing breakages and fall outs.Making hair thick and Lushes and on top of all its glory its  all natural. I have seen improvements in not only my wife her but also mine. It definitely worth the money. So give it a try</li>
    <li> Phytoworx is a hair recovery Shampoo with plant stem cells from Malus Domestica, derived from Swiss Apples. While all of this sounds a little different than most hair thickening shampoos, it is different! This is an organic, no Sulphates, no chemical thickening shampoo. I like the fact that I am not using chemicals to help my hair look and feel thick. This is not a product for hair growth. Instead, I didn&#x27;t have hair loss when I shampooed and I noticed a big effect on how my hair looked and felt after two shampoos! It doesn&#x27;t lather a lot because it is organic, but your hair will look and feel thicker and healthier. I also take Biotin supplements and B vitamins. You will like this product!</li>
    <li> The shampoo really works! Not only did it make my hair fuller and add an overall thickness, it also improved the quality and overall shine to my hair that I have never seen in hair loss products. It&#x27;s a triple threat! What I find most appealing is knowing that the shampoo is made of all natural, organic ingredients which not only prevents hair loss, but also improves overall quality of your hair. It also claims that it is free of harsh chemicals so you can feel good about using a healthy amount per wash. In addition, the stem cells that is added in the shampoo work to thicken hair and stimulate hair follicles.I will definitely be using this product for years to come!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I am very ingredient conscious. I have fine thin hair and I am constantly trying new treatments ranging from shampoos to vitamins to try and get my hair to grow longer. I really like that this shampoo is sulfate and paraben free. The ingredients are very natural and do not alarm me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product it is very light. It makes my hair feel healthy and does not weigh it down. My hair dryness has improved since I started using this about 2 weeks ago. I will definitely be using this product again!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 4 weeks and it is working. Less hair lost in my clothes and while taking a shower.</li>
    <li> Had to return due to quality problem. Looks like conditioner not shampoo. No soap component</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome!  I was hesitant about buying it because it is a bit out of my price range.  But the price is worth the end result.  My hair was very thin and continuously falling out.  I started using this product and felt an immediate difference.  My hair felt heavy - like it was retaining moisture.  My husband actually joked about it because he could see the difference after the first shampoo.  I did not use a conditioner at all.  The shampoo conditioned my hair more than enough.  So the next day I used it again.  I think that was a mistake because my hair was oily at that point.  So I started using the shampoo only three to four times per week. I would use it on Monday and then on Tuesday I would just rinse my hair with plain water in the shower.  My hair looks like I got a perm and it is very shiny and silky.  My co-workers asked me the first week of my using this product what I had changed because I had a whole new look!  So I will continue to use this product. I have been using it now for going on three weeks.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything more, really. it worked, what else is there to say?&lt;br /&gt;simple to use, as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple month now and i can say it does work. But i had to wait 1-2 month until it reduced my hair loss. I can definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Stopped my hair loss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phytoworx is wonderful. I have been using it for a while now and it has been great to me. I was having really bad hair loss and no matter what I tried they never worked so I decided to try this as my last resort when it should have been my first one. Within a short amount of time the hair loss was stopped and as I continued using it I noticed that my hair was indeed growing again. Thank you Phytoworx!!!</li>
    <li> Since my teenage I was suffering from hair loss. I tried several natural shampoos. Even I took several treatments. But it could not get the satisfying result. Then my neighbor recommended this product. I want to really thank her because it stopped by hair fall. this organic shampoo worked out well.</li>
    <li> It works almost too good, I have long hair and this shampoo saved it from bieng COMPLETELY gone, now I use it all the time and Strongly recommend this to anyone with hair loss problems!. Five Stars from me !!</li>
    <li> Due to my recent hair loss, I was once again looking for a quality shampoo that would give me back my full, long hair. This shampoo did just that and more. It is much better than other cheap chemical filled products. You really get what you pay for. I love that it is organic and integrates plant stem cells, a very gentle formula. It has left my hair feeling amazingly soft and easy to manage not to mention my hair is thicker and longer than it has been in years!</li>
    <li> Phytoworx Organic hair loss shampoo delivers a great result from the get go.  My experiences in the past with shampoos with minoxidil ingredients has shown small if any improvement of hair thickening or recovery.  Phytoworx has a unique use of Swiss Apple and fruit stem cells which can be noticed from the first three applications of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spoken with many science people in biology and they agree with the use of such natural and organic stem cell extractions for improving hair recovery and loss of hair from the base root or follicle.  Including the wonderful sent of the shampoo without any chemical smells after showering keeps a smile on my face while knowing this stuff is working.  Organic is such a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend anyone with thinning hair or loss of hair needing recovery to give Phytoworx a try for a few weeks. This can bring your hair into the new way of hair restoration, recovery and thickening benefits  - Troy</li>
    <li> Great shampoo to use. It has all the essential ingredients to give you thicker hair.This shampoo high definition is geared towards anyone with hair loss. Leaves your hair silky and also takes care of the strength of the hair follicles. product is worth the cost and is capable of doing what it says it does. This product is just simply amazing and one of the best on the market!</li>
    <li> Have to say I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;ve been using this product now for almost 4 months. About a month ago I actually began to notice tiny hairs beginning to grow on my bald batch! More and more of these hairs have begun to crop up and they seem to be darkening and thickening as well! I will be posting another update in 1 month but the results so far a very promising. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I went in as a skeptic but much to my surprise I was blown away by its results. If you have thinning hair or even a family history of thinning hair, this product is for YOU!! It works wonders! I noticed almost immediate results after only about 2 weeks of use. I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I had some health problems and I started to lose my hair. Because of my health issues I had to completely change my diet which also included tons of products I was using. Unfortunately my hair never came back fully as I would&#x27;ve liked and I started trying various products to see if anything would help. A friend told me about this new product and I figured it was worth a try. Within a few weeks I started to notice little baby hairs sprouting up in my hairline. I was super excited. I love the fact that this product is sulfate free and organic. I will definitely keep using this product. It also smells great too. I am pleasantly surprised and hopeful.</li>
    <li> My mother was suffering from dramatic hair loss.. She would complain about how she was losing too much hair in shower...so I purchased PhytoWorx shampoo for her. SHE LOVES IT! She loves that it is made with all natural ingredients. She tries to stick with the least amount of chemicals because chemicals can hinder hair growth. She also loves the smell and texture of this shampoo. She said she has been applying the shampoo to the more troublesome spots. In about a month or so she said her hair felt thicker and stronger and could see the hairs coming in! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with similar hair loss. I know my mother is a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I am taking the phytoworx supplement and now i am combining it with this shampoo and i can say that it works better and faster, it is a really good complement, now my hair is longer, fuller and stopped falling out.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how great this product works. I would definitely recommend it. It does exactly as described and I am extremely happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos for hair loss and none of them could ever compare to Phytoworx Organic shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Other shampoos would leave me feeling like a dog with my hair shedding so much I have not had that problem with this shampoo. I&#x27;ve noticed a pretty big change in my hair growth, within just a few short weeks, fuller healthier more vibrant hair glow. I love the fact that the shampoo is all organic with no harm full chemicals and or additives. Made from Rare Plant Stem Cells and other organic products is great, and it being made in the USA is a big plus to me!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my dad who was experiencing hair loss and hair thinning due to age. He has been using it as directed and has been quite happy with the results. He said it lathers sort of like a conditioner. We both notice a fuller head of hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> After months of looking and trying new methods from pills to shampoos and oils I&#x27;ve finally found this product. It work amazingly and only after a few washes. Is I get older I noticed my hair getting thinner and harder to manage. Best this is that it is organic so there is no harsh chemicals. In also prone to dandruff and it was cleared in a couple days. After a few weeks my hair feels like it did when I was younger, thick and voluminous. When brushing my hair out I also noticed there was a lot less shedding and breakage. Great product.</li>
    <li> Most of the positive reviews are FAKE! Most of the positive reviewers are fake accounts that artificially boost the rating. Look at the other reviews most of these people made...they are only positive reviews for hair loss products. I smell a scam.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because i can not stress how much i love organic products. The natural ingredients used in the shampoo made me feel good about putting it into my head. As for the results, my shedding stopped completely. I do value the shampoo and looking forward to future purchases. I know everyone has different skin and hair textures and the results can very. But the shedding stopped, and I actually liked that it left my hair somewhat shiny. It was very brittle/tough and dry. The plant stem cells left my hair soft and stronger. will be buying more when i run out.</li>
    <li> I found this product to do as described and beyond. My skin tingled from the product slightly but in a good way. The oder was pleasant as well unlike some products.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from thinning hair or even losing your hair and haven&#x27;t had success with other products that promise miracle results than give PhytoWorx a try, I can guarentee you will never go back. PhytoWorx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo is designed to increase hair regrowth and thicken pre-existent hair. They use plant stem cells (Malus Domestica) which is found in only the rarest Switzerland plant stem cells and essential oils such as peppermint, eucalyptus, and rosemary to improve scalp condition and end the struggles of hair loss. Best part, it&#x27;s all natural and sulfate free.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and have tried many products to create an illusion of being thick but the temporary quick fixes keep me on the search for what really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After your first shampoo with Phytoworx, you actually see results!  My hair feels heavier and looks healthier!  My brush is no longer full of shedding hair.  It is the only shampoo I have seen with plant stem cells.  The combination of the plant stem cells and the essential oils seems to be the key in stimulating growth I can visually see.  I find my self looking in the mirror continually looking for new hairs.  I&#x27;m really happy with the shampoo and really thankful to find something that really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thinning hair it is your go to shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good organic hair loss shampoo and I have finally found it ! After using this product I almost immediately saw results ! My hair has never been thicker or as long as it is now! I am so very pleased that I found an organic hair product that will not harm me and doesn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals that normal shampoos have ! I am very pleased with this product and I will be sure to continue to use this organic shampoo and will continue to recommend it to everyone I know !! Amazing product with absolutely amazing results !!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo about 4 weeks ago , for a while now I have been searching for a good organic shampoo to use because of my hair loss after reading the  reviews of other i decided to go for it and purchase it and wow im amazed of how well this shampoo works personally no the best smelling but within 3 weeks i started noticing the difference hardly any hair loss and my hair is much more thicker, stronger and healthier looking i would recommended to anyone with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Due to my recent hair thinning I was searching for a good shampoo that would give me back my full, luscious hair. This shampoo did just that and more. It is much better than other cheap chemical filled products. You really get what you pay for. I love that it is organic and integrates plant stem cells. It has left my hair feeling amazingly soft and easy to manage not to mention my hair is thicker and longer than it has been in years.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very effective.  My hair stopped shedding and it really is clean and shiny and soft. And, it is organic. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got the product after reading some reviews. It works great. My hair started to grow better than it was before. I&#x27;ve only used it for only a week and started to notice the difference. Well packaged and smells good.</li>
    <li> I really love this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, but is a mix of natural ingredients that perform the same desired effect. It smells terrific for men or women and has very nice packaging. Their is ample product that lasts a long time. Don&#x27;t be dissuaded when you don&#x27;t get a huge lather; the package even says it won&#x27;t produce one. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working; it is! My hair feels thicker and healthier after just under a week. This is a superior product to others on the market and I&#x27;m really glad I found it. It was recommended by a friend.</li>
    <li> I believe it is working well. I have added biotin, fish oil, a good multivitamin and (DE) diatomaceous earth food grade into the mix. My hair seems to be growing very fast and I believe the hair product is working as it promised (though I had my doubts). I use this as a conditioner instead of a shampoo. Otherwise my hair looks oily.</li>
    <li> After purchasing Phytoworx Hair Recovery and Regrowth Supplements I decided to combine it with Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo and .....Surprise,Surprise,Surprise! Not only has my receding hairline grown back, but my hair is more fuller and thicker. Not to mention my hair is more managiable when I comb and brush it. The days of tangled, kinky hair is long gone, I look and feel like I did in High School! This organic product has no sulfate! I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone who suffers hair loss, it&#x27;s one of the smartest purchase&#x27;s I&#x27;ve made and I have another bottle being shipped to me by the end of the week.</li>
    <li> This product works like no other! The shampoo has helped with all the damage that has been done by dyeing too much. If you think you have gotten to the point of no return then this is the answer for you! I noticed a difference in my hair in less than a week and I expect it to be back to full volume in no time. I love that it is organic! I don’t have to worry about all the chemicals damaging my hair even more.  I plan on purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several products from phytoworx. They package all their goods extremely well and ship promptly. Plus it&#x27;s an American company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this shampoo and see a difference. You might need to use another shampoo if you want it to lather up, but use this one afterwords to get the organic effect.</li>
    <li> I am a female who has lost a lot of hair. I have always been embarrassed at how thin and patchy my hair has been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a miracle! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little bit over 2 weeks, and I already notice a huge difference. My hair feels fuller and a lot stronger. My hair loss has also cut down significantly, which makes me feel more comfortable about my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product works like no other! The shampoo has helped with all the damage that has been done by dyeing too much. If you think you have gotten to the point of no return then this is the answer for you! I noticed a difference in my hair in less than a week and I expect it to be back to full volume in no time. This is the best way to get the results you are looking for and use a product that is healthy for your body instead of using all the chemicals that do further damage. I plan on purchasing this for a family member that is having the same problem!</li>
    <li> I wasted money. All the 5 star reviews are not real buyers!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who&#x27;s hair is thinning and his receding hair line is starting to go back even further. He&#x27;s super excited about the results. He&#x27;s only been using for a couple weeks now, but already we can both tell that his hair is getting thicker. So we cant wait to see new growth up front where the hair line was receding. The bottle being fifty dollars was kind of worrisome, but the fact that it is completely organic and sulfate free is definitely worth the price. We have been looking for something that would WORK without having the harsh chemicals that most hair loss products have. My hair is long and strong already, but I may have to buy another bottle for myself, just to make sure it stays that way and maybe help it grow another few inches! I definitely recommend it if you are on the fence about it.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have to get use to yet.  The climate in my winter home is very different from the climate in my summer home and I haven&#x27;t had time to see what it can do yet.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s simple to use and it feels like my hair is thicker and you can see alot of smaill hair on the front part of my scal;</li>
    <li> Until now I&#x27;d only heard about plant stem cells being used for cancer treatments like Paclitaxel, but after doing some research and purchasing this shampoo, I&#x27;m astonished to see that they can have myriad positive health effects, particularly in hair loss prevention and even regrowth. I&#x27;m pretty young to be balding, but hair, like most of our looks, is just one of those things that&#x27;s luck of the draw. I&#x27;m the kind of person who tends to shy away from prescription medications (particularly for something cosmetic) if there are natural alternatives, and so far I&#x27;ve been extremely satisfied with this shampoo. You can tell it&#x27;s not your typical shampoo by its distinctive texture and smell. I like to leave it in my hair for a few minutes before rinsing it out to give the stem cells and essential oils the maximum chance of helping out my hair. I&#x27;d taken to wearing a lot of hats over the past few months to avoid the awkward whispers (did you see Chris already has a bald spot? Jeez...), but after this shampoo, I think I&#x27;m ready to go bare once more. NOTE: This is a SULFATE-FREE shampoo so it won&#x27;t lather with suds nearly as much as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoos. Sulfates are found in most cleaning products and are responsible for most of the suds that they generate. BUT sulfates have been shown to damage sensitive hair, lessen the effect of dyes, and, according to some people, could even be carcinogenic. So a lot of the higher-end companies are taking them out of their products. Just because this shampoo may behave differently from your every day Head &amp; Shoulders, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not doing its job.</li>
    <li> The choice is clear when picking this product. Great Natural Solution to hair loss. By far the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> I purchased this not so much for the hair restoration, but for something that is natural. The shampoo itself is a little watery and comes out of the bottle quick, but I see this a good attribute for when the bottle becomes empty. The scent is not overpowering and allows for you to wear scents such a cologne without having to worry about the smells mixing. My hair feels nice and smooth after washing it for the 3 minutes that are recommended to allow the shampoo to be absorbed. It is made in the United States which is something that I prefer when looking for a product.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st organic hair product I&#x27;ve  tried  &amp;  most likely  will ever try .My hair is noticeably thicker  with an expected bonus-it looks bouncy .Before I tried  this my hair was flat &amp; thinning  out . I&#x27;m happy I bought Phytowork .It really is worth  the  extra money . I guess  it costs  more because of the ingredients put together  to make it work .</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome!  I am so much happier with my hair.  It is fuller and softer and smells great!  I am so happy to find a good working hair loss shampoo that is also organic!  Usually I have trouble with natural shampoos but this one rinses clean with no residue.  My hair is hardly shedding just after using one bottle.  Before I was losing so much hair daily and it&#x27;s hardly an issue now.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I’ve noticed that I had been shedding a bit more than normal lately. I used to grow hair like crazy and I’d have so much hair, but it was thinning out a bit. I guess I just got a little paranoid that it might be starting to fall out so I looked for a product that would help with the shedding. I knew I wanted to get something organic because I’ve watched the documentary ‘Chemercial’ and so I know how bad the ingredients in conventional hygiene products can be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this shampoo and now my hair looks so thick, luxurious, shiny and it actually has more body than before. And the shedding is dramatically reduced. I’m thrilled! I mean, it’s just SO HEALTHY looking it’s unbelievable! This is now my new favorite shampoo! It smells great, works great and it&#x27;s organic, so what’s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the cost of this product is worth it. Products with organic ingredients cost more to make, plus you have to factor in the cost of research &amp; development. You’re making an investment in your health when using organic products over conventional ones. Watch ‘Chemercial’ to see what I’m talking about and why organic, natural products are truly the way to go. The sulfates, propylene glycol, and other crap that they put in regular shampoos cause damage to your hair and to your body. Trust me, this is a fantastic shampoo that you can feel good about using because it won’t cause damage to you or the environment.</li>
    <li> Thin hair has always been a problem for me. I have tried many hairless products hoping something would work, but saw little results. One day Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo came up in my suggested products. Although I was skeptical I gave it a shot, and boy I&#x27;m glad I did! My hair is so full and thick now. I can&#x27;t believe the transformation my hair made, and I love that it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients unlike other brands. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo if you want to use for hair growth and hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of hair loss when I take a shower, but I don&#x27;t think as much hair falls out using this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are looking for a shampoo with sulfate that might make you feel like your hair is &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; this is not the product for you. It still makes your hair feel clean but it does not lather up. I do think that a little more product is needed since it does not lather, however, this can be used only on the scalp area so that would reduce the product usage.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, hair loss is a definite GO on this product and hair recovery and regrowth I would have to use longer to say about it, however, it does not make my hair feel dry so it feels like my hair is recovering from the damage done by the heat products.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> Great product it really rejuvenates your hair. Great for anyone losing the hair or their hair is beginning to thin.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! After using it for a few weeks I have already began to see results!! This product is also awesome because it is organic. There is absolutely no SLS or chemicals! I can feel the results! My hair is already feeling more full and soft. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair and trouble with shedding. My hair is now already becoming thicker and the shedding has been cut down to a normal level. In addition the dispenser is a push top and helps you pour the right amount without too much coming out at once. This product is absolutely amazing and I would recommend this product to anyone who struggles with hair loss or thin hair!</li>
    <li> This shampoo not only smells great, it feels amazing too! It reminds of tea tree shampoo, but with the added benefit of reducing hair loss!  I have definitely noticed less hair coming out every time I shower.  This is worth a try for sure!</li>
    <li> I remember the 80&#x27;s and my long curly locks that I never cut which I finally did a few years ago with tears in my eyes due to my thinning hair.  A pony tail is nice but when you start to look like a Hari Chrisna then it&#x27;s time for a change.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on the recommendation of a friend who graciously bought me my first bottle and I was amazed to see new hair growth in places where I had given up hope.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also seeing less hair going down the drain, and starting to experience a rejuvenation and the bald spot that made me cut off my long hair is steadily experiencing new and thicker hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also extremely pleased with the non toxic ingredients, and the one thing I don&#x27;t really like is the lack of lather but the problem is easily solved by using a nice conditioner in addition to the Phytoworx.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 4th bottle and well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone wishing to recapture their youth and keep on rockin!!!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a decrease in hair loss, but no noticeable regrowth. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather and has a bit of a strange odor to it. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem clean after I use this so I sometimes alternate and use another shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a while ago I just haven&#x27;t had the time to review it, but It is a great product! I recommended it to everyone I know! It almost felt like it stopped the hair loss instantaneously. It is made from organic materials,you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> So, this Phytoworx shampoo is my favorite for my hair. It ships very quickly when I need more from them so I do not run out. The product comes as pictured, and is great for anyone who would like to thicken their hair (has Malus Domestica in it, which are stem cells from a swiss apple that have shown to thicken hair). There is a lot of shampoo in the bottle as well which is a plus for the amount of money spent. Use it as directed, and you will always be happy with the results! What have you got to lose?! Not hair!</li>
    <li> For the last 8 or 9 years I have spent thousands on hair loss products.  I even went to Hair Club for 6 months.  I started using Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo and Phytoworx Hair Regrowth Supplement about 2 months ago.  Nothing has worked like this.  I don&#x27;t have a head full of hair but I definitely am seeing new hair coming in.  I also use hair fibers to mask my hair loss and I am using less and less.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone suffering hair loss.</li>
    <li> Well let me tell you, I never thought I would be one to order hair regrowth shampoo... but my father has been slowly going bald over the last few years so I decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to drop 50$ to see if it worked. Within the first week we already started to see some new little hairs pop up and instantly proceeded to order another bottle. I&#x27;m not sure if this will work for everyone but, it worked for my dad. He also said the smell wasn&#x27;t his favorite but I believe that is more of a personal thing. Long story short, it has worked for the most part and he will continue to use this until the positive results stop.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair seemed to be getting thinner and losing volume so I ordered this product after seeing all of the 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been fantastic!! After 5 weeks of use I noticed that my hair loss has been dramatically reduced and my hair is not only thicker, but healthier looking. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with this product, it works!</li>
    <li> Very good and very expensive.</li>
    <li> awesome shampoo for controlling my stubborn hair, but as far as the regrow part I don&#x27;t see any difference in that so far. still on my first bottle though. its expensive especially for how small the bottle is but if I was seeing hair growing in I would have no problem paying twice as much. I want to start taking pictures so that I can track my hair loss better. ill repost after using up the third bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My excuse is going to be much different than that of others.  I have short hair that is finer than that of most African Americans. I look for products that can make my hair stronger and fuller, especially being that it is short/close to my scalp.  This product does a great job of cleaning and stimulating my scalp. The later is that my hair seems to be gaining a thicker, fuller and more manageable texture to it.  Also, it is great that my guy loves the sent of my hair after washing. I recommend this product if you are looking to have stronger and fuller hair.  Even with a short crop cut, I can tell the difference after only a few shampoos.</li>
    <li> This Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo with plant stem cells is great I have been using this product for about a month and this shampoo is great. It has stopped my hair loss. I like the way it smells. The cost is a little high but it is worth every dime. It really make my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from hair loss problem and I consulted many dermatologist and beauticians. No one solved my problem. Then one of my colleagues suggested me this product. When I started to use I had a doubt whether it will be working out or not. But within two months I was surprised with the result. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from hair loss problem for more than 1 year. I was seeking for the best product which could offer me a good solution for my problem. Then my friend suggested me this product. I really love this product as it worked out since my first use. I do recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from amazon several months back. During this first month I could not feel any changes. But later on my hair fall started to reduce gradually. Even with small quantity it is working out well. The cost of this shampoo is also not too high. Thanks to amazon and Phytoworx.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells nice. U can actually feel it working as it lathers. The mild tingly sensation nicely demonstrates the beginning process on new hair growth. It&#x27;s cool, crisp and refreshing. Absolutely the best hair medicine so to speak, for the scalp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect shampoo for my hair for YEARS, and I finally found it! I noticed my hair completely stopped &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; in the shower. The last couple of years after every shower I would have a clump of hair at the drain, and my hair was thinning and damaged. This amazing organic shampoo has completely 100% stopped that, and even made my hair feel healthier and brand new! The price of this product is worth every penny if not more. Leaves my hair light weight as well and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it feel oily. 5 stars from this girl! If you are struggling with hair loss, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else.</li>
    <li> this shampoo works like a shampoo/conditioner/ leave-in conditioner all put in one bottle! i use by itself most of the time. the days I do i let my very curly/ extremely frizzy hair dry and it looks very soft and moistened as if i moussed it up very much when i didn&#x27;t have to use anything at all! which i&#x27;ve never done b/c my hair is so frizzy i constantly buy leave-in conditioners but with this product i barely use anything else. and it HAS helped get rid of the hair thinning problem i was having (many people noticed too).</li>
    <li> So, I got this one for my wife after she started using some of my shampoo. She was really worried that her hair was shedding a lot more than usual, and I have to say that so far its definitely slowed the shedding. We&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half now, and I&#x27;ve had a solid three weeks of not really having to worry about cleaning out the shower drain every couple of days. It generally leaves her hair feeling clean and smooth, and I can wash her hair without my hands being tangled up with hair. It smells a lot better than my shampoo, and it gives her that extra bit of femininity which really helps. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and so is my wife.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo here on amazon to give it a try after trying other shampoos that didn&#x27;t really work for me. I have been using this shampoo for a week now and I can feel a difference in my hair it feels fuller and thicker. I am really glad that I gave it a try and the fact that its organic is a plus!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true. In men, losing cranial hair is hereditary. My father, a heavy smoker, reached 50 and he has lost his hair to a great degree that he had to constantly wear a cap to avoid the embarrassment of showing his hair shedding. The truth is, your body and facial features can make you look younger than you really are, but the hair loss is just too immediately apparent to ignore. It&#x27;s definitely a sore issue for a lot of men and possibly even women. The fact that this Phytoworx Shampoo contains plant stem cells from Switzerland, along with other essential plant-based oils, such as Peppermint and Tea Tree leaves, makes the treating method really effective in reducing hair loss. It gives the hair some apparent shine, which looks more natural and healthy. I have observed that the results would show in about 4 to 6 weeks. The hair shaft definitely becomes much thicker and fuller, but not dry or unruly. The scalp is healthier, and in tip-top condition now. I would say that the product works amazingly well to accelerate hair growth in the right, natural method with the use of organic ingredients. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! I am in love with this shampoo!!! Ive always heard of stem cells but I did not know how great plant stem cells can help to improve health and hair growth. If you have any issues with loss of hair...PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Hasnt helped me at all</li>
    <li> My hairline is receding and I already have thin hair. After trying many other products such as Revivogen, Nioxin and other products, I needed something that would give me the results I need and this product gave me those results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is totally organic and harnesses it uses some of nature&#x27;s most powerful ingredients that I am knowledgable about, so I didn&#x27;t have to do much research. After only 1 week, the amount of hair shedding reduced drastically! I am so thrilled to be using this product and I am so happy I was recommended it!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle, and worth every penny! This shampoo is so great to use in my daily routine, and I love the smell. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but I can already see and feel a definite improvement in the growth of my hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that not only helps stimulate growth, but also help thicken and revitalize your hair, PhytoWorx is the shampoo to purchase. Don&#x27;t be deterred by the price, because the results are absolutely worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 39 year old man who is getting a bald spot. Phytoworks has been helping my situation. The stem cells are what sold me on this purchase. It smells pleasant (not like some I&#x27;ve tried that smells horrible. Don&#x27;t expect much suds because it doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoo, so take your time and work it in. My hair feels nice and natural. I&#x27;m seeing encouraging results after a week of use. I followed the instructions to the letter as I don&#x27;t want to waste my money. I like that its all organic. Give it a try, I glad I did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic so I decided to give it to my dad for a try, and he had no regrets at all.. He was skeptical at first, thinking he would would lose the rest of his hair but after he started using Phytoworx his hair loss has reduced and has instead started to regrow. The shampoo is kind and gentle to his scalp and he has an easy time using it. He hasn&#x27;t had any negative side effects so far and It was worth buying this shampoo. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a permanent solution to hair loss.</li>
    <li> I just purchased a bottle of the Hair Recovery Shampoo from Phyto Worx. I&#x27;ve been noticing excessive hair shedding when I wash or comb my hair and have been looking for products to help lessen my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PhytoWorx shampoo is SLS-free, so although it doesn&#x27;t lather up like regular shampoo, it is free from harsh chemicals which can damage your hair. The hair loss shampoo gently cleanses your hair without stripping the natural moisture from your hair and scalp which can lead to frizzy hair and/or a dry and itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this shampoo on a regular basis, you will start to notice less hair loss when you shampoo and/or brush your hair. The organic formula contains a variety of gently ingredients including aloe vera juice, coconut oil, safflower oil, green tea extract cucumber extract  and lavender oil.</li>
    <li> 5 Star Rating for this outstanding product. This product smells great and works wonderfully I have noticed thickening in the top of my head in just a matter of days. And there is no build up left from it like I have noticed with other products.&lt;br /&gt;What I liked most about this product is the smell, look and feel of it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is loosing hair and need excellent regrow product they can trust.</li>
    <li> Expensive and a week and a half later no hair growth. Wast of $60 bucks for me. : (</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as expected. It was professionally packaged as to make sure nothing leaked and the bottle didn&#x27;t crack. The shampoo itself smells great which is a nice bonus! I can&#x27;t wait for results.</li>
    <li> New hair has been growing and i just have used it for one month ill let u guys if it improves or if it is just my idea</li>
    <li> WOW. what a product! With many different products on the market, its sometimes to difficult to figure out which one is actually worthwhile for Hair Loss treatment and Phytoworx is as good as it gets. A really easy to use product that you&#x27;ll see results with quickly! Would refer others to this great product!</li>
    <li> I did not like this shampoo. Left my hair greasy and my scalp very very itchy.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product uses organic ingredients because I don&#x27;t have to worry about other harmful ingredients that I have not heard about. Keep in mind that since this product is for hair loss, to refrain from using on body parts that you don&#x27;t want to have extra/thicker hair. What is also great about this product is the price! most hair loss products can be expensive but I was lucky enough to buy this one for about 50$ Being able to use this in the shower as a regular shampoo rather than having a difficult long process of applying it on!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I battle hair loss on near my forehead. The Phytoworx Organic Shampoo has a distinctive clean smell to it. The shampoo does not require a lot of product to work. I used a quarter sized amount of shampoo on my short hair. The shampoo does not lather, it does not foam, but that does not mean it is not cleaning. The shampoo left my hair soft and noticeably fuller after rinsing and this was after one wash. I will continue to use this product, as it keeps my hair feeling soft and supple and fuller with bounce.</li>
    <li> I bought Phytoworx hair loss shampoo at a salon and I&#x27;ve got to say that this is one of the best hair loss shampoos out there. I started using it when i noticed my receding hairline. After a few uses i started noticing amazing results. The shampoo smells great unlike others i have used in the past. Overall, i would use this again and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Being as young as I am, I wanted something that could help to restore my hair growth and replace the lost hair. I didn&#x27;t want to look old before my time, but I wanted something more natural as well. Thanks to this amazing product, my hair is not only thicker, but it is also stronger as well. Instead of being worried about any bald spots, I can sit back and enjoy the soft, luxurious hair that I now have. I will continue to order this product and watch as the results keep coming my way. Definitely give it a try if you need something to help rejuvenate your hair.</li>
    <li> Out of everything I have used for my hair. This is the best product that I have used by far. I recommend this to all of you!!!!1</li>
    <li> this product is great i have actually used it in the past a number of times and just restocking now, this&lt;br /&gt;item has a great scent that leaves a lasting impression. it is very soothing to the scalp because of its&lt;br /&gt;ingredients tea tree is like aromatherapy and the active ingredients goes to work improving the life and&lt;br /&gt;look of your hair. nothing happens overnight but when it does u sure can notice</li>
    <li> I am so glad I decided to give this shampoo a try! Thinning hair is something no one wants to experience, so I decided to look for something natural that would give good results. I chose Phytoworx because it is organic and a great price compared to other hair loss shampoos/treatments. My hair feels fantastic,rejuvenated, healthy, thicker, fuller, and smoother! The amount of shedding has stopped tremendously! I will continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone struggling with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> i internally bought this for.my husband. Hes a carpenter that needs to.wear his hard hats.I noticed his hair was thinning out over the years do to the heat. So far his hair his starting to get full. It has a good smell and it organic.</li>
    <li> After struggling with finding an organic product that would help resolve my hair loss issue, I came across this shampoo. While I was skeptical of the success, the reviews seemed supportive, so I was willing to try. I must say that my hair is dramatically fuller than before. The shampoo lathers well, but not too thick so it&#x27;s easily spread over the hair and scalp (where my hair is missing). It is scented, and while I&#x27;m not a huge fan of having my head smell like florals or the ocean breeze, the scent doesn&#x27;t remain after the product is rinsed away. Rather, I&#x27;m left with hair that is moisturized and thicker. I&#x27;m still new to the product and will continue using it, but the results thus far have been favorable.</li>
    <li> I am beyond happy with my order from Phytoworx. I bought their Organic Hair Loss Shampoo with high hopes and they did not disappoint. I’ve been searching for a product that would turn my terrible hair problems around. First of all, my shampoo came on time, and was packaged perfectly. After using this product I noticed significant change! My hair feels stronger and healthier. My shedding has subsided and I have noticed my hair is longer, fuller and overall more voluminous. I couldn’t be more pleased! No harsh chemicals and a great smell! Amazing is an understatement. I would definitely recommend this shampoo. Five Stars!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the natural stem cell approach to this product. It has helped make my hair look healthier and fuller where it was thin before. My hair is also stronger and will grow easier. I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> This product has not only restored my hair while exceeding my expectations, it has restored my confidence and self esteem. All aspects of my life have improved from what this product has done. It&#x27;s a great investment for anyone, regardless of hair loss. It will improve/maintain the overall health of anyone&#x27;s hair. This is now the only product that touches my hair. Life changing.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is amazing! It helps your hair grown, and it also makes it smoother. My hair is always easier to style after using this shampoo. I won&#x27;t ever use anything else again! This shampoo has made my hair stronger and thicker! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel thicker, yes, but mostly just really greasy.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this shampoo and have only used it a couple times but am starting to feel duped. My hair feels and looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in weeks. The consistency of the shampoo is thin, bordering on runny, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is cleansing my hair/scalp at all (and I have been using sulfate free shampoo for over a year now so I&#x27;m used to low foam). I cannot speak to whether or not it works for hair regrowth as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference. I will continue to try this product and repost if it gets any better.</li>
    <li> highly recommended for hair loss....price is very reasonable</li>
    <li> After using for couple of weeks, definitely growth at bald spots, highly recommended, plus, this is a great shampoo too.</li>
    <li> It works! I noticed a significant change. It even has a nice smell to it. You can feel the cleanliness. I love that it&#x27;s all organic the ingredients just make your hair feel great and not Striped like other shampoos. My hair feels and looks thicker. Well worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This organic shampoo is number one prevention to hair-loss! It uses plant stem cells from Switzerland with an organic blend of tea tree and rosemary oil that i can literally smell and feel the tingle in the roots of my hair. I will always trust a product that i can literally feel working. With the Phytoworx recoginized brand for hair loss treatment, finally take the 1st step like i did and get back your full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Just ordered this shampoo, i found out about this from a blog and I can&#x27;t wait to use it.  I&#x27;ll update after I try it.</li>
    <li> I really cant say if it helped promote hair or not. It did take me a while to go through this bottle and the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some have said in earlier reviews. Hard for me to say if I like this product or not.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome!I was a little skeptical at first about this product working.But I must say I am impressed with the results.After using it for a few weeks this shampoo has left my hair feeling amazingly soft and easy to manage not to mention my hair is thicker and longer than before.The price was even affordable, Which I loved.I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first with the mixed reviews. But I went ahead and got this for my husband who has been having steady hair loss for the past year. He loves it. He has noticed a difference in his hair and has gained his confidence back! I would recommend this to anyone who is having hair loss.</li>
    <li> Very runny but seemed to help</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who had great results with her thinning hair. I noticed her hair was thicker and had great body and asked her to share her secret! When she told me it was a shampoo I immediately said no thank you... The chemicals were bound to do more harm than good. Then she said it was all natural... No chemicals!! I did my research and sure enough it was organic.. Plant based .. Chemical free so I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did. My hair is noticeably thicker(no more hiding under hats!) call me crazy but I think it&#x27;s grown faster than normal too! Long story short I recommend to anyone having problems with thinning hair. My hair looks great...and did I mention it smells fantastic. Get urs ASAP!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this shampoo.  I makes your hair look thicker and fuller. I will continue using it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company to let them know some of the shampoo had leaked out of the bottle during shipping.  They contacted me&lt;br /&gt;within hours with an appology and are taking care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but I can already tell a difference. My hair is thicker and has more body, it is stronger, and is no longer dry or brittle. I have also noticed far less shedding in the shower or when I&#x27;m brushing it. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s organic, parabin free, and sulphate free. I am very health conscience and I eat all organic foods and use all natural products on my body. Finding a hair loss shampoo that is organic was very important to me, especially since most hair loss treatments are full of chemicals. The smell is kind of pleasant and not overwhelming. It smells kind of like cherry almond hand soap. I would recommend this product to anybody experiencing hair loss, brittle, dry, flat, or thin hair.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive but it does something in your hair. It makes your hair stronger and thicker. I just reordered because I am curious about what else this shampoo can do. Actually more than a shampoo, it looks like a conditioner because it does not foam. I have not seen any hair regrowth yet but I am going to come back here if I see something new.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective yet soft feeling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever known.  It&#x27;s a very strong shampoo and feels that way going on and rinsing off.  I don&#x27;t even mind the smell--I am an anosmiac!  LOL!!!!  I&#x27;m a regular guy and I&#x27;m worried just like the rest of us...so why not go with the best, PhytoWorx!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing it really did ell my hair loss and have me hope ! I will definitely be ordering again and more products from this seller. Thank you so so so much ! I finally found something to put a halt to my hair loss !</li>
    <li> I have tried to use other over the counter hair loss shampoos, and gels, but ended up aggravating my sensitive scalp even more. I have thin, thinning hair, am prone to outbreaks of dandruff. My body will only allow me to use mostly organic products. I love that this shampoo is sulfate free, and organic! You can wash your hair in a river!!! For others out there that have sensitive skin and thinning hair, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> Had been thinning so I bought this product. It works great. My hair&#x27;s fullness has been restored. I had new growth within the first month of using this product, so i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I’ve had constant issues with hair loss and hair thinning over the past few years. I’ve tried tons of products, but never really liked any of them because I didn’t feel I was making progress. This product was recommended to me by a close friend, so after some extensive research, I decided I had nothing to lose. PhytoWorx hair loss shampoo is organic, made with plant stem cells and essential oils, so I didn’t have to worry about harmful or harsh chemicals like with other products. It even smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for almost a week, I’m definitely impressed with this shampoo! I use it by itself every other day, massaging it in for a few minutes before rinsing. I can already see a difference! My hair looks significantly thicker and fuller, although I haven’t spotted any new baby hairs growing in yet. Based on the reviews, I’m sure they’ll come in soon, though! This is definitely THE PRODUCT I was looking for to treat my hair loss.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;All natural&amp;#34; peeked my interest and after checking the ingredients, I was excited to try this. I&#x27;ve had the product for a month and I started using the shampoo only three to four times per week and my hair looks fuller and so shiny and silky! Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm. My hair is fuller than ever just after a weeks use. I recommend thisproduct for anyonewho is suffering hairloss or just isn&#x27;t satisfied with there thickness in hair.</li>
    <li> does seem to keep thinning hair looking volumunous. trick is to not use too much. i mix it with another biotin shampoo half and half. cant tell a difference with hair loss yet but it does look more healthly and full of volume.</li>
    <li> PhytoWorx Organic Hair Loss Shampooo is definitely worth trying. It smells so great and does not dry your hair out what so ever. The shampoo is all natural and Sulfate free. After using this product I have less dandruff and my scalp just feels better. The areas surrounding hair shafts aren’t dry and dull anymore. I would say this is the best shampoo on the market that I&#x27;ve ever used. I would highly recommend it for the many reasons I&#x27;ve listed.</li>
    <li> This product worked better than others I&#x27;ve tried this year. It&#x27;s also helped make my hair stronger as it goes back, you can&#x27;t go wrong with that. Plus it smells great. Just do it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product &amp; so does my hair. It really works and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell too much, I rather love the smell. And the way my hair feels after using it, and I&#x27;m not trying to give it extra credit, but it leaves my whole head feeling moisturized. I didn&#x27;t even notice it was working until week 5 of using it gradually works, but it works in a way that makes sense, not in some magical way. If you are consistent this will sooo work for you, it did for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo!  This shampoo works great, my hair is so much fuller and shiney!  It also smells great!  I&#x27;m going to recommend this to my sisters and mother as they have thinning hair also.</li>
    <li> My hair has not gotten any longer in the past couple years and my goal is to get my hair very long. I decided to give this a try because it&#x27;s organic and the ingredients like tea tree, peppermint, eucalyptus and rosemary oils are good for your hair. Within the first month I noticed a difference. Not only has my hair gotten thicker, it&#x27;s grown at least an inch. I love this stuff and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly, I was happy with that. This shampoo had a much better smell than other shampoos I have tried. It didn&#x27;t smell so much like chemicals, it had almost a salon-like smell to it. I used it as directed and started feeling the difference almost immediately. My wife said she started seeing a difference within a few days. It has been a few months now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My hair is thicker and fuller than it has been in years. I love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for hair loss since I recently got this but I tried it for the volume and it does exactly that.  After I blow dry,  it looks like I have twice as much.  I found if I used any kind of smoothing product (that tames the frizzes) after it was washed and before I dried it, I lost a LOT of the body.  It smells good and although some reviewers said they got suds, I don&#x27;t care how many times I reapplied it, I got nada.  It looks like watery white lotion and that&#x27;s what it felt like I was rubbing into my hair.  I didn&#x27;t have to use a conditioner afterward and my head and hair felt clean BUT it felt like there was some kind of &#x27;film&#x27; on my hair to where I couldn&#x27;t stand to touch it.  So I washed my hair again, first with my regular shampoo, then applied this and waited the 2 to 3 minutes and it felt much better.</li>
    <li> This all natural shampoo smells great, feel great and provides almost immediate result. Love it!</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT ITS NOT THAT GREAT THING IS VERY LQUIFY IT HAS POR CONSISTENCY .ACTUALLY I BEEN USING IT FOR 2 WEEKS NOW SO ITS TO PREMATURE TO GIVE A STRONG OPINION.</li>
    <li> I honestly can say that my expectations weren’t that high when purchasing this hair growth shampoo especially for the price. Receding hair lines are commonplace with the men in my family so I was looking for something to alleviate this irritating problem. I’ve been using this shampoo for close to 4 weeks now and I’m seeing an improvement in my hair volume, texture and most importantly the length. Now the next test will be permanently stopping and slowing the thinning process because as a male, I’m reluctant to let my hair go completely bald. Yes, the price can be costly but as I stated if your committed then I believe you will receive the expected results.</li>
    <li> Received package sooner than expected which was great.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this shampoo since I read so many good reviews and had such high ratings.  My hair felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in weeks.  It did not feel soft or clean. There was a thick waxy film left on my hair even after rinsing well. The smell was not at all pleasant or floral as others had stated.  After my hair dried the smell was even worse.  I washed my hair again with my regular shampoo and I could still smell this product.  The seller says it has ingredients such as tea tree oil, peppermint, and eucalyptus in it which  this product does not, nor are those ingredients listed on the bottle.  Never again!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It gets the job down and prevents your hair from falling out! But also, helps to thicken your hair. I love that this product is sulfate free and all natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allmost 60 with fine hair. I have used body forming shampoos for fine greesy hair for decades. They probably gave me dandruf. I now think that they also made my hair generate more greese. After useing this expensive shampoo in a 11 oz. bottle I find my hair in better shape then ever. Today is the second day with just a warm water rinse. I don&#x27;t seem to have greesy hair anymore! My hair is now great.  The shampoo does not lather up. It does not make my hair squeeky clean. It had me wondering for a while but now after almost a bottle, I&#x27;m sticking with it. I really think this is a hair/ scalp health shampoo. I still end up with the same amount of hair in the comb. I haven&#x27;t noticed hair growth.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a life changer! Say goodbye to unnatural shampoos PLEASE because your hair is better than that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I splurged on this shampoo after years of being mean to my hair.. bleach, dye, the works! And wondering why my hair felt dull and lifeless... well duh! Parabens and sulfates aren&#x27;t doing any good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to go for it. The Phytoworx shampoo felt different than any other shampoo I have ever used.. barely suds at all, which is great if you have dry hair like me! Not to mention the smell is out of this world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a side note but the shipping and packaging were A+! Very secure and faster than expected. I will order again!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product because I needed to revitalize my hair, I&#x27;ve tried a few other shampoos and lotions. Nothing work really the way I wanted it to. This one worked really well! It smells great, and my scalp does feel better too. It made my hair thick, and grow a lot better. It has been very nice using the product. I would defiantly buy it again.  I used to get a hair cut once every 5 months, now I&#x27;ve been noticing that I need a hair cut and its only been 2 months since my last one.</li>
    <li> I do like how it makes my hair look and feel thicker after I use it.  The smell is not so great though.  I try to follow it up quickly with some good smelling conditioner</li>
    <li> The product arrived exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s a bit creamy, takes awhile to wash out, otherwise it leaves an oily film on the scalp and hair, time will tell if it works though.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have sensitive skin all throughout the year so it&#x27;s hard for me to find a hair-loss shampoo that works without harsh chemicals that irritate my scalp. Phytoworx has helped my hair gain fullness, strength, and has helped replenished my scalp as well. I highly recommend this shampoo for anyone suffering from hair-loss and dry-itchy scalp. This will be the last product you buy for your hair-loss AND sensitive scalp needs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost two weeks now and there is a marked difference in thickness.  I would go so far as to call it dramatic.  I especially like that it contains no harsh chemicals or sulfates like ALL other hair thickening shampoos I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the complaints of oiliness and and the smell; I can&#x27;t argue with these experiences but simply add my own.  I have not noticed any excess oil buildup from using this shampoo and I use a generous amount (as directed since there is no lather) and the smell is not that strong.  It does not smell like the heavily scented and perfumed shampoos out there, but the smell does not linger on my hair and any scent that does remain gets covered up by a vanilla scented pomade I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive but I think judging by how much I have used so far I can stretch a bottle into a months supply.  It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it in my opinion.  Hopefully this product does not go away like the other good ones I have enjoyed using.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. My hair was thinning on top I ordered this product and now i have a full gorgeous top region of hair again. I&#x27;m going to keep ordering this stuff.</li>
    <li> I replaced my normal shampoo with this product and eating better.  It&#x27;s a lifestyle. I also started taking vitamins to help the process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with thinning hair for several years. I have tried various products on the market, to which I have had little success with. A friend recommended this shampoo. I have noticed that my hair is a lot softer  feeling since I have begun using it. I am shedding less and my hair is starting to get thicker. I have noticed the difference, another great thing about this shampoo is that it contains many plant based natural ingredients and is sulfate free. This product is also unique in that it contains plant stem cells and essential oils. Plant stem cells are, reportedly, excellent to stimulate the reproduction of hair in follicles long thought dead or ineffective, resulting in the ability to reduce hair loss and promote new hair follicle growth. For the price, it is completely worth it. I love love love it.</li>
    <li> I thought i was going to suffee from hair loss my entire life, but this product changed my life forever. I start usimg this produst and weeks later i seen progress already. Anyone who use this product will be happy and never stop using it. The results are so unbelievable that you wouldnt believe it. Want to see major progress, your hair with nice length and best strenght than any other product, purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ask me about the science - I flunked the subject in high school. But this stuff works! I&#x27;ve tried similar products, but I could never really commit to using them because they were all loaded with chemicals. It&#x27;s like eating fast food. It tastes good, but thinking about what&#x27;s in it makes it hard to enjoy, not to mention digest. That&#x27;s why I bought this product. It&#x27;s the only organic shampoo I could find for hair growth.    Much to my girlfriend&#x27;s dismay, my once thick hair has been thinning for some time. So I started to try hair growth shampoos. As I said, however, everything I tried was loaded with chemicals - and none of them worked. Perhaps they weren&#x27;t effective because I was unable to bring myself to use them every day. That&#x27;s why, when I came across Phytoworx during an Amazon search, I was ecstatic! Yes, it&#x27;s not cheap. But this is the flip side of the adage you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve been using it every day now for the past two months and my hair is noticeably thicker. In fact, my girlfriend even says my hair even smells better. Maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not loading it with chemicals every few days. No matter how this product does its trick, I&#x27;m glad I found it. And so is my girlfriend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair that breaks and falls out easily so, growing it long has been next to impossible. I&#x27;ve tried so many products that when my mom bought me this shampoo, I was a bit skeptical at first. I didn&#x27;t even start using it right away. I only started using it when I ran out of my other shampoo and I&#x27;m glad I finally did. After about 2 and a half weeks or so, I actually started noticing growth. Not only does it leave my hair shiny and healthy looking but, it feels stronger and it&#x27;s actually growing! Now, I even have new growth. I just bought another bottle. Long, healthy hair, here I come!</li>
    <li> Truly wonderful! Visible results! I have been using this shampoo for over a month and my scalp is beginning to show lots of little hairs growing! Extremely happy with this shampoo! Nice lathering, smells great and leaves hair feeling thicker and adds fullness to my hair!This really has worked for me, I&#x27;ll be getting some for my mom for Christmas for sure! I never want to stop using it! Finally, I found my shampoo! Thanks Phytoworx!</li>
    <li> Its working. I&#x27;ve used everything,  but this is the first time I seen any results. I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo I&#x27;ve stuck with for a very long time. Most shampoos leave my hair feeling thin and I have a great deal of hair fall out when I shower. I decided on this shampoo because I overheard someone at work talking about it and based on the positive reviews. I started using this product regularly and felt an immediate difference. Day after day my hair fall was reduced and now there is an increase in the volume of my hair, it feels so soft and manageable. I&#x27;ll be sticking to this shampoo for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> just bought my second bottle. the first one was a gift from a coworker who knew i would never spend this kind of money to try something like it. after using up the whole bottle, i am happy to say that the hair at the top of my head has definitely thickened and i see much less hair falling out in the shower.</li>
    <li> For some time now I have been dealing with my hair gradually becoming thinner. I have been searching and searching for a safe way to resolve this issue I don&#x27;t want to use a bunch of harmful chemicals that can possibly worsen my hair thinning. This shampoo has worked wonders for me my scalp has become a lot healthier my hair is noticeably thicker and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The best part about this shampoo is that it is all natural you know exactly what you&#x27;re putting in your hair. Truly recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants thicker hair or just a healthier scalp in general.</li>
    <li> did not notice any change</li>
    <li> I lost lot of hair using the shampoo, as other reviewers stated , it doesn&#x27;t produce lather , smells good, I see lot of hair in hand after massaging with shampoo, I am still using the photoworyx tablets. Keep posted with more updates, I see most of the phytoworx reviews done by single time reviewers, not sure if they are real or scam reviews done by phytoworx</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinning out since a very young age, towards the end high school. After trying many products with harsh synthetic chemicals a friend told me to try looking on amazon for cheaper products that have reviews so I know what to expect. THANK GOD I DID! It&#x27;s been only three weeks and I have never been happier with my hair since middle school. Apparently it contains stem cells from plants of extreme rarity in Switzerland. Either way, I&#x27;m impressed and happy to know that I&#x27;m using organic ingredients that have existed in nature for many years. Also, this leaves my hair feeling very soft and non-greasy. This is a wonderful product! I might even purchase some bottles as gifts for some friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have a good friend in his mid 50&#x27;s that I ordered this product for as a gift. After he finished using the bottle I got him, he was fortunate enough to notice tremendous results. If you could have seen how much more confident he was, you would know this one is a winner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to make the switch to organic products for my body and hair. So, the price I was okay with because natural ingredients typically cost more than products full of additives and chemicals. Needless to say, I was pleased with the shampoo. My first wash left my hair a little greasy but I believe it was the other shampoo and conditioner build up. The second wash left my hair clean with a tingling sensation on the scalp. Definetely worth it. My suggestion is to stop using your other shampoo a day before you wash your hair with Phytoworx. You will see and feel a difference. You won&#x27;t see much lather but its working. Use on the sides, crown and of course nape areas of your hair. Wash regularly for fuller hair and regrowth. Each day you will see less hair coming out while brushing too. I like the results I&#x27;m seeing. Ill post another update on my progress soon.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo.  It works very well for growing hair. I have never seen my hair grow so fast. It is absolutely a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very mild and gentle formula. For anyone particular about the chemicals they use in their hair, or anything like that this would be a good product for them.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice delicate scent to it, probably because it&#x27;s organic, but it&#x27;s a nice lovely gesture to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The first and foremost result I got with this shampoo was the thickness enhancement. It was a slight thickness, like something I&#x27;ve never seen before, with any other product that I have ever used. Most products that promote hair thickness work well, but particularly for me, sometimes a little too, well, because they make your&#x27;e hair a little too, thick.  But I have never seen a product that thickens your&#x27;e hair like this before. I&#x27;ts just a slight, thick, concistency that is the perfect result.  And it leaves a very soft, manageable texture that looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;The last effect was very refreshing.  After applying it, you get a most refreshing feeling to your&#x27;e scalp. which is wonderful for me. Which is also why I like this shampoo and I recommend it to anyone with hair growth or hair thinning concerns.</li>
    <li> Glad I decided to give this shampoo a try! Struggling with thinning hair is something no one wants to experience so I decided to look for something to get results. I chose Phytoworx because it is organic and a great price compared to other hair loss treatments. My hair feels great, it feels rejuvenated, healthy, thicker, fuller, and smoother! The amount of shedding has stopped tremendously! I will continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone struggling with hair loss or thinning.</li>
    <li> Good stuff not sure it put hair on you but worth a shot</li>
    <li> Smells good my hair feels thicker and fuller. That this is organic is a big plus. I see my hair has volume again. Definitely recommend espcially since my hair is falling out less!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, which has been a challenge for me my entire life. Sometimes even having to hide spots that are a bit thin with varying hair styles, especially when its &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different types of hair thickening shampoos/mouses/gels etc to thicken my hair, but I didn&#x27;t like the results of those products. A lot of them make the hair sticky flaky etc which I really don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I really don&#x27;t like products that are complicated and difficult to use. This one is simple and straight forward, no hot oils to deal with etc, just use it like it&#x27;s shampoo. Of course, it&#x27;s higher priced than regular shampoo, but that&#x27;s to be expected, because it&#x27;s not just regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always especially looking for organic products without all the chemicals... I&#x27;m happy about this!  I know some have said they don&#x27;t like the smell, but its a natural healthy smell... not filled with fake harmful perfumes and chemicals.So I&#x27;m glad to find it!</li>
    <li> Not sure if the shampoo really works. Only been using it for 1 week, but because it doesn&#x27;t lather so easy, I feel as though I have to use more. using more is counterproductive considering the price for this shampoo</li>
    <li> I am amazed to see how much this shampoo has helped repair and regrow my hair.I am starting to see hair growing where before I was starting to see areas of thinning brittle hair.It is also improving the appearance of my hair it now looks full and shiny.I like that this product is organic and contains no harsh chemicals or sulfates.It contains stem cells from Swiss apples which I hear provide great benefits to both hair and skin and I definitely am seeing the results.My scalp feels great!This shampoo gets rid of all the buildup that other products leave behind and best of all there is no harsh chemical smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells delicious, lathers up beautifully and leaves my hair squeaky clean!  It is organic and (again) smells delicious!  I have very thin hair, and this phytoworx shampoo, it made my hair thick and full like no other product has been able to do. Not frizzy, but FULL! I love this stuff!! I go a few days with out washing, and it dosn&#x27;t get flat and stringy looking! I have tried a lot of products, and I finally have hair that I feel good about!  I also use the Phytoworx supplements as well and together, my hair is getting lusher and fuller!</li>
    <li> Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo is one of the few natural hair loss shampoos available on the market today. Its unique plant stem cells, it does not contain harsh chemicals, this is one of the safest, effective hair loss treatments that can be found. Is formulated to make the hair thicker and stronger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this great organic shampoo from Beauty Superstore Plus and I would like to thank them for the fast shipping I wasn&#x27;t expecting it this fast on this time of the year.</li>
    <li> This shampoo will give results over time.It might seem pricy for such a small amount, but this product is deffinately quality over quantity. I would reccomend to not use a huge amount. Read the instructions; even regular shampoo tells you to only use a small amount. It is an organic oil based shampoo, so of course it won&#x27;t lather very much. This bottle lasted me like 3 months with everyday use</li>
    <li> WOW.....NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY OTHER THAN YOU WILL WANT TO SHARE THIS WITH THE WORLD! i MEAN AT FIRST I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF \\&quot; PLANT STEM CELLS \\&quot;? YET I HAD TO PLACE ALL SKEPTICISM ASIDE AND GIVE IT A SHOT! GLADLY I CAN PROCLAIM THAT I WAS FAR FROM DISAPPOINTED I MEAN WHERE WAS THIS WHEN I WAS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENVY OF MANY! THIS PRODUCT EPITOMIZES A NEW ERA IN HAIR RESTORATION! I TELL YOU WHAT PHYTOWORX IF YOU DECIDE TO EVER DO A COMMERCIAL SIGN ME UP, I&#x27;LL DO IT FOR FREE THE WORLD MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS \\&quot; HEAVEN IN A BOTTLE \\&quot;! I have bought other items such as garnier hair growth and castor oils that were supposed to stimulate hair roots yet the fail dismally in comparison! Hurray don&#x27;t be left out of this revolutionized product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried more than I&#x27;d like to share. After a week my hair was stronger and thicker, I was noticing that I could run my hands through and have no strands fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that toxic smell you&#x27;d expect from competitor shampoos and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, which is the norm for other similar shampoos. It distributes evenly through hair, don&#x27;t expect a typical lather like regular shampoos, more of a mild lather that is a little thin in consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s organic so I know that I&#x27;m not washing out chemicals down my shower drain or putting questionable elements in my hair that could cause more hair loss. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re considering hair loss solutions.</li>
    <li> Now I know what all the hype about plant stem cells is about! This stuff is amazing. I am very vain and I love my hair and its been thinning for a few years. This is by far the most success I&#x27;ve ever had with any product out there, truly. It smells great, it feels good lathering, and the most obvious and amazing benefit is that my hair is already thicker, stronger and I can see more growing in. I am so grateful, because you never ever know with products like these. Also, the newest stuff is usually the best, but when something is new, you never really know what you&#x27;re buying because there isn&#x27;t so much history. Glad to leave a review so others can have the same experience as me. Thank you Phytoworx for making a product that actually serves a real need!</li>
    <li> I believe in this product. My mother had always told me that I should start caring for my hair while I&#x27;m young-- no more of those cheap shampoos with harsh chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product because I wanted something that is all organic, and I know will not damage or cause hair to fall out. My first time trying this product, and I can already notice the difference! Before, with shampoos I buy at convenience stores, my hair fell flat and dull. With this product, my hair feels like it has some life and shine in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is like hotel shampoo/soap--you&#x27;ll recognize it at first whiff, but the smell intensifies when it&#x27;s actually in your hair. The hardest part about this shampoo is there is NO lather... at all. So, it&#x27;s up to you to judge the amount. I tend to fill my palm with the shampoo and just use it to massage the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone who is trying to go the organic way in keeping your hair healthy and alive.</li>
    <li> This shampoo meets and exceeds all expectations. It helped stop the thinning of my hair, and a even seems to be making it grow back faster. It doesn&#x27;t sacrifice quality for effects though. The shampoo is great and leaves a shine instead of a grease.</li>
    <li> Product truly works. Nothing better. Only thing I&#x27;ve used that actually works. Ordered 2 more as soon as I saw results which was in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy and satisfied with this shampoo! I had thinning and hair loss and this product has worked in bringing my hair back in the way it once was. I have finally found something that works and now I use it several times a week and see the benefits. Plus, I love that it has all natural ingredients because that is so important to me. Try it!!</li>
    <li> I believe that a healthy good looking hair is very important to have self confidence and fell good. I have been searching and trying out so many hair growth products and phytoworx is where I stopped;  it actually works!!! PhytoWorx Shampoo is a great product and it is worth every single penny . It uses organic products that are optimum for the regrowth of your hair  and since it does not contain any harsh chemical it wont dry out your hair. If your hair goal is longer, fuller, voluminous hair, would highly recommend this product and stick with it...Your hair will grow!!!! This shampoo leaves your hair feeling very clean and fresh with a pleasant natural smell.    This shampoo is amazing, after trying so many and finally getting Phytoworx Shampoo the difference was remarkable and if your goal is to start growing more long thicker hair you should use this shampoo as well at least give it a try if it worked for me I would work for you. stop shedding hair and seeing unwanted bald spots. i am satisfy and thankful that i got Phytoworx Organic Shampoo I highly recommend it to stop shedding hair and start growing new hair. It is Amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells good and works great</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not badly affect your hair like some other shampoos. Actually prevents hair loss. Smells good and lathers normally but also produces great results.</li>
    <li> this shampoo smells excellent . for a product to be made by plant stem cells shows the complexity of the product and only shows that it really works to learn more about the product http://organicshampooforyou.com/phytoworx-organic-hair-loss-shampoo-review/  . based on reviews on amazon and everywhere else this product is indeed top notch!</li>
    <li> Do Not waste your money !! It does not lather at all ! One review says it doesn&#x27;t lather well.... Well how about not at ALL !!! It feels like you are putting nothing in ur hair but then leaves a horrible film on ur hair!!! Looks completely greasy and like you added more oil to it and feels disgusting!! Please save your money and buy Nixon like I was told to do in the first place !</li>
    <li> This shampoo has the most WONDERFUL smell, and somehow it&#x27;s even better when you know that comes from natural ingredients. (It reminded me vaguely of lavender and eucalyptus). I was a bit surprised when the shampoo didn&#x27;t lather, but in reading the label and directions, discovered that that was how it was supposed to be. I have a few thinning spots at my hairline, but they seem to be filling in a bit now. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking to slow hair shedding and loss and especially if you&#x27;re looking to do so without chemicals!</li>
    <li> To begin, when they say stem cells, they literally mean cells from a plant stem, which are not the counterpart of the controversial human stem cells. That being said, this shampoo is entirely comprised of organic ingredients, things found in nature, like peppermint, tea tree oil, eucalyptus, rosemary oil, etc. These aren&#x27;t harsh chemicals that may damage your hair, but proven natural stimulants to hair growth. The price tag is worth it when you consider how much all of these supplements would cost if bought separately. Research has backed all of these ingredients, so it makes sense that this shampoo would work. And my hair loves it! Not only has hair loss stopped entirely, but it leaves hair feeling moisturized and looking refreshed, as nature intended. Natural ingredients will always be healthier than ingredients made in the lab, so if you want healthy looking hair, this is your product! Everyone knows that chemicals and processed foods are worse for your body than a natural diet of healthy foods, so treat your hair as you would your body, and it will respond in the same way; looking and feeling healthy, refreshed, and revitalized. Phytoworx really found a combination that works with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo! One of my favorite things about it has to be the organic ingredients since I&#x27;m vegan. I also love the scent; it leaves my hair smelling really good and last a good amount of time. Before using this, I had really bad edges; the hair around my forehead was either really short or almost gone entirely in some places. However since I&#x27;ve been using this, which has been about a month, I can already see baby hair coming in and the rest of my hair seems to be getting stronger and healthier too. The size of the bottle is great and if you use the right amount it should last about a month and a half or two months. I&#x27;ve already have recommended this shampoo to my sister since it has worked so well for me! Also be aware that it doesn&#x27;t foam up that much because of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this Phytoworx, it seem did help some with my hair falling but one bottle only last for two weeks for me. My hair length is about 5 inch below my shoulder. it too expensive! if it has reasonable price, I may consider buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for hair breakage &amp; hair loss. After using this product for almost a month im seeing results in my hair growth my  and hair stop breaking off these are results I was hoping to see so I definitely will be ordering another bottle I can say that my hair seems to be in a healthy state since using this shampoo</li>
    <li> Man am i Surprised with the quality of this product. the smell and texture are great!. the shampoo doesnt get overly foamy so it makes it easy to get all over the area needed. My hair felt thicker after just 3 washes and it felt like it had more life and shine to it. Shipping was fast and package came with no damage. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I can&#x27;t wait to use this again. The price is great and ships quickly! Phytoworx ia a great company and I will continue to purchase from them!</li>
    <li> I have been searching and trying out so many hair growth and losing hair products and this actually works, My hair stop losing after a month using every week and after three month was amazing more longer.</li>
    <li> I used to be so envious of those with thick hair. I have been growing my hair out and trying to find ways to give it some pizazz and volume. I had tried a few supplements that are supposed to help with fullness, but was extremely disappointed with the results. I was very disappointed when those did not work because that is what was highly recommended to me by my cousin. I decided to do some research on other options that may work for me and found a forum talking about this shampoo. I came onto Amazon and read through the reviews. Most of them were very good, but I tried to read through some of the bad ones as well because I know that not all of the reviews on Amazon can be trusted. After going back and forth for a while I decided to take the plunge and purchased this product. It arrived pretty quickly, so that is a big plus. I really did not expect much from this product, but within the very first week I noticed a definite difference in my hair. Not only did it feel thicker and fuller, but it looked thicker/fuller as well! I continued to use it and am not awaiting my third bottle! Because of my awful experience with hair loss supplements, I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product is going to work for you. With that being said, I highly recommend this product and it is definitely worth trying out if you are experiencing hair loss or if you are looking to make your hair fuller/thicker (like me).</li>
    <li> This is an all natural product and it feels all natural. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up like the sulfate infused shampoos, stripping your hair of the essential oils. It smells like frankincense and I love that smell. Your hair is left shinning and healthy looking just after the first use. I like the fact that you only need a little for each wash. To me it seemed like this shampoo was undoing all the abuse I had put my hair through previously (my hair had turned brittle and frizzy  from repeated straightening).This shampoo seems to be tackling dandruff issues as well as it left my hair relatively dandruff free. Quite happy with the success I had so far with the product!!</li>
    <li> I tired this shampoo to help with my thinning hair. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and it seems that my hair is thicker and my scalp is less patchy. my part line is also getting small. However, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a true shampoo since there isn&#x27;t a lot of foaming. It&#x27;s more like a scalp conditioner. I was intrigued by plant stem cells and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions whatsoever. Other treatments for hair loss have given me a rash since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Not only is it a great product, its organic as well so that&#x27;s another plus for me!</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised! The shampoo itself if a great consistency and does not have an overpowering smell. After a few uses hair is shinier and feels healthier in general. This product definitely helps battle hair loss, but also boosts hair growth! The shampoo leaves hair bouncier and adds tons of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that will generate hair growth and health then this is your product!</li>
    <li> Phytoworx products are truly amazing. I have used other products and this is by far the best I have found. My hair looks and feels more healthy. I recommend trying there pill form product for hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> I received it really quick, and I can tell the difference after a week that it makes my hair feel healthier and stronger.</li>
    <li> Worked as described, I&#x27;ve noticed already that my hair is thicker and fuller since using this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great!  It&#x27;s got a wonderful bottle, with a nice texture for extra grippiness. The shampoo smells wonderful, no doubt from the wide array of fruits used to make it. All the ingredients are recognizable. There is a note on the bottle that says it doesn&#x27;t foam up much- this is because it doesn&#x27;t use sodium laurel-sulfate, which has been linked to many damaging things. It&#x27;s basically the only thing used in normal shampoo (and toothpaste!) to make it foam. However, it&#x27;s still easy to spread through your hair, and it definitely does it&#x27;s job as a shampoo, and without all the random chemicals.</li>
    <li> my hair was weak after one use I can tell the difference with just one use. my hair is much stronger now!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible product, filled with cheap dollar shop body moisturiser, after 6 rinses and washes, my hair is still covered in this cheap greasy substance. Do not purchase this product, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with thinning hair and I was absolutely tired of it. I started to use this shampoo along with their supplement. It&#x27;s been amazing!! I have never been happier with a product in my life. I was very skeptical at first but I started to see results. My hair has grown thicker and healthier. My scalp feels invigorating and moisturized(if you want better hair, you need a healthy scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent and feel of this shampoo is extremely refreshing. I&#x27;ve seen increased volume due to the thickness of my hair now. My girlfriend is astonished how well this shampoo has work. I feel a lot more confident because my healthy hair is back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of this shampoo is that is natural and harsh chemicals can further damage. If you&#x27;re the type of person who is picky on products, this is the product for you. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product. If you&#x27;re having problems with thinning of hair, this product will give you results.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product despite its price, you pay what you get for. And this product definitely does what it is intended to do and some more. Prior to the purchase of this, I had thin hair and nearly bald. After just 2 weeks of applying this product, I felt the effect of this product. Now I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss solutions, but this one really delivers and is there to stay. This product really helped me regain my youth hair and self-confidence, and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from several of my employees and even recommended it a few of my friends, how were also experiencing devastating hair lost. Needless to say, it worked just as well on them if not better than me.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of organic products so I am happy to come across this organic hair loss shampoo. I made the purchase and started using it immediately upon receiving it in the mail. I have been experiencing hair loss for several years now and have tried other products in the past, but none of them worked as well as I wanted or needed.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how fast I saw results. While nothing works overnight, I did start seeing results within a week. As time went on, the results became more noticeable. Now, a few months later, my hair has never looked thicker, fuller or healthier.&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I liked the most with this organic shampoo is that you don’t have to use a lot. Just a small amount does the trick. I just massage it into my hair for a couple of minutes and rinse it out. That is all there is to it.&lt;br /&gt;Another huge advantage to this shampoo is the natural ingredients. With ingredients such as peppermint, rosemary, tea tree and eucalyptus in the shampoo, you will definitely notice a thicker, fuller head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shampoo for everyone who wants thicker, fuller and healthier hair.</li>
    <li> I have been STRESSED through out summer quarter and it&#x27;s taken a toll on my health and even my hair. From the white hairs and hair loss, I have time before Fall Quarter and I need to get all of it back and take better care of myself. Through the middle of summer quarter, I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo religiously and it is a staple to my hair. I don&#x27;t have a bush left over when I brush my hair, my clogs are clean in the bathroom. I&#x27;m actually really surprised and also concerned because I have read both the negative and positive feedbacks on this and I just had to really wing for it. It&#x27;s my own experience and it worked for me. Now even after summer quarter I can relax and just let my hair grow out and continue this through September without having one less thing to worry about. It&#x27;s been 8 weeks now and I&#x27;ve grown at least enough to give myself some bangs so I&#x27;m not complaining! Really happy with the results so far and hope it continues this way!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s hair growth abilities but it made my hair fuller looking and just plain better looking after the first use.  At first I thought the smell was off putting but after my hair dried it did smell good, and unique.  It&#x27;s expensive but if you have thinning hair like I do, how much shampoo do you really use anyway?</li>
    <li> i have very thin hair and this helped me get my hair fuller and more thick even tho it took like 3 weeks, it smells nice and works. feels great on hair and comes off clean, i would recommend others who have problems with their hair to buy this.</li>
    <li> Really great shampoo makes my hair feel thicker and stronger. I prefer natural and organic products so this is a win-win!</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;d say this is an effective product. Although every organic shampoo or organic product is not necessarily superior to man-made products, this shampoo actually uses the appropriate blend of organic product relative to what&#x27;s healthy for  hair and skin. Plant stem cells are known to add longevity to hair and skin so that was an excellent choice for the shampoo. It also has a pleasant smell and a pretty light feel. I&#x27;m expecting to see results soon but as of right now I notice less split ends and less breakage. Will be trying more Phytoworx organic  products.</li>
    <li> If any of you are having trouble with hair loss currently, I highly recommend this product. Don&#x27;t wait! You&#x27;ve seen all these reviews, phytoworx has the science down.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. My hair is fuller and thicker. And this shampoo leaves my hair soft, feeling healthier. And it smells great. Additional plus, all organic natural ingredients. I also notice less hair breakage. I do notice changes in my hair growth even though I have been using this shampoo for a month.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shampoos in the market, but nothing did a job like this one! Absolutely amazing! Thicker and healthy looking hair in a short period of time! Love it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells delicious, lathers up beautifully and leaves my hair squeaky clean! It is organic and (again) smells delicious! I have very thin hair, and this phytoworx shampoo, it made my hair thick and full like no other product has been able to do. Not frizzy, but FULL! I love this stuff!! I go a few days with out washing, and it dosn&#x27;t get flat and stringy looking! I have tried a lot of products, and I finally have hair that I feel good about! I also use the Phytoworx supplements as well and together, my hair is getting lusher and fuller!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that really works, you&#x27;ve found it. I&#x27;ve spent months trying multiple products to stop my thinning hair with little to no success but this shampoo has been nothing short of amazing. With only two weeks of use, I&#x27;ve already noticed a huge difference in the strength of my hair. Not only is thinning becoming something of the past, but my hair is growing back thicker than ever. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants real results.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Being a diabetic, my hair is very thin and falls out easily. Since using this product, my hair is healthier, stronger and there is a lot less breakage. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants fuller, thicker, healthier hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  As with other reviews this product appears to begin working after just three washes.  Never had hair loss problems until middle age (menopause).  I have started washing my hair every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use:  Wet  your hair, apply the Phytoworx shampoo and allow it to sit on your hair (scalp line area) for three minutes.  I then apply a dime size amount of Loreal Everpure Sulfate Free Shampoo for the lather.  Rinse, rinse, rinse and then apply a small amount of sulfate free conditioner (of course rinse that out too).  Wonderful results!  Hair loss is significantly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended this to friends with the same issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a wary person when it comes to hair loss products but I have been thuroughly satisfied with the results so far. It has a good smell and it&#x27;s helping my hair regain its thickness quite nicely. I can finally get a hair cut without feeling embarrassed! Plus it is made from all natural, organic ingredients so I don&#x27;t have to worry about any long term side effects from using it. This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous hair loss products within the last year, and this is absolutely one of the best. Some other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried felt &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; so to speak, but this Phytoworx ORGANIC shampoo feels natural and great!! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my hair within about a week! Hair loss has slowed significantly, and my hair feels healthier and more natural than it has in a long time! Will definitely continue using, probably for a long while.</li>
    <li> best of the way to take phytoworx products. 2 times a day for me its fine... once in the morning and then at night</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. Im so used to buying shampoos for hair growth that just smells bad I dont even want to use it in my hair. But not with this Brand. Smells just fine. Helped cover up my bald spot took a little bit of time though so dont rush it. Just take care of your hair with Phytoworx products and you will be ok.</li>

    <li> This shampoo actually works! My hair has been thinning for years now and not only has this shampoo made my hair thicker and fuller but it leaves it so smooth! It does not dry out and you can start to see the results immediately! I recommend this and will be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I&#x27;ve been looking for one that actually works for awhile now and after trying this one I was very pleased. I&#x27;ve struggled with thinning, flat hair, and shedding for awhile, but thanks to Phytoworx I not only immediately saw a decrease in the amount of hair falling to the drain or getting caught in my brush, my hair is also a lot thicker, fuller and stronger! It&#x27;s great because I have a sensitive scalp and there are no harsh chemicals to worry about. I highly recommend it. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Excellent service! Great price and very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. It works wonders for my thick coily hair that was brittle and falling out. In the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it my hair is stronger and has a nice sheen to it. The badly damaged spots I used to have blend right in now. I definitely recommend this. I&#x27;m also a fan of the way it smells and I love being able to read and understand most of the ingredients, like coconut oil, tea tree oil, etc. ..stuff that I already know is good for my hair!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long, but am sharing my initial thoughts.  This shampoo smells at first like a light scent of black cherries, but the scent does not last long so if you prefer to not have a lingering scent all day, you will be pleased.  It has a bit more of a syrupy consistency so keep your fingers closed so you don&#x27;t lose product down the drain.  I don&#x27;t know yet if it is helping to thicken my hair, but it seems to clean well and I like that it has ingredients like aloe vera, coconut oil, sunflower oil, and shea butter to help moisturize my hair, especially with cooler weather coming in the upper Midwest and dry air. :-(  It seems to clean my fine hair sufficiently, but might weigh down your hair if already moisturized or oily.</li>
    <li> I have been searching and trying out so many hair growth products and this actually works!!! Amazing is the best word to describe this shampoo!! And the best part is you will see results so fast that you will see why this shampoo is the best!  After the 2nd time use of this shampoo I felt a huge difference, my dull hair came back to life. It gave me a full body of hair and lots of shine, you will also notice less shedding and this will not dry out your hair. If your hair goal is longer, fuller, volumous hair... I would highly recommend this product and stick with it...Your hair will grow!!!!</li>
    <li> I been trying so many different products to help with my hair loss and I was a little skeptical with this product but after the first 2weeka I&#x27;m notices such a big difference I&#x27;m so exciting and can&#x27;t wait to get my next order!</li>
    <li> So far I really like this shampoo, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days. It does give my hair more texture. I like the smell, and love that all of the ingredients are natural and recognizable. It doesn&#x27;t foam, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if you have the right amount, but I don&#x27;t mind it not foaming. It lends credibility to the fact that it&#x27;s all natural herbs and oils. I have not seen growth yet, but there has not been enough time. I&#x27;, also using it in conjunction with the pills. Kind of expensive, but if I can get results naturally, it&#x27;s worth every penny. Certainly can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I have a few spots on my head that are very thin. It helped match up my hair thickness to the rest of my head! So simple!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is amazing. I&#x27;ve been struggling with hair loss as well as extremely damaged hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for products that could somehow work,but I wasn&#x27;t finding anything. One day I was just looking on Amazon and came across the Phytoworx organic hair loss shampoo, and decided to give it a try. The first day I started my hair just felt so clean and soft. After a bit I started noticing my hair was growing. The spots where I was having hair loss was becoming less and less noticeable. And it somehow restored the health in my hair. Now my hair is looking healthy and growing. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wowza. I got this shampoo two weeks ago and I have been using it once a day, leaving it in my hair for at least two minutes, as recommended, before rinsing it out gently. Already my hair has thickened and I have noticed baby hairs where there were none before! I didn&#x27;t want to believe my eyes at first as I have been losing hair on and off in phases during most of my twenties. At 27, I was starting to get concerned, but this has presented a new hope. I wish this shampoo was a lot less expensive, but I cannot complain about the results. It may not work for everyone, but it is definitely working for me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> I got the results I wanted from this shampoo. After using It I was pleased it left my hair tangle free without striping my hair of its natural oils and after a few weeks time started to notice significantly less hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I stuck with the shampoo and my hair felt felt stronger and looked fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an organic, great smelling shampoo that actually does what it says, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair re-growth shampoos and Id have to say this one is the best. Obviously you&#x27;re not gonna see a drastic change after one use but you can really see a difference in the health of your hair. Every time I took a shower I had tons of hair falling out and after using this shampoo I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference, little to nothing is falling out and I haven&#x27;t even been using it that long. I&#x27;m defiantly going to keep using this shampoo its a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo ever!  This works great and I would recommend to all of people with hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> Having sparse hair is bad, having it when you are 48 is worse. I have tried many hair growth products, and have been happy. I was quite surprised;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, suds up nice, and after a week my sparse hair is feeling thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is made in our own country, so when I read the label I know exactly what I&#x27;m getting. All the ingredients are natural and or plant based. So far So happy. I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not harsh on my hair, and I can definitely see a difference already. I know theres new hair growing because my receding hairline is less now. It&#x27;s easy to use, the price is great for the amount of product you get and the quality of the shampoo. It smells great and it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s organic and natural. My hair is lush, thicker, and healthier. I am so satisfied and I would buy this product again. I definitely recommend it!.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a organic way to hekp with my hair loss , looking forward to thick beautiful hair again.</li>
    <li> I have used many Hair Loss Shampoos, and this is the best one I have used.    And, the new hair is even stronger than my old hair.    The shampoo even smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a great organic product. The tea tree, peppermint, eucalyptus and rosemary oils condition my scalp and my hair has never felt healthier. It smells nice and shampooing my hair now feels more like a ritual than a chore. I highly recommend to stimulate hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair loss shampoo for quite a while now, and I&#x27;m encouraged with the results so far. My hair is both wiry-fine and also has been slowly but surely stopped growing in a couple of scalp areas, on my crown most noticeably. So far I&#x27;ve detected that my hair shafts are thicker where I&#x27;ve been maintaining hair, and I&#x27;m beginning to see slight renewed growth on my crown with regular use of this shampoo. I think it&#x27;s keeping my follicles vital by keeping them clean, unclogged, and stimulating them to produce hair as they are naturally programmed to do. I am optimistic that will longer use I will see more filling in on top, but am very satisfied my hair is not falling out so rapidly now on top. I&#x27;ve become accustomed to how my look has changed over the years, still, I&#x27;m excited that I&#x27;m keeping what I have remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do also appreciate how the shampoo&#x27;s natural oils add body and hydration to my naturally extremely dry hair and scalp, too. I used to have these little eruptions or bumps on my scalp, and haven&#x27;t experienced this, whatever it is, after a couple of weeks of using this shampoo. And overall my hair feels and looks a lot more vibrant since I started this regimen every morning, so I really like the results I&#x27;m getting with it.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this product wont reorder this again</li>
    <li> I can not believe how fast I am seeing results with this product.I have been suffering from extreme hair loss and my hair was literally falling out in clumps.I was so embarrassed I would wear my hair up to try to disguise my thinning hair.I decided to try Phytoworx Hair Loss Shampoo since it is an organic blend I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. Within a few weeks of using it I noticed my hair felt stronger and healthier and I didn&#x27;t see any hair clumps in my shower or in my hair brush!I just recently went to get my hair trimmed and my hairdresser was so impressed she asked me what I was doing to make my hair look so healthy and pointed out my hair was growing back.I told her about this product and she said she would be recommending it to several of her customers that have similar problems.</li>
    <li> Since using this product my hair is thicker! I have noticed a small amount of growth in the areas where I need it most! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My hair now looks stronger and fuller thanks to Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo. The shampoo does not have a bad scent, but more of a natural smell, which is not bad. I wanted a shampoo that would help my hair loss while being environmentally friendly and that is exactly what this is. In addition to having some hair thinning, I had dandruff which this shampoo seemed to get rid of completely. It is a little pricey, but it works. I am very satisfied and will purchase it again so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how quickly this improved the condition of my hair. My hair was thinning and flat, but now it looks and feels fuller and has volume. It leaves my hair shiny and healthier. It feels great to get these amazing results with no harsh chemicals. It has a light, fresh, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This product is not for me. After using it and even with two conditioners I can&#x27;t get a comb through my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I purchased this product and I love it.  I&#x27;ve always had thin hair, ever since I was small and as a grown up, I&#x27;ve tried multiple things but this shampoo leaves my hair looking fuller.  Each bottle lasts me a a couple weeks and it&#x27;s the purchase I never hesitate on buying. I saw the difference within a week and I&#x27;m so grateful for it.</li>
    <li> this it is a great shampoo for mens than other in shops, this a good option and use it combined for best results.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo it works great and nit only can you feel a difference you can clearly see a difference in your hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo is outstanding!  I was a bit tentative about purchasing it because it is a bit out of my price range, but the price is worth the end result by far. My hair was very thin and endlessly falling out. I started using this product and felt an immediate difference. My hair felt much thicker, and it was retaining moisture. I actually could see a difference after the first shampoo. This shampoo conditioned my hair more than enough. My hair looks like I got a perm and it is very shiny and silky. My co-workers asked me the first week of my using this product what I had changed because I had a whole new look! I will definitely continue to use this product. I have been using it now for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product you will not be disappointed with!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel amazing! I noticed the change within a short while of using and I feel amazing! My hair feels and looks thicker and stronger and it shines and bounces so beautifully! I love this product and I am so glad I bought it. It has done everything it said it would do and more for me This product is just simply amazing and one of the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I am a 24 year old female. I had really thin hair until I started using this product. My hair is thickening up and I have never had hair this nice till after this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve literally only been using this for 3 days and my hair already feels thicker. The one thing I do kinda miss is all the suds that come with other shampoos but it clearly states on the bottle that I shouldn&#x27;t expect suds.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will be buying more soon. I&#x27;d recommend this to everybody that would like to thicken and strengthen their hair.</li>
    <li> No description of the lab, or manufacturing place. Very poor packaging for such a expensive product. i tried 1 time and never again</li>
    <li> For years now I have been suffering from thinning hair and hair loss, I have searched high and low for what I would say is “The Right Stuff” but have always had the worse luck when it comes to hair thinning shampoos that are supposed to help. NOT anymore, I am so pleased to say that Phytoworx organic Hair Loss Shampoo is truly a hidden gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo now for over a month every other day and have had tremendous results. The fact that it is organic and sulfate free make for a much better quality product that is safer to use and by the way it also smells great. These days I rarely see hair falling out and I have also notice that my hair has thickened and that’s huge for me. I give this product A+++</li>
    <li> I wanted to believe it truly helped some. . But it&#x27;s not worth the money I paid for it,  I ended up using 1/4 the product so I could &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; my hair and it could work.  My hair falls the same amount if not more. It only lasted literally 10 times.  A week has 7days!! The 5 stars reviews are very sketchy.  Just saying. ..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I search and read and searched some more, trying different products along the way but none have compared to the results that I received after three weeks of trying this product. I colored my hair before trying this product and already I need to retouch my roots because growth is very noticeable. Not only that, my hair appears thicker and softer. I am happy that I have finally found a product that gives me the amazing results that I desperately sought.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent. I experience less shedding of my hair and have seen quite a bit of hair growth in areas where I was experiencing some hair loss. I also love the way my scalp and hair feels when using this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. It is a bit different than the previous one. Last order had brown shampoo, this one is white and is more like conditioner than shampoo. But it is still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish if could order the previous version of shampoo in some way!</li>
    <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for, an organic shampoo but not just a shampoo but a hair loss shampoo. It is so fresh and smells good too. I am suffering from hair loss and  couldn&#x27;t find one that really gives me the satisfying result. after a couple of weeks using this product, I immediately noticed the big difference! Hair growing fast and noticeably less hair fall. Felt so light and stronger. Even gives me a shiny hair. I even recommended this shampoo to my friend. Definitely it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has done wonders to my hair! Before use my hair was dry and limp and now it looks healthier and thicker than ever! Another plus is that it&#x27;s organic which is really important when it comes to strengthening hair and making it healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Hairloss Shampoo for just a little while and I can&#x27;t believe it but I can really see and feel a difference in the thickness of my hair! Leaves my hair feeling clean and smells great too. Definitely recommend to anyone who is experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> Phytoworx shampoo works great. I was a little skeptical at first but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I really feel like my hair is thicker and fuller. The consistency of the producy is a bit syrupy, so be prepared when you pour it into your hands. The smell is very pleasant. I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting thicker looking and feeling hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many hair loss shampoos that haven&#x27;t worked! After using this I have noticed some hair starting to grow back. My scalp feels really clean and my hair that I have is thicker shinier and easier to handle. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Phytoworx organic is a great product for those looking for a little help with hair lost. I beening using it and see great results and not seeing hair coming out while in the shower. Works great and fast would recommend to anyone looking for a little help.</li>
    <li> I am a female in my mid-twenties and I lost a lot of hair after my first pregnancy. I noticed results within about a week of using it. This shampoo has definitely helped regain some of my lost hair and also makes it feel soft, healthy and thicker too. I love that it&#x27;s organic and natural. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> ORGANIC!! ORGANIC!! ORGANIC!!! I trust nothing but organic ingredients these days and this shampoo delivers!! Its not really a shampoo its more of a treatment for your hair. I couldnt be happier with the results, plus I feel the confidence that I am not massaging chemicals into my head. I have had thinning hair since a young age and I can finally see my hair getting thicker and stronger. I couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband, whos hair was thinning. After one bottle he noticed that he stopped losing hair and was actually getting some regrowth. He is so excited about it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Being a diabetic, my hair is very thin and falls out easily. Since using this product, my hair is healthier, stronger and there is a lot less breakage. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants fuller, thicker, healthier hair.</li>
    <li> In just a short amount of time there is a dramatic difference in the amount of hair that falls out after the shower.  A great product and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I just received another bottle of Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo and I love it. I don&#x27;t find hair in my comb any more and my hair is getting thicker! I use it with Hair MAXX and the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair loss shampoo on the market.  Results were INSTANTANEOUS, within the first three washes I started noticing more thickness and volume.  By week four some of the thinning hair on my head filled in and in the light you cant see the skin on my head anymore.  Im now five and a half months in and the bald spots on my head are almost completely gone.  This has been a huge help for me and also a confidence booster.</li>
    <li> Since I didn’t want to put a bunch of harsh chemicals on my hair, I decided to give this one a try to see if it could help regrow some of the hair I lost. After using the first bottle, I notice that my hair is thicker than what it was a month ago. It is slowly starting to fill in those areas where my hair was thinning out. Since having such great results myself, I decided to get some for my friend to try as well. I am going to tell anyone I can about this product. Not only is it made in the USA, but it is all-organic as well. It doesn’t get much better than that.</li>
    <li> I tried several natural shampoos.But after used it I noticing amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair thicker and fuller. I will continue using it and will share more results.</li>
    <li> I have tried umpteen shampoos, so I know from shampoos.  This is good stuff.  Sure it is expensive, but it&#x27;s your Hair!  It rinsed easily, and left hair with body and shine.  No miracles, but I did notice a thickening of my hair.  Scalp felt better too.  Will order second bottle, because I believe that it is less harmful for fragile hair than other shampoos on the store shelf.  I&#x27;ve reached the point where saving what is left is the priority.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few times already and I am amazed that it works as well as it does. I felt a significant difference and I suggest that others try it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, so I will be posting a review after 2-3 months in order to give reliable feedback.  I have relied on my own extensive research of these product reviews, so I&#x27;ll be sure to share my experience as well.. All I know right now is that it arrived in good time and smells great!! : )</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders on my hair ! It really did help with shedding which was a huge issue with my hair. Always shedding. Very organic. Great ! Just love it</li>
    <li> Shampoos come and go but so does my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss shampoos and some of them worked to some extent and some didn&#x27;t really work at all. Since I like the Phytoworx products, I decided to check it out. I&#x27;m no expert but maybe it&#x27;s the plant stem cells. Whatever it is, my receding hairline is stopped cold and my hair is thicker and fuller. For all of us that are trying to find the best shampoo for our folliclly impaired heads, I recommend you try this one out right away.</li>
    <li> I really love this product because of these organic ingredients. I&#x27;m very satisfied with how quick the hair thickening and revitalizing take. It has been about a month and my scalp is definitely healthier. You don&#x27;t really need a lot of the product and it&#x27;s really great that you can use it as a regular shampoo as well. It&#x27;s a really reliable product!</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old and i saw my hair was thinning, so i decided to give this a try hair its been a couple weeks now and i must say GREAT success! you can see the difference. I have seen a further decrease in the amount of hair I am shedding after a shower and throughout the day; it is thicker, stronger &amp; healthier. It gives a nice smell and after smoothing feel to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this shampoo, Yes! I have seen results after a little over a week, so it does work reasonably fast. Anyone who is experiencing similar thinning of hair and receding hairline could benefit from this shampoo. Even if you don’t think your problem is too severe, the shampoo can always help prevent further issues and give you thicker and lusher hair.\&lt;br /&gt;and for your own happiness it is worth the price!</li>
    <li> I started using this product and I like it. It actually doesn&#x27;t leave your hair rough or anything.</li>
    <li> this shampoo so far hasn&#x27;t been giving me any trouble , if anything it seems at though my hair has more strength than usual</li>
    <li> I started loosing my hair around my edges. I was so ashame i hat to wear wigs. I tried almost every product for hair growth, nothing work. until i use this marvelous product. My hair is back to normal. i So love this product.. Will be purchasing more</li>
    <li> I was advised to pick this up so I kept my expectations low. After about a couple of weeks using it, I clearly noticed a difference. My hair is more hydrated, and not so dried out like it usually is. Look, we all get older, and our hair isn&#x27;t what it used to be. It&#x27;s especially tough for us guys but I can say that this stuff is working. Plus, the fact that it&#x27;s organic really helped me make a decision. I&#x27;m tired of chemical shampoos that do nothing for the health of my hair. I have no doubt that if I keep this regimen up, I will see more hair growth.</li>
    <li> Great smelling shampoo, not a lot of lather but left hair feeling clean.  Interested in seeing thickening results in weeks to come.</li>
    <li> After having lost a lot of my hair due to medication and other health related illnesses, I was desperately looking for a hair product that actually works. I ordered Phytoworx and was amazed how nice it smelled, I could not wait to use it, after a short time, to my amazement, I saw little hairs &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; up all over the place. My hair started to get fuller, shiny, and just looking healthy. The best part is, there are no pills to take, I simply shampooed and watched my new hair grow. The days of hair loss are finally over. I am excited to have found a product that truly works.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo, your hair looks fantastic and revitalized. This organic shampoo contains absolutely no SLS or harsh chemicals, so you can feel comfortable and confident using it. Malus Domestica, stem cells produced by a rare Swiss apple, are included in this organic blend to promote healthy hair growth in a short period of time. If you&#x27;re looking for thicker, healthier and fuller hair, then this shampoo is perfect for you! I was not expecting the shampoo to have a great smell to it either because it is organic, but  it does leave a sweet smelling scent in your revitalized hair after washes. This purchase is definitely worth the money and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve the overall health or growth of their hair!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s organic and it has worked to reduce my hair loss. Since I’ve been using this shampoo my hair looks and feels fuller and reduced my shedding to “normal”. It lathers up nicely, smells great and leaves your hair feeling soft, not dry or damaged. All natural is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> So happy to find an organic product that actually WORKS for my hair! Totally worth the price - obviously, you get what you pay for. Within a few days of use I could already feel a difference, and after a couple weeks it is even more notable. Much less hair loss, hair feels healthier, fuller, and my scalp feels so much better too! I really like the smell as well.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have noticed less hair falling out. Also, I can feel that my follicles have become stronger allowing my hair to stay in thus becoming thicker in the thinning regions. The major plus of this product is that it is organic, so I am not damaging my hair with chemicals. I would recommend this product as an organic solution to those with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have been having issues with hair loss due to medical issues and I thought I was never going to have full hair again.  But since I have been using this it has changed the thickness and feel of my hair for sure. And I have noticed that the thinnest spots are becoming less noticeable. Very happy with this product so far and would buy again!</li>
    <li> Phytoworx user here! For a long time I have been using this product, attracted by the organic, sulfate-free content and the tea tree, peppermint, eucalyptus and rosemary oil. What can go wrong with this start? Nothing!&lt;br /&gt;I use the product everytime I wash my hair, which was starting to fall down at a high rate that years before. Not only it has slowered considerabily, but it looks stronger, nicer and the shampoo gives a very nice end touch and smell. I was using a conditioner before starting to use this product, but now I feel I don´t need it, I like the way the shampoo revitalizes my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying it!</li>
    <li> I give 5 stars based on the organic ingredients that they used  in the making of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance when you apply it on your hair. ( To those that doesn&#x27;t like fragrance, you&#x27;re perfectly safe )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros : healthy organic shampoo for your hair&lt;br /&gt;Cons : there is no foaming from the shampoo ( First time using shampoo that doesn&#x27;t produce foam )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone that having hair loss problem for all ages and gender</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this shampoo.  I was hopeful it would actually work for me, but was getting prepared to be disappointed yet again.  To my surprise, Phytoworx turned out to be the product that stopped my hair loss.  I know results vary, but for me, I noticed it working almost immediately.  Less and less hair was left on my comb, and for me, and what that meant for i&#x3D;me is that I no longer had to be embarrasses about my receding hairline.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works pretty great! The smell is clean and fresh. After using Phytoworx my hair felt healthier and fuller. Definitely a must try</li>
    <li> I am a very impatient person so right after using the shampoo for the first time i was looking for results. after only a WEEK i started seeing results! i have washed my hair once a day for a month now and and i can say for a fact this does exactly what it claims.it has a pleasant smell and is organic which i LOVE, right away my hair felt thicker and softer. when i bought it for the first time i had never spent more then a few dollars on a bottle of shampoo but i really wanted to a good quality hair loss shampoo and i found it! totally worth it i am so happy with my purchase i am buying more right now!</li>
    <li> I cant say enough good things about this shampoo. At first the price of it made me cringe ha but its so worth it!! The fact that its completely organic makes me feel so much better about using this shampoo as well, as I try to keep harsh chemicals away from my hair and my body. PLUS to top it off, this shampoo smells AMAAAAZING. for real. like almonds or something. My hair has grown at least a whole inch and my hair is also much stronger and shiny! :) you WONT regret purchasing this.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell if this product would make any difference in my hair loss.  After I thought about it, any change in your hair would come from the inside but this might spur things along.</li>
    <li> This is the best organic hair shampoo that cleans well without stripping the hair while having the purest of ingredients for it&#x27;s price. It also leaves behind other great benefits which include:  moisturizing, hydrating, clarifying and protecting tresses. This organic hair shampoo also strengthens and fortifies hair strands with the highest quality non-toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and absolutely love this shampoo.  After washing my hair with Phytoworx Organic shampoo my hair always feels very clean and my scalp actually tingles.  Before using Phytoworx the only other time I experienced that tingling sensation was when I got my hair washed in a very expensive salon so that feeling alone reassured me.  Also I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels/seems stronger since I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo.  My hair has stopped shedding/breaking badly when I brush my hair and a few people have asked me what I&#x27;m doing differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself has a very pleasant herb like smell that I really like.  Plus, it is sulfate free which was a major selling point for me.  Since there are no sulfates in this shampoo (and it is 100% organic) you don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals stripping/damaging your hair follicles or deal with the strange smell that some shampoos with sulfates have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am very happy with Phytoworx and the changes in my hair I have already noticed.  I plan to continue using it and I recommend it to anyone who is on the fence about trying a new organic shampoo brand.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the fact that this shampoo does not create a rich lather and it&#x27;s unique apple aroma turn you off. Or that it is a bit pricier than what you will find on supermarket shelves. This shampoo does really give you fuller, thicker hair. I am approx. 3/4 of the way thru my 1st bottle and I definitely notice my hair is thicker, fuller and shinier.  It moisturizes enough that I have no split ends and can use less product in my hair to keep it in shape. I tried this on a whim and am definitely &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; on it. I highly recommend it for those of you with thinning hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing! My hair looks and feels fuller and thicker, and the shampoo smells great. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells really good. Not the chemical kind of smell, but the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; good smell. There are many other products that claim the same thing, but this shampoo takes the plant stem cells approach.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re struggling with hair loss, look no further!! I bought this shampoo about 2 months ago and I have noticed the difference. I was struggling with losing my hair due to stress and life. I was tired of buying and spending money on other products that would not work. I was extremely skeptical at first but once I kept using it and I started to see a difference, I was amazed!! My hair looked healthier and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend was so astonish on how well this shampoo was working. I could run my fingers through my hair without shedding any. My hair increased in volume due to the thickness. I&#x27;m getting compliments from co-workers, and my hairdresser. My scalp feels a lot better and healthier. It&#x27;s just an amazing product, I&#x27;m dumbfounded how well this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a gentle shampoo with all the benefits of a vitalizing shampoo. I would recommend this product to anybody who&#x27;s having hair loss problems.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a month of using it every weekend I saw my hair longer. I like the smell and feel fresh when I wash my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair loss product I&#x27;ve found to work for my thinning hair. It does not have the harsh chemical smell that so many other hair loss shampoos do. It&#x27;s defiantly worth the cost -- for real results! Its sulfate free and I feel more comfortable using something with organic ingredients.  Don&#x27;t waste your time trying any other products.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few month due to thinning hair. All I can say is AMAZING. Definitely an item to try for hair loss and thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several hair loss shampoos for my thinning hair, and let me to tell you, this is the best one so far! I noticed a great improvement in the condition of my scalp, and my hair is no longer thinning! The organic ingredients really nourish your scalp and hair from root to end. It smells amazing too! I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over a week and I&#x27;m already seeing results. My hair isn&#x27;t falling out like it used to. Less hair in my sink drain and less in the shower drain. My hair is thicker and noticeably fuller. It just feels healthier. I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural too because my wife has been getting her hair done for the last few years at a place where they use no chemicals and her hair has become fuller and thicker. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of the all natural products they use to do her hair. I just like the idea that there are no harmful chemicals in this shampoo. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product works ! It takes time to notice how healthy your hair looks (a week or 2) but I will buy this product again and again! Def Recommend !</li>
    <li> Long story short: It works and it&#x27;s effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s already been a few days and I have noticed a significant increase in my hair&#x27;s health. It has a nicer sheen, it&#x27;s stronger, there&#x27;s less falling out when I brush, and my hair has never felt better! The shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t gather much of a lather, so it feels like it melts into your hair, but it is very effective regardless. It is also gentle and isn&#x27;t harsh like other shampoos that use artificial chemicals, yet it gives my hair a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of all that, it&#x27;s made in the USA! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I could not believe how soft , straight and  how healthy my hair felt and looked after trying this. I will never use anything else to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Number one, the smell of this shampoo is incredible.  As soon as I opened the bottle, the aroma of the shampoo hit my nose and I was like, &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;As for as the performance of the shampoo; when I showered I expected a lot of lather.  It didn&#x27;t lather much so I was initially like, ok, that&#x27;s different.  However, over the course of about a week or so of using the product I began to notice that when I brushed my hair out, there wasn&#x27;t as many hairs left in the sink as I am accustomed to seeing and I was like, hmm, that&#x27;s interesting.  It let me know that the shampoo was beginning to work and that apparently I wasn&#x27;t shedding nearly as much as normal, which is what I was hoping the product would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a friend suggested that  I try the product, I asked him what made this product better than any other shampoo I&#x27;d used.  He let me see his bottle and I read the ingredients and noticed that it was all organic, which I figured had to be better for my hair than the chemical rich shampoo I&#x27;ve been accustomed to using.  You cant go wrong with ingredients such as peppermint, plant stem cells, tea tree, eucalyptus, apple, and coconut oils.  The fact that it&#x27;s a Swiss product was appealing to me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion PhytoWorx has put out a high quality product that I&#x27;m really enjoying using.</li>
    <li> This organic shampoo is definitely worth the extra money! After using Phytoworx, my hair and scalp feel healthier. My hair is looking more like it used to - full, soft and shiny. It had become dull with a brittle fuzzy feel when I realized it was thinning and refused to hold a style. Now I can swing it around and it has that little bounce of healthy hair! My hair has started to grow back and it has grown back healthier and fuller! I recommend this for anyone that needs hair.</li>
    <li> This product is worth your money! I purchased this product for my Aunt who suffers from menopause induced hair loss. With the vast amount of hair loss shampoo found on Amazon, I choose this shampoo for my Aunt due it strong presence of coconut oil and Aloe Vera juice that are ORGANIC which are incorporated into the shampoo. Her hair is initially prone to breakage and split ends in addition to various small balding spots. Within 1 months of treatment, the appearances of split ends and bald spots were reduced and signs of new life became apparent in certain areas of the balding scalp. It is no longer prone to dandruff or oil accumulation. My aunt will continue to use this product to further her results, but overall, this price of this product is worth every benefit.</li>
    <li> This shampoo takes time to work like around a month or so, but I suggest stick with it and you&#x27;ll get results. I use it sparingly and mix it with other my regular shampoos for longevity. What made me interested is it&#x27;s organic, targets hair loss, and leaves your hair feeling refreshed. If you are looking for results in a week that&#x27;s too soon, but given time you notice your hair is stronger, thicker, and stays on your head not the floor.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo to add some volume to my thinning hair. It doesn&#x27;t foam like regular shampoos, but is more like a serum that you put on your scalp and leave on for about 2 minutes before rinsing it off. So if your hair tends to get very oily, I would suggest you use it at night before you go to bed and then wash your hair with regular shampoo in the morning to remove the excess oil. That&#x27;s what I have been doing and I my hair really looks much fuller and shinier now. I also have less hair on my brush now when I comb it so it seems to keep my hair from falling out. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants to do something about thinning hair.</li>
    <li> With always having fine, poker straight hair, I learned to adapt to styles and caring for it. When it started shedding more and more and then breaking, wrapped up in a bun had become my new and only look. I came across Phytoworx Shampoo and with the huge plus of it being made without having harsh chemicals....I figured what more could I lose....Now....I am pleased more and more every time I use it. My hair isn&#x27;t like the shedding dog that made me feel so self-conscious. I am finally comfortable leaving my hair down, again.&lt;br /&gt;Personal tip: The directions say to massage it into your scalp first and let it sit for a couple minutes before working through the rest of your hair. I have long hair and since it doesn&#x27;t get all sudsy like most shampoos, I found if I tilt my head over it&#x27;s easier to wash through for full coverage. Plus, I use less product that way, too, while still getting the full effect of the natural cleansing and conditioning ingredients. I find the aroma very calming, too, which I so appreciate!</li>
    <li> My hair is in love. I am so excited to see some amazing results.</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo today, i used it already, it smells greats and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry which is great some shampoos dry out the hair, also I didn&#x27;t have hair coming out in the shower I would definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I will admit that it took some time to get used to this shampoo. No lather and a non-perfume aroma but a very earthy one. But, it was recommended to me by a friend who said &amp;#34;Stick with it.&amp;#34; so I have been doing just that. I am into my 4th bottle now and cannot be more pleased with the results. My hair feels stronger when I run my fingers thru it. My hair has a healthier appearance. And best of all, my hair IS thicker and fuller than before I started using Phytoworx. I highly recommend it and pass on the words that were told to me...Stick with it!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful shampoo. I have been using it for a short period of time and I am already seeing results. I have long hair but it’s thin. This shampoo makes my hair look fuller and shiny. Also this shampoo has nice smell and full of organic fruits and vegetables which doesn’t make your hair look dull or rough at all. Loved it from the first use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  After just a week or so I had noticeably less shedding, and a week or two after that I had much more volume than before.  My hair feels thicker and healthier, and has started to re-grow on parts of my scalp that haven&#x27;t seen hair in ages! And to top it all off, it doesn&#x27;t have that weird chemical smell some other hair growth products have, and doesn&#x27;t leave any gross residue.  For anyone who is unhappy with the way their hair is aging, I definitely recommend trying PhytoWorx!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and I really like how my hair is growing back on the top and front sides nicely.  My hair is really soft and my mom noticed I&#x27;ve got it growing back in.  Mom&#x27;s know!</li>
    <li> Great organic product that has helped give me fuller hair.  I decided to give this a try because of my thinning hair, and it works great.  I&#x27;m seeing some regrowth and have gotten multiple comments that my hair looks fuller and healthier.  I would highly recommend this product and have already ordered some for my father.</li>
    <li> I found out that the difference is in the quality of the ingredients. First off, there is nothing like it on the market and therefore the only way to compare it really is in the results. These will not spectacular for everyone, so I cannot speak for all but me. COnsider the ingredients, they did work for me, and I will but my third bottle. I am proud to say I use Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo, and I see a change.</li>
    <li> This plant stem cell organic blend shampoo for hair regrowth contains powerful essential oils that stops hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;This powerful sulfate free shampoo gives immediate hair growth results.&lt;br /&gt;The results will leave your hair thicker with noticeably healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo to help liven up my hair a bit and it seems this one is doing the trick. I don&#x27;t really like to use product or leave-in conditioners that have a bunch of chemicals and ingredients I am not familiar with. This shampoo is composed of all natural ingredients including a complex variety of plant extracts and and oils. After about two weeks of use my hair is significantly thicker with more volume and the brown is darker and richer in tone. In addition to smooth, rich look, my hair also feels smooth to the touch and my curls are much more defined. My hair looks and feels much healthier now that I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo and I will be buying another bottle when the time comes in a month or two. I am impressed!</li>
    <li> Very happy to have found this organic shampoo to help my hair growth.  After having very thin and fine hair all my life I noticed after I used the product my hair felt  thicker.  It was a positive sign.  A lot less hair loss is the drain was a another great  sign that the product was working.  My scalp was feeling better and less itchy so there is something else that I noticed with the shampoo - another great sign.  I am trying to see if it will help my hair growth in addition to keeping my hair I have left, on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other things I like about this product is it smells great and does make my hair significantly thicker and easier to manage. I have had some guys at the office ask me what&#x27;s different about my hair.  I think they really noticed and I believe it is stimulating hair growth as well.  Great shampoo!  I have recommended to a couple of friends who could stand to follow my lead.  It works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic, and was hesitant to try something new on my thinning hair. My girlfriend told me about this shampoo and after seeing the results she had with her hair, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s been three weeks and my hair is feeling softer, thicker and looks phenomenal. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting to be careful, but with organic ingredients and results like this, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> So far after just a few weeks of using this product I see a slight difference in the thickness of my hair. I like that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to lather too much because I feel like it helps keep the oils in. After the first use I felt like my hair was already a bit thicker but didn&#x27;t want to jinx it by telling everyone. It was def more evident though when others noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was my hair every few days and I love the results so far. Not only does my hair look thicker but it feels thicker as well when I style it. it also leaves it shiny which is an added plus!</li>
    <li> I can say Phtytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo really works!!! Its worth the buy and I recommend it to anyone who has gone through the trials of finding the right shampoo to have volume, shiny, growing hair. The rosemary eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree oils smells are so heavenly!!! The fact that it is organic is a plus too. After using so many other harsh shampoos filled with harming chemicals I longed for the right shampoo to make my hair healthy and growing again. Now that I found Phtytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo I am all smiles again. My boyfriend too, he loves the beautiful smell and softness of my hair now!!! ;-)</li>
    <li> My hair looks &amp; feels great! The best part is the ingredients, how wonderful that natural, plant derived ingredients work so well &amp; smell soooo good. My hair feels thicker &amp; has more luster. I color my hair &amp; the shampoo is not at all harsh (prob because no chemicals) so the color was not affected.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is disappointing.  It coats the hair.  Indeed, this makes the hair thicker.  But, my hair is darker and not shiny at all.  Dull describes my hair when using PhytoWorx.  My hair also appears darker.  There is no sudsing at all so it is difficult to determine if all parts of your hair are getting shampooed. (They do warn of the lack of sudsing on the container.)  Does PhytoWorx stop hair loss?  Empirical evidence is lacking.  Lastly, for $55+ I could have bought twice as much of most any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to expect to see new hair growth, but my hair seems healthier, more youthful, and my scalp feels better as well. Not seeing hair loss increasing, so am encouraged. Trying to go sulfate free with products wherever possible, and have found a soy-based hairspray as well. At any rate, no one product will work for everyone, but I&#x27;m hopeful to grow new hair soon.</li>
    <li> I absolute love this hair product. My hair has been thinning in the last few months and I couldn&#x27;t find any hair product on the market that really worked until I found this. Instant results after the first wash. I definitely recommend to any body who wants instant results.</li>
