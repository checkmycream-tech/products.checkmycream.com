<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this set.  The colors go with pretty much any finger nail polish.  The black one looks like mesh and is my favorite</li>
    <li> Ordered these from NailBeauty4U because I&#x27;ve ordered from them in the past and the items always arrive quickly and as described. This time was no different. I received my polishes in 2 business days and they&#x27;re all here. I love that CG is offering multiple shatter colors, unlike the lone black offered by OPI. I can&#x27;t wait to try out all sorts of combinations with these. Have played with them a bit today and they are easy to use and create a great effect on the nail.</li>
    <li> Loved every one of the colors.. alot of people complain about the purple one not shattering I did not have any  issues with it. I also have the opi black shatter and I will say it is very simular.</li>
    <li> I got this and it works amazing! The black, white, grey, blue, and purple work good for me. The pink is back and forth. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve found that if I paint it on vertically sometimes it just crackles with straight lines, but if I paint vertically and horizontally, it will make amazing crackles. I haven&#x27;t used the Katy Perry Shatter nail polish yet, but I still love this one no matter what!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this crackle nail polish, I was going to purchase the OPI crackle but the China Glaze has more crackle colors.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the pictures that some of the women uploaded here on Amazon helped me decide to purchase- some of the nails are soo cute! I will be uploading my own here- I will keep messing with the color combos and  show my results. So far I LOVE THIS STUFF&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;All you do is brush on a crackle polish on top of any dry nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;You apply it as if it was a top coat, it was very weird to watch it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it- and it started to seperate on my nails, and give the crackle look.&lt;br /&gt;Then the directions say to apply a clear coat like you would any other polish.&lt;br /&gt;This polish is very cool and the colors are bold but not bright- neon colors.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking I am going to purchase the other China Glaze Crackle sets that have the brighter more neon colors.&lt;br /&gt;The look is pretty funky, and I really like it- It is different!</li>
    <li> this product is awesome, i ordered it from here because it runs about $8 a bottle at beauty supply stores.China Glaze Crackle arrived within a few days and i&#x27;ve tried 4 of the 6 colors to so far and have recieved so many compliments. Also great looking as a french tip.</li>
    <li> Got this set for my wife for her birthday because this is the brand the local nail salon uses.  She loves it and it was a lot less expensive than if I bought it around here ($8 a bottle at the salon).  She&#x27;s tried all of the colors and they all look/work great.</li>
    <li> Nice colors...but the purple is the only one that doesn&#x27;t really crackle like the rest. However, perfect for nail polish collection. Perfect for the summer!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old granddaughter and she loved it.  She did a different color on each nail to start.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Beauty Knockout. The shipping was very quick only 3 days. I purchased the set of all 6 and they came to me in perfect condition and also for a great price:) Thanks so much. I can&#x27;t wait to try so many different nail combinations!</li>
    <li> I love these nail polishes!! They&#x27;re perfect for spring and summer plus I get a lot of compliments on it</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, easy to use, beautiful colors and a unique effect.  Equal to OPI but half the cost.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great price for the set! Ability to create endless combinations as long as you have many base colors. Create your own look or use one that China Glaze has already recommended for the different color crackle polishes.</li>
    <li> I love the nail polishs. They came about 1 week earlier than the estimated date :) so thats always a PLUS! But they just came wrapped in some bubble wrap, I thought it was suppose to come in a box.. but i didn&#x27;t like the packaging at all!!!</li>
    <li> China Glaze offers the best collection of fun colors. Once you allow the base color to set and then apply the Crackle, the look is hot and fun. Then just seal with a top coat. It allows the polish to lasts as well too. Crackle is an easy and fun look to your every day polish. My clients love it!</li>
    <li> I went to 3 stores to find this crackle and nobody had it in.  They all said  it just flew off the store shelves, so I went to the place I always go to when I just can&#x27;t find a aparticular  product and am 99% satisfied.  The Crackle nail polish was just what I wanted and was received in time for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.    Thanks for a job well done!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish, and so do my clients! It&#x27;s easy to use and the colors are great. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an edgy, eye-catching look.</li>
    <li> I would of given 5 stars but there&#x27;s one thng I dont like about the polish....... It pretty much dries before you can paint your whole nail and gets a little clumpy. Other than that, they are amazing. Love the colors</li>
    <li> this product works well. it is long lasting and you see results almost immediately. i really like the colors, but it took a while longer for me to receive the products (they did not come on the estimated date). i understand it&#x27;s an estimation, but it shouldnt take 3 weeks for me to receive a product.</li>
    <li> Love the color set!  Work great.  This was my first purchase of China Glaze products and I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Pro:  +Adds that little extra something to spice up your nails  +Endless options with multiple crackle colors  +Easy to apply and dries very quickly  +Lasts long  +Great value in buying a whole set   +Crackles better than OPI and Sally Hansen  Cons:  -Time consuming because you need a base coat, base color, crackle coat and top coat.   -Some crackle colors don&#x27;t crack as well as others. Black works great, purple not so much...  -Missing some key colors. I actually bought OPI because I wanted red and navy crackle :(</li>
    <li> I watched quite a few reviews for this product online before buying it...and I love it so much! they crackle so nice, except the purple color not quite as much as the others, but look wonderful over just about any color that you want!     I would definitely order this again, and refer a friend. The shipping was quick, and well packaged. Hope this helps, and that you enjoy your crackle nails!</li>
    <li> This polish is super easy to use and leaves a great fun crackle.   Definitely try if you&#x27;re looking to save some money at home  as oppose to going to the salon. Once polished it lasts a good  Time too.</li>
    <li> Everywhere I&#x27;ve been with this polish on it&#x27;s been noticed.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with application.  Right now I have chrome base nail polish on with the black crackle.  Looks great............</li>
    <li> I love this product! The only downside is that I don&#x27;t think the white crackles as much as the others. But that is my only complaint!</li>
    <li> These crackle nail polishes work just as good as the OPI but are WAY less expensive. Colors are very true to the picture that is posted. The packaging was great and nothing could have broke, shifted, or even budged the way this company packaged it! Great Job!</li>
    <li> I was totally hyped about OPI&#x27;s shatter when it first came out, but was disappointed in how goopey the formula was. The shatter effect was perfect, but I felt like it had to be replaced like once a month. I have never liked OPI, so when ChinaGlaze came out with their version, I knew it was time to go shopping! It was impossible to get them in store, so naturally I headed to Amazon. Buying the set saved about 6$, plus it saved me time. The set contains all 6 of the original crackle colors they came out with: Pink, Tiffany&#x27;s blue, black, grey, white and purple. There are now metallic shades as well, but I prefer matte myself. The crackle effect was just as good as the Shatter, but without the goop! These will last me forever :) As with any crackle/shatter polish, work quickly and apply a thin coat for the best results. Definitely worth the price!! &lt;3 me some ChinaGlaze ^_^</li>
    <li> Quick shipment. Great nail polishes. The mailman left the polishes out in the mailbox instead of up by my door, so the nail polish was hot and didnt crack like it should. But once at room temp it worked. Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I bought the OPI black shatter and then decided to try the China Glaze version. This kind does not clump up in the bottle like OPI and I like the crackle of this kind better! It also doesn&#x27;t need a top coat to be shiny like the OPI does.</li>
    <li> China Glaze Crackles are by far superior to it&#x27;s competitors.  Was thrilled to score this collections after countless trips to beauty stores in search of shatter or crackle coats.  Seems to be a bit thinner than the OPI shatter.  I had also tried the Sally Hansen version in silver and it was truly pathetic in comparison.  I like how the Crackle goes on and that I can manipulate the strokes w/o it looking like a big dull clump.  Color is definitely great and is easy to play around with without thickening up too much.  The price to purchase all 6 was also awesome compared to salon pricing.  Thanks to China Glaze for continuing to fuel my addiction, XOXO!</li>
    <li> This polish crackles, but each color seems to have a different consistancy.  The think stuff doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look as nice.  The colors that are thinner in  consistancy go on better and look nicer.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Love it. Excellent service from the company and Amazon also. One broke in the mail and they replaced it, no problem.</li>
    <li> Even though it says arrival time the 15th I got it 4 days after I&#x27;m really happy now waiting for my other package though</li>
    <li> This polish is really neat! I have had fun trying different color combinations. You will definitely want to let the base coat dry before applying the crackle. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had this same thing--but with mine, I get really fine crackles and not the chunky look that is shown in many of the pictures. I&#x27;ve tried applying a thicker coat, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference. Even with that, I still think it spices up a boring ol&#x27; color and is a must-try for everyone. It also lasts for a long time. It stayed looking great for a week until I took it off to try another. Don&#x27;t overlap with the brush strokes either--those places won&#x27;t crackle.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a higher rating but some of the colors were REALLY clumpy. I ended up throwing a few out a few months after buying this. Maybe I just got a bad batch? Or maybe some of the colors just tend to clump. I don&#x27;t know. But overall, it was a good buy because I could change my nail look whenever I wanted. A great tip to try is using any of the crackles over OPI&#x27;s liquid sand because the effect is amazing and the crackle/shatter effect really pops. I have an obsession with my nails, and will try anything once.</li>
    <li> I got these so fast. Ordered on a friday and got them Monday.  So far I have used Fault Line, Broken Hearted, and Black Mesh. I have the opi shatter and have not seen any difference. If you aren&#x27;t get any shatter/crackle it&#x27;s user error. You need completely dry nail polish then apply the crackle.You need to apply nail polish first these crackles are topcoats for other nail polish colors. How much product on the brush and the pressure you put on the brush while applying makes a difference. Very little polish &#x3D; small cracks. Thicker coats &#x3D; bigger more chunky cracks. BUT again it depends on the pressure you apply to the brush too. Black Mesh is really no different than OPI&#x27;s black shatter  I see similar patterns using the crackle. I think the crackle maybe a tad thinner than the black shatter but I am seeing less clumping and goop per maincure with the crackle than the OPI. I also like the china glaze brush better than OPI, I hate the pro wide brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my crackle collection :)</li>
    <li> I watched many tutorials how to apply this product. You have to practice to apply it just the right way. Too thick, and if you overlap, it looks horrible. Too much hype over nothing.</li>
    <li> If only I could get it to work!! Tried it 3 different times with different colors and never comes out good. Not worth $30!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I received my crackle nail polish!  The shipping was quick and painless.  And my package showed up a day before the estimated delivery date, which is ALWAYS a nice surprise.  The colours are alittle different then what it apprears in the pictures privided.  But pretty close, considering they&#x27;re online pictures.  I didn&#x27;t expect the colours to be 100% accurate.  But, if I had to rate the accuracy of colour, I would say 97% spot on for being true to its colour in the pictures.  I only had the chance to try the gray crackle polish.  And it did not disappoint.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colours next!    I would definitely recommend this crackle nail polish to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This polish rocks!! It looks super cool and you have so many different choices. Just one coat and it looks crackly. If you do more than that it won&#x27;t look good. Also if you don&#x27;t use enough it can dry a little light in color. Either way it looks awesome on natural and acrylic nails. Just use a good top coat!</li>
    <li> My friend used this nailpolish on me the other day and I just had to order it myself. I&#x27;m in love! The price was very reasonable and it shipped EXTREMELY quickly. It was here within three days! Unfortunately, one bottle (the white) one broke, though they were all bubble wrapped. Still, 5 for $16 is still a good deal regardless.</li>
    <li> China Glaze Crackle Polish works great!!!! I love all the colors and this is a GREAT price!! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was such a great addition my large collection of nail polish. I how it goes on and I love just sitting there watching it crackle :) but I hate how I leave the brush out to long and it gets clumpy around the rim, I gotta stop that. The way it was package was so cute to me, and I also like that it came so fast but it seemed liek forever since i was so eager. 5 frigging stars&lt;333</li>
    <li> Ive never been to China but I can tell you great glaze is made there. This was the first crackle type that I bought my wife, we have nothing to compare it too. We had great results with her toes, and then we put the glaze on and it made everything even better. As far as paint on toes, that already have paint on them, this stuff looks really nice (crackled).</li>
    <li> AWESOME AWESOME AWSEOME. WHAT A COOL IDEA. I BOUGHT A BOTTLE OF BLACK, THE STORE OFFERED 5 COLORS. I WASNT SURE ID LIKE IT. THE EFFECT IS FAR OUT. I WENT ALL OVER TOWN THE FOLLOWING WEEEK AND EVERYONE WAS SOLD OUT.. SO I ORDERED ON LINE. THEY CAME QUICK. THE COLORS ARE  COOL AND  YOU CAN DO SO MUCH WITH IT. BUY THEM YOU WILL LOVE IT. A NEW FAD</li>
    <li> NOTHING like the OPI version first of all, and on top of that its a horrible nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not to mentions it took 3 weeks to get here.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is very similar to the OPI Shatter product.  The biggest different inbetween the two is that the China Glaze is a thicker product &amp; I need to dip into bottle more often to cover a nail, that is with 1 coat.  Like the variety of crackle affect nail polish, not just black like the OPI Shatter.</li>
    <li> I HATE giving bad reviews but I feel there are times prospective consumers should know what they are getting into. It looks nothing like the pictures. I am perfectly capable of reading directions. I am organic chemistry student, so my reading skills and ability to follow directions are up to par. The product, however is not. I tried many base colors. I tried applying the crackle in different ways. Nothing produced results of ANY quality in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and 3 days later it actually showed up in my mailbox!  Super product, super fast shipping.  I am ordering more for &#x27;stocking stuffers&#x27; for Christmas.  It&#x27;s never too early to start shopping. :)</li>
    <li> Very fun nail polish! So many combinations! Just don&#x27;t overlap and you get very good results. The purple doesn&#x27;t have as much of a crackle effect as the other colors but I like that it&#x27;s kind of shimmery once a top coat is applied. I&#x27;m glad that I was able to purchase all the colors together considering that the part of the country I live in it is very hard to find these polishes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughters...ages 16 and 12.  They absolutely loved it!  We went to get maniicures 2 weeks prior and they offered the \\&quot;crackle\\&quot; manicure for $12.  They thought it was very cool. So for roughly $40 bucks we received many manicures from China Glaze.  They both have fun with it and I think it was totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> The polishes were well packed for traveling, arrived in great condition and were mailed shortly after having made my purchase. I like not having to wait a few days before receiving a reply on my purchase. They were timely and efficient and I would definitely do business with them again!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves them!! They work just as well as the OPI crackle and come in great colors!! The price was unbeatable compared to buying one bottle of OPI.</li>
    <li> My daughter love the nail polish and the seller forwarded the product in a very resonable time.  Great service</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was easy, fun, and the effects were great. I plan on getting the same set for my daughter.</li>
    <li> My product came fast--very fast!  None of the bottles were damaged, and everything was there.  I love the color options, and that it works with any brand of nail polish.  I had been looking for crackle nail polish everywhere and was not finding it.  I definitely recommend this,China Glaze was great and 6 colors for $23 (including shipping) was AWESOME.    My only note is to make sure your crackle layer is thin...thicker layers look bad and you have to strip the whole nail.  Wipe the brush between every nail.</li>
    <li> Love the beautiful colors and great results. I used the Crushed Candy on top of an orange base color on my nails and toe nails and looks great. Needs a clear top coat to make it shinnier and last longer.     Fast shipping and great price too!</li>
    <li> Good quality stuff. I ended up giving them away because I don&#x27;t really like the colours but it is very good quality stuff. Bought these on a whim. Just like the OPI shatter, if not better.</li>
    <li> This product can be great with just a few tips.    * For best results allow whatever base color you are using to dry COMPLETELY before applying Crackle. This kind of irks me as it adds an extra five minutes to a mani or pedi but it is vital for the best result.     * Also apply a thin coat. Thicker coats (especially in the purple for some reason) tend to simply split rather than crackle and it can look clumpy.    * You must also make sure to dip the brush all the way back into the bottle when moving from nail to nail. Otherwise the product very quickly builds up in gobs on the rim of the bottle and brush and you will end up with one hot mess.    * Play around with your top coats. Love, love, love Crackle with a matte top coat.     Once again China Glaze outdoes OPI! Love these so much more than Shatter and the variety of colors is awesome. My clients have had mixed feelings about this look but for the right person it creates endless color combinations and a very easy nail art. Did a pedi with the black Crackle over a China Glaze Black Diamond (an asphalt gray) then finished off with silver zebra stripes over the top. AWESOME. Can&#x27;t wait to play even more.</li>
    <li> The product (set of 6 polishes)is fine.  Not sure it holds up as well as OPI, but it works well.</li>
    <li> First off I got my package way early then expected, every bottle was nicely wraped in bubble wrap , so every bottle was hugged with protection.. I would def buy product from the seller..</li>
    <li> Ordered these from china glaze and received them very quickly and in good quality. I&#x27;m very happy with these polishes. They work very well and there are so many different color combination&#x27;s to try.</li>
    <li> I have received a number of compliments on this product.... I love the fact that using a different base gives a new look everytime.</li>
    <li> I really like the black crackle. I find it works the best. A clear top coat makes a big differnce in the over all effect of the polish because the colors are quite dull looking on their own. It takes a bit of practice to figure out how thick of thin to apply the polish so don&#x27;t get discouraged if the color you used doesn&#x27;t turn out how you expect. Keep using it and you will figure it out! Overall I love the Crackle nail polish!</li>
    <li> hi i am happy with the China Glaze but i realise that it does not crack much on certain polishes as much as others,my clients love them and they are showing off to their friends.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome, I was skeptical at first that it wasn&#x27;t really going to work really well.. But it looks amazing, so many different colors you can play around with and different styles.. It&#x27;s a lot of fun.. Worth the money I paid.. :)</li>
    <li> I think for what it costs it was cheap. for only $23 i got 6 colors. definitely a most. I like it can do different designs without trying to hard.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail today, ordered it Saturday night and got it thursday morning. Decided to try it out and the china glaze brand works just as good as the 8 dollar bottles I&#x27;ve been buying at CVS. I think maybe better not as clumpy. Very much in love, cant wait till my niece comes over later to play around with it on her too! :-)</li>
    <li> Love how you can have an ordinary nail polish color and give it something extra.. I enjoy it and like it a lot. Will buy another set for my nieces since they love doing their nails I think this would be something fun to add into the mix of manicures and pedicures..</li>
    <li> I really like this set of polishes. The price was very reasonable, and the colors dramatic and intense. The seller was prompt and made sure everything was protected when mailed out. Nothing broken, no dissapointment. Happy with purchase would reccomend highly.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice but it doesn&#x27;t crackle as well.  The purple one didn&#x27;t crackle at all!  very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> awesome set of crackle they work  like I wanted to make may nails they  me want to change them every day</li>
    <li> I used that kind of product for the first time using China Glaze. I must say that I was amazed watching the transformation. It works extremely well.</li>
    <li> i guess i forgot to review this item after i threw it out. it is crap. the crackle trend is over anyway, but this is subpar to the OPI product. all china glaze seems to be crap.</li>
    <li> Out of the six bottles, two arrived with a clumpy liquid that makes it very hard to use. I tried to clean the brush, but that didn&#x27;t help much. I just don&#x27;t use those colors now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other four that arrived as they should work great. I just applied my base color and then waited for it to dry before putting on the crackle polish. Each time the crackle appears, it&#x27;s unique in pattern and it&#x27;s always fun to mix and match base color + crackle color. If you want to stray from the usual solid color, crackle is perfect!</li>
    <li> Loving all 6 colors of these crackles! I tried forever to get my hands on the OPI Black Shatter but could not but I was extremely lucky to find these on here from Pink Nails! It does take some getting used to these. It comes out different when you put a thin coat on versus a thick coat. I like the thick coat look better. Thin coat makes lots of crackle lines, thick coat makes bigger crackle areas. Try them you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love all the colors they are so easy to do but looks like it took forever. I did alot of research and compared china glaze &amp; OPI shatter, and china glaze wins hands down because there are more colors (OPI shatter only comes in black)and is cheaper I get compliments all the time. fast shipping and packaged great! I sooo recommend this product :-)</li>
    <li> Not worth the price of most Amazon sellers !!! I advice to wait and look at other stores instead of wasting your money with those sellers !!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It crackles good and stays on my natural nails if I use the product jealous before I crackle.  It will stay on for a good week.</li>
    <li> I have used OPI Shattered and the China Glaze Crackle is better. It goes on smoothly and it crackles very well. The only problem you need to shake the bottle in between hand applications as it does clump on the brush shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the colors that were sent to me and hope that China Glaze Crackle will come out with other great colors!</li>
    <li> First of all, the shipping was super fast and the items were neatly packaged! The cost is great for 6 bottles of this stuff when at the store it&#x27;s $8.50 per bottle (at least in my small town).     Now, about the product. I painted my nails a silver metallic color and waited for it to dry. I then tried all the colors. The shatter effect took about 30 seconds to set in and it looked awesome!     The purple, black, pink, and light bluish colors look great with silver. The gray and white didn&#x27;t work so well, but I&#x27;ve yet to try them with dark colors.     I would buy this again and am thinking of buying another set in order to give individual bottles out to my girlfriends as a fun gift.</li>
    <li> cool polish wish it cracked more</li>
    <li> I have used all of the colors in this set and they work great.  just make sure the base polish is completely dry before applying.</li>
    <li> I have still yet to get my entire order!  I have contacted both Amazon and the seller both giving positive feedback that the order will arrive - It is now March 21 and still no polish!  Will not recommend ordering this through either of you.</li>
    <li> Much better than the \\&quot;OPI Shatter\\&quot; competition since this 6 bottle set includes black, white, grey, pink, purple and greenish blue crackle colors! An assortment that will enable you to let your creativitiy run wild. I love it! In general China Glaze works wonderfully. For a crackle look, just slap on a base color, the China Glaze crackle color of your choice, then a shiny top coat to seal the deal. The spontaneous and unique crackles on each nail makes the whole set look amazing. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and fun! I bought cracked concrete (gray) from Sally Beauty Supply today and put it over black polish. It came out looking futuristic-ly apocalyptic (awesome). Very true about the thin versus thick coats - thin will give you the shatter look like on the china glaze website. A thicker coat will split mostly lengthwise. Either way looks fantastic. This stuff is selling out left and right.</li>
    <li> These work really well.  It took a little getting use to putting it on (you just want to go over it one time) but looks great.  My favorite so far is black, purple and teal over white polish.  Using bright colored under works the best....need to do some more experimenting on other colors.  Shaking the bottle helps get rid of any kind of junk that collects on the rim/edge of the bottle.  Great price and no trying to hassle with trying to find it in a store!!</li>
    <li> ive used this product and it fun to use and to wear the best ones to use is the black and the gray and i have not tried the other colors but looking forward  to doing so</li>
    <li> I really like this product, me and my mom has a great time trying different patterns, my mom took some on her trip to see my sister-in-law and her mother they had a great time having a party with this...</li>
    <li> I received these nail polishes in the mail yesterday and already my toes and fingers as well as my step daughter&#x27;s fingers have been fully loaded. The colors in the set are vibrant and crackle beautifully. I first tried OPI Shatter, but I am falling in love with China Glaze. So far, the polish goes on smooth and crackles big or little with how much or little you apply to your nails. The set was a good price and I do not regret my decision at all. Here&#x27;s to many more manicures to myself and my friends alike. Happy painting!</li>
    <li> I was worried the colors would not crackle right  , But I tried all the different colors and they look and work great!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great set! I am a newby at doing my own nails and this was super easy and quick. I am a mom, wife, full time student and employee, so you can imagine time is of the essence. I am always getting compliments and I have gotten to the point where I feel comfortable to do my family&#x27;s nails.</li>
    <li> I love crackle nail polish. The only draw back I had about buying more from stores was that you can&#x27;t find them for under 8$ but once I saw it on here it was something I knew I had to buy. Such a great product!</li>
    <li> My teenage girls did not think this worked quite as well as OPI shatter.  One box of 3 polishes had no packing in between the bottles so one was broken and it was a real mess.  They did send another of the color that broke.  Crackle works  OK.</li>
    <li> So fun! These polishes have the good quality of OPI&#x27;s other polish products too. I actually ordered a second set for my niece for Christmas since she used them at my house and loved them.</li>
    <li> OMG PLEASE HEED MY WARNING THIS STUFF WAS BEYOND HORRIBLE I MEAN IT WAS JUST AWFUL CLUMPED CHIPPED OF WITHIN AN HOUR WILL NEVER EVER EVERRRRRRRR BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> They work great. My girls love them and so do I. They don&#x27;t take skill just paint your nail and the polish does the work!</li>
    <li> China Glaze Crackle is just awesome. This is the first time I&#x27;m using crackle nail polish so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it in the mail yesterday and decided to try it right away. I used a black base (just regular nail polish) and the white crackle over it. I let the base dry completely as I had read that it works better that way.  Then I applied a coat of the white crackle and was disappointed for a second. It was just white. And then after a few seconds the crackle started to appear. So just give it some time. Once it was complete dry, it looked great! The black and white combination gave me the eery Halloween feel. So I&#x27;m planning on trying a whole bunch of other combinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that when I applied a thick coat of the crackle, I got a lot of small crackles and when I painted thin, I got fewer but somewhat bigger crackle. Now sure about this though since I&#x27;ve only used it once. Usually they say that if you paint light you get smaller crackle and if you paint heavy you get a bigger crackle.</li>
    <li> yes love the color. prices are great.am so glad i got them  so cheap. since i got them i notice the prices have gone up.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a little learning curve to get the intended outcome, but watch some youtube videos and practice a bit and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> they dry very fast if you don&#x27;t use them for a while :( i used to love them..i will buy them again but not now :(</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my sister, and she seems to like them pretty well.  The coating is more of a matte finish, not very glossy...so if you want to blind people with your shiny fingernails, get a different brand.</li>
    <li> These crackle polishes have been all the rage, but they don&#x27;t work as flawlessly as pictures of manicured nails might suggest. China Glaze is my favorite brand polish, but the fast-drying nature of their product works too well for the crackle effect.  If you don&#x27;t paint with light speed, the crackle effect is lost nails end up clumpy and ugly.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to regular and glitter polishes from now on.</li>
</ol>
