### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>for an excellent razor.</li>
      <li>Perfectly and its made in japan..</li>
      <li>I have this panasonic battery operated shaver that I bought 7 years ago and its really very good..</li>
      <li>Works great.............</li>
      <li>This provides the best choice for keeping your favorite Panasonic shaver going.</li>
      <li>Of course, I&#x27;m delighted with them.</li>
      <li>very satisfied</li>
      <li>my panasonic 4025 shaver is my favorite electric ever.</li>
      <li>Nice smooth shave.</li>
      <li>excellent and working properly.</li>
      <li>Ok, I bought this for one of my boy&#x27;s</li>
      <li>But my wife found a used Panasonic shaver at a garage sale 9 years ago, and it gave me a closer, quicker, more comfortable shave than Remington ever had.  </li>
      <li>Good service and nice to now be able to shave with sharp blades!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the Gillette model (sell the razor cheap, and make up the difference on the blades).  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fit inside</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>Thanks for the excellent razor replacement inner blade and outer foil screen.  </li>
      <li>did originally.  </li>
      <li>How nice, since the advertisement clearly says \\&quot;FOIL AND BLADE SET\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I am so glad a replacement is available vs. having to locate a new shaver.</li>
      <li>The foil worked great for my razor, but I&#x27;m rating the seller a 3 Star, due to the hassle I went through on this order.</li>
      <li>They worked great for a little bit, but as soon as I took them off to clean, one cracked</li>
      <li>Panasonic, you win this round.</li>
      <li>As good as Braun, at half the price.</li>
      <li>I wanted to support American producers, so I stuck with Remington for many years.  </li>
      <li>I received exactly what I wanted and in the time length specified.  </li>
      <li>But the first set of blades lasted 4-5 yrs..</li>
      <li>thanks amazon!</li>
      <li>I have to say it was fast delivery on this item.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 5+ years and love the wet shave function.</li>
      <li>However I was offered a 50% off, customer support was very helpful, that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
      <li>... but the foil and blade replacement cost me almost as much as the shaver ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I needed and made my razor work like new.</li>
      <li>the price is high - $27.</li>
      <li>live too far away (NZ) to get these as fast as I would have liked:)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>Installation of the repalcement screen and new blades was a snap.</li>
      <li>Razor is like new.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>I wish the packaging text and compatibility of the screens was more simple, other than that this worked well well</li>
      <li>First off, I would like to point out that I only received the Foil and didn&#x27;t receive the Blade.</li>
      <li>I did not notice any difference in the closeness of the shave, or time it took to shave, between the old and new foil and blades.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s see.. $23 for new blades and foil, or $25 locally for a complete new ES-RW30-S shaver with these parts,  PLUS a new battery and everything else new.</li>
      <li>We all try to get at least one more shave out of any blade, give up and replace.</li>
      <li>it just took longer and longer to shave as the blades was getting old.</li>
      <li>The blades and the foil stay sharp for much longer than Remington&#x27;s, and even much longer than Panasonic claims.</li>
      <li>so I decided to finally get a new set of razors and foil.</li>
      <li>I hope my batteries will last as long as the new blades.</li>

    <li> For years I looked for an electric shaver that would give me a close shave.  I wanted to support American producers, so I stuck with Remington for many years.  But my wife found a used Panasonic shaver at a garage sale 9 years ago, and it gave me a closer, quicker, more comfortable shave than Remington ever had.  The blades and the foil stay sharp for much longer than Remington&#x27;s, and even much longer than Panasonic claims. They still seem sharp 2-3 years after I buy them.  But now, for only the third time in 9 years, I&#x27;ve bought replacement blades and foil. Of course, I&#x27;m delighted with them.</li>
    <li> This provides the best choice for keeping your favorite Panasonic shaver going. However I&#x27;ve noticed my battery life is getting shorter, so I hope my batteries will last as long as the new blades. Just something to think about.</li>
    <li> ... but the foil and blade replacement cost me almost as much as the shaver ([[ASIN:B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]]) did originally.  It&#x27;s the Gillette model (sell the razor cheap, and make up the difference on the blades).  Panasonic, you win this round.</li>
    <li> I wish the packaging text and compatibility of the screens was more simple, other than that this worked well well well well.</li>
    <li> I have this panasonic battery operated shaver that I bought 7 years ago and its really very good..but now the blade and the foil are getting dull and needed a replacement..so decided to buy this and as soon as I received it,  opened it and see if it fits with the shaver..wow! Perfectly and its made in japan..thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> Good service and nice to now be able to shave with sharp blades!&lt;br /&gt;Sadly live too far away (NZ) to get these as fast as I would have liked:)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using the same razor for an embarrassing amount of time. It has served me well but I got a few dents on the foil so I decided to finally get a new set of razors and foil. Not its like having a brand-new razor again.</li>
    <li> Razor is like new. Nice smooth shave. We all try to get at least one more shave out of any blade, give up and replace.</li>
    <li> Will use thuis item in a year as required on the head for wear&lt;br /&gt;and the cutters in two years so considered this to be a good&lt;br /&gt;purchase for an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> They worked great for a little bit, but as soon as I took them off to clean, one cracked and it does not stay put in place.</li>
    <li> No problem with replacement parts. very satisfied</li>
    <li> This was also a gift and my friend states it works well.  I have to say it was fast delivery on this item.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the excellent razor replacement inner blade and outer foil screen.  It was exactly what I needed and made my razor work like new.</li>
    <li> Product as described......Works great.............</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I wanted and in the time length specified.  That&#x27;s is how it should always be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side, it&#x27;s too bad the price is so high to replace parts of a product that is not worth a lot more.</li>
    <li> So far so good and it is still going well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the item for my shaver ES4036.&lt;br /&gt;I assembled the shaver and foil set and without any trouble it&#x27;s fit inside the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Its excellent and working properly.</li>
    <li> Ok, I bought this for one of my boy&#x27;s and I even used it a couple of time&#x27;s and I have yet to see them replaced.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4-star is b/c the price is high - $27. It is almost as expensive a new shaver. But the first set of blades lasted 4-5 yrs..it just took longer and longer to shave as the blades was getting old.</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to point out that I only received the Foil and didn&#x27;t receive the Blade. I was told by the seller that this advertisement was listed incorrectly and that I was only supposed to receive a Foil. How nice, since the advertisement clearly says \\&quot;FOIL AND BLADE SET\\&quot;. Also, the shipping took a little longer then I expected. The foil worked great for my razor, but I&#x27;m rating the seller a 3 Star, due to the hassle I went through on this order. However I was offered a 50% off, customer support was very helpful, that&#x27;s a plus. But, I will not deal with the same seller again, due to the problem I had.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see.. $23 for new blades and foil, or $25 locally for a complete new ES-RW30-S shaver with these parts,  PLUS a new battery and everything else new. Toss it and buy another shaver I reckon.</li>
    <li> my panasonic 4025 shaver is my favorite electric ever. I&#x27;ve had it for 5+ years and love the wet shave function. Recently my dog got ahold of it and chewed the foil screen. I am so glad a replacement is available vs. having to locate a new shaver. Installation of the repalcement screen and new blades was a snap. If you&#x27;ve never used a wet shaver I suggest you try it. It&#x27;s the next closest shave to a blade without the nicks and cuts!</li>
    <li> Have had the shaver for over 10-years and only use it when I travel 1-2X per month. I did not notice any difference in the closeness of the shave, or time it took to shave, between the old and new foil and blades.</li>
    <li> As good as Braun, at half the price.</li>
    <li> The product is excelent and has definetly met my expectations , but the packaging is way to big for such a small product</li>
