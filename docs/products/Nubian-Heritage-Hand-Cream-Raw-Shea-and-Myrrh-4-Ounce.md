    <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used for my very dry skin.  It is thick, rich and long-lasting.  It also has a very pleasant, light fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is not the best lotion.  It is like others I have purchased in a regular local store.  I have very dry skin and this really did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of product.</li>
    <li> I brought it for my wife , she loves it .</li>
    <li> The only hand cream I use. Excellent!!!!</li>
    <li> There is no hand cream better than this!!!  It moisturizes without feeling too heavy or greasy.  The scent of myrrh and frankincense is mesmerizing. Because the scent is not overbearing, my husband uses this cream too. I have given this as gifts to friends and they rave about how wonderful it is.</li>
    <li> The most natural lotion with a lovely scent that i have found. Incredible moisturing.</li>
    <li> The cream has great coverage but it stinks.  It smells very florally.  I love the way it feels on my skin but I will not be using this as the smell is very strong.  I feel like it has way too much floral extract.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter is so soothing and healing, it&#x27;s wonderful for dry, overworked hands and feel, elbows, anywhere you might need a heavy, rich cream</li>
    <li> I like this hand cream I carry in my purse.It is good for extra dry skin feel good on my hands. Best hand cream I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This is very creamy and moisturizing, but the scent is overbearing so I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I stumbled onto this product at a health food store.  Now more that 20 other friends are using it and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.</li>
    <li> The consistency is too thick and leaves hands greasy</li>
    <li> Exotic,Very unusual,sensual.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion- thick &amp; smells great! Great for dry skin people like myself.</li>
    <li> I got Nubian hand cream at a health store and keep it at my work. I use it almost every day and can say that this is surely one of the best products for hands. The cream is thick enough to create protection coat on your hands that will last for a long time. Yet, it&#x27;s not greecy. It smells really nice. I am happy with the product and will use it again. Plus it&#x27;s organic which is one of the priorities for me.</li>
    <li> I wore acrylic nails for years then decided to quit. My nails were thin, ridged and would split and tear. I began using this hand cream while the healthy nail began growing out. I used it regularly, everytime I washed my hands, rubbing any excess on my neck. I noticed my nails were getting shiny and my neck seemed to look less saggy. While I&#x27;m not proclaiming miracle properties for this, it made a difference for me and the smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this works great for me. It also has no fragrances and absorbs quickly. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft, I apply it on my elbows and knees too. I been using this for several years already and could not fond anything better so far.</li>
    <li> This is the first hand cream that I&#x27;ve found with Shea Butter as the 1st ingredient.  I&#x27;ve been using the Nubian Heritage soaps, and love them, so I thought I would give their hand cream a try.  So very hydrating, the best of all the hand creams I&#x27;ve tried. I live in the dry desert and need all the help I can get.  Thank you Nubian Heritage. [[ASIN:B001ESA2S2 Nubian Heritage Hand Cream,Raw Shea W/Frnksc 4 oz]]</li>
    <li> This has got to be the most incredible hand lotion I have ever experienced--subtle yet powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely!&lt;br /&gt;And I look forward to using it at night.</li>
    <li> Lovely product - ordered more after receiving as gift -  very happy with timely shipping.</li>
    <li> It says it is for the hands, but I live in a very dry area with very low humidity so at night after washing I use it on my face.  The smell is incredible.  I have adult ADHD and at the end of the day I find this brings me down and relaxes me and kind of gives me a feeling of centered-ness.  I&#x27;m not sure which of the oils does this, but it works. It also leaves my face very soft in the morning.  I use a tissue to wipe off excess oil in the morning and do not wash.  This seems to keep my excessive oily T-zone in check (at 48 years old) and keeps my face in balance.  I use Eucerin in the morning because of it&#x27;s SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey but it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Loved the product, made  my skin feel softer and took the pain of dry skin away.  The product was packaged appropriately and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry skin especially in the winter and with many hand washings. I have been looking everywhere and trying everthing to moisturize my hands and body and found this hand cream here on amazon. Based on the other reviews I bought some to try.  I absolutely love this hand cream.  It smells awesome, and is thick and creamy but not oily and slick once you apply it.  I have noticed an improvement in my dry hands since using this and really like it. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this, and the Amazon price is much better than the health food store.  However, the body lotion is just as nice, and half the price.  Plus, the body lotion (lavender and floral) has a nice fragrance.</li>
