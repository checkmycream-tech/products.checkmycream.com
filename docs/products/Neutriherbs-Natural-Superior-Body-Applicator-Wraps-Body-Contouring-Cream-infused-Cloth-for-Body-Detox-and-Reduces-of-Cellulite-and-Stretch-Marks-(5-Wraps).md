      <li>What she should be asking is why would u pay 50 more dollars for a product u had no results with?</li>

      <li>I love these wraps.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and I am ready to buy more!</li>
      <li>The box does not give much by way of directions so this was very nice.</li>

      <li>and it does feels fresh!!</li>
      <li>and I was able to zip my dress up and look fabulous for the wedding.</li>
      <li>I do believe, however, that implementing these wraps into your healthy lifestyle routine could help you lose inches more quickly than with diet and exercise alone.</li>
      <li>I know some of you want the easy way out believe me</li>
      <li>I honestly like these wraps, being a person who is on a weight loss journey and have tried other wraps before I.e. MyItWorksWraps, these are a great alternative or addition.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these to be honest and I was blown away with my results from just 1 wrap.</li>
      <li>free u don&#x27;t need to pay for a gym membership.</li>
      <li>have to be honest and was not expecting much from using this wrap.</li>
      <li>Product provided free of charge in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
      <li>Another great way to use and keep it on is if you have some foldable yoga pants, you can keep them unfolded and cover your entire belly to maintain the wrap on, of course with plastic wrap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s a significant difference</li>
      <li>Thanks for sharing this product! :)</li>
      <li>I just received mine today and over excited</li>
      <li>I started my first one love the tingling feeling on my stomach</li>
      <li>It has a menthol cool feel while it&#x27;s on, so you think it&#x27;s working.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price</li>
      <li>The price is not expensive considering you will get 5 wraps (4 plus 1 free).</li>
      <li>Dont work itworks wraps are the best wraps i try this ones cause cheaper but waste of money i will go back to itworks wraps better</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been really happy and finally feeling confident in my swimsuit again after my 3rd kid.  </li>
      <li>You still have to live a healthy life.</li>
      <li>I just used my first wrap and OMFG!  </li>
      <li>i saw a difference by the first wrap you have to try this !</li>
      <li>Although they aren&#x27;t really spectacular either at least they smell better!</li>
      <li>It is worth the try.</li>
      <li>I found the detox benefits worth it.</li>
      <li>Drank the right amount of water.</li>
      <li>Nothing against the chain, everybody got their own koolaid to drink, however, I tried them back to back and found results from these wraps better.</li>
      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I put my first one on yesterday rubbed the lotion in</li>
      <li>Yes these wraps really work!</li>
      <li>I wore the first wrap for two hours</li>
      <li>Once i do that most likely i will purchase the defining gel.</li>
      <li>After using the wrap the 1st time I trimmed the front lower and upper pieces to add to my love handles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are looking to buy only one, it will be a lot more costly</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; wraps definitely work better.</li>
      <li>My first wrap</li>
      <li>tingled, bloated me up at first</li>
      <li>I was able to go about my daily duties at home while wearing it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After applying the first wrap, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t going to stay on by itself.</li>
      <li>This is my first wraps applicator.</li>
      <li>My first wraps</li>
      <li>I was able to wrap both upper arms and treat my &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; on my stomach each time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great body wraps at a great price</li>
    <li> OK but not as good as It Works body wraps. I got better results with the ItWorks product. I also use defining gel on the days I don&#x27;t wrap and I&#x27;ve been really happy and finally feeling confident in my swimsuit again after my 3rd kid.  I pay $59 for 4 wraps and they ship to my home.  OH  - i ordered from kmstarks.itworks.com I found the url from instagram :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that good and doesn&#x27;t stay in place..</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift. It is worth the try. I found the detox benefits worth it. Kept it on for longer than the recommendation and noticed that it is very necessary to drink tons of water. I noticed a headache the next day but a few glasses of water helped take care of that. It did help me feel clear headed within two days, whereas I was feeling muddled before I tried it. Will be looking into getting these frequently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry. I have had 3 boys. Youngest being a year old. I put my first one on yesterday rubbed the lotion in and i still have no results yet to see. I realized these products are bs and a lot of the reviews are probably fake accounts with fake reviews so that this makes it looks out there. I&#x27;m still going to finish my other 4 and will update.</li>
    <li> These wraps absolutely work, but they have to be used correctly. I found it helpful to follow the step by step guide. I lost inches and i feel good i saved a good chunk of money by not buying them through It Works. The whole experience is so much better when you can have a wrap party with your friends without the pressure of being sold a bunch of crap you don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> Dont work itworks wraps are the best wraps i try this ones cause cheaper but waste of money i will go back to itworks wraps better</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful investment! Super easy to apply and left my skin feeling SO soft (along with reducing/ diminishing stretch marks)! I highly recommend purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> Follow all the rules only ate one meal in the three days of each wrap and had NO results!!! The distributor trys to say if u goto the gym for an hour and don&#x27;t get results would u quit, but this is not the same at all u can pay nothing to work out at home and just run, which I do for free u don&#x27;t need to pay for a gym membership. What she should be asking is why would u pay 50 more dollars for a product u had no results with?</li>
    <li> Does not really works and smells.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t even the real wraps they didn&#x27;t work at all. If you want the real wraps that will work find an It works! Distibutor. Not this!</li>
    <li> Used 2, waiting to use 1 more before i can say how the results turned out</li>
    <li> Have used 2 of the 5 and no results.... Did everything that  the package said to do and still nothing...</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s working great!!Love this product.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money... It smells horrible and the scent seeps through clothing...like tar mixed with nail polish remover and it has a heat behind it. Like, you&#x27;re walking down the street in 102 degree with soaked in garbage juice..&lt;br /&gt;#nopeville</li>
    <li> It works I notice flatter belly reduce inflammation after giving birth</li>
    <li> I have never been allergic to anything my entire life, and I had a serious reaction after using one of these wraps. I followed the directions, and my results were as follows (see pic). I emailed the seller regarding the issue, and they never wrote back. Clearly, matters like this don&#x27;t make a difference to them. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very expensive and don&#x27;t do anything other than steal your money .</li>
    <li> This was first time buying body wraps and I got them in less than a week. I follow the directions and it work. I lost 3 inches but of course I drank a lot of water and exercise everyday. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my first wraps applicator. Honestly after reading a lot of reviews I decided to purchased it. I got it on Wednesday.  I used it  my first applicator the same day and followed instructions. I thought this won&#x27;t  work but I have lost the fat that I had on my stomach. Well for me it&#x27;s working and I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Drinking a lot of water and doing exercises three times a week. I am so happy and I&#x27;m planning on buying another one.  I know everyone is different but for me it&#x27;s really working. Thanks everyone for sharing and posting your reviews. I&#x27;m doing the same thing hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Very nice product!  It works!</li>
    <li> No this is a knock off product of it works. I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price for it works wrap I thought I was getting a deal purchasing this off of Amazon.if you would get on anybody&#x27;s Facebook page that is selling it you can compare the pictures on the boxes even the logo I&#x27;m disappointed I fell into the trap. so my suggestion is just find someone that&#x27;s buying them and ask them to purchase you and item this way they get points and you get your their deal.</li>
    <li> Honestly, these wraps worked wonders for me.. but the downside is I kept getting sick to my stomach while using them, I cannot stand the smell it&#x27;s the strongest herbal smell I&#x27;ve ever smelt. It really is a good wrap but I can&#x27;t handle this upset stomach feeling.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as described. Used exactly as directions were stated. Used in same area of body. Not even a slight change. Waste of money. It works wraps actually worked for me but they are so expensive. BUT they work.  Will go back to them instead.</li>
    <li> Used it for the time frame it say. Did not work at all</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work - stupid product</li>
    <li> After I start seeing that it works I&#x27;ll rate it again. Thank u! after using this IT DONT WORK p</li>
    <li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t work and it smelt terrible!</li>
    <li> This product does work, but it&#x27;s hard to keep in place.</li>
    <li> I love these wraps. Make sure to drink plenty of water and exercise and you will see good results.</li>
    <li> I am very very disappointed in this product. I bought it due to reviews and the price. I&#x27;ve used all of them and see nothing. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and 130. I figured that would help but nothing. I kept it on for the most allotted time, 8 Hours. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Oohh... In my opinion!!! This is a big fat lie!!! I try them already and got no results at al!!! Waist of money !!!!! I am with you guys, all of those reviews probably, most all of them are FAKE , they are just trying to get your money !!! Big bummer</li>
    <li> I have ordered and used several times.My last order I was unhappy with the wraps were not very lubricated with the gel at all,pretty dry,I had problems even getting them to stick to my body while I wrapped,I don&#x27;t feel it did much at all just way too dry of the gel.</li>
    <li> Product has a horrible smell</li>
    <li> My first wraps I didnt really see much change but my 4th and 5th wrap I saw great results! I am now on my second shipment and I&#x27;m obsessed with this product! I dont understand why some of the reviews have been so harsh.  I started using the wraps before my wedding/honeymoon and I&#x27;ve been using the wraps for a couple months since. My results get better with each wrap - Ive wrapped my legs and arms and my cellulite is almost gone. It&#x27;s pretty wild how they work.</li>
    <li> I tried this product hoping it will work but after using wraps and after following seller&#x27;s instructions I saw NO difference. At first I saw good reviews when I was ordering and hoped it work for me but in last few weeks AND after I ordered all reviews were bad. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying the wraps came fast, they are large and you can cut and customize them for different body parts and unlike most packs that come with only three wraps this comes with 5.The first one I did was a little trial and error (I didn&#x27;t keep it on long enough and I wrapped myself too tight so it rolled up lol ) but I did notice a little difference and that tingling sensation too. When I wrapped myself the second time I read only some of the instructions you provided (mistake #2) and tried exfoliating and wearing it over night with my waist trainer. The next morning I took the wrap off rubbed in the lotion put my waist trainer onn and went to work. I noticed that my waist trainer was a little loose fitting now and at the end of the day I noticed that my stomach looked tighter I was so pumped. However I did not drink as much water as I was supposed to (I found that out when I read the rest of the instructions). I have no doubt that they work because I saw results without following the instructions to a T but I stopped wrapping for now because I need to get my&lt;br /&gt;diet and water intake together. Once i do that most likely i will purchase the defining gel.</li>
    <li> Hi, I tried to wrap this product last night for about hour and a lot of water. I just want to the result a next 72 hours.  thank you very much.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work at all. Another diet scam</li>
    <li> They work with belly fat and stretch marks !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical towards body wraps and now I&#x27;ve had the chance to use Neutriherbs Natural Superior Body Applicator. I&#x27;ve had 2 c-sections so I have a bit of extra skin. I am very happy with the results I&#x27;ve accomplished with this body wrap. My skin looks and feels tighter after just two applications. I can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like after I use the rest of the applications in the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received this product at no cost to me to facilitate a review; regardless, all opinions are my own. **</li>
    <li> This is COMPLETE BS and brilliant marketing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  It has a menthol cool feel while it&#x27;s on, so you think it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s not. Not at all. Not even a little. I&#x27;ve used 3 exactly as instructed and not lost one millimeter.  If I could give it zero stars I would.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied would not recommend product .  It is a poor imitation. I was under the impression I was receiving something else . Poor quality not effective</li>
    <li> Smells awful like bunch of herbal mix with Vick. Had it on for 45 mins and I felt the cold sensation it&#x27;s colder than the actual it &amp;#34;works wraps&amp;#34;. I was very skeptical about the product but after one application I didn&#x27;t see much results as the original wrap do, I guess you need to keep applying all 5 wraps to see an actual results. My first wrap I saw some type of results not as much as I would like. Keep in mind the ingredient of this wrap and the actual one are very different.</li>
    <li> These did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> This did not work for me, should have read all instructions before purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried one of the wraps and did not see a change. Once I try all them I will try and give another review. Oh and the smell is horrible</li>
    <li> I noticed little difference with these wraps.  I attempted to leave them on overnight but the smell was so disgusting I couldn&#x27;t muster it.  I will stick to the It Works! wraps in the future.  Although they aren&#x27;t really spectacular either at least they smell better!</li>
    <li> i absolutely loved this product. i really helped me lose some cellulite</li>
    <li> Terrible , cheap , made in China knock off of famous brand . Did not work</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I used one and couldn&#x27;t stomach to use the rest. HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> out of date, it was expired when I received this item</li>
    <li> No noticeable change I wore them all night and drank plenty of water my skin is soft but that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> I honestly like these wraps, being a person who is on a weight loss journey and have tried other wraps before I.e. MyItWorksWraps, these are a great alternative or addition. Plus with these you get more for your money. Oh, the smell is a little intense on the grassy herbal side. I will and am buying these again</li>
    <li> I loved this product omg i saw a difference by the first wrap you have to try this ! Its really good you lose inches and look like you have a flatter tummy. I would also. Recommend the gel it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference after using all of them. I had the last one on for four hours. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it, it works for me.  I used it in my stomach, arms and legs and so far I can definitely see a huge difference.  I will keep buying this product until I achieve my goal.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product and see if it work i have try it works wraps and they work great but i have try 3 wraps out of this box and no results at all i do exercise and drink plenty of water all the time but still it didn&#x27;t work i try saving money and didn&#x27;t want to buy it works wraps but now it will cost be double I paid to much for this wraps and they don&#x27;t work no results at all</li>
    <li> With so much hype about miracle weight loss cures without any work I am always amazed at what people will do.  Right now, body wraps are definitely all the rage, the thing is, some body wraps are claiming to make you go from plus size to super model with a simple wrap - which that isn&#x27;t true by any means, body wraps can help you achieve goals and facilitate toning and shaping when used properly and consistently.  I received this set of five body wraps in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I was skeptical but went in for the try - I have been working out again and had some loose skin on my arms that I wanted to work on.  I opened one of the wraps and noticed they are quite large, so you can actually cut it and get several body parts from just one wrap.  I was able to wrap both upper arms and treat my &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; on my stomach each time.  The recommended treatment is to do a wrap once every three days.  Unfortunately for me, we had some illness and a broken foot in between, so my stretch was more like every 6 or 7 days, but not too far off.  I followed the directions, wrapped with the herbal mixture and then wrapped my arms and stomach with plastic wrap (an ace bandage would work here, too but I was fresh out) and then proceeded to sit down, drink a &amp;#34;greens tea&amp;#34; (I picked up one on Amazon) and oodles of water. The greens aren&#x27;t required, but I&#x27;ve read they could help so I gave it a shot.  Right away you could feel a cooling and tingling sensation that was quite pleasant and made me think it was doing something.  After 45 minutes I headed back into the bathroom, unwrapped myself and rubbed in the leftover herbal mixture and followed it with a firming lotion that I have been using for years (one of those that is supposed to help with skin elasticity, we&#x27;ve all seen the commercials).  While I didn&#x27;t suddenly have freakishly thin toothpick arms, over the next couple of weeks I noticed that my arms were looking less bulky and more toned and defined. And I definitely noticed the pouch on my stomach starting to diminish.  Yes, part of this is from the increased water intake - but by combining that with the herbs it is making a difference.  I have had body herbal wraps at the dayspa and have paid tons of money for it - this is a much more affordable and convenient option that I would definitely love to do again and again!ined.

    <li> Received an empty box...if I could give it no star that&#x27;s what it would have</li>
    <li> I love them! They have worked wonders for me :). I highly recommend getting these.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Drank the right amount of water. I know some of you want the easy way out believe me I did to so I bought the cheapest body wrap I could find hut its nothing compared to it works. I did research after research on this product. And found nothing but one video of a girl pretending it works. I am begging u. Don&#x27;t listen to those who say it works the pictures you see are from it works. Do yourself a favor. Get with an it works distributor and by those wraps</li>
    <li> These smell really weirs. Like pool stick chalk almost. But you do feel them penetrating. I did not notice a difference visually though</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten any results yet but I&#x27;m staying positive</li>
    <li> As recommended I left this on for over 45 min and it didn&#x27;t work I spent a lot of money for nothing</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work! Don&#x27;t waste your money buying something that won&#x27;t work. I used the directions as it says and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> Too bad it didn&#x27;t work... Should have known better.</li>
    <li> The wife tried these once and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. Something to think about before you buy.</li>
    <li> I have a 2 month old (my second child) and am eager to drop the weight...I just used my first wrap and OMFG!  I&#x27;m too modest to post the photos but there&#x27;s a significant difference and I can&#x27;t wait to get through the two weeks to see the changes!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. It was very easy to use I was able to go about my daily duties at home while wearing it. I enjoyed the slight cooling sensation it gave. I definitely experienced the detoxing results right away. Thanks for sharing this product! :)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this wrap. I thought this was not going to work at all. But I was so mistaken. It was so easy to use! I loved the cold sensation and felt it working. I drank about a gallon of water and went to the restroom quite a few times, it totally cleaned my insides! I have a kid so my stomach doesn&#x27;t look that great, but after using It, I really saw a difference with just one wrap. I am very pleased and I am ready to buy more!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for any product but I&#x27;m going to write one for this. I decided to try these wraps after reading the reviews for another more marketed wrap. The other wraps only positive reviews came from people trying to sell it to me so I decided to give this one a try. It was less expensive and there was an additional wrap in the box. The seller sent a very helpful email to me with tips and tricks on how to get the best results from the wraps. The box does not give much by way of directions so this was very nice. I had my fourth baby 15 weeks ago and have been working out for about 10 weeks. I have that little bit of extra skin that I wanted to firm up. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these to be honest and I was blown away with my results from just 1 wrap. I&#x27;m so excited to do my second one tomorrow. I think drinking lots of water is key. I always aim for half my body weight in ounces a day and I am drinking even more than that. Seriously these are amazing!</li>
    <li> Really liked product, u will notice a difference !</li>
    <li> eh, was ok not great, was hoping for cloth not paper applicator. tingled, bloated me up at first then I went back to what I measured before doing the wrap. Only tried one so far, I will be using the rest to see if they work or not</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money! Been using for almost 3 weeks and see NO results! The &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; wraps definitely work better. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just love these wraps!!! I had a wedding to attend and the dress I ordered was a tad bit snug. One wrap and I was able to zip my dress up and look fabulous for the wedding. Best discovery ever! Totally recommend</li>
    <li> I just received mine today and over excited I started my first one love the tingling feeling on my stomach I can feel it working already my stretch marks have lightened about 10 shades</li>
    <li> I did like it and it does feels fresh!! very easy to use!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product defiantly has made a difference.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product! It worked exactly as described. I couldn&#x27;t believe how long I waited to try it! My skin was much smoother afterwards. I will definitely be purchasing the wraps again! -Bertha</li>
    <li> For around $40, you&#x27;ll receive 5 wraps, which is a deal when compared to the price of other toning body wraps on the market. The wraps smell &amp;#34;earthy,&amp;#34; like an herbal tea with a hint of menthol or mint. They do not look particularly pleasant—it almost looks like a bunch of dirt was smeared onto a thin sheet of cloth. This did not deter me from trying the wrap, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the first wrap, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t going to stay on by itself. I had to use an ace bandage to secure the wrap to my body, especially since I planned on doing a lot of moving around (I&#x27;m a mother of two, so I can&#x27;t sit still for very long). I wore the first wrap for two hours and I did notice results (as you can see in the two images I&#x27;ve provided). The difference is subtle, but I certainly noticed a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while I *did* see results, they didn&#x27;t last very long. The morning after having worn the wrap, my stomach was back to its normal size. I do believe, however, that implementing these wraps into your healthy lifestyle routine could help you lose inches more quickly than with diet and exercise alone. However, because of the inability to stay in place without extra support and because of the short term of the results, I can only give this product four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided free of charge in exchange for an unbiased review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference to much. Didn&#x27;t follow directions 100%</li>
    <li> I have tried other wraps in the past and this is different from them in a couple ways. The size seems a lot larger and the product on the wrap itself is a herbal-like mixture that has a strong herbal scent and is a little off putting in color when you first open it. The box comes with 5 individually sealed wraps in the box.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging to each individual wrap is stained yellow from the mixture inside. Once you open the wrap it is folded up in several folds and you will be surprised how large it is. After using the wrap the 1st time I trimmed the front lower and upper pieces to add to my love handles.&lt;br /&gt;To keep the wrap on your body you will need plastic wrap or you can even use an abdominal binder which is probably your best bet. Just remember if you use that you may still want to use some plastic wrap to protect your binder from getting dirty. Another great way to use and keep it on is if you have some foldable yoga pants, you can keep them unfolded and cover your entire belly to maintain the wrap on, of course with plastic wrap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several ways to use this wrap. You can use it to cover your belly and waist or can cut it strategically as pictured on the box for other areas like your thighs and arms. This seems like a way I want to try it out for the future.&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest and was not expecting much from using this wrap. I showered and on my hot damp skin  I applied the wrap to my waist and after my actually wore the wrap to bed and removed it in the morning and rubbed the contents all over until it was completely rubbed in. I was actually surprise I saw some changes. I really was not expecting it at all, especially after one wrap. After using a wrap you can apply another in 72 hours and do it all over again. It is suppose to continue to work for the next 72 hours. The entire sessions will take you a couple of weeks to finish up and use.&lt;br /&gt;There is no burning, but there is a cooling sensation while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would say give it a try. Make sure to use it as directed of course. The price is not expensive considering you will get 5 wraps (4 plus 1 free). I have seen other a lot more. If you are looking to buy only one, it will be a lot more costly and I would recommend trying the multi pack. If you are looking to get a skinny waist from this if you already have a &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; waist, do not expect miracles! I did however see a slight change and I think I will get another box to continue on to see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work at all it&#x27;s just a waist of money. Please don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Actually better then &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34;. Nothing against the chain, everybody got their own koolaid to drink, however, I tried them back to back and found results from these wraps better. Neither is a miracle. You still have to live a healthy life. But it does tone you somewhat.</li>
    <li> I used this wrap for the first time yesterday and wow I lost 1/2 in . Was wondering if anyone experienced tiredness and body aches from using the wraps? Not sure if I just didn&#x27;t drink enough water.</li>
    <li> Yes these wraps really work! Make sure you drink half of your body weight in ounces of water the day you wrap and three days following for max results. Read through the Guide too. It&#x27;s helpful. Leave wrap on overnight when you sleep wrapping Saran Wrap over it and around you to keep it on when you sleep up to 8 hrs for max results. Use five wraps(1pack). Keep wrapping it away dont stop after 1 wrap if you dont get results immediately.</li>
