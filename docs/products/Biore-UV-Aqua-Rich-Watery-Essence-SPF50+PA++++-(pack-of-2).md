<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my first Asian sunscreen, and I have been pretty severely let down. I&#x27;ve heard so much raving about the quick drying times and cosmetic elegance of Japanese sunscreens, but this product is every bit as sticky and shiny as most American sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. It does not play well at all with my makeup, which is very troublesome since it is SO shiny, I wouldn&#x27;t ever wear it alone. I&#x27;ve tried a few different ways of making this work. I&#x27;ve tried it over my regular, thoroughly dry, moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried it over freshly washed, un-mouisturized skin, and I&#x27;ve tried it over a light gel moisturizer and it always has the same result. I end up with a super shiny face, and there is a sticky feel even hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has had a very strange effect with my mattifying powder. After applying it with a powder puff, my face ended up covered in what looked like pilling, although I only dabbed the powder on and didn&#x27;t rub or buff at all. The only way I have gotten this to work for me is by letting it dry for about 45 minutes, then blotting with oil blotting sheets, and then applying a mattifying powder. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if I didn&#x27;t wonder how much SPF protection I was losing on the oil absorbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final issue I have with this product is that I have found it very irritating to my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t burn at first, but as soon as I step out in the sunlight, my eyes become hyper sensitive to the sun, even with sunglasses on, which is strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars because it does supposedly offer very good protection, it smells okay, it doesn&#x27;t have any white cast that I could see, and it isn&#x27;t the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this gel sunblock. It&#x27;s so light and absorbs in fairly quickly. And it works very good make up base for me. My make up goes on smoothly on top and I honestly think this is better than other makeup base I have. My teenage sons said they like this light gel texture, they&#x27;d wear this sunblock too.</li>
    <li> I am a tried and true user of Biore UV Perfect Face Milk, but my friend who also has oily skin has said that she loves this version (the Aqua Rich), so I decided to pick it up on my last order. This is very different from the Face Milk in pretty much every way except the brand! This is a much thicker, almost gel like sunscreen that has a bit of a yellow tint to it when you squeeze it out. I don&#x27;t notice any yellow tint to my face when it&#x27;s applied, which is a good thing in my book. When I apply this, I squeeze it out into my had and then apply in blocks. This sunscreen does need drying time before applying any makeup and if you apply sunscreen generously, you&#x27;ll be waiting a bit. That&#x27;s the only reason I have this product 4 stars since I am used to the non-existent drying time of the Perfect Face Milk. It does deliver on its claim of being aqua rich and I will probably love this even more in the winter when my skin gets more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; than oily.</li>
    <li> Very effective. Pleasant citrus smell. I primarily use to protect my tattoos when I&#x27;m in the sun and it works well.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that burns immediately without protection, and therefore regular SPF doesn&#x27;t last very long. I bought this after reading recommendations on Reddit makeup subs for sunscreens that didn&#x27;t feel like plastic or mess with your pores OR mess with makeup. I just came from a two hour commencement ceremony in the Alabama sun, and I could literally feel a difference between areas covered and those I missed on my temple and hairline. Amazing. My face feels comfy, makeup went on great and stayed great for this occasion when I need to look like &amp;#34;everything is fine! We&#x27;re dignified people absolutely not sizzling and wilting in our massive black robes!&amp;#34; To give even more perspective on how badly I burn, I have mesh marks on my feet from where my dress didn&#x27;t cover the top of a trouser-socked foot for a minute.</li>
    <li> WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE? Seriously, I have wasted so many years with western sunscreens! I use sunscreen every day, so I am always on the lookout for a better product, and honestly, I doubt that this can be beat for daily use under makeup. It goes on like a dream, sinks in, does not leave a white cast, does not leave me sticky, and I cannot even tell that I have it on. I got this tube with prime shipping from Japan Import, and it was authentic. I definitely paid double the normal Japanese retail price for the convenience of two day shipping, but it is worth it even with the inflated price.</li>
    <li> Light and non-greasy.  A great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunblock product I ever had, very gentle and moisturized not drying out your skin at all.</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite sunscreen.  this has kept my skin it&#x27;s natural color despite living on a farm in the Colorado mountains!  no tan lines for this girl!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product, because it blended into my skin beautifully and the texture was perfect. Unfortunately it made me very itchy, which I think is the fault of the alcohol. My mild rosacea was definitely worse by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> great product for oily skin</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a sunscreen to use that was spf 50 with an aqua or gel texture, since some would break me out or left a nasty white cast. So when I got this product, I loved this instantly when I used it. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it and it does have a faint citrusy scent to of it.</li>
    <li> I have a very delicate skin, even walking for 15 minutes on an delightful sunny day gives me sunburns on every part of uncovered skin. Personally hate the thick consistency of regular sunblocks so I started to looking for something that were strong enough to protect my skin and I could use every day and I found this. Has worked beautifully, absorbs very quickly and my face feels hydrated after every use. It is recommended for everyday use, not for a long exposure on a beach day. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Very light, no feeling of oily</li>
    <li> The product is very nice ! Not oily...Not heavy...The shipment was fast.It only took 12 days! will buy it again..</li>
    <li> Fantastic sunscreen. I use sunscreen regularly now under my makeup/over my moisturizer. This is the best and way better than any Western-based brand. Asian sunscreens are formulated to be used daily instead of just those trips to the beach. This is water-based and spreads smoothly and absorbs great without a greasy feeling. When I went to get a facial, the lady said I had very little sun damage so this def works!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and no greasy touch. Good price and super fast shipment.</li>
    <li> This is everything! I have dry skin and I&#x27;m African American. I have been using this since May it is now the end of July and I can finally say I love it. . I was worried about getting a white cast from sunscreen on my face  but this one dries clear. You can&#x27;t see it on the skin after it dries at all, it leaves a smooth satin finish.  It also serves as a makeup primer, it keeps my makeup on all day! I don&#x27;t have to worry about it reflecting light I&#x27;m photos either.&#x27;i have been I&#x27;m the sun a lot this summer and my face has not tanned as much as my body, which makes me think my face is being protected. And don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s no skin bleach or anything (which was a concern of mine with it coming from Asia)  I will definitely repurchase. Only downside is it takes a month or arrive.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. I&#x27;m brown-skinned so finding a sunscreen that does not leave a white cast is important. My mission was accomplished with this product.</li>
    <li> Delivery  takes a while but awesome sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Only sunscreen I use. Nongreasy,  light weight, feels like a lotion, doesn&#x27;t have thick chalky sunscreen feel, makeup goes smoothly over it. Love it so much.</li>
    <li> I finally found one I can wear under my makeup!!  No white cast at all, very moisturizing, and sets matte and dry leaving no trace of it behind.  It also seems to keep my makeup on my face longer.  I will never go back to traditional US sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Light weight. It kept my makeup stay put for longer too.</li>
    <li> Very very light, does&#x27;t have any greasy feel like US brand I used before (Neutrogena Clear Face Sunscreen Lotion to be exact). It works well too, one day I went to flea market, put it on my face but forgot apply to back of my neck, then my neck got serious sunburn but my face did&#x27;t get any sunburn a all, not even got tan! But it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the amount of product you got, would give 5 stars if it&#x27;s cheaper~</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;-not greasy&lt;br /&gt;-does not have a strong scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-makes my face really shiny (I have dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;-is not sweat resistant (it basically melts off my face in the heat)&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t feel super protective (I have received some mild burns while wearing this product, but that could be due to the melting issue)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunblock! It&#x27;s so lightweight that you don&#x27;t feel it after applying! I hate thick goopy smelly sunblocks, especially when using on my face and this product is great!</li>
    <li> This absorbs quickly and has no white cast. I don&#x27;t have any problems even when reapplying over makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product and goanna last for a while :)</li>
    <li> Seriously great stuff- goes on like a comfortable moisturizer, sits beautifully under foundation, and keeps those pesky wrinkles away. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better sunscreen for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Not for my skin!! I used it for 3 days and my face got red and a lot of pimples!!</li>
    <li> Totally worth the buy. I&#x27;ve been looking for a light sunscreen that has a good SPF for a while. I should&#x27;ve looked into Asian sunscreens a long time ago. It&#x27;s not sticky, especially if you let it set. After a few minutes, my skin is so smooth. There is no shine, so I&#x27;m not sure what people are claiming when they say it&#x27;s shiny. It&#x27;s perfect for the face, coming from someone who is extremely oily. I hate the feel of heavy creams or sunscreens; I rarely wear foundation or even CC/BB creams for that reason. This however, is so light, I just feel like I&#x27;m wearing a thin layer of moisturizer. Much, much better than the Neutrogena brand I&#x27;ve been using. Glad I found this; totally adding it to my holy grail list of products.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen so much! I smells pleasantly citricy. It is not at all oily, and it glides on smoothly like a regular lotion. It does not leave a white film or a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much I ended up buying 5 bottles to keep in stock so i don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen! The formula is mostly matte, absorbs quickly, and has no white cast. It has alcohol in it (the sunscreen has a slight citrus/alcohol scent, but its subtle and dissipates), so if you&#x27;re sensitive to alcohol make sure to patch test! Also, this sunscreen is not sebum/sweat and water resistant so it won&#x27;t hold up if you&#x27;re sweating or in water (I reapply every two hours anyway, and use a regular sunblock for my neck and body). It&#x27;s a pretty small bottle, but for the price I don&#x27;t really mind. I&#x27;m glad the new formula is PA++++!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunblock! non greasy, easy to apply and absorb. No weird smell and small enough to carry around.</li>
    <li> not oily at all, light weight</li>
    <li> It is very watery and smooth, very easy to smear it evenly. Smells good, not very fragrancy, which I like. Will consider purchasing again if I use it up. The little thing that about this purchase is that they put my country incorrectly in France but I am in U.S., so it took a long while for me to get it. However, seller is very friendly.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and my eyes burn when putting anything around my eyes. I purchased this SPF 50 moisturizer because it was highly recommended by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is so light, goes on very easily, and does not have a chemical/sunscreen scent. My makeup goes on perfectly over this lightweight sunscreen. My eyes don&#x27;t burn when I put it on and my skin feels amazing after putting this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second bottle and I keep falling in love with it over and over again. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> With the reformulation to PA++++, this sunscreen now has UVA protection in the highest range currently measured by the Japanese sunscreen industry and is pretty much perfect. It&#x27;s extremely light-feeling even at the recommended 1/4 tsp/face dosage. Dries extremely quickly, is totally non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on skin at all. This is my absolute favorite sunscreen for daily use, and I hope I never run out.</li>
    <li> Really watery and small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately although I heard tons of good things about this sunscreen it broke me out horribly the first three times I used it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my skin. The only thing I can complain about is how small the package is! :( I am afraid I will go through one at least once a month. It&#x27;s well worth the purchase. I will laugh at the people who rated this 1 star because they couldn&#x27;t read the instructions because it was in a foreign language when it literally says JAPAN in the product title!!</li>
    <li> Alcohol in this leaves my face feeling dry and tight.  Gave this to my sil who likes it. The hunt continues!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen. It does not feel greasy, and it melts into my face easily, and it does not clog or enlarge pores. It is now part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best high-SPF formula I have ever tried. Every other one I&#x27;ve tried had either felt weird, made me look like Casper even under makeup or both. This one is very light (even a little runny) and absorbs quickly. It does have a light chemical smell right out of the tube, but that dissipates quickly. I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day, both under makeup and alone, and I&#x27;ve been impressed. Everything breaks me out, and so far, this has not. I only wish it was more readily available in the U.S. so shipping didn&#x27;t take so long. I recommend ordering well in advance of beach vacations.</li>
    <li> very lightweight and non-greasy, feels amazing on my face.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It is thin and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky, oily residue or a white cast on the skin. It soaks into the skin almost immediately!</li>
    <li> Got this new sunscreen today, LOVE IT. Like absolutely, no back-see&#x27;s, holy grail, will never return this product. Zero greasy feeling, doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol like my hada labo uv creamy gel (another holy grail/favorite) and smells... kind of sweet? It&#x27;s a very pleasant smell and not over powering at all, I cant tell once its on my face but I like smelling my hands after I apply it to my face because its a very good smell.</li>
    <li> Lightweight ❤️❤️❤️ Just as a I imagined how the product would work!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! Use everyday!</li>
    <li> This is my daily sunscreen on days where I&#x27;m not really in the sun too much. It&#x27;s very lightweight and makes a great makeup base, but I would for sure use something thicker if I know I&#x27;ll be outside for a while.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  The texture was nice, kind of a alcohol-based gel.  It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving a silky matte finish.  It was a nice primer.  Unfortunately, I received a light sunburn and later peeled.  I have begun to think that I am tanning a bit as my makeup is now too light.  My husband has darker skin than me and tanned significantly while wearing this sunscreen. I thought that I had found an easy to apply product that wouldn&#x27;t feel sticky and justify his complaints about sunscreen.  This didn&#x27;t prevent tanning, so why bother.</li>
    <li> Lotion is quite light, and turns to water after rubbed. Great.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen you can buy. No white cast, not greasy, works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> 4th time buying this product, have to say it&#x27;s the BEST sun screen I have ever used !</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin and looooves this sunscreen. 5+++</li>
    <li> The delivery was from Japan, not long time, just as mentioned and with a candy as gift :))  Very nice, light, moisturizing product, I am trying to avoid the heavy products or those with too much (chemical) ingredients. Small packs, 50 gr, good price, now is a bit higher.&lt;br /&gt;I put them in the refrigerator - another way to feel fresh in 100F+  outside :)&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, but my advice to the Seller: will be nice to have the ingredients on English, if not on the package at least on a paper inside...</li>
    <li> This is the Holy Grail of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you hate applying sunscreen to your face?  Hate the thick, white texture that you have to smear and rub so you don&#x27;t look like an albino?  Then you will loooove this stuff.  It goes on like a light facial cream--no rubbing or smearing.  No albino face.  Light citrus scent.  Dries quickly and protects all day.  I ordered two additional tubes after a week of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, it does contain alcohol which some people may be sensitive to.  I recommend an oil cleanser to remove this at night, unless you use a super high pH cleanser (which strips your skin and disrupts your skin barrier!) you won&#x27;t be able to effectively remove all traces of this.  I use a balm type oil cleanser (Clean if Zero from Banila Co.) and follow up with my usual foaming cleanser (CeraVe) to remove any remaining residue.  Not a clog or pimple caused by this baby!</li>
    <li> Not your typical sunscreen - and that&#x27;s a good thing! It feels great on my skin, didn&#x27;t block my pores, and protected me from sunburn while in Puerto Rico for 10 days. I highly recommend this sunscreen, especially if you are like me, and hate the feeling of sunscreen on your face - because it doesn&#x27;t feel like sunscreen at all. It has a light and watery texture that feels pleasant and absorbs very quickly. I was able to layer on my Bare Minerals primer and makeup almost right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin: oily with dry patches and I am prone to acne breakouts at 26. This sunscreen kept my skin hydrated and I did not breakout after wearing it everyday for 10 days in a row. Definitely will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the holy grail of sunblock imo and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Like it very much! Easy to apply, not thick at all. Best for summer~</li>
    <li> Purchased this after reading reviews that discussed its viscosity as being thin. I visited Las Vegas last week and the sun was out in full force. The skin that already had a slight tan to it was protected and did not further tan. However, the pale skin burned, but not extremely. I did get real red on those places, but did not feel that typical stinging burn. I will use again when next in the sun and see how the newly tanned skin fares.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s that effective? I&#x27;ve been pretty tan this whole summer. But again it does take some time to see results. I really liked the texture of the cream. It&#x27;s very light and not as oily as other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Very good product. The most lightweight and blendable sunblock I&#x27;ve ever used specifically for face. However, most of the reviews said how they wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there wasn&#x27;t any actual sun protection in the product, because of how light it is and how easily it absorbs. But I could still tell because even though it was easily blendable, the is still the tiniest white cast of you don&#x27;t blend properly. Although blend in is easy with this SPF, I just have a very bad OCD about having to run any product on my skin. But I highly reccomend for anyone looking for a very light SPF, that absorbs easily compared to most.</li>
    <li> I liked the texture of it...much betterr than the US brand names...it is super light and goes on easy without leaving any white sticky residue..However I have super sensitive skin and it made me break out..It does make your face look oily and shiny..I gave it to my firnd who has a normal combination t zone skin and she loves it.. I would definitely recommend it to people with normal skin looking for a good UV coverage.</li>
    <li> Lightly scented but I only smell it when I first apply it and for a few minutes after. Easy to spread and fast absorbing. At first feels slightly tacky but can&#x27;t even feel it after a few minutes. Doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy. Wished it was just a little moisturizing because I have dry-combination skin, but it doesn&#x27;t make me dryer so I&#x27;ll live. Hasn&#x27;t broken my skin out yet. Western brands always seem to break me out. Asian brand skincare is the only thing that my skin is okay with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it protects me from UV rays or not, I&#x27;m not sure yet because I haven&#x27;t been outside for more than 15 minutes at a time per day so far.</li>
    <li> It is light and smells good. Like it so far. The only problem is that I am not able to read the ingredients. It is Japanese @@</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good! Good protection and it is not oily. Easy to use but the small bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Super silky and light! My skin loves it. It does have a lot of alcohol, so some may not tolerate it well.</li>
    <li> Totally love it! This product arrived earlier than I expected!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! I have been using it for 2 years. I have very fair skin and burn easily. This keeps my face protected and is not greasy at all- no breakouts.</li>
    <li> Nice sunscreen, really light feeling. Only thing is I don&#x27;t like using chemical sunscreens. Will look for a phy only one next time</li>
    <li> Has a slighty fruity-sunscreeny smell.</li>
    <li> This is absolute nonsense! In terrible English is an add on paper label . . .&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It is the latest Package for 2015years!&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I WON&#x27;T EVEN OPEN MINE! I will not put anything on my face that has nothing I can TRUST!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the second worst experience I had with AMAZON. The first being the Chinese 100% polyester sheets being passed off as 100% Egyptian touch.</li>
    <li> Light weight and works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> Nice light weight cream. If you like a good sunscreen protection with non-greasy skin finish, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I live in Arizona and have been trying to find a sunscreen for the face that didn&#x27;t fell like you had sunscreen on the face.  Read reviews on this and bought it.  It feels light and I put it on under my makeup.  The tube its small but you only need a small amount.  Worth It!</li>
    <li> No white cast, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave sheen (even when using over .5 teaspoon). Doesn&#x27;t break me out and seems to last a long while.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this sunscreen! It doubles Asa moisturizer, which saves me time in the morning. I apply 1/4 tsp to my face each day, which seems like a lot at first but this stuff absorbs into your skin SO fast! Since the SPF is so high, I&#x27;ve noticed some of my spots of hyper-pigmentation fading and my skin getting smoother with time. This lotion is a must-try, I swear by it!</li>
    <li> This is the stuff of pale girls&#x27; dreams.  This gel sunscreen sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I&#x27;ve had issues with other face sunscreens, but this one doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.  My work has me out in the LA sun during the most intense hours of the day and this keeps my skin totally protected.  I cannot recommend this sunscreen enough.  Shipper sent a lovely little note, too :)</li>
    <li> Very good sunblock for protect the skin from UV, will order more next time.</li>
    <li> Watery, easy to absorb texture and minimal scent makes this product amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! This is the only sunscreen that I have ever repurchased. I love how lightweight it is, it does not feel greasy at all and it does not leave any white cast. There is a light, floral scent, but it is non-offensive and disappears after about 10 minutes. It feels like I just have regular lotion on my face, and it seems to protect well! I&#x27;ve used this out in scorching hot sun, and did not get sunburnt at all, and I burn very easily. Will continue to repurchase!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months now. Before trying it, I thought greasiness was just a necessary component of preventing sun damage and I&#x27;d just have to deal with it, but this stuff just disappears on my skin after a few minutes without any greasiness or white cast or anything, and I&#x27;m slathering on a pretty decent amount. *And* it&#x27;s better UV protection than most of the greasy face sun screens I&#x27;ve tried. Really glad I gave it a shot.</li>
    <li> Perfect: easy application, not sticky, great sun coverage, and feels very very light-almost like a lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product for use every day. Absorbs so fast, dries matte very quickly. It&#x27;s easy to use the recommended 1/4 tsp when you don&#x27;t see any white cast on your face and you can&#x27;t feel it after it sinks in!</li>
    <li> THX , hopefully it works⋯⋯and the gift!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best facial sun screen I have every used.  It goes on light and works - I expected to get burned (or tanned) after being out for several hours and was not.  It really does what it says - it does feel so light you may not believe it is spf 50.  Do your research though and get the one made in the right year (i.e. look for 2015 in 2015), etc.  Sunscreen can expire&lt;br /&gt;I was a previous neutragena user and then Meroxyl / European sun screens.  Then Neutragena changed their formulation (I theorize this) because I started to react to the daily spf30 moisturizer that I had used for years (I had bought several to see if I happened to get a dud).&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I am buying a few for my friends to introduce them to this product.</li>
    <li> It took only a week from Tokyo to me. Very happy with the fast shipping and it&#x27;s FREE. Can&#x27;t be more excited to get these wonderful sunscreens from Japan with such low prices and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This was everything it was reported to be and more. I usually avoid chemical sunscreens because they irritate my skin and burn my eyes. This sunscreen is different: it&#x27;s absolutely non-irritating, just takes a minute to settle on the skin, and then it feels like I have nothing on. Some people find the alcohol irritating to the skin; thankfully my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.</li>
    <li> Good, recommended by my friend.</li>
    <li> I believe to read orhers&#x27; comment that this is chemical sunblock so yes it absorbs well and quickly into your skin leave no white or oily sticky feels.  I used it as a makeup base and touch over lightly with powder foundation.  It&#x27;s a perfect everyday natural look that no one can tell I have on SPF 50 with powder as well.  I just don&#x27;t like the smell but it&#x27;s very light smell so I don&#x27;t mind.  The tube is quite small in size for everyday uses.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used! Leaves skin feeling smooth and not oily - looks matte, and smells nice as well!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like putting on sunscreen for many reasons. One of them being that they tend to feel extremely sticky, and I just don&#x27;t like that feeling on my skin, and they cause breakouts on my face. I used this sunscreen and I was surprised that it did not feel sticky on my face. It actually felt moisturizing and was very easy to apply. It also smelled great and didn&#x27;t make my face breakout. I highly recommend this sunscreen especially if you are on a budget because that&#x27;s another great thing about this sunscreen. It&#x27;s very affordable and better than most high end brand products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on Melodee Morita&#x27;s beauty haul recommendations.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t love it as much as she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is very thin and watery liquid as the name suggests.  However it leaves my skin feeling greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in.  Even after I apply mineral powder makeup on top of it my face is shiny within a few hours.  On the positive side, it didn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I&#x27;ll buy this again.  I prefer Clarins UV Plus or EltaMD UV Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, combo Asian skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing sunscreen. I had a major acne problem and had a lot of PIH scars leftover. I was using retin A to get the scars to fade. Unfortunately, this made my skin super sensitive to sunlight. This sunscreen really helps protect my PIH from getting any worse. It is not glossy. It is not greasy. It is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so light!!! and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Awesome sunscreen..it feels even better than the expensive sunscreen I got in the past....</li>
    <li> It works perfect to keep my skin hydrated, and I don&#x27;t feel sticky as my skin breaths as smoothly as it does in usual without sunscreen. I do highly recommend this to people with sensitive skin or people have breakout on skin with american brand sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s a little less moisturizing than my usual Hado Labo sunscreen, but it s Matt and smooth, and dies quickly.</li>
    <li> This is not a beach sunscreen. It is not waterproof. Reapplication throughout the day is needed if you sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for everyday use in non-humid/non-sweaty conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight lotion but it does not feel ‘watery’ as the name claims.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly into, leaving a soft matte texture.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is light yellow but it does not affect your skin tone when applied.&lt;br /&gt;Small container. It can last a few months if you’re only using it for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that shipping takes a long time from Japan. Order ahead if you’re running out soon.</li>
    <li> I know that physical spf is better than chemical, but physical spf on my face breaks it out, clogs my pores, and gives white shine.  Make sure to use antioxidant cream with this or after use.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality！But it is a long long long time delivery~</li>
    <li> This sunscreen would be AMAZING....If it didn&#x27;t make me break out! The texture is awesome, light, and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;ve put anything on. I&#x27;m really sad that my skin didn&#x27;t like it; I was so tempted to keep using it just because it feels so nice--hence, the high rating.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second bottle. I love it. Not greasy nor sticky and it don&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;suncream&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found a sunscreen I actually like!! I&#x27;m very picky about what I&#x27;ll put on my face and can&#x27;t stand anything that feels heavy, greasy or sticky. That is what most American sunscreens feel like to me so I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for a sunscreen for my face that I can actually tolerate so I&#x27;ll use it. This stuff is amazing. It almost instantly absorbs into my skin and feels like I have nothing on. Seriously. It really doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything on my face - so much so I wondered how it could possibly work. It does though - no sunburns so far! I&#x27;m also really picky about scents in cosmetics and lotions. I&#x27;ve ruled out several just because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of them. This stuff has a light lemon scent that isn&#x27;t quite like fresh lemons but is quite tolerable and the smell goes away quickly. I can&#x27;t believe how different this sunscreen is compared to what we can buy in US stores. I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to daily sunblock. It leaves no white cast at all and has a clean, pleasant scent. If you&#x27;re a makeup wearer, this soaks in quick and provides a nice base for makeup. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for over a year. With daily use, this tube will last you a couple months.</li>
    <li> Holy Grail of sunscreens for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Good quality and good speed</li>
    <li> love how light it feels on my skin, love this product! its water based so it doesnt feel like you have a mask on, and i dont break out.</li>
    <li> Soft powdery finish and smells great! My boyfriend who usually refuses to wear sunscreen has used it all up already because he&#x27;s using it as a moisturizer after washing his face.  I need to buy a bigger size.</li>
    <li> Probably the best sunblock I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the smell, it smells citrusy to me. It&#x27;s super light and perfect under make-up. Not greasy at all, goes on like regular hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;100% does not have the nasty sunblock smell that so many other sunblocks have. I take it in my purse all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion, love the quality of tje consistency/composition because after is applied, you won&#x27;t even remember or feel is there. Not oily at all. Will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen! I love it! It wears so well under makeup, you can hardly tell you are wearing any! It absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky white cast on your skin. The bottle is smaller than people are usually used to with sunscreen, so make sure to pick up two! It has a light citrus scent and is a thinner watery lotion texture. It has alcohol in it, but doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you will never go back to american sunscreens again!</li>
    <li> This is a really common drugstore sunscreen in Japan, and it&#x27;s popular for good reason. It feels so light, soft and almost velvety when dried. I use this under a physical/chemical sunscreen, Missha Soft Finish Sun Milk, for maximum protection. Because this is so light, it&#x27;s perfect for layering. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but if you do, this would probably be a suitable base and wouldn&#x27;t feel too heavy underneath BB cream or another product with additional SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this sunscreen contains hyaluronic acid, which moisturizers and has other benefits for the skin. Definitely a product to keep repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Works great for my acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin to be oily and with white substance like other sunscreen products.  I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this sunscreen, because I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts. I was looking for a high SPF and high PA++++ rating to fight UVA and UVB rays (and premature skin aging). After Elta MD Physical clogged my pores horribly, I decided I would have to look into physical/chemical combo sunscreens to get the protection I needed without the breakouts. I really like the texture of this sunscreen. It is very watery, and feels like a light lotion going on. You will not be able to start off with 1/4 teaspoon in your hand directly on your face. In order to get the right application, use 1/8 teaspoon at a time, and layer the sunscreen on. Once the first layer dries (there is alcohol in the product to facilitate a dry, matte finish), you can apply the second layer. Let the second layer dry and set, and then apply your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in an office and keep my blinds shut, so I rarely get more than 2 hours of sun exposure all day, and I can tell you I can still feel this sunscreen on at the end of the day. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a layer of lotion, but I can tell it&#x27;s there because the texture of my skin is still matte and soft. It&#x27;s a very nice change from the Elta MD Physical where I felt grungy by the end of the day. It also seems like this sunscreen has other skin beneficial ingredients to it, as my skin feels nicer at the end of the day. The only reason I took off a star is, for the price, this is a very small container of sunscreen (about 1-1/4 ounces). Aside from the small container, I think this sunscreen is well worth the money for the good feel, excellent protection (much better UVA protection than ANY U.S. sunscreen), and other beneficial ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is my second tub of the sun screen. It is the best I used , light moisture touch , free feeling of the day ! 5 star !!</li>
    <li> I love this.  I bought this for vacation in Croatia in August.  This stuff is marvelous!  It goes on really nicely, it looks &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; when it comes out of the tube.  It seems like it creates a dewy shield on your skin. It also seemed to stay on even when I was sweating through the upper 90s, high humidity temps.  I see no need to buy anything else.  It is pricey when you consider what you are paying for verses the size but well worth it.  For me I use it on my face, neck, and chest.  For the rest of my body I use a regular zinc oxide sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens, and the new formula does not disappoint. I have highly sensitive skin and this does not cause breakouts. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, and leaves no white cast with or without makeup. Cons: the alcohol smell is quite strong, but dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> So much better than any western brand sunscreen I have ever used! Asian sunscreen technologies seem to be more advanced than western ones.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It goes into your skin fast! and no oily sticky feeling at all.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth&lt;br /&gt;* No white cast&lt;br /&gt;* Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;* Looks great under makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Strong alcohol scent&lt;br /&gt;* Not a lot of product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love this one, but it&#x27;s still an improvement over sunscreens typically available in the U.S.. This is why I give it 4 stars instead of 3 - it&#x27;s better than using a western sunscreen.  I do feel like it leaves with a little sheen/oil on my face, but it&#x27;s not terrible.  I definitely prefer Biore Perfect Milk&#x27;s satiny finish over this one though.</li>
    <li> THE best spf for oily/ combo skin!  I wear it in the morning, and it acts nicely as a primer.  A fabulous find!</li>
    <li> Great, light weight for cool and heat temps</li>
    <li> This is a superb, light, effective product with no allergic or chemical reactions, such as runny eyes, or burning skin. This is by far the most gentle, most effective, and overall best sunscreen on the market. I finally found one after years of looking!</li>
    <li> Heard rave reviews about this product, especially the new formulation. Before this, I was just like most Americans and not knowing what I was missing out on in the realm of sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all sunscreens are thick, white, creamy, and oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is a dream to apply. It feels light and fresh, having more of a watery/gel-like texture than a thick cream. Sinks in and dries to a nice matte finish quickly, with a pleasant smell. I swear my skin looked better with this sunscreen on too, as if I had a slight glow - but without the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is perfect for daily use. It is lotion-like with a PA++++ rating for UVA protection.  BUT... this is 50 grams.  That&#x27;s it.  It is smaller than [[ASIN:B00BALO6X0 NIVEA Sun Super Water Gel 80g - SPF50 PA+++ | No Scent | Remove by Soap | for Face and Body | Moisture Ingredients - Collagen &amp; Hyaluronan(Japan Import)]] and WAY smaller than [[ASIN:B00BALO0XG Nivea SUN Protect Water Gel Spf33 140g Pump | Uv Protection (Japan Import)]].  I have used both of these for more than a year, and love them, but they may be reaching the end of their commercial cycle (and won&#x27;t be available any more).  Plus, they don&#x27;t provide as much protection.  Perhaps a PA++++ sunscreen will end up packaged like this one in bigger volumes.  In light of the price, I will use this one on weekends when I&#x27;m out in the sun more, and the cheaper ones on weekdays when I see little daylight. Anyway, this stuff goes on with zero oil and zero residue. Would be nice if it were cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Nivea Japan Sun Protect SPF 35 PA+++ has replaced the pump dispenser SPF 33 PA+++</li>
    <li> Love this product: light and clear. Exactly what I need for my oily skin!</li>
    <li> It is not greasy at all! It is more like watery texture and absorbs really quickly and it does have light scene on it, but it didn&#x27;t bother at all!!</li>
    <li> Great for greasy skin. Lightweight enough for multiple applications throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con. Small bottle, does not last very long</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is amazing!  There is nothing like it that I know of available in the U.S.  I would never have known about this but I traveled to Japan where it is available just about anywhere.  Every sunscreen I have tried in the U.S. that offers this level of SPF is either greasy, smells awful, sits on your skin, makes you feel like you&#x27;re wrapped in plastic, gets on your clothes, furniture, etc. and possibly staining these surfaces, makes your eyes sting, and when used on your face causes clogged pores.  Some of the sunscreens are nearly impossible to wash off.  So let me tell you what I LOVE about this product:  It is relatively inexpensive (you are paying more because someone has to get it from Japan), it goes on like silk and absorbs quickly--once it&#x27;s on, you&#x27;re no longer aware that you&#x27;re wearing it, it smells fresh and clean when you apply but doesn&#x27;t linger, you can wear it on your face without breakouts--I wear it every day for a foundation, and it will not make your eyes water.  Why can&#x27;t we find this in the U.S.?  Japan, you could make a fortune here.  Thanks for making this available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen for face I&#x27;ve ever used. It is not greasy, very light weight and when I touched my faced it was soft and smooth. Great protection for hard sunny days. Absolutely great product. Highly recommended! (￣▽￣)ノ</li>
    <li> Edited: I still love it but it was DEFINITELY breaking me out.  One day, I applied this to clean, unblemished skin prior to leaving my house. Within the 15 minutes it took to get to my destination, I experienced burning and itching. Look in the mirror, lots of small flesh colored bumps cropped up. I looked like I got smacked with a handful of beads. It took a few days for the reaction to fade away. I&#x27;d still recommend this as an option for other people who don&#x27;t like the white/blue cast of traditional sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that such a high SPF sunscreen does not leave a white or blue cast on my deep brown skin. Does not seem to make me more oily either. That said, it *may* be breaking me out but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I have ever tried, affordable, not at all greasy, feels great on skin, great coverage. Will buy again, however post was very slow to Australia from Japan.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the face. Not oily or heavy. I wear it under make-up and it&#x27;s perfect. The shipping took a few weeks but it was worth the wait. It came unopened and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I think biore&#x27;s sunscreen are best</li>
    <li> not waterproof, goes on like regular moisturizer. at first i was using a LOT because it felt so good, and then i ran out quickly. it&#x27;s expensive on amazon compared to buying on rakuten, but on rakuten you have to find a seller who ships to the US etc. this is a great daily moisturizer if you&#x27;re not going to be sweating or spending a lot of time outside. too expensive to use beyond face/neck/chest. pleasant citrus smell. honestly, i can&#x27;t stop raving about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that having been said, there are other japanese sunscreens that are also really good - i&#x27;m using the nivea UV gel which is very similar, and you get more in the bottle for about the same price. either way, if you&#x27;re using a photosensitizing active like a retinoid or AHA, this is a great choice for protecting your skin during the day. i actually like wearing sunscreen now!</li>
    <li> As an uber-pale, sun-averse, mostly Irish person, I am always looking for the Holy Grail of sunscreen. If I could get this in a vat and it weren&#x27;t quite so expensive, this would be my HG sunscreen for sure. It&#x27;s lightweight, blends into the skin quickly (important for everyday use, since you don&#x27;t want to wait around for sticky sunscreen to dry when you need to get dressed and get to work), and seems to effectively block the sun. I haven&#x27;t tried it for a long day on the beach, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but for daily sun exposure -- including driving around with a convertible top down -- it has been great, and I have no doubt it will continue to be effective if I ever spend more than twenty minutes in the sun.</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this sunscreen except the alcohol. Its not greasy/shiny, it has a powder like feel, dries quickly, but the alcohol was just too drying.</li>
    <li> A nice sunscreen. It soaks in well. Good for daily life, but not if you plan on getting sweaty or wet.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen, smells like alcohol and might be drying if your skin isn&#x27;t moisturized enough. Otherwise it leaves my skin feeling completely smooth.</li>
    <li> There are tons of different sunscreen options out there, but I was intrigued by its PA++++ rating, which, btw, I did not know about until using the miraculous google search.  I learned that there were two types of UV rays (A&amp;B) and that a broad spectrum product such as this would be necessary.  Living in Southern California, where UV rays are plentiful, I decided to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression of this product was that it was very watery, which I liked because it is easier to apply and to absorb into the skin.  The smell wasn&#x27;t like a typical sunscreen either (imagine a banana boat sport spray) and was rather mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been applying to my face daily as I work outdoors and my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.  I only apply one coating of sunscreen, and have yet to fully sweat out the first layer, and it did not sting my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to give this a full run, but pretty impressed with the product thus far.  5 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunscreens in my quest to find a good one for everyday use, and this is far and away my favorite. As soon as I apply it, I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin at all - there&#x27;s no tacky residue. It has a very light odor (not fragrancey), which I actually didn&#x27;t like at first, but the smell goes away immediately. And compared to the cost of comparable sunscreens, the price for this one is very reasonable. The only negative is that shipping takes a really, really long time, so I have to plan well in advance to make sure that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> No smell and not greasy!</li>
    <li> The consistency is watery and cool once it hits your skin. The sunscreen immediately absorbs and feels light weight, however, it made my skin very dry. I have normal to oily skin and this sunscreen made my t-zone area very dry and flaky, which was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Works good but the smell is funky.</li>
    <li> Very light sunscreen, definitely &amp;#34;aqua-rich&amp;#34; as it says, so it&#x27;s more on the watery side than on the oily side. However, it also claims SPF50, which I am skeptical about since it is so light.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen DOES NOT WORK. Was out in sun for only 2 hours and got burned. And I am not fair skinned! I am medium toned. One of the worst sunscreens i ever used.</li>
    <li> You barely feel it on your skin, unlike other sunscreens, and it works!</li>
    <li> Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much. Absolutely non-sticky!!!!</li>
    <li> Clear and not oil at all!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really great product. Not too oil and feel like skin can breath under cover</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pill and dries matte!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It goes on so smooth and immediately sinks into my skin. I don&#x27;t know how my co-worker found it, but I&#x27;m glad she told me about it. Too bad they don&#x27;t sell anything this good is the US. I break out using most sunscreens except for this one. It&#x27;s more like a gel than a cream.</li>
