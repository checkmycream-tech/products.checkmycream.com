<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use Dermal Clay Cleanser to clean my face. I have been using this product for a lot of years and now I am glad that I can purchase product from Amazon. It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Pump never worked. Product seems ok.  Gives a nice tingly feel after using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermalogica Dermal Clay Cleanser for quite some time and I love it..when I buy it in a store. Most of my purchases are done in-store because I don&#x27;t trust online beauty product websites. I should have spent the extra money. The product I received was outside of its original packaging. When the 16.9 ounce bottle of Dermalogica Dermal Clay Cleanser is purchased in-store, the bottle is inside of a Dermalogica box with a protective sticker holding the lid closed, ensuring the product is new and has never been tampered with. The product I received today was just simply inside of a cardboard box, no protective seals, no legit Dermalogica packaging. I thought I would take a chance and try the product. Mistake. Whatever is inside this bottle is not Dermal Clay Cleanser. It&#x27;s some sort of watered down, cheap, random &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34;. Now I have a bottle of used mystery cleanser that I can&#x27;t return. I should have known better. Go to the store and DO NOT buy online.</li>
    <li> I have combination/t-zone skin. This cleanser was recommended to me when I had a professional facial at a spa and I have been using it now for around 3 years. It has a great refreshing feeling that wakes me up in the morning and prevents the blemishes that I used to have. I love this pump bottle. The smaller (I think 8 oz) bottle with the round tilting cap always spewed a little cleanser out when I would open it and drove me crazy cleaning little spots off my shower wall. This bottle solved that problem, so now I am 100% annoyance-free and have a fresh face. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product and love being able to buy the large size. Much more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it now for three weeks and I can see a major improvement in my skin. The blackheads that I used to always have on my T-zone are all gone and now I can see my pores getting smaller. After first use my skin felt amazing. My skin felt cool, clean, and refresed. I also use a dermalogica mask once a week. I think I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for years. I am 66 years old and still have oily skin that requires lots of care.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes burn when I washed my face.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this.  My daughter swears by it and says it&#x27;s the only product that keeps her skin from breaking out. So she&#x27;s hooked and I get to buy it ;)</li>
    <li> Feels good and I could tell a difference in my big fat pores within a week.</li>
    <li> My daughter was breaking out all over her face.  After using this product, all of her face cleared up.  She ran out about a week ago and is breaking out again…I have to order more.</li>
    <li> The woman who does my facials uses this line and gave me a small container to try at home. This one product has done more to clear my skin, keep it clear and improve the texture and color of my skin than anything I have ever used. Love it and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It makes my face feel refreshed, even the next morning. My skin feels smoother and has cleared up a bit since using it. A bottle goes a long way. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> great for oily skin without leaving it dry.  been using this for years.  see no reason to use anything else.</li>
    <li> I finally quit using proactive finally due to this product. I am in love with dermalogica. I have combination skin and now it feels balanced.</li>
    <li> I love this product Keeps skin clear but non drying</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed because I thought this was a great deal. I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a year and it&#x27;s awesome. Unfortunately, the cleanser I received from Amazon was not the same. It was in the same packaging as what I get at the salon, but the consistency and smell is pretty different. I&#x27;m going to try it since I wasted the money on it but I wish I would have spent the extra few bucks and not purchased online.</li>
    <li> I just bought this, have noticed a red/sensitive/deep breakout on mt cheek and forehead. These have been problem spots for year and have managed to be calm when i use a regular cleanser or an exfoliant with alpha. Does this cleanser cause breakouts or pulls out breakouts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angelo</li>
    <li> I used this until it was almost gone and did not see any changes to my skin. Plus, it was very messy. The clay material would fall to my sink or on the container, or hang from the nozzle and it dries up and is a pain to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at a local retailer. I&#x27;m a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.  This is not one of my main facial cleansers BUT I do like this one and would recommend it. I find that it&#x27;s very good for the summer and has a cooling effect, which does a good job of cleansing and clearing impurities.</li>
    <li> This product was packaged terribly. The cap was bound by bubble wrap and too much packing tape, which left stickiness all over,  The cleanser was also missing it&#x27;s protective security seal, which I found to be pretty shady.  Not willing to risk the quality of a product that&#x27;s going to go on my face, I returned this product.</li>
    <li> This product is a great product &amp; I would recommend it to family &amp; friends, I really like the price compared to Dermalogica site which is really pricey &amp; my product arrived on time &amp; will order from this company again</li>
    <li> By far my favorite Dermalogica cleanser. I find it gives me a good deep clean but it also soothing and cooling to my skin. This large pump bottle is a great deal.</li>
    <li> These are great what a savings! I was worried about the expiration date possibly on these. When I got the two bottles I called derma logic and verified the expiration dates and they are about two years or so out! My wife takes six months to go through a bottle some people might take less or longer-so even with that this bottle could sit on my shelf for a year and then still be okay for her to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note: my wife&#x27;s face is very sensitive to products and she has had no complaints about these bottles. These bottles are not old, or replicas, they are the real demalogica product with a valid expiration date.</li>
    <li> I found Dermalogica after a bad expereince with a facial peel and I have been addicted ever since.  This product is great for my oily skin and this sizes last me about a year.  When you compare how much you would spend mothly or bi-monthly on other solutions (Clear-a sil or Proactiv) this is a no brainer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years. Strong enough to keep the acne at bay, but does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is true to its name; a must try it really works. I discovered it years ago when my daughter suddenly developed a really bad skin issue.&lt;br /&gt;She used it for a short time and was all cleared up. The rest of the bottle sat around, I started using it, as I did not want it to waste, for its not cheap; to my pleasant surprise, it gave me skin I never knew was possible. Keep this one as a staple.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermal Clay for 25+ years. Have tried many different products but keep coming back to this.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this product.  Great wash that is gentle and refreshing, and it is a product we can both use making it worth the money</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin this is the cleanser for you. I have been using this for 5 years and never thought I would find something that wouldn&#x27;t break me out or cause an ever greater oil slick to form. I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers and nothing beats this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is refreshing and tingly but doesn&#x27;t hurt your face.  I like most Dermalogica products and this one is no exception.  Plus the bottle is huge--it&#x27;s going to last me awhile.</li>
    <li> I have inherited large and numerous pores from my mom&#x27;s German side of the family, so I&#x27;m always looking for cleansers that help with black heads.  Anything clay based is promising for that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this cleanser does nothing to remove dirt and makeup, that is not how I use it.  I wash my face with my normal, gentle cleanser and my ProX facial brush, to remove the day&#x27;s makeup and dirt, then I apply one full pump all over my face and let that sit on my face while I finish up my shower.  At the end of my shower, I gently massage the clay cleanser into my entire face, then rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a week, I mix a pump of this clay cleanser with a half teaspoon of Bentonite Clay and apply as a mask.  I let this mask sit on my face for a half hour or so, then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product as a mask has really worked to clear my pores, reducing their size and appearance, resulting in a smoother complexion and more flawless makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that it&#x27;s expensive, but this bottle has lasted a LONG time!  If you have trouble with large pores and black heads, I really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser; it feels good, lasts forever, and does a really good job.  Highly recommend.  It&#x27;s really great!</li>
    <li> While it seems to cleanse Ok, I have not seen any reduction of oil in the t-zone, or smoothness of my skin whatsoever. That&#x27;s what I bought this product for. My skin does feel clean after use, the menthol type fresh feeling is nice after a long day. However, no change in appearance at all. In fact, used it last night before bed, also applied the dermatological over night treatment, woke up to a fresh breakout. I am only giving it two stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any of the results it promises in all the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had been a drugstore product I&#x27;d throw it away, but its too expensive to just throw out. I will use it but wont buy again. No results you couldn&#x27;t get with a cheap can of Noxzema.</li>
    <li> I like this facial cleaner a lot, enough even to justify the relatively high price tag.  This is made with green clay, and I know you are supposed to do clay masks for getting rid of blackheads if you have them like me. The problem is, I am lazy.  I don&#x27;t usually feel like doing a 15 minute mask once a week.  This is the perfect alternative. It seems to clean nicely whether you scrub with your fingers or a vibrating facial brush.  It also has a nice tingling feeling.  Has it solved all my acne problems? No, but I think it helps.</li>
    <li> Genuine Derma product. Very clean and soft skin after cleansing. I have oily, sensitive and acne prone skin so this is very good for me.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.especially for sensitive, oily skin.</li>
    <li> Works for my oily skin!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Literally like no other one out there. Makes skin feel a tingling sensation every time. Perfect for oily, acne prone, or to use for a deep clean for dry skin every once in a while. The only thing i didnt like is when i received it the cleanser did not have the &amp;#34;safety sticker&amp;#34; attached to the bottle and cap to ensure no one tampered with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Skin feels tingly and you feel it really cleans when u use it. I&#x27;m in my 40s and this has helped my acne</li>
    <li> Use it daily or as a mask.  Keeps my pores clean and slows oil production.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge. It&#x27;s the size of a lotion bottle. Should last me a long time. I&#x27;ve used this clay cleanser and it&#x27;s always kept my face clear of acne. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am 100% satisfied with this cleanser! I have combination type skin, very oily in T-Zone and some redness when irritated. This cleanser not only keeps the oil down but also soothes my skin and reduces redness. I am excited I finally found a product that lives up to its description!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, and clears up my face better than anything. It also leaves a cool clean sensation that I can&#x27;t get enough of. Best face cleanser anywhere.</li>
    <li> The Dermalogica line has SAVED my skin. The Dermal Clay Cleanser cleanses well and keeps my oily combination skin in check. I appreciated the fast shipping from the seller as well and will continue to do business with them.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is ideal for congested skin. The clay gives a very deep clean and leaves NO residue or tight feeling in your skin afterwards like most gel cleansers. Your skin feels SUPER clean, refreshed &amp; tingly. Great for severe acne.</li>
    <li> I loved the way this felt on my face the first time I used it. A very nice cooling sensation, it made me believe it was really working! After months of use, my skin looked the same as always. I enjoyed using this cleanser, but I haven&#x27;t purchased it again since I ran out. For me, the price outweighed the benefits, and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to spend this much on a facial cleanser that isn&#x27;t spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use the Alba Botanica Acne Dote System (pore wash, scrub, and oil control lotion). The prices are a lot more reasonable and I love the results they give me, also they&#x27;re all natural (a huge plus for me). I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year with no thoughts of trying anything new... which is quite surprising because I always want to try different products. It has a nice minty smell and you can buy any of the products at Target.</li>
    <li> As described.. I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> Its creamy and refreshing. Gently removes all the oil and doesn&#x27;t dries  skin . Best face wash ever!!! Finishing with Dermalogica Active Moist</li>
    <li> My entire life I have had bad acne.  I have tried product after product, and some of them twice, in case I \\&quot;didn&#x27;t think I used it right\\&quot;.  I found this product late one night as a recommendation after ordering a clarasonic mia.  I decided to give it a try.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!!!  It&#x27;s been 3 days and my face is clear for the first time in my life!  I will never use another product!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great customer service. Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> BEST CLEANSER EVER! Really gentle on the skin! Great for oily skin. A little goes a long way. AND YOU CAN DOUBLE IT AS A FACE MASK! It has a great cleansing sensation!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! La di dot dot da. Buy it you will be please by this more than any other acne wash on the market!</li>
    <li> THIS CLEANSER IS BY FAR THE BEST CLEANSER IVE EVER TRIED,AND I HAVE TRIED ALOT OF THEM OVER THE YEARS.IT ALL STARTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS ABOUT 22YRS. I HAD NEVER HAD ACNE AS A TEEN AND WHEN I STARTED BREAKING OUT I FREAKED MAKING MY ACNE WORST I WAS SUPER SELF CONSCIENCE ABOUT MY FACE JUST BECOUSE NOBODY HAD EVER SEEN ME WITH A PIMPLE (THAT MADE IT EVER WORST)....OH WELL THANKFULLY I FOUND THIS AND MY FACE IS CLEARER THAN EVER :) WOULDNT CHANGE IT FOR ANYTHING...OH AND IT LASTS YOU FOR A LONG TIME!!!!!</li>
    <li> NO product has ever done for my skin what Dermalogica Dermal CLay has done. I have naturally oily skin so my acne used to be pretty bad. This stuff cleans the oils from deep down but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. My face feels so smooth and soft after cleansing. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old male athlete and have been using this cleanser for about a year now. I have tried the special cleansing gel in the past but felt it left my face somewhat dry. The clay cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and the menthol is extremely refreshing. Like others have noted, the 8 ounce bottle will last you close to a year as you only need that \\&quot;dime size\\&quot; amount for each use. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have very oily skin, I feel clean without feeling like my face has been stripped. And the finish of cooling is fantastic.</li>
    <li> After using the Dermalogica products I can honestly say I will not return to Mary Kay facial products. I felt bad selling a product that I did not use (Mary Kay) so I stopped! Using this right here is refreshing to my skin. It is worth every penny. I have seen a huge improvement in my skin after using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and this cleanser works well for my oily complexion.  I use it every day with an exfoliating glove.  The only downside is the full pump gives more than you need for just your face.  I have to pump it out gently to make sure it lasts long enough.</li>
    <li> This product gives your skin a tingle, which I like.  It works as well as other products I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon and I have been using it for a week now.&lt;br /&gt;I must stay it is an effective cleanser for oily acne prone skin (which is what I have).&lt;br /&gt;However, it is costly and sometimes I feel like I have to cleanse my face twice, especially when I wear sun screen so I am using it a lot more then other cleansers I had and leaves my skin dry. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to dry or normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, however, the skin feels really clean, squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the skin feels refreshed but when it goes near your eye (not even in the eye, but NEAR), it really stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? maybe. I can use this 2-3 times a week but not as a regular cleaner. Also, given the price point, I can find better products that will last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  It removes my makeup and feels great on my skin.  It is really the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that kept my T-zone acne under control.</li>
    <li> The existing reviews speak for themselves. Been using this stuff for 8 years and can&#x27;t go without it! I mix it with St. Ives invigorating scrub for an added exfoliant effect.</li>
    <li> I really like the dermalogica brand of products. From their cleanser to scrub to mask. The dermal clay cleanser smoothens my skin, gives a great refreshing feeling and makes my face glow. I use it daily to cleanse my face and I can feel the difference. I have oily skin and I use this cleanser along with the skin prep scrub, skin smoothing cream and the skin refining masque. I can see a visible difference in my skin and how much younger it looks after using the dermalogica line of products for the past year. Before I was using the regular brands like neutrogena, aveeno etc. The &#x27;D&#x27; brand of products are expensive but then there is visible difference as to how your skin looks.</li>
    <li> African American, early 30&#x27;s.... first time using this product and I love it. It leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh and rejuvenated, not to mention the tingling sensation from the menthol. Would buy again...</li>
    <li> look at the reviews and the stars. most dermalogica products have 4 to 5 stars. most beauty products are not this praised because they are not consistent in their different products. i love these products i use this product morning as a quick wash and at night i leave on for 1-5 minutes as a mask and my skin looks feels great. i use the dermalogica tinted spf 15 moisturizer as my sole foundation and it is fabulous all day and all night so natural and radiant. these products are really expensive for me but they last forever i cant stress how a little goes a long way if you can get a sample you will learn this.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by a clay based cleanser and what pushed me to buy it was a recommendation from a salon friend. Very cooling affects.</li>
    <li> I wear a fair amount of products to sun protection as well as make up. I only use this cleanser before bed time and it cleans my face really well in preparation for night treatment. Again, best place to buy it is from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am not in love with this cleanser, but it has helped the amount of oil on my face, not my acne however.  You can&#x27;t ever go wrong with Dermalogica as everything they have is of great quality. My skin feels so clean after using this.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I am one with combination skin and even though in my mid 20&#x27;s still suffer with minor acne breakouts. This bottle of cleanser will last me for an entire year. You only need a quarter sized amount and I use a facial buffer to scrub with- this product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or leave me itchy or blotchy. You have a nice cool sensation once you rinse off the product.&lt;br /&gt;I find that not only have my breakouts extremely decreased, but when they do happen around that lovely time of the month they clear up quickly and leave no darkspots (I haven&#x27;t broken down to using dark spot correcter yet) which I love.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that dermalogica is one company where they don&#x27;t change their formulas very often, unlike Aveda and others. I truly hate it when you find a product that works and then the company not only re-formulates but increases price where you get less quality and at a higher price point. Dermalogica, thank goodness, does not do this very often if at all- WHICH I LOVE because I know I can always count on this product.</li>
    <li> My pores are getting smaller......Had a huge volcano on the end of my nose 2 days after starting to use this product. Time will tell, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> Amazon sells this product, but this does not seem like quality Dermalogica Dermal Clay Cleanser. The item arrived without a box or seal--it was inside of a plastic bag and closed but otherwise it would be impossible to verify if the item were brand new. Additionally, after using the product, it does not seem up to the same standards of the normal Dermalogical Clay Cleanser, which is very refreshing to use and leaves a tingly feeling on the face upon application. There was no such feeling after using this cleanser, and I&#x27;m concerned that it is perhaps old or has been sitting in a hot warehouse too long, thus lowering its efficacy. For the price point, it&#x27;s really not worth skimping on quality when it comes to a product like this--very disappointing. I&#x27;ll have to seek out Dermalogica at a nearby salon when this cleanser is out.</li>
    <li> Great everyday cleanse that is not over drying and leaves face feeling fresh and clean. Safe for everyday use. I suggest using dermalogica&#x27;s moisturizer as well. I have used this before and ran out so I had to buy more.</li>
    <li> I always buy my Dermologica products on Amazon, in the larger professional size. It&#x27;s typically the same price as the tiny size you buy at the spa.  Just make sure your products come from a seller with good reviews and have all of the proper seals when they arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this particular product as both a cleanser and a mask when needed. It as a nice, cool, refreshing feel.  Makre sure to check with the Dermalogica website to see which products you need before you buy.</li>
    <li> I have oily/combination skin and this cleanser is great at zapping the grease without stripping the moisture from my dry spots. It has a tingly sensation so be really careful of the eye area. There&#x27;s no strong smell that I noticed. Overall, just a good, non-irritating cleanser. I use it with my Clarisonic and about one pump or a quarter sized amount gets the job done. Yes, it is expensive, but I find that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to feel like you&#x27;re getting your face thoroughly clean. I think you get your money&#x27;s worth. My only complaint is that the small amount of clay left at the opening, whether you use a pump or the smaller bottles, tends to harden and become unusable. I guess this is just par for the course with clay as an ingredient, but I wish there was some way to prevent this because it does waste a small amount of product.</li>
    <li> I would consider my skin slightly sensitive.  This product made my face SO DRY and I have the oiliest skin of anyone I know.  I cannot imagine anyone wanting it for dry skin.  It was awful...Made my skin look ten years older than I am.</li>
    <li> Tried this cleanser and it feels really refreshed especially in the morning, advisable to leave it on for 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;and wash it off, getting less breakouts since using this cleanser, great product which is not foaming but cleans your face&lt;br /&gt;really well. Advice to clean your eye make up with remover first to get a through cleansing effect.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so purchased this product after reading all the reviews. After using it for a week my skin only got oilier and did not like it. Everyone has different skin so what works for others may not work for all.</li>
    <li> I love their cleansers .  I really got a good deal on this considering how much it costs on Dermalogica&#x27;s site.</li>
    <li> A wonderful clay cleanser for oily or acne skin. It is great at controlling oil and minimizing mid-day shine. With long term use it helps to eliminate acne and the production of clogged pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews.  I have oily/acne prone skin especial around my chin.  I went off Proactiv to use this and my skin has been constantly breaking out with no end in sight and my skin is just as oily as it ever was.  I will be going back on Proactiv.  The reason I stopped using Proactiv is because the benzoyl peroxide in the lotion was staining my pillowcases.  OH WELL!</li>
    <li> the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it for more than just a couple of days ~ but in another week or two I think I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  It&#x27;s terrific (as are all dermalogica products I&#x27;ve tried so far) and even has a wonderful, refreshing &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect.</li>
    <li> I just buy this product for my wife as a gift on her birthday. One time, she said that she loved it so much.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product feels.</li>
    <li> this product did not help me with blemishes at all and dried my skin out. i am dark skinned and have oily combination skin. i was not very happy with this purchase and it was quite expensive. If you are dark skinned and/or have the same skin type as i do, it would be best just to use a regular cleanser and apple cider vinegar, these two products have given me clear skin and it is way cheaper than this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product line from Dermalogica for over a year and I love it. My face is usually greasy, not oily, it&#x27;s gross. But since I&#x27;ve been using this line it&#x27;s WAY better. It looks normal like everyone elses. I normally use this cleanser twice daily, but not in the winter time, it makes my cheeks too dry.</li>
    <li> I have oily &amp; acne prone skin. This cleanser seems to work for me. I like how it feels afterward, very clean. 1 pump is enough to wash the entire face &amp; neck. So, I think 16.9 ounce will last more than half year.</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to me at my local spa many years ago and it&#x27;s great for oily skin. You can use it daily as a cleanser or once in a while as a clay masque. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Leaves your skin feeling clean.  I usually follow up Dermalogica spray toner and then Dermalogica mositurizer during the winter months. Try and score some free samples either through the manufacturer or at a local spa that uses this product first before buying but I think you will like it. Reminds me of a great mud masque I use to use back in the day.</li>
