<li> I gave it 3 stars because it adds a shine to my face but covering dark spots and hiding bags under the eye its useless</li>
<li> This is not a good concealer.</li>
<li> Very unfortunate.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It has concealer and illuminator. Concealer does not work well with my asian (light brown) skin type but illuminator works well. I think I need tan/dark shade.</li>
    <li> If I had been able to see the color up close I would have realized that it was just a bit too dark for my face, I do like it however, because it does hold up well.</li>
    <li> I needed a dupe for my Giorgio Armani concealer, this one was it!  This product applied easily, though I wish it came in a tube.  Both the highlighter and concealer work well for every day work use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping to conceal my under eye circles. Instead it made them look darker and just did not help at all.</li>
    <li> Nice!  Very nice love the brush, because you just dot it on where you need it!  Great formula, and the highlighter is good too, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> i like very much this product, it really delivers without the hefty price tag. Love it! creates a bright look around the eye.</li>
    <li> The highlight side definitely brightens by eyes and covers up the bags I&#x27;ve acquired since losing a lot of sleep (newborn baby).&lt;br /&gt;The concealer is okay. I will probably buy this again!</li>
    <li> Very unfortunate.Maybelline has discontinued this concealer and their replacement is NOT the same.you do get a small amount but works great so i dont mind. I was SO happy to find a couple on amazon!</li>

    <li> I like the concealer part but don&#x27;t see how the other side highlights anything. It doesn&#x27;t. Just make one of the concealer on its own and I will love you forever! And if you do have one, someone tell me! ;)</li>
    <li> This is not a good concealer. I like the instant age rewind dark circle eraser much better. I&#x27;m 37 and need quality concealer you get what you pay for.</li>
