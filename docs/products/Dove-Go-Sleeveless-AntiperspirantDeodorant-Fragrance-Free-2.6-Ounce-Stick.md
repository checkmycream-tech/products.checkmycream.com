      <li>This deodorant works great!  </li>
      <li>Best unscented antipersperant I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>NOT fragrance free!!!!!  </li>
      <li>This stuff works perfect.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>This is the best.  </li>
      <li>No itching, no rash, great antiperspirant qualities, and no odor.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>Now they have come out with this one which is just great and works great.</li>
      <li>Great deodorant and no odor</li>
      <li>This is great.  </li>
      <li>On that front, this is a great product that works as promised.  </li>
      <li>It was great to find another one that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is a great deodorant.</li>
      <li>In my case being able to go sleeveless means not having arm pits enflamed by allergic reactions!!</li>
      <li>This works good considering</li>
      <li>Seems like a good deal.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair comparison</li>
      <li>so I decided that it was best for light color clothing.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have away any spots... good deodorant though</li>
      <li>I have loved every product I have tried, that was made by Dove.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most deodorants (maybe fragrance?), but these Dove deodorants have been great for me.  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>not wearing it in the heat and smelled better than if I was wearing this deoderant!  </li>
      <li>fragrance free deodorant is great.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it might not work as good against odor, but it turned ok.</li>
      <li>It seems to sooth them after shaving, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I guess it is supposed to make your skin smoother, and it does glide on nicely, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the smoothness of my underarms after five days, and even longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a lot of respect for Dove as a company, because they make good products and they support healthy body image by using women who are \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sized in their advertisements.  </li>
      <li>Nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t detect a scent in this, and I have a very strong sense of smell.  </li>
      <li>Making it a great economical choice.  </li>
      <li>I do love scents --- but it is also nice to sometimes find those products that have no scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was free from fragrances as promised, which was good.</li>
      <li>it was so strong!  </li>
      <li>It is truly fragrance free - fast shipping -perfect item -thank</li>
      <li>First it does not smell that great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s 1/3 to 1/4 of the price and seems to work ok for most people.</li>
      <li>There is a \\&quot;smell\\&quot; to it, but it is more like the smell of the ingredients used to make this.  </li>
      <li>Most deodorants cause a skin rash for me.</li>
      <li>Of course, now I feel like a hoarder with my many sticks of Dove</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like an unscented product.</li>
      <li>With most deodorants, I can apply them once every couple days, and not have odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d better switch deodorants.</li>
      <li>Still, I recommend this one and Dove is what I use most for cost efficiency.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant - smooth, don&#x27;t notice any fragrance once it&#x27;s on, and seems to work!</li>
      <li>and truthfully I didn&#x27;t feel any difference.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the deodorant and will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I usually love Dove products and I have been using their soap and hair products for years.</li>
      <li>but this deoderant most definately did not work for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it works as well as most deodorants do.  </li>
      <li>So I have found that using Shout Carpet Stain Remover will get rid of all or most of it in the laundry.</li>
      <li>I love it because my clothes don&#x27;t have that strong deodorant scent.  </li>
      <li>This was easy to use and worked well all day - even better than some of the clinical strength products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>far as what it smells like, as opposed to what I smell like when using it, I thought it was just great.</li>
      <li>I like most is this deodorant stick is truly fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>is an awesome brand of deodorant, as well as other products as well.  </li>
      <li>It does have a very mild smell, but I can&#x27;t say whether that&#x27;s a \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; or just the smell of the product.  </li>
      <li>It glides on easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms even the day after a laser hair removal</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as clinical products, but if you&#x27;re concerned about irritation, the milder product might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t strong at all though</li>
      <li>Though, the strength of the antiperspirant protection wasn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal dove deodarant fan for many years.</li>
      <li>Basically, although I can hypothetically imagine a better deodorant, I&#x27;m happy enough with this one that I don&#x27;t really feel any need to seek out something better.</li>
      <li>They are no longer shipping the fragrance free dove deodarant.</li>
      <li>Dove Go Sleeveless Antiperspirant/Deodorant Fragrance Free.  </li>
      <li>Dove fragrance free is one of the lowest fragrant deodorants that I have used, and, for that reason, I do like</li>
      <li>I found out I am allergic to fragrance in products, so went on the hunt for a fragrance free deodorant.</li>
      <li>Item is incorrectly listed as fragrance free.</li>
      <li>The fact that it is fragrance free allows my body lotion and perfume to shine and also assures me that the product is working and not masking odors.  </li>
      <li>: I see that this says Fragrance Free in the description.</li>
      <li>This particular antiperspirant works perfectly in that respect, leaving no indication that it has been applied, except perhaps for the absence of perspiration.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t actually have any kind of problem with my underarms being notably unattractive.</li>
      <li>Sleeveless Fragrance Free Antiperspirant/Deodorant is non-irritating and has a clean, mild scent.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t as clean as a deodorant as I would like.  </li>
      <li>This is awesome, keeps you dry and fresh; it really does its job.  </li>
      <li>If your needs are pretty light then Dove&#x27;s Go Sleeveless is a fine, unscented, and affordable product.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>Is kind to sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Of course I wanted to see what the hype was about and used [[ASIN:B001ECQ5FW Dove Go Sleeveless]] for a full week</li>
      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t make me want to put on a tank top and run around with my arms up, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment.</li>
      <li>but I love this stuff and had not been able to find it at my local Walgreen&#x27;s or Safeway.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a mild, non-irritating antiperspirant/deodorant, this is definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>The fragance free smells very musky like bo.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and makes you feel fresh without feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>More time will tell just how much I will really like this one.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this to see if this fragrance will be one of those rare exceptions ...</li>
      <li>Despite the fact that I rarely \\&quot;go sleeveless\\</li>
      <li>Overall, it is nice and I would purchase it.</li>
      <li>Dove&#x27;s product works nicely, with no smell, no appearance, and ultimately achieves its goal.</li>
      <li>Additionally, the weather is not conducive to sweating right now.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no irritation when used right after shaving</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of a fragrance free version but in the end I think I need something a little stronger.</li>
      <li>If it is no longer available, that information should be available to the public.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It did fine in tests in our household - it did leave minor marks on clothing, and wasn&#x27;t the most powerful tool in the drawer, but overall was fine.</li>
      <li>My husband thought I was a bit off when he saw me feeling my right underarm, trying to figure out if it was any more moisturized than my left underarm.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it does what they say this sleedveless dove does would recommend cant go wrong buying sleeveless dove.protect under arm wetness</li>
    <li> please delete this. i wasn&#x27;t aware when i left a review that it would be traceable via search engines on the internet, which i view as a violation of my privacy.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works great!  And, what&#x27;s really important for me is that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other brands.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I was upset because Dove changed the formula on their original Fragrance Free product so that it was only Unscented which allowed for a masking fragrance. We are multiple chemical sensitive so couldn&#x27;t use that formula any longer. Now they have come out with this one which is just great and works great. Hurray!!</li>
    <li> Best unscented antipersperant I&#x27;ve found.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate the underarms and has no parabens.</li>
    <li> NOT fragrance free!!!!!  Have done added fragrance- check the ingredients label on the back</li>
    <li> Truly hypoallergenic unlike other formulas.  The fact that it is fragrance free allows my body lotion and perfume to shine and also assures me that the product is working and not masking odors.  Would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin - I have eczema and this did not aggravate it.</li>
    <li> After buying another dove deoderant ( the powder one ) my husband told me I smelled like a feminine hygene product so I bought this. It does not have a fragrance however after wearing it my body chemistry must mix with it and it gives of a tangy funky smell. I know it is not my personal smell as I have gone days not wearing it in the heat and smelled better than if I was wearing this deoderant!  I hardly ever write a negative review but this deoderant most definately did not work for me and I now have four of em.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant and no odor</li>
    <li> I like it just what I ordered cost was  within the budget I wanted and I may need more in the future</li>
    <li> I am having a hard time these days locating this specific deodorant. This one has no &amp;#34;masking fragrance,&amp;#34; which other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; deodorants have. I am very sensitive to fragrances and the unscented deodorants with a masking fragrance actually HAVE a fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> All other Dove deodorants have strong scents to them except for the cucumber and green tea one. The fragance free smells very musky like bo. The secret ph balanced unscented[[ASIN:B005OAHN92 Secret Unscented Antiperspirant Deodorant Ph Balanced - 4 Pack]] smells better and don&#x27;t have no musky smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking I was ordering Dove Ultimate Sensitive Care ( [[ASIN:B0017WP52S Dove Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant Ultimate Clear, Fragance Free,  Sensitive Skin - 2.6 OZ]] ). I hate the way companies play with words. \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; should mean unscented. But no, only \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot; is truly unscented. This \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; product has a masking fragrance to cover up the slightly chemical-ly smell that many \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; products have. The masking fragrance gives it that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell when you open it and use it. But a masking fragrance is still fragrance. Almost all fragrances make my nose burn and my skin break out. I haven&#x27;t tried this to see if this fragrance will be one of those rare exceptions ... not sure I want to deal with the aftermath if it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I see that this says Fragrance Free in the description. Either I was sent the wrong product or the description is incorrect. At any rate, Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> I used this for about 1 month and had to throw it out. It feels wet during and after application, and the wetness feeling never goes away. Very uncomfortable! It did absolutely nothing to keep me dry and my clothes were constantly soaked. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with heavy perspiration but this product was worse than going without any anti-perspirant at all. Maybe it was the moisturizers or chemicals in it. Also, it is not fragrance free, but rather smells faintly like a bar of Dove soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the worst underarm product I&#x27;ve ever used. Body powder keeps me drier than this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually have any kind of problem with my underarms being notably unattractive. (I epilate, rather than shave, so perhaps that helps?) But I was interested in a fragrance-free antiperspirant/deodorant, and this does the job. It isn&#x27;t irritating, goes on easily, and hasn&#x27;t left any noticeable stains or marks on clothing. Seems like a good deal. Will probably re-order after my sample runs out.</li>
    <li> This product did not protect against odor for the day. In the past I had used another Dove deodorant and it worked very well. On the other hand, it was nice to find an unscented product.</li>
    <li> Of course, now I feel like a hoarder with my many sticks of Dove Go Sleeveless...but I love this stuff and had not been able to find it at my local Walgreen&#x27;s or Safeway. It does what I need it to do and I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to it like I do so many other brands (that claim to be scent free/gentle etc).  In my case being able to go sleeveless means not having arm pits enflamed by allergic reactions!!</li>
    <li> This item has recently changed. They are no longer shipping the fragrance free dove deodarant. Beware when you purchase, they will ship you the sensitive skin one, which is not fragrance free. Item is incorrectly listed as fragrance free. If you have a fragrance allergy, do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I searched for a long time to find a truly fragrance-free (not \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;) mainstream deodorant that could be purchased anywhere, and thought I had found it in Dove Ultimate Sensitive Care. Much to my dismay and disgust, when I opened one of the sticks, out came a powerful scent. I had my husband take a whiff, and he concurred. It took repeated washings to remove the persistent scent from my hands, even though I had only touched the cap and not the stick itself; the odor also lingered for a time in the room where I had opened it.   I usually check all the ingredients of any product that I purchase, but they were not listed on the page; this is information that Amazon should have provided. I just now looked up the \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; ingredients in this product on another site and, sure enough, one of them is a fragrance, ethylene dodecanedioate, which has a persistent musk odor and is used in many applications, including personal care and fragrances. It is also listed as a SKIN and eye irritant! This is misleading - Dove claims its product is for those with sensitive skin - and dangerous; musks are endocrine disruptors and persistent environmental pollutants, as well as potential carcinogens. I am thoroughly disgusted with Dove and their disingenuous marketing; I would have given this product 0 stars if I could have! Despicable!!</li>
    <li> Unscented and I love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have away any spots... good deodorant though</li>
    <li> I like this product. After using it for a few weeks, my underarms do feel slightly softer. It seems to sooth them after shaving, which is nice. I like the smell. It is fresh, but very subtle. I don&#x27;t like my body products to have too much scent to them. If I want to smell good, I will wear perfume or body spray, and I don&#x27;t like to have multiple scents on at the same time from using different products. Overall, it is nice and I would purchase it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as so-called \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; deodorants but it&#x27;s 1/3 to 1/4 of the price and seems to work ok for most people. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair comparison but I do think that in absolute value terms something like the [[ASIN:B001F51VS4 Secret Clinical Strength Advanced Solid Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant Light And Fresh Scent 1.6 Oz (Pack of 2)]] ends up being cheaper despite the appearances of getting less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Secret Clinical Strength (and perhaps other clinical strength anit-perspirants) has a higher concentration of the active ingredient and it seems to be in anhydrous form which means that it doesn&#x27;t contain any water. I get longer lasting protection with less application than I do with the Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what it comes down to is that we all have different needs based on our bodies perspiration and our skin&#x27;s sensitivity. If your needs are pretty light then Dove&#x27;s Go Sleeveless is a fine, unscented, and affordable product. But if you&#x27;re looking for heavy duty and long-lasting protection then look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Deodorant gives me a rash. There, I said it. I get ugly, itchy bumps...definitely not attractive.&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance free deodorant is great. No itching, no rash, great antiperspirant qualities, and no odor.&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? This stuff works perfect.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see too much difference with this from the standard Dove deodorant, besides the fragrance free. Both are the powder type, both are really for all skin types so don&#x27;t irritate me, pretty decent all around. Lasts throughout day but needs reapplied if you&#x27;re doing any heavy sweating or getting hot, which seems an obvious thing but there are deodorants that can last through that. Still, I recommend this one and Dove is what I use most for cost efficiency.</li>
    <li> Dove fragrance free is one of the lowest fragrant deodorants that I have used, and, for that reason, I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is wintertime &amp; I work in an office, so I do not really exert myself much during the day.  Additionally, the weather is not conducive to sweating right now.  Dove did hold when I shoveled snow &amp; really warmed up, but I didn&#x27;t break a brow sweat, so again, I&#x27;m not sure this was a real test of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove deodorant does not leave the tell-tale white spots on my clothing.  It glides on easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms even the day after a laser hair removal treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test will come this summer when we have a high humidity day &amp; start sweating spontaneously just by stepping outside.  I will update this review when we get a few of those types of days.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand the \\&quot;go sleeveless\\&quot; claim to this antiperspirant/deodorant.  Wasn&#x27;t I supposed to go sleeveless before?  Are my armpits that offensive, or do they know I have old-lady arms and really shouldn&#x27;t be going sleeveless anyway?  I guess it is supposed to make your skin smoother, and it does glide on nicely, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the smoothness of my underarms after five days, and even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that claim is meant for people who have reactions or allergies to most deodorants and get little bumps or flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that this product has less active ingredient than the others I have on hand, both regular strength and clinical strength.  And that does make a difference.  This one doesn&#x27;t keep me as fresh as the others, doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long with normal activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also left white marks on the inside of my black t-shirt.  I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as what it smells like, as opposed to what I smell like when using it, I thought it was just great. There is a slight scent from the product itself, but no perfumey smell and nothing objectionable to my nose.  One of the clinical strength products I have, while it works well, is so heavily fragrance that I don&#x27;t like using it, so this fragrance free one is better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, three stars meaning \\&quot;it&#x27;s okay.\\&quot;  But I think I&#x27;ll not get this one again, especially since those sizzling Arizona summers are right around the corner.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is labeled fragrance-free and it is truly, completely fragrance-free. That is not always the case with \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; products. Many times I notice subtle lingering fragrances, but with this product there is absolutely no smell to it at all. This antiperspirant/deodorant worked well for me and left no residue on my clothing. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Usually, I use Suave and Dove Clinical deodorants, but, I would like to find those in unscented formulas, so I tried this one. It doesn&#x27;t irritate underarms, it is gentle enough for sensitive skin. Though, the strength of the antiperspirant protection wasn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;m used to. I have a funtioning tumor on my adernal gland and it can cause perspiration so, this one wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me. Though, if you are looking for a sensitive formula with no scent I&#x27;d highly recommend it if you didn&#x27;t need the strength of a Clinical formula.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin.  This deodorant doesn&#x27;t seem to cause irritation like others we have tried.  Recommend for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use and worked well all day - even better than some of the clinical strength products I&#x27;ve used.  The stick is tall and there is a lot of it.  Making it a great economical choice.  I especially appreciate that it is fragrance free - I don&#x27;t want to smell like chemicals masquerading as scents.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is nice but not really much different than other Dove deodorants.  It has just a slight fragrance that could pass for &#x60;fragrance free&#x27;.  I have tried it for a while and though I felt a little tingle, I didn&#x27;t get an irritation which is a good thing for me since I have sensitive skin.  I did notice that it took a bit longer to sort of dry and I still had a light white film that ended up in my dark shirt (the one day) so I decided that it was best for light color clothing.  Not bad but maybe not what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. It&#x27;s a nice low scent deodorant, seems to last throughout the day. No complaints or reactions to it. It is something she would consider using again.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Quick shipment. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal dove deodarant fan for many years. I was skeptical of the fragrance free version however was pleasantly surprised at how well it still worked without the heavy perfume smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using the deodorant for a while now, and have to say that it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the scented dove deodorant. I have noticed that by the end of the day a slight sweaty odor that I don&#x27;t have when I use the scented ones.  I liked the idea of a fragrance free version but in the end I think I need something a little stronger.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t detect a scent in this, and I have a very strong sense of smell.  There is a \\&quot;smell\\&quot; to it, but it is more like the smell of the ingredients used to make this.  Once I put it on, I smell nothing.  I like that, because I don&#x27;t always like smelling like deodorant.  I did notice that it doesn&#x27;t protect as well as other deodorants I have used.  I need to apply this daily in order for it to stop odor.  With most deodorants, I can apply them once every couple days, and not have odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin under my arms, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the claims made in that area.  I ordered this because I love Dove, and usually I use the [[ASIN:B001ECQ5FC Dove Ultimate go fresh Cool Essentials Anti-perspirant/Deodorant, 2.6 Ounce (Pack of 4)]], which protects well.  This is just about as good as the Dove Go Fresh, but it protects a little less. They are both solid, stick deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say, however, if you are looking for a fragrance free deodorant for sensitive skin, you should give this a try.  I have a lot of respect for Dove as a company, because they make good products and they support healthy body image by using women who are \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sized in their advertisements.  I have loved every product I have tried, that was made by Dove.</li>
    <li> How can a fragrance-free antiperspirant, with the same active ingredient as all the others, differentiate itself?  In typical Dove form, it is all about avoiding ingredients that can cause skin irritation and adding gentle moisturizers.  I periodically get a rash from harsh deodorants, so Go Sleeveless feels like a soothing balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm with this product is that, like other sticks, it can leave some white marks on clothing.  I will update this review if I get any more serious stains that won&#x27;t wash out.</li>
    <li> I used this before I went to the gym. I have to say that it did not work that well. First it does not smell that great. After two hours at the gym I can see the pit stains as well as my underarms sweating. This did absolutly nothing for me at the gym. After I took off my sweats  I still seen some residue on my clothing from this. I give it two stars because you can wear it for a few hours not working out.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a mild, non-irritating antiperspirant/deodorant, this is definitely worth a try.  It does have a very mild smell, but I can&#x27;t say whether that&#x27;s a \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; or just the smell of the product.  It&#x27;s not as strong as clinical products, but if you&#x27;re concerned about irritation, the milder product might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did fine in tests in our household - it did leave minor marks on clothing, and wasn&#x27;t the most powerful tool in the drawer, but overall was fine.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that I rarely \\&quot;go sleeveless\\&quot; I was hoping for a simple deodorant stick that would sooth my armpits, which I&#x27;m embarrassed to say tend to get dry and irritated.  On that front, this is a great product that works as promised.  My pits feel soothed and moisturized, and it&#x27;s a quality that lasts.  Indeed, after a week my skin under there felt dramatically improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My four stars, though?  This isn&#x27;t as clean as a deodorant as I would like.  Perhaps its just an unfortunate side effect from the wonderful moisturizing properties, but this does tend to leave a mess.  Is that why it&#x27;s recommended for \\&quot;go sleeveless\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, as far as good and basic moisturizing stick goes, I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like perfumes in skin products. This doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes. It keeps me fresh and dry even through a workout. I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with this product</li>
    <li> I have allergies to fragrance in deodorants, so this one is exactly what I need.  Not for extreme activity, though</li>
    <li> I found out I am allergic to fragrance in products, so went on the hunt for a fragrance free deodorant. I really like this one.</li>
    <li> Falsely advertised! This variety of Dove antipersperant is NOT &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; as advertised. If it is no longer available, that information should be available to the public.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve all seen the commercials where several woman are given tank tops and t-shirts and told to try Dove Go Sleeveless for 5 days; then they come back wearing the tank tops and showing off their underarms.  While I appreciate Dove&#x27;s marketing campaign choice, for me it&#x27;s not about smoother underarms, it&#x27;s about wetness and odor protection and Dove provides me both.  Of course I wanted to see what the hype was about and used [[ASIN:B001ECQ5FW Dove Go Sleeveless]] for a full week and truthfully I didn&#x27;t feel any difference.  It definitely didn&#x27;t make me want to put on a tank top and run around with my arms up, but that&#x27;s okay. Overall Dove provides a reliable antiperspirant/deodorant and in a fragrance free formula.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the \\&quot;Go Sleeveless\\&quot; claim, I was thinking(for some reason) it meant it wouldn&#x27;t rub off on clothes. It does! Put your dark clothes on with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a great deodorant. I didn&#x27;t notice it having a fragrance. It went on very smoothly and it kept me dry. I like it!</li>
    <li> This Dove deodorant works pretty well. It actually does make your armpits feel softer an smoother. Sort of like soft baby skin. There&#x27;s no irritation when used right after shaving and it seems to soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It protects well against odor and wetness. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like an unscented product. I didn&#x27;t know if it might not work as good against odor, but it turned ok. I didn&#x27;t have any body odor, but there was a little bit of wetness. Not enough to be really bothersome, but just enough to know it was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good deodorant for someone who doesn&#x27;t sweat heavily and who is looking for unscented products. The only scent to it is sort of a waxy/crayon smell. It isn&#x27;t strong at all though and you can only smell it if you actually put your nose almost right on the product in the tube. It doesn&#x27;t smell while you&#x27;re wearing it at all - you can&#x27;t smell it on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good, but I personally would probably not trust it for myself during the summer months or when I am being really active and sweating a lot, unless I&#x27;d reapply often.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  Works well and does not have any smell.  Finally no chemical smell and no perfume.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I usually love Dove products and I have been using their soap and hair products for years. However, I recently tried this deodorant (because it was a decent price and I trust the brand) and it is horrible. I don&#x27;t really sweat a whole lot under my arms and I have never had an issue with underarm odor. That being said, when I used this deodorant it did not keep my armpits dry AT ALL and midway through the day I started to smell. I have never had this issue with any of the other deodorants I&#x27;ve used so I can only conclude that this deodorant does not work.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that the sample would be a 4 pack, as the actual product, but it was only a 1 pack. The product itself I found satisfactory. I have sensitive skin and this did not cause any irritation. It was free from fragrances as promised, which was good. On the minus side though, it does rub off on fabric, so be careful with it. As far as deodorants go though, this one&#x27;s pretty much what you would expect and a well-known brand. Unless you prefer fragrant or gel-type deodorant (which don&#x27;t leave any marks on the clothing), this one does the trick.</li>
    <li> My husband thought I was a bit off when he saw me feeling my right underarm, trying to figure out if it was any more moisturized than my left underarm. I used Dove Go Sleeveless on my right side, and a Suave product on my left. As much as I rub my underarms, I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between the two sides. As advertised, this deodorant is completely unscented. While it may not have any extra moisturizing power, it works well otherwise.</li>
    <li> This works good considering it&#x27;s still winter.  I&#x27;m hoping that it will continue to work as good come warmer weather as I usually use the Clinical Strength.  Nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering and it doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on your clothing like some others.  It smells fresh and makes you feel fresh without feeling greasy.  More time will tell just how much I will really like this one.</li>
    <li> Going sleeveless is not something I&#x27;m likely to do unless I&#x27;m going swimming, in which case antiperspirant generally isn&#x27;t an issue. However, I like to avoid stains and odors from gunky antiperspirants on my shirts. This particular antiperspirant works perfectly in that respect, leaving no indication that it has been applied, except perhaps for the absence of perspiration. Dove&#x27;s product works nicely, with no smell, no appearance, and ultimately achieves its goal. The only difficulty is that the stick is just a little scratchy - like a cat&#x27;s tongue or some fine sandpaper - which left me wondering if I was feeling the stick or the plastic edges the first time I applied the product. And because there&#x27;s no evidence of application, I&#x27;m never quite sure whether I&#x27;ve put on too little or too much. But within a day or two, you figure that part out. The overall size is nice for travel purposes, goes through security without difficulty, and appears to last a long time by not wearing down too quickly.</li>
    <li> Most deodorants cause a skin rash for me. It was great to find another one that doesn&#x27;t. Like the others that I use, over time an underarm stain develops. It does not seem to matter what the dispenser says. So I have found that using Shout Carpet Stain Remover will get rid of all or most of it in the laundry. Who would have guessed?</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant. It&#x27;s nothing magical--there&#x27;s still a bit of white residue, and it doesn&#x27;t stop me from sweating--but it does what I expect from a basic deodorant. It&#x27;s remarkably scent-free (though I think I may personally prefer the scented version of this same deodorant), and it does eliminate body odour. The residue is pretty minimal. Basically, although I can hypothetically imagine a better deodorant, I&#x27;m happy enough with this one that I don&#x27;t really feel any need to seek out something better. This isn&#x27;t perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a sticker on this deodorant that says \\&quot;Go Sleeveless in 5 Days.\\&quot;  Dove ought to rethink that pitch, because I want to go sleeveless right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, I&#x27;m not sure what is taking 5 days.  It has moisturizers to make the underarms smoother.  If there was anything I had to moisturize, it&#x27;s not my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower every day, so I can&#x27;t test the 48 hour protection claim.  I&#x27;m not sure I want to.  I hate to admit it, but I do smell a little after a long day of strenuous activity, even with that 48 hour protection.  I&#x27;d say it works as well as most deodorants do.  48 hours is a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most is this deodorant stick is truly fragrance free.  Not only do they not add perfumes, the deodorant itself has no scent.  I can&#x27;t smell it at all.  I love it because my clothes don&#x27;t have that strong deodorant scent.  That really ought to be the selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/30/13: I put Dove deodorant away for awhile and just started using it again. My husband finally broke down and told me I&#x27;ve been smelly for the past two weeks and that it&#x27;s never been a problem before. Hmmm. I&#x27;d better switch deodorants.</li>
    <li> I like that this is fragrance-free.  I was using another product and I kept feeling like I had air freshner under my arm it was so strong!  This is great.  It works without having any scent!  It isn&#x27;t completely clear, but doesn&#x27;t really leave any residue after it dries.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I love this producr and only wish we had tried it years ago. Is kind to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I can not use any soap or deodorant with perfume or fragrance in them.  It was not clear that I would be able to use the DOVE go sleeveless deodorant.  I have tried the deodorant and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Dove Go Sleeveless Antiperspirant/Deodorant Fragrance Free.  This is awesome, keeps you dry and fresh; it really does its job.  It is fragrance free, which is sometimes hard to find.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I do love scents --- but it is also nice to sometimes find those products that have no scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is an awesome brand of deodorant, as well as other products as well.  I am a long-time, big Dove user.  I use Dove soap, shampoo, and everything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most deodorants (maybe fragrance?), but these Dove deodorants have been great for me.  No itching/burning/rash, is clear, no fragrance, etc.  Been using them for years... just wish they came in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I found this version of Dove quite disappointing. I don&#x27;t perspire much but this product did not keep my underarms dry. To me, that is the first thing an anti-perspirant, deodorant should do, not make my armpits lovely, but keep them dry. I far prefer [[ASIN:B001ECQ4SK Dove Invisible Solids, Sensitive Skin,]] which is unscented, does not stain my clothes or skin and keeps me dry.</li>
    <li> Looked all over for this item.  It is truly fragrance free - fast shipping -perfect item -thank you</li>
    <li> Destroyed several shirts so I stopped using it!</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant - smooth, don&#x27;t notice any fragrance once it&#x27;s on, and seems to work!</li>
    <li> Dove Go Sleeveless Fragrance Free Antiperspirant/Deodorant is non-irritating and has a clean, mild scent. It is a stick rather than a roll-on. It seems to provide only moderate antiperspirant effect though it works fine as a mild deodorant.</li>
