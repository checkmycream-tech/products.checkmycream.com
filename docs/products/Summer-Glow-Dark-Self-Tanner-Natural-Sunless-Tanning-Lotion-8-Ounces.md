      <li>I finally found the best!</li>
      <li>I am completely IN LOVE with this self tanner.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>I wanted it to be more thorough.</li>
      <li>The lotion itself has a lovely honeysuckle aroma and the technology used in the lotion</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many self tanners throughout the years.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>Love the color from this product.  </li>
      <li>have:&lt;br /&gt;-A guide color to help you to make sure you are applying an even application</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always satisfied with this product as well as the service.</li>
      <li>The darker is better suited for helping to even out</li>
      <li>That being said, three shades darker than porcelain is MUCH better than carrotdarkdark brown.</li>
      <li>I am a red head with very fair skin.....</li>
      <li>definitely aMAzing smell, like fresh laundry detergent.</li>
      <li>The tinted guide color makes it easy to see where you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
      <li>this stuff is EASY to put on.  </li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of cheap and very expensive self tanners and I love this one the best because I am very fair skinned and this doe NOT make me look orange at all.</li>
      <li>I had really high hopes about this product considering all the good reviews.</li>
      <li>Beautisol&#x27;s tanner is hands down the best one out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair complected, but I don&#x27;t see how I can have absolutely no change in color whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a brownish liquid which is supposed to help with smooth application.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t even imagine how light the medium is.</li>
      <li>For the price I knew I would have to really love it to make the purchase again, and it is worth</li>
      <li>Now that i don&#x27;t lotion, it goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t have a super strong scent and it was semi-easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Wash hands right away after use!</li>
      <li>I receive compliments all the time on what a nice tan I have because it really looks real!</li>
      <li>Finally......a true tan looking tan&lt;</li>
      <li>Provides a nice natural color.  </li>
      <li>I found this one so stinky that I didn&#x27;t wait for the full developing time to see what color I&#x27;d get.</li>
      <li>The only good thing is the odor blocker which is helpful though not 100%.</li>
      <li>I read on the website that the tan lasts about 5-7 days which is true, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is how it starts patching when it fades.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lucky it even got a one star.</li>
      <li>also gets big props for the instruction videos Sinead (one of the products creators) put on You Tube to help show tips on proper application to get the best</li>
      <li>It tanned be super quick</li>
      <li>I think worth the price</li>
      <li>The medium helps to achieve a natural healthy looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Overall the color is the most important thing to me</li>
      <li>While you do have to be careful as you apply, the instruction videos on Beautisol&#x27;s website are fantastic and my tans have been very nice, even and natural.</li>
      <li>Using LAVA bar soap afterwards takes it right off your hands though.</li>
      <li>I always thought it was too disappointingly light but never realized how much until I bought a $6 self tanner yesterday at a drug store and was blown away at how much darker the color came out!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a natural, healthy looking tan without risking sun damage.</li>
      <li>Love the instant color</li>
      <li>After trying many products this is the only one that doesnt burn her skin.</li>
      <li>Sticking to fake bake flawless.</li>
      <li>The first time i put this on, i had lotioned my skin...</li>
      <li>Ive used self tanners since the 80s when AVON first came out with it.</li>
      <li>This happy ending didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>She just recommend a real good exfoliation first and using a VERY small amount to start.&lt;br /&gt;Overall both Beautisol self-tan body products get 5 stars for overcoming most of the issues that come with usual self tanners.</li>
      <li>Getting a nice basic natural looking tan overnight.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color develops quickly and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>The developing smell is a bit strong, perfumey, but it&#x27;s alot better than the DHA smell that I usually have</li>
      <li>So I had to use my bare hands since the gloves didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>This is the FIRST self tanner that I found that gives you a REAL looking tan</li>
      <li>after 2 days tanning outside in 80s heat with ok tan,  this gives better DARK ocean tan effect.</li>
      <li>Like really, I can&#x27;t even wear clothes or</li>
      <li>People look at me and say I really need to go tan</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product!  The lotion does not have the  typical nasty smell that comes with self tanners, rather it has a pleasant odor.  Provides a nice natural color.  While you do have to be careful as you apply, the instruction videos on Beautisol&#x27;s website are fantastic and my tans have been very nice, even and natural. I&#x27;m getting compliments on my summer glow all the time!  If you&#x27;re looking for a new self-tanning experience, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was a little cautious about this since it looks green going on but I love it. It has the most beautiful color. And the smell is not that bad</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes about this product considering all the good reviews. Unfortunately I was highly disappointed. The color was very faint. The one thing I did like about it was the fragrance. Very pleasant, like a tropical citrusy smell.</li>
    <li> Love the color from this product.  But still don&#x27;t like the smell even though the claim is that is doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.</li>
    <li> Have used this self tanner the last 3 years. It works great. I tried a different one last year just once, but came right back to Beautisol. People look at me and say I really need to go tan and I proudly tell them it&#x27;s fake!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make me that tan at all. Sticking to fake bake flawless.</li>
    <li> This is the FIRST self tanner that I found that gives you a REAL looking tan and it lassssst a lonnnnng time, i&#x27;m truly impressed with this product.  Even though it says DARK don&#x27;t be scarred to try it because it only will become DARK if you keep applying it , one application will be find for someone with light skin and it will still look natural. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  A little pricey put I think worth the price, look around for a bargain, that&#x27;s what I do !  EnJoY !!!</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to a selftanner that didn&#x27;t have a funky odor, this one has little but the color is muddy, doesn&#x27;t last and I already have a great tan from Aruba and hoping to maintain it. The best product is Tanning Towels and guess I would rather deal with the odor for a day and get great lasting color. So disappointed this didn&#x27;t work for me expecially after reading the reviews. Sending it back, Maryann</li>
    <li> I am completely IN LOVE with this self tanner. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years, so I have seen and tried every tanner out there. Seriously, this is the ONE. The color comes out perfectly tan and incredibly natural. And they put some sort of special technology in it that gives it a spa-like fresh scent while it&#x27;s on my body (every other tanner out there smells terrible...) Beautisol&#x27;s tanner is hands down the best one out there. I use the dark tanner (Summer Glow), but I think they also have one with a lighter shade. Maybe I&#x27;ll try that one come winter-time. For now though, I can&#x27;t get enough of the dark tanner!!</li>
    <li> It works! This was recommended to me by a friend and I must say it really works. I am very fair and one application did a great job. Did another application the second day and I did have a line of demarcation but I put the lotion on in a hurry and did not moisturize or anything beforehand. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Awesome my wife loves it! Its a great product. After trying many products this is the only one that doesnt burn her skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and having tried them all I can attest to the great tan. I put it on at night wait for it to dry then go to bed. After showering in the morning I have a great streak and smell free tan!</li>
    <li> I have tried an UNBELIEVABLE amount of self tanning products. I finally found the best! I give 5 stars to both the Medium Self-Tanner - AKA \\&quot;All Seasons Glow\\&quot; and their Dark Self-Tanner - AKA \\&quot;Summer Glow\\&quot;. For the price I knew I would have to really love it to make the purchase again, and it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the difference, the \\&quot;All Seasons\\&quot; gives a lighter color upon first application and is recommended to start with if you have a much lighter skin tone or just want to add some \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to your otherwise pale winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use the medium or \\&quot;ALL SEASONS\\&quot; in two instances:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I still want to wear a skirt in the winter or spring and just need to have a little extra color (not the usual glaring white) on my legs but I am not going to bother with other areas of my skin. In this situation it would look a bit silly to have \\&quot;tan\\&quot; legs on the lower half but to be so fair on the upper half. The medium helps to achieve a natural healthy looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;2. In the summer months when I already have some color (either from the real sun or from using the \\&quot;Summer Glow\\&quot; product\\&quot; and I just want to maintain color or slightly build on the color a little more, so I will use it before bed as a lotion that helps the color I have to stay and also adds a bit more to it without getting too much darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dark Self-Tanner, \\&quot;Summer Glow\\&quot; is perfect for:&lt;br /&gt;1. Getting a nice basic natural looking tan overnight.&lt;br /&gt;2. Building on your current tan (fake or real) and getting an even darker richer look. The darker is better suited for helping to even out tan lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the face tanners but my friend has used the Medium \\&quot;All Seasons\\&quot; on her face with good results and no break out issues. She just recommend a real good exfoliation first and using a VERY small amount to start.&lt;br /&gt;Overall both Beautisol self-tan body products get 5 stars for overcoming most of the issues that come with usual self tanners. Both the Medium and Dark (\\&quot;All Seasons Glow\\&quot; and \\&quot;Summer Glow\\&quot;) have:&lt;br /&gt;-A guide color to help you to make sure you are applying an even application (you can probably get away with no gloves for the Medium but I would recommend using disposable gloves with the Dark). Some of the guide color will wash off in the shower the next morning but your skin will still have color, don&#x27;t worry your tan is not going down the drain!&lt;br /&gt;-Natural looking color/results (don&#x27;t worry about the color of the guide color in the lotion, one of them has a slight green tinge but will not look like that when showered off the next day).&lt;br /&gt;-Smell great! The lotion itself has a lovely honeysuckle aroma and the technology used in the lotion helps to drastically minimize the offensive off-putting aroma that lingers so long after the DHA process. (One of the reasons it is more expensive than others.)&lt;br /&gt;-Beautisol uses more natural ingredients that are not as chemical laden as many other brands.&lt;br /&gt;-Beautisol also gets big props for the instruction videos Sinead (one of the products creators) put on You Tube to help show tips on proper application to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results will last approximately 5 days to well over a week depending on how hydrated you keep your skin (lasts longer) and how much you exfoliate and shave your legs (will last not as long).&lt;br /&gt;For a tan lasting up to a month get both products and apply the Dark every week and a half to two weeks and the Medium once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH SELF TANNERS IN THE PAST YOU SHOULD SPLURGE THIS ONCE TO SEE HOW ONE IS REALLY SUPPOSED TO WORK. (But watch the videos on You Tube first if you are not experienced in getting good even results.)</li>
    <li> I will never  use another self tanner again! This product smells amazing and I now have a beautiful glow and am ready for our beach trip!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of self-tanning lotions and this is by far the best! The color develops quickly and looks very natural. The color of the lotion is really dark when you first see it, but it rubs in well and evenly. I will definitely be sticking with this brand for now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many self tanners throughout the years. This one has a very pleasant scent unlike others. The tinted guide color makes it easy to see where you&#x27;re applying it. After showering it leaves a nice, believable tan. However , I wish the color was darker. It does fade away gradually&lt;br /&gt;and doesn&#x27;t leave behind scaly, &#x27;snake&#x27; like look like others I&#x27;ve tried. I really like not having that horrible self tanner odor!</li>
    <li> Didnt work at all.  I followed the directions. The gloves they sent were the cheapo latex gloves you can find anywhere and the lotion didnt spread well at all with them.  I saw a very slight difference in color after the whole 8 hours of wearing this stuff... but only cause I knew exactly where I put my trial patch of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back . Dont waste your money people.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Really easy to apply and looks great!</li>
    <li> The best self tanner!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this stuff over and over again with NO...I repeat NO RESULTS.  I&#x27;ve followed the directions to a T and even watched every video on the website for this stuff.  I&#x27;m very fair complected, but I don&#x27;t see how I can have absolutely no change in color whatsoever.  Very disappointed.  it worked well on my sister in law so I decided to try it, and it&#x27;s a no for me.  Not sure what else I can do to make this stuff show some color on me, but I&#x27;m done trying.</li>
    <li> This self-tanner is a very natural look.  I use it once a week and it works perfect for me.  If you want a darker tan, you will probably have to use a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> after 2 days tanning outside in 80s heat with ok tan,  this gives better DARK ocean tan effect. Ive used self tanners since the 80s when AVON first came out with it. there is absolutely no orange. this is the one!!!!</li>
    <li> This workers wonders on my legs! Takes about 4 hours for color to darken. Wash hands right away after use!</li>
    <li> I am an Irish and Scottish bred, strawberry blonde with a few freckles early twenties college girl who does NOT have time for tanning beds. This was by far the quickest self tanner. A nice rich color, beautiful until you put 2 coats on. One coat isn&#x27;t darkdark, but it&#x27;s a real tan color. Two coats is orange. That being said, three shades darker than porcelain is MUCH better than carrotdarkdark brown. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyyhooo...definitely aMAzing smell, like fresh laundry detergent. My boyfriend asked me if I got my sweatshirt out of the dryer I smelled so good to him. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO streaks, washes off hands/blends into hands easilly with baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG way. Literally dime size went on one whole arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not make fingernails/elbows/etc. orange/outofplace looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product, just wish the color was a teeny bit darker. I mean it&#x27;s dark. It&#x27;s very dark. But maybe I was born with AF-AM blood in me? Who knows...</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My skin looks naturally tan without having to go to a tanning salon or sitting in the sun.</li>
    <li> i am an average size 14 woman who carries her weight evenly.  I use this stuff to tan my legs from the hips down and then my arms neck and face, some shoulders.  this stuff is EASY to put on.  I&#x27;m not sure what the complaint is about being hard to put on, but this is as easy as putting on lotion.  The first time i put this on, i had lotioned my skin... thats a big no-no. bathe in something that moisturizes your skin already.  the lotion made the tanner clump up on me. Now that i don&#x27;t lotion, it goes on smooth.  I have had 5 applications so far.. and most of the time, i do it one night and wake up the next morning and put a second app on.  i will never buy anything but this again because it is very real feeling, looking and it STAYS on longer than expected.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it works well with my skin. The color comes out beautiful. I&#x27;m always satisfied with this product as well as the service. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Gives very nice color.  Makes my skin feel very soft whereas other tanners I have used in the past were drying.  Don&#x27;t care for the color guide too much but once that is washed off the remaining color looks great.  The developing smell is a bit strong, perfumey, but it&#x27;s alot better than the DHA smell that I usually have and I can live with it.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I am a red head with very fair skin..... and I can&#x27;t tan normally so this works so great!  It is super dark but look very natural.  Application Is a long process but it lasts a very long time as long as I use lotion a lot!</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of cheap and very expensive self tanners and I love this one the best because I am very fair skinned and this doe NOT make me look orange at all. I receive compliments all the time on what a nice tan I have because it really looks real!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It actually works. I&#x27;ve very pale all year round due to being IIrish. I&#x27;m not to keen with laying out since I also don&#x27;t age well so I tried this. It works!! The color even stayed after washing it off. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was I didn&#x27;t receive the pad to put on beautisol. I only got the gloves and the bottle. So I had to use my bare hands since the gloves didn&#x27;t fit. I also didn&#x27;t like the instructions. I wanted it to be more thorough. Like do I was after applying every time?  But as far as the product I was very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Love the instant color so you don&#x27;t have to wait.  A little bit pricey, but it works really well.  I would recommend to friends and/or family.</li>
    <li> Should be called \\&quot;light tan\\&quot; instead of dark tan. Can&#x27;t even imagine how light the medium is. I always thought it was too disappointingly light but never realized how much until I bought a $6 self tanner yesterday at a drug store and was blown away at how much darker the color came out! This one also streaks easily due to the very liquidy texture. Using gloves makes it harder and makes streaks worse. Using LAVA bar soap afterwards takes it right off your hands though. The only good thing is the odor blocker which is helpful though not 100%. Can&#x27;t wait for all brands of self tanners to improve the smell. Overall the color is the most important thing to me so this one doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This claims to be the least offensive self-tanner on the market. I have 4 other types which don&#x27;t offend my sense of smell but my husbands hates them. I found this one so stinky that I didn&#x27;t wait for the full developing time to see what color I&#x27;d get. It&#x27;s a brownish liquid which is supposed to help with smooth application. Even after exfoliating and applying extra moisturizer on the drier parts of my legs the color was uneven. So far neutrogena is the best, even though I must wait until my husband is out of the house.</li>
    <li> This product worked great the very first time I used it. It tanned be super quick it didn&#x27;t have a super strong scent and it was semi-easy to apply. This happy ending didn&#x27;t last very long. I read on the website that the tan lasts about 5-7 days which is true, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is how it starts patching when it fades. -_- I have no clue when I&#x27;ll be able to walk around in shorts again without people staring at my legs or without my friends making little jokes about my at home tan that I bragged about so much during the first use.&lt;br /&gt; And to make matters worse, this stuff rubs off when you wear jeans or certain shoes, it&#x27;s a nightmare to maintain. I have lines down my legs from wearing a pear of jeans, and lines that goes all the way around my ankle from a pair of ankle boots?! Like really, I can&#x27;t even wear clothes or the product will come off? I wouldn&#x27;t be so critical of this product if it weren&#x27;t so much money. I will NEVER purchase it again. It&#x27;s lucky it even got a one star.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect self-tanner for fair skin and anyone that is looking for a natural tan without going in the sun! Love it! Being a pale girl, I was afraid that self-tanner would turn me orange. Imagine my surprise when I tried Beautisol and not only did it look natural, it didn&#x27;t smell! It gives me a beautiful, healthy glow. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a natural, healthy looking tan without risking sun damage.</li>
    <li> Finally......a true tan looking tan&lt;br /&gt;no orange&lt;br /&gt;no smell&lt;br /&gt;just a yummy color all over.....&lt;br /&gt;the heat from tanning beds give me a migraine&lt;br /&gt;other products I have used for years give off that awful odor...&lt;br /&gt;This is actually fabulous and I will order it FOREVER!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t turn me orange and the smell is nice, like laundry.</li>
