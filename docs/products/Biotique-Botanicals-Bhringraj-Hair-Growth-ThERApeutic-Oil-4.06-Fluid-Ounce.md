<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had been using Brahmi Amla hair oil for a while now and decided to buy this product based on the great reviews. The ingredient list was very similar to the Brahmi Amla hair oil, with what I presumed was a lighter base, and decided to give it a shot. I followed the instructions and massaged the oil into my hair and left it in for 30 minutes. I like how easy it was to apply, was not as thick as the previous oil, and the smell was pretty good too. After 30 minutes I washed my hair in the shower and to my complete horror watched as clumps of hair fell (tried to count the strands, but gave up after 120). I went through the ingredients to try to determine what it could have been and did some research, but all the listed ingredients are supposed to be great for your hair. The only explanation I can think of is that there are some unlisted additives that may have caused this reaction. The additional ingredient(s) may or may not be natural, but definitely can have the opposite of the intended affect in people who are sensitive. I just wish they had listed all ingredients and perhaps put some disclaimer and/or suggest trying on just a small patch first. Obviously I will no longer be using this product and hopefully with time the lost hair will regrow with no lasting damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: (for people who are not sensitive - though I wouldn&#x27;t suggest trying)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- great ingredients (as far as what is listed)&lt;br /&gt;- washes out easy (with the addition of clumps of hair)&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Hair loss</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this works. I&#x27;m not bald, just have thin hair. I used it for a while and I didn&#x27;t see anything. The shampoo on the other hand is amazing.</li>
    <li> Use it weekly, whenever I shampoo. Improves health of the hair that is thinning with age.</li>
    <li> I do not know what the long term results would be, but it is helping to keep my hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but very oily, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this. I leave it in my hair overnight 2 or 3 times a week. LOVE the smell. I feel it helps prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair oil ever if you have a problem of hairfall.Don&#x27;t apply it for more than an hour though ! It&#x27;s quite heavy.Also,I use it mainly for the scalp.</li>
    <li> very good use it everyday</li>
    <li> One of the oils in this product is Amla, which is known to regrow hair. At first I was skeptical over trying something else, when in the past nothing has ever worked. I ordered this product &amp; Brahmi Amla oil from Bazaar of India (ordered from Amazon) which also has natural oils that help regrow hair. Both of these products are all natural, do not contain mineral oil, or anything chemicals. At night I massage them both into my scalp, sleep with the oils &amp; wash out in the morning with DermOrganic cleanser &amp; masque (also ordered from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark, natural curly, past the middle of my back, not chemical treated, medium thickness except the top of my head is thinning.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something to help stop the hair loss &amp; regrow what has already fallen out. DermOrganic cleanser &amp; masque are natural, non sulfate or harsh chemical cleaners that do not strip hair of natural oils. Upon some reading it was mentioned that not stripping the hair will allow the scalp to heal &amp; hair to grow.&lt;br /&gt;Every night I apply a few drops of this oil to my scalp &amp; a generous amount of the Brahmi Amla oil to my scalp &amp; run that through my hair. The first couple of days I noticed a new shine to my hair, &amp; the ability to air dry without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;After the first week I am now for the first time since my childhood able to air dry my hair &amp; all my natural curls are tight &amp; shiny. Not since childhood have I been able to get my hair to curl naturally. The longer I use this product the healthier my hair is getting.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, shiny, full of body &amp; not oily or weighed down. The color has darkened some instead of lightening in the summer sun.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been long enough for me to notice fresh new hairs growing into the thinning parts, but I can say that my hair has grown a half inch faster than without this product. I am really happy with the outcome in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Up till 2 months ago I used gels, the blow dryer, flat iron &amp; hair dye. Now I have stopped everything &amp; replaced it with DermOrganic cleanser &amp; masque, these to oils &amp; that&#x27;s all I need to have beautiful hair that looks like it did during my childhood. I am so happy to have my hair back. I thought for sure it would never be the same again.stopped everything &amp; replaced it with DermOrganic cleanser &amp; masque, these to oils &amp; that&#x27;s all I need to have beautiful hair that looks like it did during my childhood.

    <li> I was pretty hard on my hair this summer resulting in a couple of trims. I can&#x27;t say this product didn&#x27;t work, but I can&#x27;t say it did either. The oil penetrated my hair. The fragrance is pleasant. However, for the price, I personally would have preferred noticeable remarkable hair growth results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good ol olive oil from the kitchen works just as good, if not better as a wash out hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> I use it on both my daughter and I. Her hair is finally growing and has a pretty red tint! It&#x27;s very good!</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels better since using this therapeutic oil...and it has a most&lt;br /&gt;pleasant fragrance. I was concerned the smell would be as strong as some of the&lt;br /&gt;other bringaraj oils and it is not.</li>
    <li> Great product with immediate noticable results. I am a fan!</li>
    <li> Had to wait forever to get this product but I am loving it so far.. It&#x27;s very light and seeps in your scalp very easily. Also it smells very good which is a big+ when it comes to choosing hair oil. I have only been using it for a week so will leave another review once I have used it for at least 4-6 weeks and see if it really helps with hair fall and regrowth.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair much more manageable . initially i bought this because i had a large amount of my hair ripped out i read that it would take 3 months to even see stubble I&#x27;ve been useing this about 3 weeks and my hair had grown around an inch even on the bald spots!! I love it and plan on ordering another bottle when this one is gone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 4c natural girl. Here&#x27;s my experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this oil I had braids for 4 weeks and used shea moisture mist and castor oil: saw about 1&amp;#34; in growth. Got braids again upon using purchasing this product, did four weeks using the shea moisture mist and alternating between castor oil and the bhringraj therapeutic oil and saw ½&amp;#34; in growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can guess, I&#x27;m back to the castor oil alone and don&#x27;t plan on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This oil very nice for hair.  I believe it&#x27;s really helping my hair get thicker - definitely shinier.</li>
    <li> actually this is my second order,I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s smell and oil&#x27;s condition while applying to the hair. It greatly helps reduce of hair fall. Have used many oil products and changed so many shampoos at last I found this through my friends suggestion,awesome in provoking the fine hair into thicker and helps in lustrous hair......that is why I&#x27;m rating this as 5. Uploaded a picture of my hair before founding of this product and now it reduced to 2% of that falling.....I browsed down about this bhirngaraj and it is said that it is the king of oils in Ayurvedic for controlling of hair fall and helps in start of growing hair from bald head also....Bhringaraj is a root which strengthens the hair from its roots. I&#x27;m greatly impressed with the product.....</li>
    <li> this oil is ok not bad smell very fresh i just use three tikmes i dont know the result yet</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference in the hair growth. It does smell nice as others say. Nothing wonderful</li>
    <li> Very hard to wash off hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just began using this product about 3weeks ago and I must say that it is working.However I use it in conjunction with Biotin supplement and Nioxin system so I can&#x27;t give it all the credit but it definitely boosted the process.</li>
    <li> really enjoy the smell, good ingredients, much more affordable then some of the alternatives</li>
    <li> This product arrived much sooner than anticipated.  I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a little hair growth, so I will continue to use.  Also, I notice that it easily removes knots from my 4c natural hair, so I&#x27;ll continue to purchase for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> This oil really smells and works great. I have to be careful of the amount I use, however, it makes my hair really soft. I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth. More to follow.</li>
    <li> SORRY DIDN&#x27;T SEE A DIFFERENCE IN HAIR GROWTH, BUT I LOVE THE SMELL AND MY HAIR LOOKS A  LITTLE SHINIER, BUT I HAVE NATURAL DARK BROWN HAIR AND IT SEEMED TO HAVE LIGHTENS IT A LITTLE BIT, NOT A BAD THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT A BAD PRODUCT I JUST WONT BE REORDERING.</li>
    <li> not sure on this one I&#x27;m still on the fence...</li>
    <li> Oh...my goodness. This oil is magical. It really does work to re grow hair in those awful thin spots. You have to rub it in a circular motion. Leave it in for an hour or so and then rinse it out with plain water. Continue this for a few days  week and a  in about a month you will see results. Yours is not a hopeless case. This will help along with diet and exercise. Cheer up and get a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing some hair shedding and thinning around my edges.  So I have been on the search for a good oil that could encourage growth and stop the shedding.  I ordered this and used it for the first time last night and wow! I see a difference with just the very first use. The scent is not strong, but like a soft baby powder type smell to me.  I was not bothered by it at all, and it washed right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the oil on my dry hair as a pre-poo and left on for 30 minutes. Then I washed and conditioned my hair as normal.  My results were impressive.  My hair came out very soft with nice body, and so far, no hair fall/shedding.  I will continue to use and hope it will continue to improve my hair and help my edges to grow in thicker.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like to try different hair oils and was quite pleased with this product.  The oil smells exotic and is very light.  They say to massage scalp with this oil before washing hair.  I usually massage at night and find that this oil really absorbs into the scalp really well. The smell of the oil is luscious.</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping.  My hair is a bit thicker &amp; some old fallen hairs have returned.</li>
    <li> I have an endocrine disorder and thought this would help with my hair. You are supposed to apply it to the scalp and let it set for a half hour before the shower. My issues is that it takes DAYS to wash out fully and leaves my hair lank and oily. I rarely use this.</li>
    <li> sadly no I have not seen any positive results from using the product</li>
    <li> Use to regrow hair and it does work. Has a pleasant fragrance, however, it will take at least two bottles for great results. Could see results in about six weeks. It is therapeutic to the hair and it does revive it and it is natural. I will purchase this product again and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> item exactly as advertised. It has worked to regrow hair.</li>
    <li> Product delivers.......easy to use, more beneficial than many products on the market.  Adds moisture and strength, breakage decreased.  Great product</li>
    <li> Makes my hair more wavy and shiny.I do not know how people figure these things out! I really like it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It is so light. I mix it with coconut oil, almond oil, and frankincense essential oil and it does wonders for my skin and hair. This particular brand of Bhringraj Oil does not have an unpleasant odor at all. I have purchased another brand that has a very strong, unpleasant odor that caused me not to use it regularly. But this one I use daily. It is one of the best hot oil treatments for hair, and also good for the skin. They also sell the powder form which is great for the internal body; especially if you suffer from any type of liver malfunction. I have written another review in which I listed at least 10 health benefits of this oil, as well as the powder.</li>
    <li> love this oil and the smell my hair has a fresh washed fragrance without having to wash it.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4a/b hair.  i always do a pre-poo on my hair, and this product is by far the best oil to use as my pre-poo.  i use this when i need a coconut oil with added umph.  this oil hasn&#x27;t ever let me down.  this oil makes my hair even more stronger than coconut oil.  no breakage at all.  this oil is part of my permanent stash</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but it broke me out in contact dermatitis and I had a horrible rash.  Some cosmetics break me out that way, and some don&#x27;t.  I am unable to use the product as a result.  It may work for others, but I&#x27;ll never know how it would have worked for me.  It wasn&#x27;t very expensive, just about $10 with shipping, so I didn&#x27;t request a refund from the seller.</li>
    <li> Great service from seller. I really like it. 👍👍👏👏</li>
    <li> Smells really good, like fruit pebbles or fruit loops! I love the smell! And i really did notice improvement of my hair getting longer even though ive been using this almost three weeks</li>
    <li> it helps to relieve the itchy in my scalp, and stop a little bit the hair falling</li>
    <li> This is not a good oil wastage of money. I not get any benefits from this oil. But it not create any problems. I buy this becoz of too much good reviews but it not work. Poor product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for healthy hair.  Keep in mind you don&#x27;t just apply this to hair - make sure you massage it into the scalp with your fingers.  It only takes 2-3 minutes and a small amount - and there are a bunch of videos online showing how to do it, but its important.  Think of your hair as trees, and the scalp as the soil - and this oil (and other indian hair oils) is the fertilizer.  You have to make sure you get the nutrition to the roots of the trees, i.e. roots of the hair, to get the true benefit of healthier and fuller hair.  Brhingraj oil is also considered an ayurvedic oil that, when massaged into the scalp, helps keep you calmer.  Sometimes my scalp tingles for a while afterwards, or its a little bit itchy - but i see those as good signs that the hair oil is doing its job of stimulating the hair follicles with increased blood supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually leave this in for at least half an hour before a shower, but usually I try to leave it in for a good 4-6 hours while i run errands.  So far i am using it about twice a week. It&#x27;s only been two weeks, but i have already noticed I don&#x27;t lose much hair in the shower anymore.  Also my hair has a lot more shine and volume after the shower  when it dries.  I have not noticed hair growth yet but its only been two weeks, and its just harder to tell with my super curly hair anyway. The smell is pleasant but a little strong - i am getting used to it, but i would have preferred a milder scent.  I tend to be very sensitive to perfumes and most give me headaches, but this product did not.  Overall I am pleased with the purchase and will continue to use it - already ordered a 2-pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks and I Love it!! It is starting to grow my hair after I have not had any growth in the last 6-8 months. This oil really works and I would recommend it to anyone who is suffering from significant hair loss or alopecia.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this oil probaly won&#x27;t reorder</li>
    <li> Noticed no change after using.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my scalp or hair</li>
    <li> Received it few weeks ago and came in leaked. I returned it and waiting for my refund for over three weeks now and nothing. I will wait one more week or I will file a complaint.</li>
    <li> Helps with hair that falls out excessively (mine did, but now doesn&#x27;t). Conditions and smells nice. I leave on all day or over night.</li>
    <li> It has met my every expectation. My hair loves it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it.My scalp is so itchy after using this oil.</li>
    <li> OK I guess once I read reviews I see it won&#x27;t do what I thought it would help with hair loss....</li>
    <li> I just love this oil. I only used it once and I cannot keep my hand out of my hair. Soooo silky soft and smooth and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a couple times and not for sure if it was beneficial in helping with my hair loss...will continue to use it and perhaps&lt;br /&gt;it will yield a better assessment...I have heard great reviews that this oil really works and that many have been helped with its healing properties.....this is why&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the product....if I have better results than I will rewrite another&lt;br /&gt;review....</li>
    <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m loving this oil, scalp feels good and hope to see a lot of growth with continued use...</li>
    <li> i love this product! It promotes hair growth, smells great, and produces results. I had some hairless due to a micro-mamaging manager causing me stress on a daily basis. I quit working for that employer, and began the task of regrowing my hair.  Thhe bald spot now has hair growth.</li>
    <li> I first read about bhringaraj oil on a site called ecliptaalba.com. I had been looking for a natural remedy for thinning hair. An Indian friend recommended Bhringaraj oil so I did a lot of research online. My trichologist had given me Rogaine but it dried out my hair so I hated it. I looked for a good natural oil online with bhringraj in it and found this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and my edges have grown back in. The top of my head where most of the thinning was taking place is also now thicker and my hair feels so much stronger and thicker for the first time in 12 years. I love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like thicker, healthier hair</li>
    <li> Great product.  My 4a/4b hair loves it</li>
    <li> So far so good. I really love this hair oil. It has improved the strength of my hair. I recommend everyone to try it.</li>
    <li> This I use with the skin roller for my hair and I use aloe Vera for my skin. Use it genitally on the scalp or face.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. My hair is really soft. I use it before washing my hair and the results are incredible.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves my hair silky soft.  So you are aware this is not a leave in oil. Its very greasy and has a strong scent. I personally love the smell but it is very strong.  I use this once a week. I put the oil onto my scalp first and massage it all the way down to the ends. Once I have saturated all of my hair,  I roll my hair into a bun and go to sleep.  It says that you only need to leave it in for 30 mins but my hair is so thick that I feel I need more time.  I wake up and wash and condition as usual and my hair feels like silk.  I  dont put any heat or product in my hair for at least 24-48 hours after the treatment to let my hair breathe.  It feels awesome.  You dont need to do much you just let it air dry and go. If you find your hair is still frizzy after you air dry use some leave in Argan oil that stuff is magic.</li>
    <li> my thinning hair continues to fall out and thin Product has not helped to promote growth, product has a nice scent and it not heavy or excessively greasy</li>
    <li> The smell was unusual and wasn&#x27;t very pleasant to my senses, but the oil is very rich and great for pre-washing Afro textured hair.</li>
    <li> I notice that my hair was falling out in areas where I have been using this product didn&#x27;t do what it claim also, don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m not doing something right but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I got this for genetic hair thinning.  I&#x27;m female and used this product for a period of 3 months, either using it daily or every 3 days.  I&#x27;d let it stay in my hair for about 30 minutes before washing it out.  The smell is not too bad.  I wouldn&#x27;t cover my entire scalp, just the parts where I&#x27;m thinning the most and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  I guess I was hoping for a miracle.</li>
    <li> Good product, my hair is better.</li>
    <li> This oil has a pungent fragrance that reminds me of cheap mens cologne.  It&#x27;s obnoxiously strong.  I put the oil on my hair along with a  shower cap, yet the fragrance was so strong it gave me a nasty headache.  When I showered, it took 3 washings with a clarifying shampoo to remove the oil.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> As my title says it this product works by preventing hair falling and making it smooth  It smells amazing as we&#x27;ll. be warned that it&#x27;s oily and should be applied 30 min before shower. Love it</li>
    <li> While trying to get rid of a sinus infection, over the years, I have tried so many antibiotics.  Each time, I loose more hair.  I think my scalp is in chronic hair drop and does not know how to stop.  Hair is growing, but coming out quicker.  To counter the extreme drying of antibiotics, I needed a good scalp product.  One without chemicals that would feed my scalp properly.  This one is great.  However, please do follow the instructions.  30 minutes is the correct time to keep this solution on.  A little goes a long way so use it sparingly.  The first time, I left it on 45 minutes and my scalp itched for one full day afterward.  Since, I put it on before I shampoo and leave it 20 to 30 minutes, rinse well, and then shampoo with a gentle product once only.  Have used this about two weeks and hair loss has been cut in half.  I do have a long way to go to nourish my scalp, but I feel this product is heading me in the right direction.  Many thanks to Amazon for presenting this product and to the manufacturer for his excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered the hair growth oil from biotique and got the shampoo. I didn&#x27;t have the time to return it back , so started using it. The shampoo is good too.Makes my hair feel good. But in due time I will find out if does have any effect on regrowth. BUt overall biotique products are usually great.</li>
    <li> its a nice oil no results as of yet but the feel of it in my hair isnt bad the smell is tolerable</li>
    <li> Iv been useing this product for two weeks now. It sets well on my hair and it&#x27;s gaining it&#x27;s helthyness back sence I colored my hair a lot. Iv noticed hair growth but it could be from the new shampoo and conditioner I have for hair growth. I love it cuz it&#x27;s easy and light but bad thing is I got it and it was leaking everywhere so I lost some but not a lot so I kept it</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It makes my hair so soft... and the grey has disappeared.</li>
    <li> Nice product for weak and hair that is falling. The oil is easy to wash out of my fine hair and leaves my hair feeling more moisturized.</li>
    <li> It adds so much shine to my hair. I love it. The smell is really nice too! Great product! In general, Indian hair oils really agree with my hair and help tame it and making look very healthy. I am African American with hair that gets frizzy and needs to be permed every few months. I find Indian hair oils great for helping to make Black hair more manageable. I highly recommend them!</li>
