      <li>I love this thing, smells amazing.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say how this stands up against them, but I am happy with the results and pretty content with the price.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair smells after using.</li>

      <li>Its scent is pleasant, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>It works and smells good, I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference with the curls and waves being any better</li>
      <li>The old smell was sophisticated, and people were always commenting on how good my hair smelled.</li>
      <li>-- it allows my hair to be just the way I love it, full of curls and bounces.</li>
      <li>What kind of grown woman wants to smell like tacky cherry cough syrup?</li>

      <li>After a week, my hair has become much more soft, less frizzy at the ends, shiny, and wonderfully wavy.</li>
      <li>i love it so much and will never buy another.</li>
      <li>The old version was great for my super curly hair; I swore by it and wouldn&#x27;t buy any other kind of shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>Great overall, easy to rinse out, and leaves hair soft.</li>
      <li>I did not notice any more curls in my hair than normal.  </li>
      <li>Hairdressers are ALWAYS asking me what I use on my hair, and I laugh when I tell them.</li>
      <li>Smells perfect, and arrived earlier than expected!</li>
      <li>I always get compliments on my hair and its this stuff right here that does all the work.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair super soft, smells fresh and clean all day.</li>
      <li>I like massaging it through the ends first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good conditioner for curly hair ever since Pantene changed their formula from the old wonderful \\&quot;dry to moisturized\\&quot; to the truly useless \\&quot;moisture renewal\\&quot; conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair always feels soft and clean for up to four days after.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this really brings out the curl as well as taming frizzies.  </li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong and stays on my hair all day long.</li>
      <li>Gives me a decent slip.</li>
      <li>So far I really like it</li>
      <li>It always leaves me with smooth beach waves hair with little to no effort.</li>
      <li>I have been using Herbal Essences Hello Hydration for a year on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>My curls come out so defined and soft.</li>
      <li>This product leaves it really soft after use.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through countless shampoos/conditioners to tame my coarse, dry, wavy hair, which is an uncommon hair type for Asian females (that&#x27;s me).</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m not a big fan of the new smell.</li>
      <li>I never buy it unless there is no other choice.</li>

<li> But I&#x27;m not a big fan of the new smell.</li>
<li> I never buy it unless there is no other choice.</li>
<li> I expected the previous jade version, but received the new wild cherry.  </li>
<li> Some conditioners weigh down naturally curly hair, which interferes with its ability to curl and flattens it.</li>
<li> The wild cherry does not work as well as the previous version.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m mixed (half Asian and half black), so my hair is really curly.</li>
<li> I go through a lot of this because my hair is so long.</li>
<li> I use other products afterwards, for styling, but this definitely does the job as a conditioner.</li>
<li> but and the smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like other ones but it works!</li>
<li> Expensive products just aren&#x27;t worth it in comparison.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t use shampoo at all, just conditioner, to keep them defined and \\&quot;controlled.\\&quot; Often I don&#x27;t use any styling cream at all, just a few squirts of conditioner applied the same way.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for a few years now, and it&#x27;s my clean little secret.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried other products for wavy hair</li>
<li> but I had to share a little of my experience since it varies person to person.</li>
<li> the secret is this brand of conditioner, no shampoo (it&#x27;s not like I work on a farm), no flat iron/ blow dryer</li>
<li> I am heavy handed</li>
<li> Not sure why.</li>
<li> The new formula definitely does not work as well, smells awful, and it not worth the money.</li>
<li> The new scent is absolutely atrocious.</li>
<li> When used together with Totally Twisted shampoo, I find that it enhances my curls and helps prevent frizzing.</li>
<li> Every year I switch up my conditioner and this year I started using Totally Twisted Curls &amp; Waves.</li>
<li> Totally Twisted Curls and Waves</li>
<li> The updated version of Totally Twisted is absolutely dreadful.</li>
<li> This change was a dreadful mistake on the part of Herbal Essences.</li>

    <li> I shampooed my hair now about 4 or 5 times.  I did not notice any more curls in my hair than normal.  The curls that I have in my hair were&lt;br /&gt;not enhanced nor thickened.  I thought it would leave my hair with a nice fragrance, but no.  However, it does clean the hair well.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, smells amazing. Gives me a decent slip. I am heavy handed so I use up a lot of product.</li>

    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It works and smells great. My hair always feels soft and clean for up to four days after.&lt;br /&gt;This is only one shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and so far is the best.I may find another I like better, but that hasn&#x27;t happened. It always makes me feel like I just took a shower. I&#x27;ve tried Pantene, TreSemme, Hair One and Kirkland. But none of them work like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome. That&#x27;s about all I can say about it. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through countless shampoos/conditioners to tame my coarse, dry, wavy hair, which is an uncommon hair type for Asian females (that&#x27;s me). After one use, I saw a difference. After a week, my hair has become much more soft, less frizzy at the ends, shiny, and wonderfully wavy. I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t flatten my roots. The shampoo does strip my hair but the conditioner is the savior. I like massaging it through the ends first. I haven&#x27;t tried other products for wavy hair so I can&#x27;t say how this stands up against them, but I am happy with the results and pretty content with the price. I never write reviews for anything but I had to share a little of my experience since it varies person to person. This is what works for me and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> The smell is different the one I bought from the store one month ago. Not sure why. But I&#x27;m not a big fan of the new smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner. My curls come out so defined and soft. The smell is strong and stays on my hair all day long. It doesnt offend me... It will probably if you are bothered by fruity floral scents. You get a pack of 3 for a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good conditioner for curly hair ever since Pantene changed their formula from the old wonderful \\&quot;dry to moisturized\\&quot; to the truly useless \\&quot;moisture renewal\\&quot; conditioner. I&#x27;m so grateful for Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curls and Waves -- it allows my hair to be just the way I love it, full of curls and bounces. Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> My hair smells amazing and looks even better. My colorist is always complementing how healthy and shiny my hair is- the secret is this brand of conditioner, no shampoo (it&#x27;s not like I work on a farm), no flat iron/ blow dryer and I only use oil based hair products for shine. I may not go organic and sulphate free, but the results are remarkable.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on my hair and its this stuff right here that does all the work. It always leaves me with smooth beach waves hair with little to no effort.</li>

    <li> so amazing on my hair. it smells so good a gives my hair the best condition ever. i love it so much and will never buy another.</li>
    <li> I love this product with the shampoo.  I have naturally curly hair and this really brings out the curl as well as taming frizzies.  This product has been discontinued in stores.  Amazon is the only place I can find it.  Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed (half Asian and half black), so my hair is really curly. This product leaves it really soft after use. My hair is always frizzy after use of any conditioner, but this does a good job of softening it up so that I can brush it in shower! I use other products afterwards, for styling, but this definitely does the job as a conditioner. And it smells amazing! I get compliments on it, all the time.</li>
