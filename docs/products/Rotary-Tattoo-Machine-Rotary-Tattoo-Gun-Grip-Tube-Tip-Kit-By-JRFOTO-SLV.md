      <li>Looks good from 3 feet.</li>
      <li>very nice Ez to clean feels great in my hand</li>
      <li>Great addition to any collection and so easy to use.</li>
      <li>it would be amazing if everybody purchasing tattoo supplies had to provide proof of artist employment</li>
      <li>the motor started changing speeds on its own</li>
      <li>these guns are silent with a strong good running motor the best rotary i have found on here</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed it when it was working</li>
      <li>first couple times i used it i was amazed with how good it worked really light, helped my lines out, love how it shades but not even 2 weeks of owning it</li>
      <li>You have to run it on lower speeds, I&#x27;ve only used it for packing and if came out great.</li>
      <li>it feels cheap and it does not hold</li>
      <li>This gun just feels cheap...</li>
      <li>slides right off!</li>
      <li>I got it on time, the box was nice, but it worked for about ten seconds before the plastic link between the arm and the motor shattered.</li>
      <li>I love this gun so much I&#x27;m thinking about getting me another one real soon</li>
      <li>you probably aren&#x27;t running it right.</li>
      <li>Was worried about power but concerns faded after first use because it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It worked well at first, quite.</li>
      <li>think I&#x27;m not going to buy another tattoo gun without checking out the reviews first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super smooth and quiet even for a rotary.</li>
      <li>Seller fulfilled the order good but the machine is not worth the money!!</li>
      <li>It appears stainless steel but is only cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>but you will get over that fast</li>
      <li>you have a power source for a reason and as for the plastic part breaking probably because you were running it to fast</li>
      <li>This \\&quot;ROTARY TATTOO\\&quot; Machine is an ABSOLUTE PLASTIC PIECE of GARBAGE.</li>
      <li>Now for you guys saying they go way to fast</li>
      <li>Product goes WAY WAY WAY WAY to FAST.  </li>
      <li>this is my first  professional tattoo gun after using a homemade tattoo gun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i can never rely on reviews when im tryin to find new equipment.</li>
      <li>get 3 of them  because you will not want to use your OLD guns .</li>
      <li>it sucks that so many SCRATCHERS</li>
      <li>Than it just stopped working completely..</li>
      <li>Not worth the money though, something is bound to break with in the first hour</li>
      <li>I replaced it to find out the motor was too strong, made the whole thing vibrate like crazy.</li>

    <li> i used only one time and it was broke, is bad because i buy all what i need to you guys.............sorry for my english if i wrote wrong.</li>
    <li> I got this gun and it sucked this is my first  professional tattoo gun after using a homemade tattoo gun.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m not going to buy another tattoo gun without checking out the reviews first. this gun totally sucked the guy I was tattooing got so mad just do a homemade tattoo gun I have one I have it for  like 3 years now  and had no problems with it</li>
    <li> Piece of junk didn&#x27;t work and hurt my clients skin. Don&#x27;t waste ur time.</li>
    <li> I got it on time, the box was nice, but it worked for about ten seconds before the plastic link between the arm and the motor shattered. I replaced it to find out the motor was too strong, made the whole thing vibrate like crazy. maybe it was unbalanced, or something. eventually after 20 minutes of screwing with it, the back cover came off. metal screws in a plastic frame.   would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Worked for about 20 mins then went crazy and stabbed a client, just out of no where no warning went from normal to ultra-fast!! Seller fulfilled the order good but the machine is not worth the money!! DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> Now for you guys saying they go way to fast you have a power source for a reason and as for the plastic part breaking probably because you were running it to fast i line at around 4 and shade or pack color around 3 these guns are silent with a strong good running motor the best rotary i have found on here i also have a stigma bizzare and its garbage rattles bad and the pressure wheel thing the screw strips the plastic... the stealth knock offs rattle also and they are both louder than this one use common sense setting it up if you making blood run turn it down grey lines turn it up..</li>
    <li> very nice Ez to clean feels great in my hand get 3 of them  because you will not want to use your OLD guns . great price. not sure how long it will last yet feels a little cheap but you will get over that fast</li>
    <li> I just got this rotary tattoo gun in the mail yesterday. I plugged it into my machine just to hear how it runs for maybe less then 10 secs, then it stops working completely. Didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use it and just got it. I want to return this for a refund..</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the look and first couple times i used it i was amazed with how good it worked really light, helped my lines out, love how it shades but not even 2 weeks of owning it the motor started changing speeds on its own it would slow down or speed up without me changing the voltz knob.. Than it just stopped working completely.. So i went to a Radioshack and bought another motor with a capicitor and now works like a champ.! Still using it and one of my favorites</li>
    <li> it sucks that so many SCRATCHERS wanna try to give bad reviews because they have no knowledge at all on how to tune a machine!!! i can never rely on reviews when im tryin to find new equipment. it would be amazing if everybody purchasing tattoo supplies had to provide proof of artist employment</li>
    <li> trash..look further the thing runs like its possessed!...not worth a dime trust me..if not find out yourself</li>
    <li> The lightest machine ive ever held. Was worried about power but concerns faded after first use because it is worth every penny. Great addition to any collection and so easy to use. TaT2 life</li>
    <li> This gun just feels cheap... You have to run it on lower speeds, I&#x27;ve only used it for packing and if came out great. Not worth the money though, something is bound to break with in the first hour</li>
    <li> Great gun for the price. If you&#x27;re having problems with it you probably aren&#x27;t running it right. It has to be lubricated and ran at extremely low settings. It&#x27;s super smooth and quiet even for a rotary.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;ROTARY TATTOO\\&quot; Machine is an ABSOLUTE PLASTIC PIECE of GARBAGE. Waste of $$. Looks good from 3 feet. Product goes WAY WAY WAY WAY to FAST.  Spend your $$ on a much more expensive Tattoo gun, you get what you pay for!  I learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed it when it was working but all the sudden it just stopped working and I cant figure out why</li>
    <li> Horrible. Within 10 minutes of use the machine overheats and voltage drops. It appears stainless steel but is only cheap plastic. Terrible machine.</li>
    <li> i love it thx its perfect</li>
    <li> I love this gun so much I&#x27;m thinking about getting me another one real soon and this is one of the best guns I have</li>
    <li> It worked well at first, quite. But after a day it broke!!! Totally not worth the money at all!!!! I would not repurchase or een think about buying it again.</li>
    <li> its plastic and it feels cheap and it does not hold a disposable or metal tube&lt;br /&gt;it slides right off!</li>
