      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>Ag is now one of my favorite haircare products.</li>
      <li>This product works better than any I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about four years and love it.  </li>
      <li>She combined the AG Recoil curl activator with AG liquid effects, extra-firm styling lotion and it produces a better defined curl with lots more hold and controls the frizzies much better for me.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this product works my curls</li>
      <li>Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I was especially happy with the larger size and the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; as opposed to the tube.</li>
      <li>It transforms my otherwise wavy hair into beautiful soft curls.</li>
      <li>Both, these materials are better for your curls than terry cloth which increases your chances of becoming frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I loved this product for the first week of use.  </li>
      <li>So Amazon offers a great price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product and not heavy.</li>
      <li>Received it today (it came very quickly).</li>
      <li>The Re-coil performed above my expectations; it curled my stubborn areas beautifully (ringlets) and very quickly.</li>
      <li>The woman who has the hard job of making me love my hair after any hair cut used this wonderful product in my hair</li>
      <li>I love that it leaves my hair nice and soft,</li>
      <li>This product is great for people with short curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I used to use the curl defining gel recommended by my stylist:it does creat&amp;hold nice curls and waves,hard type and very unnatural though which</li>
      <li>you might need to follow this with something light.  </li>
      <li>I used about a quarter sized amount and it left my hair a bit too fly away.  </li>
      <li>Easier to use and more economical.</li>
      <li>cuz ppl said it was good on natural curly hair like mine and to my surprise</li>
      <li>Glad I could get it here for a more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>During checking all the reviews here,I found out most users had the same problem as mine:coarse,unruly,frizzy and it seems recoil had worked greatly on them,so I decided to give a try(rcved early this</li>
      <li>But for me, it works GREAT at preventing friz if I rub it into wet hair.</li>
      <li>Like most people with curly hair, I&#x27;ve found that--unlike what people with straight hair think--we have to work to try to get that magazine-look.  </li>
      <li>Since I want some hair product that can make my curls soft and nice so badly,i searched a while until I saw this AG recoil.</li>
      <li>Finger set twists and dry, perfect soft, shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s been noticing, and the best part is that I actually have been spending a lot less time on my hair (with fewer products and better results) than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>keeps curls all day long, does not dry hair, excellent!</li>
      <li>This was my very first purchase.</li>
      <li>but since I love it so much I went through it too fast!</li>
      <li>love this product, keeps my hair in place and its not stiff</li>
      <li>i just tried it and waited till it completely dried before I come and write this review:it works greatly on my hair and help me realized everything I have been wanting for my hair:</li>
      <li>I love how soft my hair feels even after having this in it all</li>
      <li>It is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I have been quite found the right amount of product to use.</li>
      <li>had a lot of stringy pieces in my hair and left it more of a wavy not as curly.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>The bottle version is much easier to use too!</li>
      <li>Anyway this method works pretty well for me</li>
      <li>This product really tamed down the frizz and created gorgeous curls that lasted.</li>
      <li>I love this product for my curly hair and the seller had a larger bottle at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I usually get pretty good clumps &amp; no residue when it dries</li>
      <li>However the front of my hair is still pretty straight.</li>
      <li>I have loose, wavy curls and have never used a better product on my hair.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like;besides</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this prodcut gives much if any hold, so if you need that</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I have had straight hair all my life well until now.</li>
      <li>I love how this product gives and extra frizz-free hold without the major crunch.</li>
      <li>have really fine, no body, dry hair that has various textures all over--some really curly but fuzzy,</li>
      <li>It left my hair very, very sticky.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product at my local hair salon.  </li>
      <li>(my hair&#x27;s fine enough that it just sets--also it&#x27;s really dry where I live)</li>
      <li>This is amazing to me because I usually can only accomplish this using a cocktail of products with a lot time and effort.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a microfiber towel, you can use an old t-shirt.  </li>
      <li>My 12oz bottle lasts nearly five to six months.  </li>
      <li>My hair type is natural curly,coarse,hard and in a word,not the easy-to-manage type.</li>
      <li>have priced this locally and my salon wants $40 for the 12oz bottle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product! keeps curls all day long, does not dry hair, excellent!</li>
    <li> I used to buy the smaller version but since I love it so much I went through it too fast! The bottle version is much easier to use too! It transforms my otherwise wavy hair into beautiful soft curls. I get compliments on my hair every time I wash and style it! I do diffuse my hair but a friend of mine (who I gave a sample to try) said it worked on her air-dried hair too. It has great hold and I don&#x27;t need any other product (before or after I use it). Worth it!</li>
    <li> I actually discovered this product at my boyfriend&#x27;s - he has curly hair &amp; uses it just occasionally to neaten up his locks on days he skips a shower. But for me, it works GREAT at preventing friz if I rub it into wet hair. And it doesn&#x27;t require a whole handful of gel, a little goes a long way so the bottle is lasting me a long time. (My hair has grown to about mid-back length &amp; I have only recently upped my usage to 2 pumps. When my hair was shoulder length, one was sufficient). Re-Coil gives me SOFT, BOUNCY, TOUCHABLE, frizz-free curls. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I loved this product for the first week of use.  My curly hair had great definition and \\&quot;coils\\&quot; -- but then my hair began to look worse and worse.  My hair stylist said it was because the magnesium in the product is drying to the hair.  So now I&#x27;m using it only occasionally, then my hair looks great when I choose to use it.  Too bad, I&#x27;d love to have my hair look like this every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using re:coil for about a year now. I have very thick, wavy hair that looks good wet, but as it dries, it loses it definition and becomes a frizzy mess. I use recoil after my hair has started to air dry. I use about two palmfuls. Yes, parts of my hair can be crispy, but it also stays defined and nice looking. I use it in conjunction with Kerastase  oleo-relax slim and my hair is not frizzy and looks great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have very long curly hair and have been an avid user of gels and non-aerosol hairspray for years. This product has made it obsolete! No more sprays or anything! All I have to do is add a tiny bit to my hair and let it air dry. I&#x27;m so glad my stylist turned me on to this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about four years and love it.  It has been difficult to find other than on line. I was especially happy with the larger size and the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; as opposed to the tube. Easier to use and more economical.</li>
    <li> Reviews are so great for this ag recoil I got this cuz ppl said it was good on natural curly hair like mine and to my surprise I did not like at all had a lot of stringy pieces in my hair and left it more of a wavy not as curly.</li>
    <li> Like most people with curly hair, I&#x27;ve found that--unlike what people with straight hair think--we have to work to try to get that magazine-look.  How many times has someone come up to you and said, \\&quot;your hair looks really good today; you should wear it like that all the time.\\&quot;  And you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;I DO wear it like this all the time--just sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I have really fine, no body, dry hair that has various textures all over--some really curly but fuzzy, some with almost no curl.  And all I want is defined, consistant curls with body, without any crunchy or sticky feeling.  Re:coil is a great product to get there!&lt;br /&gt;I had read a bunch of reviews and they were somewhat mixed, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  You need VERY little product, and you run it through your hair right after a shower when it&#x27;s still sopping wet.  Then I put it in one of those absorbant towels for a few minutes and then shake my head upside down and let my hair air dry.  When it&#x27;s dry then I mess with it a little (scrunch upside down).  Voila!  Perfect ringlets!  Everyone&#x27;s been noticing, and the best part is that I actually have been spending a lot less time on my hair (with fewer products and better results) than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I hate some Amazon reviews when it&#x27;s clear that the reviewer just bought the product but hasn&#x27;t started to actually use it yet--so I waited for 2 weeks before posting this.  It is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat--I don&#x27;t think this prodcut gives much if any hold, so if you need that (my hair&#x27;s fine enough that it just sets--also it&#x27;s really dry where I live) you might need to follow this with something light.  On a few days I&#x27;ve put a tiny amount of John Masters Shine On on the ends of my hair for extra definition.</li>
    <li> My hair type is natural curly,coarse,hard and in a word,not the easy-to-manage type.I used to use the curl defining gel recommended by my stylist:it does creat&amp;hold nice curls and waves,hard type and very unnatural though which I really don&#x27;t like;besides I need to spend at least 10 mins everytime to finish this styling.I used to buy all kinds of stuff from Amazon:clothes,cosmetics,books,etc,but never hair products.Since I want some hair product that can make my curls soft and nice so badly,i searched a while until I saw this AG recoil.During checking all the reviews here,I found out most users had the same problem as mine:coarse,unruly,frizzy and it seems recoil had worked greatly on them,so I decided to give a try(rcved early this afternoon)and i just tried it and waited till it completely dried before I come and write this review:it works greatly on my hair and help me realized everything I have been wanting for my hair:soft,beautiful curls,natural looking and feels very light.Great great great product.I LOVE it and definately will recommend to all my friends too.</li>
    <li> I have loose, wavy curls and have never used a better product on my hair. Minimizes frizz and gives you definition without crunch. I&#x27;ve been using Recoil by AG for approximately 5 years and have recommended this product to other curly girls numerous times.</li>
    <li> Love all AG products, great smell and works great. I have very thick and curly hair and it cleans up my curls great.</li>
    <li> This a great product.  It helps the curls stay for the day without becoming frizzy!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at my local hair salon.  The woman who has the hard job of making me love my hair after any hair cut used this wonderful product in my hair and I am once again in love with my hair!  Oh yes, the cut is always amazing....but this product will do wonders for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the hold isn&#x27;t stiff, it&#x27;s a natural hold.  You can even run your fingers through your hair without messing up the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when you comb out your hair at night, I swear it&#x27;s like this stuff conditions your hair overnight for you!  I love how soft my hair feels even after having this in it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly, a little goes a long way!  My 12oz bottle lasts nearly five to six months.  I thought I was mistaken....but no, it really did last that long.  And I&#x27;d use it at least five to six times a week!  So spend the few extra dollars up front to make it last a lot longer and thus save money on styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have priced this locally and my salon wants $40 for the 12oz bottle.  I have found a few beauty supply places, but they charge $30 to $50 for it.  So Amazon offers a great price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled with this product.  I will continue to use it.  I love that it leaves my hair nice and soft, that it holds the style all day, and that the product lasts for some time.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product works my curls but I have to tell you that after using it for about a month, my hair is really dried out.</li>
    <li> This product is great for people with short curly hair.  I gave it four stars because of the push-top cap, which lets the smell of this product leech into my bathroom.  The pop-capped bottles are much better.</li>
    <li> Hairdresser had me use it and I love it. Glad I could get it here for a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Ag is now one of my favorite haircare products. I started buying them all on Amazon. This was my very first purchase. I do like the cream because it helps give my hair the umpump(sp?) that it needs.  I had a traumatic accident after a month in the hospital I had tangles in my hair so bad I had to chop off the back of my hair one of them all the way to the scout. At the time I decided to leave it a little bit longer in the front and of course the short in the back. What a mistake! Because the Trumatic experience, the back of my hair grew back really currently. However the front of my hair is still pretty straight. I have had straight hair all my life well until now. I never really had that much of a wave, but there was a little bit in the back of my hair and a teeny tiny bit in the front so the pieces of my hair that I didn&#x27;t cut is extremely difficult to get wavy or curly in the front. All of my AG products help me achieve the waves that I need. I have about medium length hair and it does leave my hair a little crunchy and sticky. I have been quite found the right amount of product to use. But with all the other product so I have I am in heaven!</li>
    <li> Iʻve been using this exclusively for two plus years on my thick curly hair.  Finger set twists and dry, perfect soft, shiny hair.  Will continue to buy forever.</li>
    <li> It left my hair very, very sticky.</li>
    <li> This is a great curl cream.  I put if one as the last product and I am very happy so far.  Follow directions and don&#x27;t use clip for sill a wonderful hair behavior.  Nw, if they could get rid of the curl scemes that list onto my finishined.</li>
    <li> I use this product coupled with AG Styling Jel. I love how this product gives and extra frizz-free hold without the major crunch. My curls are bouncy and I love my hair! Great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product when she trimmed my 3 A-B curls.  You have to play with the amount you use in your hair to find what works best.  Initially I used a bit too much (maybe 3 quarter sized amounts, it&#x27;s slightly thick, white creamy product).  It made my hair feel a bit heavy and dirty.  On the next go round I used about a quarter sized amount and it left my hair a bit too fly away.  I eventually discovered about 2 quarter sized amounts work best with my shoulder length, thickish hair.  I also purchased the 12.8 oz pump bottle on Amazon because the smaller  8 oz bottle I bought from my hairdresser didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since going back to my hairdresser she experimented with another AG product.  She combined the AG Recoil curl activator with AG liquid effects, extra-firm styling lotion and it produces a better defined curl with lots more hold and controls the frizzies much better for me.  I use about 2 quarter sized amounts total, combined (mixed together in my hand) of the AG Recoil curl activator.  I typically will have to do 2 handfuls since my hand just isn&#x27;t big enough for that much product all at once.  I also put it in my hair when it&#x27;s dripping wet, leaning my head forward, upside down.  I then squeeze the excess water out and then blot with a microfiber towel (which absorbs some of the excess product).  If you don&#x27;t have a microfiber towel, you can use an old t-shirt.  Both, these materials are better for your curls than terry cloth which increases your chances of becoming frizzy.  Never put your hair up in a terry cloth towel, turban style.....that just spells F-R-I-Z-Z-Y for us curly girls.  Anyway this method works pretty well for me and I have a majority of good curly days.</li>
    <li> i would rate this about 3.5/4 starts....I really like this product. I have short, extremely curly (3b/3c) hair that can somtimes be a hassle. This product really tamed down the frizz and created gorgeous curls that lasted. The only downfall is that it left my hair crunchy for a while, even after scrunching. I would recommend this product if you have frizzy/puffy hair because the hold is so much, but just remember a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Received it today (it came very quickly). My hair is 3a/3b curls with some stubborn areas (possibly heat damaged) that won&#x27;t curl. When it arrived I had already styled my hair for the day so I decided to moisten the pieces of my hair that wouldn&#x27;t curl with a little water and apply smaller than a pea-size (read a lot of reviews stating a little is all you need) of Re-coil to each of the pieces and then scrunched. As I scrunched I began to see my stubborn pieces begin to curl. It was very quick! This is amazing to me because I usually can only accomplish this using a cocktail of products with a lot time and effort. Sometimes I would use a curling iron (which is bad, bad, bad) when I lacked the time or patience. The Re-coil performed above my expectations; it curled my stubborn areas beautifully (ringlets) and very quickly. I loved the end results!</li>
    <li> love this product, keeps my hair in place and its not stiff</li>
    <li> Gives a nice shine to your hair. Great product and not heavy. Good for curly and wavy hair. Leaves curls looking natural without the look of oily residue.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good product to boost curl. It does feel stiff unless you blow dry while styling. However, the crunchiness fades as the hair is touched. Example, sleeping will get rid of it-the moving during night.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my curly hair and the seller had a larger bottle at a reasonable price. ;-)</li>
    <li> I have course, dry curly hair.  I have been trying to find something to use with gel immediately out of the shower.  This product works better than any I have tried.  I usually get pretty good clumps &amp; no residue when it dries</li>
