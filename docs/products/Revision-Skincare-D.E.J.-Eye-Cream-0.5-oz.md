      <li>I will continue using this bottle but seems I had better luck with an Estee Lauder cream I had before.</li>
      <li>This product seems to work better than what I&#x27;ve been buying in the store</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I decided to try this product to see if it would minimize fine lines and puffiness around my eyes.</li>
      <li>, the lotion did not show any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles after a month of use.</li>
      <li>It has helped a lot with fine lines and my puffy eyes from being sleep deprived by my kids.</li>
      <li>I love this, it soaks right in and isnt greasy.</li>
      <li>Used the product originally from a spa and now order online.</li>
      <li>Been using this cream past month and Very happy.</li>
      <li>Everytime I push the top of the botle there comes too much of the eye cream.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this for a month so this may not be a fair review.  </li>
      <li>It was great to find it on Amazon so much less money than at the doctor.</li>
      <li>It has not irritated my eyes at all, and my eyes are very sensitive to most creams.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle texture doesnt irritate my eyes.</li>

      <li>Actually I like Rhonda Allision lip/eye sermun much better.  </li>
      <li>Thanks god!</li>
      <li>The most noticeable thing has been that the &amp;#34;crepieness&amp;#34; on my eyelids has vastly improved.</li>
      <li>While i did LOVE the ease with which the eye cream went on, it didn&#x27;t take much to cover the entire eye area</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just expecting too much too soon.</li>
      <li>Use very sparingly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize an eye cream could make so much difference.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
      <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Better results and less cost.  </li>
      <li>But to be realistic it might not work for me and do wonders for others.</li>
      <li>I used it one more time the next day and my eyelids became swollen and slightly red.  </li>
      <li>was highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have seen a big improvement on my smile lines and takes my morning puffiness away in the morning</li>
      <li>this manufacter only sells their produut to doctors so you really don&#x27;t know if its the real brand name is Revisions product</li>
      <li>My eyes very sensitive</li>
      <li>I will continue to use and highly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Recommended by professional.</li>
      <li>So far like the product - may be too soon to tell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old.</li>
      <li>If you want to see a major difference in your face in just One application that this product is for you.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin or low tolerance for cosmetics around your eyes.</li>

    <li> Wake up in the morning with puffy, irritated eyes.  Certainly not what I expected.  There is no returning this item if it doesn&#x27;t meet expectations, so it&#x27;s quite a waste of money if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.  Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin or low tolerance for cosmetics around your eyes.</li>
    <li> So far like the product - may be too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I was leery that this product would actually do what it says.  After using for about 3 weeks I noticed a definite improvement.  I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product at a great price! Glides on the skin, won&#x27;t crease or interfere with your concealer.</li>
    <li> Product is priced competitively.  Used the product originally from a spa and now order online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old. I decided to try this product to see if it would minimize fine lines and puffiness around my eyes. It does both.</li>
    <li> While i did LOVE the ease with which the eye cream went on, it didn&#x27;t take much to cover the entire eye area, the lotion did not show any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles after a month of use.</li>
    <li> was highly recommended. I also place it around my lips. Great product.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended me this  eye cream. My eyes very sensitive it&#x27;s hard to find a right cream for me. Very gentle texture doesnt irritate my eyes. Thanks god! Been using this cream past month and Very happy.</li>
    <li> On 5th bottle. Works really well. A little bit goes along way. Great price point for an aggressive eye cream.</li>
    <li> Does help and would purchase again.  Use very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the skin feel so subtle and easier to put on makeup&lt;br /&gt;without it showing all the wrinkles</li>
    <li> I tried it.  Actually I like Rhonda Allision lip/eye sermun much better.  Better results and less cost.  All of her products are amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. It has helped a lot with fine lines and my puffy eyes from being sleep deprived by my kids.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye cream, makes your eye make up go on very smooth, softens the area around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I like it but the container has a problem. Everytime I push the top of the botle there comes too much of the eye cream. An amount equivalent to three times of use.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this eye cream and I bought and used it. My eyes are no longer puffy or red when using. It was great to find it on Amazon so much less money than at the doctor. I will continue to use and highly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 6 months and I think I see some benefits.  Recommended by professional.</li>
    <li> I use only Revision Skin Care products now but am on the fence about this eye cream.  I have only been using this for a month so this may not be a fair review.  I will continue using this bottle but seems I had better luck with an Estee Lauder cream I had before. Maybe I&#x27;m just expecting too much too soon.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any benefits from this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using this for about a year and it does what it promises</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results of the Revision D.E.J. Eye Cream.  The most noticeable thing has been that the &amp;#34;crepieness&amp;#34; on my eyelids has vastly improved. It has not irritated my eyes at all, and my eyes are very sensitive to most creams.  I have noticed some &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; in the lid area.  I give it 4 stars only because of the price.  It&#x27;s a very small product, and I will have to see how long it will last  before I can assess its true value.  Overall - I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> While I love the neck cream - was disappointed in the eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;Not a great product.  But to be realistic it might not work for me and do wonders for others.</li>
    <li> If you want to see a major difference in your face in just One application that this product is for you. Facial wash is my favorite!!!! This definitely beats the price of my doctors office!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a middle aged woman whose age has only shown up so far on my eyelids.  This works. It does not sting.  It does not irritate.  It soaks in to my skin right away and smooths the creepy part of my eyelids instantly.  I don&#x27;t know if I can continue to afford it but for now I am thrilled.  Maybe the long term results will convince me for the next order.  And a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream from Texas Beauty Supply BEWARE this product did nothing for me when I tried to return it they refused a refund I called the manufacturer and was told to beware theses products are only prescribed to a doctors and they told me they don&#x27;t know how Texas Beauty Supply could sell this with out a DR approval this manufacter only sells their produut to doctors so you really don&#x27;t know if its the real brand name is Revisions product</li>
    <li> I love this, it soaks right in and isnt greasy. I like that I can use it on my eye lids and it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate like other eye creams  have done in the past. I have seen a big improvement on my smile lines and takes my morning puffiness away in the morning</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream of all time!</li>
    <li> This product seems to work better than what I&#x27;ve been buying in the store</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermotologist.  Didn&#x27;t realize an eye cream could make so much difference.&lt;br /&gt;Took years off. My look.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream, it is the perfect consistency, not heavy and not too lite. It does not irritate the eyes and seems to hold its moisture all day. I will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I just started using it now. So far so good!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist office had recommended this product.  I followed the directions on the package.  After applying it the first day my eye lids became itchy.  I used it one more time the next day and my eyelids became swollen and slightly red.  I was advised by the dermatologist office to stop using it. No refund because it was opened.  If I bought it at the doctor&#x27;s office I could have received a refund.</li>
