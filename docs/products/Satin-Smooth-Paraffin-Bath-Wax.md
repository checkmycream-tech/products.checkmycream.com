<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it once and received excellent relaxation with the added benefit of softening my feet and hands.  </li>
      <li>It would be great if it heated up faster but probably doesn&#x27;t to prevent burns</li>
      <li>This works great for anyone with arthritis in hands and or feet.  </li>
      <li>It feels so good to aching arthritic hands and does temporarily help the aching.  </li>
      <li>and I caught it at a really good price.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I kind of like this paraffin wax spa.</li>
      <li>great product except it gets too hot.  </li>
      <li>Will over the weekend! :)</li>
      <li>I was glad when I found the product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>After all that&#x27;s what helps you! :)  </li>
      <li>May dog stepped on it and cracked the top</li>
      <li>I love this equipment.  </li>
      <li>I found this paraffin wax melter pretty good.  </li>
      <li>After ordering the wax separately, I was finally able to use it and it worked fine.  </li>
      <li>B0028UWTMM Jilbere Satin Smooth Paraffin Therapy Bath]]  </li>
      <li>Holds plenty of wax,  Right Temp kept for my massage office, My clients love this add on.</li>
      <li>Most of the time the wax got too hot.</li>
      <li>It was a gift so couldnt really tell you much more.</li>
      <li>It is so hot it is easy to get a burn from using it.  </li>
      <li>This unit does get two stars because it did melt the paraffin (took several hours) and it would be fine if you just want warm paraffin....  </li>
      <li>other than that, it is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Mine does the opposite; after 10 hours it was still just warm; didn&#x27;t generate the heat I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It does take four hours to melt the wax, but it is worth the wait.</li>
      <li>The temparature of the paraffin is either too hot to keep your hand in or too cool and the paraffin hardens.  </li>
      <li>Not bad at all, and very smoothing.  </li>
      <li>It in fact takes much longer, more like 7 to 10 hours to completely melt the wax.</li>
      <li>and it gets really hot.</li>
      <li>Once it is melted the wax is almost too hot to touch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It allows ease of dipping your hands and feet in hot wax.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was out of luck and ready to order another brand and came to work and boom..</li>
      <li>My hands get real sore with cracks on my fingers in the winter.</li>
      <li>It has plenty of room and is nice and deep to cover your entire hand and wrist well, also feet, but haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  </li>
      <li>The paperwork indicates it takes 4 hours to completely melt a full load of wax (new or existing).</li>
      <li>This is a great little device but it takes so long to get it heated up.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it for carpal tunnel help.  </li>
      <li>It works well on my dry heels and saves me a ton of money on pedicures as I use it with the plastic liners and original terry booties</li>
      <li>, the way initially took about 6 or more hours to completely melt and holds the same temp.  </li>
      <li>When it said that it was thermostatically controlled I thought there would be some way to control the temperature, at least a choice of three temperatures such as a control from warm to hot.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d prefer a replacement lid to a new one.</li>
      <li>have had it plugged in since purchasing it, the outside of the unit isn&#x27;t hot</li>
      <li>leaves my hands so soft!</li>
      <li>Love the way it helps dry cuticles as well and with dry cracked hands in the winter, can&#x27;t wait to use it then too!  </li>
      <li>Great solution to cold weather aches and pains on hands or feet.</li>
      <li>Just wish it had been made clear that the wax must be purchased separately.</li>
      <li>Although I have only had this a few days so far, I love it.  </li>
      <li>wish it was thermally controlled so that it had a start-up (higher heat) setting to initially melt the wax, and then an operating setting to keep the wax just barely molten for use?</li>
      <li>I bought it based on the other reviews that it got the paraffin too hot!  </li>
      <li>it takes 6 hours for the wax to be completely melted and if left for a bit the wax burns..</li>

    <li> there is no way to control the temperature of the paraffin.  It is so hot it is easy to get a burn from using it.  When it said that it was thermostatically controlled I thought there would be some way to control the temperature, at least a choice of three temperatures such as a control from warm to hot.  I am seriously thinking of returning it for a refund.  Please inform me of how I can return the item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and received excellent relaxation with the added benefit of softening my feet and hands.  Have told my friends they need one.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 2 months and no guarantee after 30 days I thought I was out of luck and ready to order another brand and came to work and boom..it started working again!!&#x27; Keeping my fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item so long, I&#x27;m not sure when I bought if. I remember it retailing for ~$70.00 and I caught it at a really good price. My unit still works and a 1 lb block of wax melts in ~ 3 - 4 hours. It works well on my dry heels and saves me a ton of money on pedicures as I use it with the plastic liners and original terry booties it came with. May dog stepped on it and cracked the top so I&#x27;d prefer a replacement lid to a new one. The newer ones are much smaller. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0028UWTMM Jilbere Satin Smooth Paraffin Therapy Bath]]  I love this equipment.  It allows ease of dipping your hands and feet in hot wax.  I would recommend this item.  It does take four hours to melt the wax, but it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> The product is acceptable, but does NOT operate as advertised or as documented in the included brochure. The paperwork indicates it takes 4 hours to completely melt a full load of wax (new or existing). It in fact takes much longer, more like 7 to 10 hours to completely melt the wax. Once it is melted the wax is almost too hot to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was thermally controlled so that it had a start-up (higher heat) setting to initially melt the wax, and then an operating setting to keep the wax just barely molten for use?</li>
    <li> Item only had an on/off switch, so I was not able to control the temperature of the wax. Most of the time the wax got too hot. I did notice this when I ordered it but overlooked it for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and am thoroughly convinced that it has helped my arthritic hands immesurably and softened my skin.  Would highly recommend it for carpal tunnel help.  The heat seems to have promoted healing.</li>
    <li> Holds plenty of wax,  Right Temp kept for my massage office, My clients love this add on.</li>
    <li> I found this paraffin wax melter pretty good.  There was room to do your hands and your feet (separately of course.)&lt;br /&gt;One thing was deceptive: the wax is supposed to melt in 4 hours, which is longer than I like to take, but it took 6.  My last paraffin machine took 2 hours, but held only 1/6 the wax.  This is a Conair product, but it says &amp;#34;Gibere,&amp;#34; I guess so it sounds French.  I almost always like Conair products.  It only has on-off switch so heat not easily controlled, but I didn&#x27;t mind that.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> The temparature of the paraffin is either too hot to keep your hand in or too cool and the paraffin hardens.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is a great little device but it takes so long to get it heated up. And if you have two clients in 1 1/2 hours it is presentable but you can dip from the side and get the job done. It would be great if it heated up faster but probably doesn&#x27;t to prevent burns</li>
    <li> I kind of like this paraffin wax spa. there is no thermostat control at all. is basically an off and on button and it gets really hot. it takes 6 hours for the wax to be completely melted and if left for a bit the wax burns..</li>
    <li> The thing it should have come with wax like page you per parafi put the wax with it instead u have to bye support rath&lt;br /&gt;Any thank you in need the wax</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother.  We had it plugged in on two separate occasions for over 9 hours each.  The wax would begin to liquefy but after about an hour it would begin to harden again and the unit would get cold.  I contacted the manufacturer and I was told that I have to pay to have it shipped to them and cut a check to them so they can ship one back to me. I have never dealt with a company that didn&#x27;t take the responsiblity for their product malfunctioning.  I requested that they send me the money instead of replacing the unit since I did not want to go through the headache of another failed product.</li>
    <li> Although I have only had this a few days so far, I love it.  It feels so good to aching arthritic hands and does temporarily help the aching.  It has plenty of room and is nice and deep to cover your entire hand and wrist well, also feet, but haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  Will over the weekend! :)&lt;br /&gt;I have had it plugged in since purchasing it, the outside of the unit isn&#x27;t hot, the way initially took about 6 or more hours to completely melt and holds the same temp.  Although a little hot, not too bad. After all that&#x27;s what helps you! :)  And it&#x27;s only in for a min, a few times.  Not bad at all, and very smoothing.  Love the way it helps dry cuticles as well and with dry cracked hands in the winter, can&#x27;t wait to use it then too!  I&#x27;ll definitely use this daily.  My wax has not &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; at all as a few stated.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have wanted one of these for years and only wish I had gotten it earlier. What a relief from arthritic hands and feet. Plus, there is the added advantage of the moisturizing. My feet are no longer dragon feet.!</li>
    <li> great product except it gets too hot.  other than that, it is a great product.  leaves my hands so soft!</li>
    <li> This works great for anyone with arthritis in hands and or feet.  Also helps to moisturize dry skin on hands or feet.  Great solution to cold weather aches and pains on hands or feet.</li>
    <li> I had the same product 4 years &amp; it stopped working. I was glad when I found the product on Amazon. All local stores guit carrying the product. Gotta have it. My hands get real sore with cracks on my fingers in the winter. Only thing that heals my hands are this product &amp; wax.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Seems to work. It was a gift so couldnt really tell you much more.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to discover that this unit does NOT come with the paraffin wax.  It is the unit only.  After ordering the wax separately, I was finally able to use it and it worked fine.  Just wish it had been made clear that the wax must be purchased separately.</li>
    <li> This unit does get two stars because it did melt the paraffin (took several hours) and it would be fine if you just want warm paraffin....  I like mine on the hotter side, so it doesn&#x27;t suit my personal needs.  I bought it based on the other reviews that it got the paraffin too hot!  Mine does the opposite; after 10 hours it was still just warm; didn&#x27;t generate the heat I was looking for.</li>
