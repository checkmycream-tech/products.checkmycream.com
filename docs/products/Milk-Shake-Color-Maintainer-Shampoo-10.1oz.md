      <li>I wish it was shipped in a better manner</li>
      <li>Oh yes, and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is also better than my salon</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know of too many salons in my neighborhood that carry these products, and 2)</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a dime sized amount of Pureology every morning, and this Milkshake needs considerably more and just feels like fake-o chemical grodiness.</li>
      <li>I will only use milkshake products and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>and I totally love it and</li>
      <li>cant find it in many places.</li>
      <li>I love the Milkshake Shampoo.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re someone who loves smelling like a vanilla cupcake you&#x27;ll love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and price was phenomenal!</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been in such good condition!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, it makes my hair really soft and smell good to.</li>
      <li>The conditioner was amazing and smelt exactly like whipped cream, so I thought I&#x27;d try their shampoo.</li>
      <li>what I got was a sickeningly sweet concoction that repulsed more than</li>
      <li>, it has a sweet fragrance that I don&#x27;t love</li>
      <li>It makes your hair smell sweet and delicous and keeps it healthy.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance and gentle on your hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on my blonde hair that i get bleached monthly.</li>
      <li>worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Is this really 6 times better than my $2 bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders?  </li>
      <li>product shipped quickly and was packaged well....</li>
      <li>it keeps my color  lasting longer for sure!</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t get enough lather without using considerably more than I am accustomed to, and it just doesn&#x27;t spread around and make my hair feel clean.</li>
      <li>the daily frequent shampoo is good also</li>
      <li>So glad I finally found it again online!</li>
      <li>It does smell like a milkshake when you first shampoo your hair.</li>
      <li>First, don&#x27;t expect it to lather a lot.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>For a shampoo and conditioner to last five months is pretty abnormal for me, but the product is top quality and one I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
      <li>are a a bit more harsh ie very sudsy, leave hair feeling super clean)</li>
      <li>I love this whole line of products, works very good, BUT its SO expensive, that&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
      <li>Really, life changing stuff here.</li>
      <li>This product is also concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use as much shampoo.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
      <li>My hair looks fuller in volume and is very shiny.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little strong at first but got used to it.</li>
      <li>and this gives it a little more life.</li>
      <li>I first started using the Milkshake leave-in spray conditioner, and fell in love with the fact that it smells like butterscotch hard candies.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to make it worse by saying that Pantene performs better than this Milk Shake product, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really fun shampoo that actually does it&#x27;s job!</li>
      <li>captivated.&lt;br /&gt;But, to the credit of the actual shampoo, it made my hair SUPER bouncy and fairly soft</li>
      <li>My mother also uses it and she has dry, thick curly hair - seems to have the same good effect on both of us.</li>
      <li>They have too much chocolate and not enough white cream filling as they were years ago.</li>
      <li>I have average thickness, very straight hair</li>
      <li>Luxurious smooth creamy thick textured shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, mousy born hair that I color blonde pretty heavy.  </li>

<li> I lost a lot of hair after the birth of my 2 nd baby and went to a bad stylist who burnt my hair badly.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately the way it was shipped was horrible.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m disappointed that this contains sulfates!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! I also use the Milkshake Leave in Conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo it smells just like a Vanilla Milkshake!! It&#x27;s amazing how it makes your hair feel!! This is the best price that I have seen!! You have got to try out this product!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for maintaining color treated hair. It does smell like a milkshake when you first shampoo your hair. Only problem is that the smell does attract insects in the summer time. ; }</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair soft and bouncy. I have average thickness, very straight hair and this gives it a little more life. My mother also uses it and she has dry, thick curly hair - seems to have the same good effect on both of us. Amazon&#x27;s price is also better than my salon so it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!! The smell is a little strong at first but got used to it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells delicious! And does smell like a milkshake. Probably works best with thicker hair as mine is soft and fin e and it makes hair even softer.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Nice fragrance and gentle on your hair. Holds the color!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my hair really soft and smell good to. I would recommend this shampoo. I have the leave in conditioner and the glistening milk as well.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cleans and makes my hair feel but I&#x27;m disappointed that this contains sulfates! A color preserving shampoo should not have this. It&#x27;s sodium laurel sulfate FYI. Besides that, it cleans well (probably a bit too well but I tend to prefer the feel of the shampoos are a a bit more harsh ie very sudsy, leave hair feeling super clean), it has a sweet fragrance that I don&#x27;t love but I don&#x27;t mind it too much. If you&#x27;re someone who loves smelling like a vanilla cupcake you&#x27;ll love the fragrance. I have been using it with the color protecting conditioner and it&#x27;s made my hair soft and even smoothed frizzies (I have thick, straight hair that has a slight wave if I have layers).</li>
    <li> I first started using the Milkshake leave-in spray conditioner, and fell in love with the fact that it smells like butterscotch hard candies.  This shampoo smells just as good as the leave-in conditioner.  I use less of the shampoo only because the bottles are so much smaller than the Biolage shampoo I still use from time to time.  I have to order the Milkshake products from Amazon, because 1) I don&#x27;t know of too many salons in my neighborhood that carry these products, and 2) Those &amp;#34;snobs&amp;#34; over at Ulta don&#x27;t carry these products.  When I tried to show a sales girl over at Ulta what the Milkshake products were, she was like &amp;#34;we don&#x27;t carry those.&amp;#34;  Too bad for Ulta, because these products rock compared to the other crap hair care products they sell and carry in that store!  Kudos to Amazon for carrying Milkshake products!</li>
    <li> First, don&#x27;t expect it to lather a lot.  Good shampoos don&#x27;t.  This is the healthiest my hair and&lt;br /&gt;Scalp have been since I started coloring my hair 10 years ago.  Really, life changing stuff here. Glad my hair stylist told me about it.  I have shoulder length, mousy born hair that I color blonde pretty heavy.  My hair is usually so oily, but this has reduced it by 1/2.  I lost a lot of hair after the birth of my 2 nd baby and went to a bad stylist who burnt my hair badly.  But my hair stopped falling out the same week I started using this. No coincidence, amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this milkshake product because I tried their whipped cream leave in conditioner. The conditioner was amazing and smelt exactly like whipped cream, so I thought I&#x27;d try their shampoo. Yes, it does smell delicious and seems to be doing a good job cleaning and leaving my hair soft. It&#x27;s a really fun shampoo that actually does it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> Smells like a vanilla milkshake! Works great on my blonde hair that i get bleached monthly. Recommended by my hairdresser &amp; my husband loves the smell.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this...  so I bought it.  I don&#x27;t know anything about shampoo.  I use whatever is on sale at the grocery store.  Is this really 6 times better than my $2 bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders?  Probably not.  Anyway, she likes it...  Says its great.</li>
    <li> I love the Milkshake Shampoo. I used this at the Salon and it smells wonderful! I didn&#x27;t care of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product and I totally love it and how manageable my hair is after using it.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job on your hair.</li>
    <li> Milkshake shampoo and leave in conditioner is the best hair care product I have ever used.  I hope my salon picks up the product soon!  My hair has never been in such good condition!</li>
    <li> The product itself is awesome.... It makes your hair smell sweet and delicous and keeps it healthy. Unfortunately the way it was shipped was horrible. The lid unscrewed and the product leaked inside the box. I wish it was shipped in a better manner</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! It shipped quickly and price was phenomenal! Thanks!</li>
    <li> product shipped quickly and was packaged well....love milkshake products...leaves hair clean and keeps color looking great...also smells great...the daily frequent shampoo is good also</li>
    <li> Living in a dry area my hair needs moisture and with my hair color I want a product to help maintain the color my stylist worked so hard on. I will only use milkshake products and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Luxurious smooth creamy thick textured shampoo. Makes  my hair smell and feel great. My hair looks fuller in volume and is very shiny. Friends  compliment the way my hair looks. The matching conditioner is great too and detangles too.Amazon&#x27;s price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff great smell and great on my hair it keeps my color  lasting longer for sure!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pureology Anti-Fade set for five months now; both the shampoo and conditioner. [I would share a link, but there are fake Pureology products being sold on Amazon and I don&#x27;t want to point a link to one by accident---try Ulta!] The price for the Pureology set was something I would never spend, but my cousin gave it to me as a birthday gift. For a shampoo and conditioner to last five months is pretty abnormal for me, but the product is top quality and one I&#x27;d buy again. (Update I bought gallon sizes of each and just now used the last of them almost 2 years later)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this Milkshake shampoo (and matching conditioner) from a three-piece set I bought from my stylist. I religiously use a lot of serum, and I could get the serum, shampoo, and conditioner for $40 so why not, I thought? Yeah. That&#x27;s what I get for thinking. Yes this shampoo smells good. But it&#x27;s like it turns to water when it hits my hair, I can&#x27;t get enough lather without using considerably more than I am accustomed to, and it just doesn&#x27;t spread around and make my hair feel clean. It just feels like a cheap drugstore shampoo with a great smell. It also makes my hair feel like decimated STRAW. Just---nasty. I don&#x27;t want to make it worse by saying that Pantene performs better than this Milk Shake product, but it&#x27;s true. I find that to be so sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a dime sized amount of Pureology every morning, and this Milkshake needs considerably more and just feels like fake-o chemical grodiness. I cannot believe that I&#x27;m about to go buy another bottle of Pureology but, it&#x27;s a tough act to follow. My curly, frizzy, Brillo-pad hair just does not like the Milkshake shampoo. Neither do I.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great smells great. Will keep buying this product. Would recommend it to others. Unlike any product I have used before.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to be that great of a product for the price</li>
    <li> I was anticipating a wonderful milkshake/cupcake scent but what I got was a sickeningly sweet concoction that repulsed more than captivated.&lt;br /&gt;But, to the credit of the actual shampoo, it made my hair SUPER bouncy and fairly soft so I think I&#x27;ll stick with it at least til I finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Not planning on buying another, though.</li>
    <li> I love this whole line of products, works very good, BUT its SO expensive, that&#x27;s the only downside. It you got the money to splurge, Then DO :)</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! cant find it in many places. So glad I finally found it again online! worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It smells like a cupcake and I love it!</li>
    <li> All was great except the Mountain bars. They have too much chocolate and not enough white cream filling as they were years ago.</li>
    <li> Milkshake colour maintainer shampoo is a great product that smells fabulous and my hair feels good.  This product is also concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use as much shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past but can no longer find it on the island that I live on. I believe it hydrates and cleans the hair without weighing it down. Oh yes, and I love the smell.</li>
