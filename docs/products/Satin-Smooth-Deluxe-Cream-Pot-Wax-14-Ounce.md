      <li>Make sure you have strips (</li>
      <li>I absoluy love this product.</li>
      <li>the more often you use it the more contained</li>
      <li>This wax says it works best on coarse hairs</li>
      <li>I read most of the 1 star reviews and 99% of them were people who were misusing the product (you NEED fabric strips to remove this wax).</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, don&#x27;t hesitate on this wax, just buy it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok wax.</li>
      <li>This stuff was more like glue, it stuck to everything, except hair to be removed and removal strips.</li>
      <li>love the cream wax.</li>
      <li>Okay to use everywhere.</li>
      <li>pretty good..</li>
      <li>However, these are minor problems for an awesome product!</li>
      <li>since I used this product, The hair perfectly gets removed in 1 single strip.</li>
      <li>Comes off clean!</li>
      <li>But for hair that comes out relatively easily</li>
      <li>After a couple applications it was easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>it also was easy to wipe off.</li>
      <li>Had to do it in good ventilation and threw away the left over wax while it was still warm in a plastic bag.</li>
      <li>I bought this product (Deluxe Cream Wax) along with the Gigi warmer to attempt my first at home wax.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and comes off easy.</li>
      <li>Took off my fine arm hair and leg hair but stick to my skin a bit on my arm..</li>
      <li>Also, as with all waxes, it is important to use either oil or baby powder on the skin before the wax is applied to protect your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only use it on my legs, and have had great results.</li>
      <li>this product is so smooth when it goes on and comes off, it get all the hairs on my face.</li>
      <li>I am an esthetician and I love most of the suddenly smooth products, the only kind I don&#x27;t like is the honey wax</li>
      <li>I will be buying it again great overall!</li>
      <li>This wax grabbed the hairs very well and pulled the hairs out so effectively I could see in the intact hair bulb.     </li>
      <li>Fairly easy clean up considering it is wax.    </li>
      <li>Very worth while product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hundred percent satisfied with the product and with the seller&#x27;s description very fast delivery</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too familiar with home waxing.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised and very glad.</li>
      <li>I waxed my fianc&amp;eacute;es back and found that it did do a good job there because his hairs were fine.</li>
      <li>Awesome product, the wax grabs every hair and has no residue like hard wax and was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>I will probably not buy this again as the only good thing about it was that it melted quickly.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used many different types of wax and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Like I said I used this wax for my FIRST at home wax and was able to wax my: legs, under arms and chin with my first application.</li>
      <li>Not only does it heat up very quickly but it pulls off very smoothly and literally leaves the skin feeling like satin</li>
      <li>very pliable and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>An absolutely acceptable wax for my easy to lift hair.</li>
      <li>Ps, didn&#x27;t even get bumps;) yay!</li>
      <li>Love this cream soft wax.</li>
      <li>you have fine, soft hairs, this is for you though!!</li>
      <li>The satin smooth wax pulled out more hair and left the skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This wax is a miracle worker - by fair less pain than what I&#x27;m used to in the waxing salon -</li>
      <li>I have coarse hair, and when I go to the salon very rarely do I get completely smooth results on my legs, the hairs tend to break and not come out fully.</li>
      <li>With this particular was it works best with a thin layer of baby powder applied to the skin before the wax is applied to protect your skin.   </li>
      <li>Great amount of wax in the pot, however, should last a long time (if you don&#x27;t overdo it when applying.)</li>
      <li>Did not get too hot on my skin.</li>
      <li>It melts at a lower temp which means my skin isn&#x27;t red afterward and it leaves my skin feeling smooth!</li>
      <li>No matter what temperature I have have the wax, what kind of strips I use, or whether or not I use baby powder on my legs prior to waxing, this wax rips layers of my skin off leaving me with huge red patches that take weeks to heal.</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time on my eyebrows and my arms.</li>
      <li>even if on hot has not burned me at all.</li>
      <li>Feels great on guests skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate as much like other soft waxes do.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about the Satin Smooth Deluxe Cream Wax because it isn&#x27;t as hard as the GiGi waxes, but it is wonderful!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tacky in a stretchy, chewing gum kinda way so that when you pull the strip off, it hardly ever comes away nice and clean.</li>
      <li>First of all, I love that this wax is pink.  </li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>First off, this is NOT a hard wax!</li>
      <li>Even pure Acetone couldn&#x27;t remove it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> An absolutely acceptable wax for my easy to lift hair. I don&#x27;t think it would work well on tough growth, for that you&#x27;d need hard wax. But for hair that comes out relatively easily this works well and is not irritating.</li>
    <li> this is the best wax you could use on your skin. I&#x27;m a hundred percent satisfied with the product and with the seller&#x27;s description very fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great price and nice sating smooth feel after job well done. Great experience and even if on hot has not burned me at all.</li>
    <li> I wax my own legs as well as my sisters. you can definitly tell the differnce in results. I was finishing off another brand of wax (Gigi?) on one leg and then used this  wax on the other. The satin smooth wax pulled out more hair and left the skin soft and smooth. Its now the only brand I buy.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know to use oil to remove this product. Big mess, which took a half hour to clean from myself, sink, countertops. Oh my. I&#x27;m afraid to try it again. But, use oil to remove. So I&#x27;m told. If you read this and have tried one that works, please let me know. Sure would appreciate it. :)</li>
    <li> I love this wax! This is a very smooth wax. It goes on easy and comes off with no residue on your skin at all! It is not messy unless you are a very inexperienced waxer, it grabs every hair no matter how thick or little it is, and it never leaves a rash on my skin or gets too hot. Fits perfectly in my gigi warmer!</li>
    <li> Very gentle for facial waxing, but also messy (I know pretty normal for wax). Make sure you have strips (Muslim or did cut cloth will be even messier) applicator and some oil/was cleaner for face &amp; anything that falls. DO NOT attempt near grout. VERY difficult to clean up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning the right technique, so it&#x27;s definitely messy at first. Arrived very quickly and actually fits perfectly on an old candle warmer I had lying around. Warmed it up to the perfect temperature without a problem! My only problem is that it&#x27;s not getting all the hair on the first shot. This could be from my technique, I&#x27;m not sure yet - which is why I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars. Overall, I like it but I have to work on mastering the wax, as it&#x27;s a bit of a challenge if you&#x27;re new to this. Great amount of wax in the pot, however, should last a long time (if you don&#x27;t overdo it when applying.)</li>
    <li> This stuff was more like glue, it stuck to everything, except hair to be removed and removal strips. Too messy to return, I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Leaves a pink streak which does wash away... the colour does make it a little harder to see if i have removed all the hair off in a dimly lit bathroom...</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my own legs now for almost 15 years. I have used a number of Satin Smooth products and none have given me trouble. Except this one. No matter what temperature I have have the wax, what kind of strips I use, or whether or not I use baby powder on my legs prior to waxing, this wax rips layers of my skin off leaving me with huge red patches that take weeks to heal. I would recommend any of their other wax varieties before this one.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and I love most of the suddenly smooth products, the only kind I don&#x27;t like is the honey wax but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like ANY honey wax. Suddenly smooth is the only wax I use on my clients. Comes off clean!</li>
    <li> This wax I would suggest for sensitive skin.  It lasts a long time and heats up smooth. It is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> great wax for underarms and face. definitely invest in some oil to remove any messes as it is VERY sticky. I use vitamin E oil. and also i apply to skin after waxing.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this wax! It&#x27;s super messy hard to get off compared to gigi honey wax. It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair and it sticks through the wax strips making it hard to rub the strip before pulling off. I used this on my armpits didn&#x27;t do anything but irritate my skin. Also used it on my legs didn&#x27;t get all the hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time on my eyebrows and my arms. very pliable and easy to work with. pulls out all the hairs work&#x27;s great! it also was easy to wipe off. love the cream wax.</li>
    <li> this product is so smooth when it goes on and comes off, it get all the hairs on my face. just gotta be careful it does get every where but that is what the neck protector is for to scrape off any exes wax on the applicator.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, the wax grabs every hair and has no residue like hard wax and was delivered quickly. I will be buying it again great overall!</li>
    <li> Terrible wax.... Check out cerapil instead!</li>
    <li> Yeah I thought was hard wax bcuz its color. Its a cream wax which is a soft wax for removing hairs thats thick, coarse and curly hair. Big mistake didnt read what its for. Ppl out there rating it a one start not a hard wax. There is others wax line called Cirepil. its a purple cream wax and its also a soft wax. Satin Smooth will say their wax pot is a hard wax on the label. THIS DELUXE CREAM POT WAX DIDNT SAY ITS A HARD WAX,</li>
    <li> Love this cream soft wax. Great use on legs, arms and backs. I have gotten a total of 20 wax services out of it and still have a little left. Feels great on guests skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate as much like other soft waxes do. Glides on perfectly and comes off easily! Highly recommend, met my expectations!</li>
    <li> Honestly I was hoping to use this product to do a brazilian along with my legs and underarms....hmmm what can I say? DISAPPOINTED! This wax says it works best on coarse hairs but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me. I waxed my fianc&amp;eacute;es back and found that it did do a good job there because his hairs were fine. Overall the wax didn&#x27;t do what it claimed and I ultimately ended up going with a hard wax (gigi brazilian)...which did a much better job! I will probably not buy this again as the only good thing about it was that it melted quickly.</li>
    <li> This wax is a cream wax &amp; when first trying it out it could be a little messy. After a couple applications it was easy to use. My clients have commented on it being less painful then honey wax. It works great on legs, bikini lines, underarms, as well as the face.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love that this wax is pink.  It makes it a lot easier to see where you&#x27;re applying it.  It&#x27;s also not as painful as other waxes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I&#x27;ve used this on my brows and under my arms successfully.  Some of the other reviewers complained that they couldn&#x27;t get it off of their skin or wherever they dropped it.  Using baby oil, I was able to remove all of the excess wax that I got on my fingers.  It worked better than the wax off product I have.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that when I went to open the jar, a TON of the wax was stuck to the lid.  It took me forever to get the lid off, and I tried to use one of the sticks to kind of scrape the excess wax back in the jar, but that was next to impossible.  Another minor complaint is that due to the texture of this wax, it&#x27;s hard to reuse the strips to remove it.  Others I can use the same side multiple times, but because of the creamy texture of this wax, I end up smearing more of it back on me.  However, these are minor problems for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t recommend this product. It is just waste of money. You are not able to make a thin layer with this plus it will darken your skin. Won&#x27;t believe me try it and regret it later on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tacky in a stretchy, chewing gum kinda way so that when you pull the strip off, it hardly ever comes away nice and clean. I require a harder wax consistency that isn&#x27;t literally &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34;; just something that will hold on to tough hairs better, like the honey wax (which is what I thought I ordered from Satin Smooth..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine, soft hairs, this is for you though!!</li>
    <li> I worked in a spa shop before and we use this cream wax to do face and body waxing all the time. it&#x27;s the best and most gentlest was that won&#x27;t ever hurt your skin. This quality is spa level so you don&#x27;t need to have any doubt on it. I want to say the store customer service is great. my package was lost due tu unknown reason, and when i called back the girl is very helpful and promptly solved my problem. i get my replacement package soon without any issue.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I have always used GiGi All Purpose Honee and had issues with my skin being reddened for a long time and zit-like bumps the day after I waxed. I was skeptical about the Satin Smooth Deluxe Cream Wax because it isn&#x27;t as hard as the GiGi waxes, but it is wonderful! It melts at a lower temp which means my skin isn&#x27;t red afterward and it leaves my skin feeling smooth! I&#x27;ve never had a wax leave my skin smooth, the GiGi always left some stickiness. I don&#x27;t know how this is possible, but I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all with this wax! I am seriously amazed and loving this wax. I do feel like this wax spreads out more than harder waxes when you put pressure on the strips, so be careful how close you apply it to areas you don&#x27;t want to wax!&lt;br /&gt;I have been waxing for 15 years and this is the best product I have ever used.  Sally Beauty Supply stores carry it for under $15.</li>
    <li> Great Deal, cost between 13 and 16 at stores</li>
    <li> It will remove the hair. No question about that. But it is SO sticky and messy, I&#x27;d just as soon opt out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been spending a small fortune each month in waxing services. I bought this product (Deluxe Cream Wax) along with the Gigi warmer to attempt my first at home wax. It is a little messy before you get the hang of it - but I&#x27;m assuming that all waxes are like that as well. I don&#x27;t if other waxes get completely hard in the container, but this does not. It has the consistency of taffy and it&#x27;s tacky (read: can be messy) even when you aren&#x27;t warming it.    To my delight the wax is pink, and there is no question if you missed a spot during application. I have coarse hair, and when I go to the salon very rarely do I get completely smooth results on my legs, the hairs tend to break and not come out fully. This wax grabbed the hairs very well and pulled the hairs out so effectively I could see in the intact hair bulb.     Like I said I used this wax for my FIRST at home wax and was able to wax my: legs, under arms and chin with my first application. I  finally worked up the courage to try my bikini area and did a full brazillian wax by myself.     This wax is a miracle worker - by fair less pain than what I&#x27;m used to in the waxing salon - it&#x27;s not pain-free - but it&#x27;s close as you can get when you are ripping hairs out of your body.  I used almond oil that I already had at home to clean up residue left on my skin and drips on the tile floor. It came off much easier than what I was expecting. Fairly easy clean up considering it is wax.    Fantastic product, don&#x27;t hesitate on this wax, just buy it!</li>
    <li> First off, this is NOT a hard wax! I read most of the 1 star reviews and 99% of them were people who were misusing the product (you NEED fabric strips to remove this wax). Also, as with all waxes, it is important to use either oil or baby powder on the skin before the wax is applied to protect your skin. With this particular was it works best with a thin layer of baby powder applied to the skin before the wax is applied to protect your skin.   I bought this at my state beauty supply for 16 dollars after the last wax I bought (gigi honee) literally ripped me open.. I&#x27;m certified in cosmetology and do this for a living and I&#x27;ve used many different types of wax and this is my favorite. Not only does it heat up very quickly but it pulls off very smoothly and literally leaves the skin feeling like satin no matter what part of body or stiffness of hair it is used on. I&#x27;m not sure how well this company ships since I haven&#x27;t bought it off of amazon but my experience with this wax has been nothing less than perfection.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried too many wax varieties, but this seems to do the job...bikini, underarm and legs.  Definitely prefer this over the Satin Smooth Honey.</li>
    <li> it s so profesionnel you can get perfect wax just at home don t need to go to salon again</li>
    <li> I have normal to hard hair and at times it takes me 2 strips at one place if the hair are not enough grown in length.&lt;br /&gt;But since I used this product, The hair perfectly gets removed in 1 single strip. Plus surprisingly the pain is just ignorable with this wax. A real great product</li>
    <li> This item is great. I have super sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate me at all. I was really surprised and very glad. Very worth while product.</li>
    <li> This is messy and not a hard wax; however the results are better than other waxes I&#x27;ve tried. I think it&#x27;s worth the potential mess and the more often you use it the more contained the mess seems to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing and this is the only type I&#x27;ve bought so far. It has worked well for me, well enough that I purchased a second jar instead of experimenting with others. I&#x27;ve only use it on my legs, and have had great results. It grabs on to my hair well. Very little wax residue is left behind, and what is left comes off easily enough with baby oil.</li>
    <li> Way messy and way to thick! Gave my friend a rash and was sooooo hard to wash off even with the wax remover! Used it twice and both times had a bad experience! Will never buy this junk again</li>
    <li> Works very well, but is messy and very sticky. Even pure Acetone couldn&#x27;t remove it. Then someone here told me to use Olive oil, and it worked. It has a bad smell and the fumes given by this wax feels chemical like and affects/irritates eyes. Had to do it in good ventilation and threw away the left over wax while it was still warm in a plastic bag. Crap!!</li>
    <li> pretty good.. Took off my fine arm hair and leg hair but stick to my skin a bit on my arm.. Couldn&#x27;t get it to remove underarm hair. This must be a talent but but Gigi bikini hard wax removed my underarm hair. Also this wax &amp; the Gigi both removed my bikini line hair.. Gigi works best though!  Ps, didn&#x27;t even get bumps;) yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aesthetician and I&#x27;m very happy with this wax. It goes on smooth and comes off easy. I love the bubble gum color too!</li>
    <li> I absoluy love this product. I have used different brands and kinds and find this one the least painful of them all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too familiar with home waxing.  I usually use the honey natural wax but that was more wasteful so I tried this one.  It&#x27;s a bit more messy but I could reapply the wax strip on another area and since my hair is fine it doesn&#x27;t waste as much product.</li>
    <li> Is better than the honey and the green one. it takes off the little hairs on my upper lip with ease. Best wax ever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok wax. The problem I have with it. Its that it&#x27;s very messy.  But the best part about it is that I did not have an allergic reaction to it.</li>
    <li> Been using this wax for 4 years and is great. I wax my facial hair sideburns, upper lip, under chin. and eye brows.</li>
    <li> Great product and got it in 2 days</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to everyone. This was was not too hard on my skin. Did not get too hot on my skin. Okay to use everywhere.</li>
