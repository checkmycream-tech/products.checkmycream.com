<li> skin is brightening up (terrible acne blemishes African American Woman).</li>
<li> The bottle itself is incredibly weird long and weird.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is very thick and the pump does not work well</li>

    <li> The product is a little thick for the pump dispenser.  It works beautifully and you do not get overwhelmed with the rather disappointing fragrance of neem.  Skin is clean and clear without being stripped.</li>
    <li> This smells really wonderful , foams up really well and face feels really nice after you wash! I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> The bottle that it comes in has the smallest most ridiculous nozzle where the products is supposed to come out of. The bottle itself is incredibly weird long and weird. The cleanser smells like plastic. One night of use and I don&#x27;t have any results to report back as of yet. I just hope the product works better than it looks and smells.</li>
    <li> its been two weeks since i have used this product and i am very satisfied with the results. I fell very fresh after washing my face with this.</li>
    <li> My wife like it. Period</li>
    <li> My pores haven&#x27;t been this clean in years! The spout is short which makes it difficult to get the product out but other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great. The pump does not work well, however</li>
    <li> This is a great face cleanser! My acne has cleared significantly. Also you don&#x27;t need much, so I could see this bottle lasting me about a year, seriously, a year.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin and decided to try this product out. I like that is has a thick consistency, and it surprised me that it lathered up fairly quickly and well. Unlike some other natural face washes, this one seems to be cleansing my face a bit better. I don&#x27;t have to go over with my toner more than once. I&#x27;m still testing it out, but so far no change in my break out, which sucks.</li>
    <li> Everyone was ranting and raving about this product so I was super excited to use it on my skin which is acne prone with a few scars. I finally get the wash and not only is the bottle I have expired but the pump sucks and the liquid is so ridiculously thick...I really don&#x27;t care for it at all which sucks cause I had such high expectations...</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients that are very good for skin - especially dry skin. I use a loofah for my face so that I feel really clean.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and this has helped a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and the pump does not work well but it is a wonderful product .</li>
    <li> Thick but very affective... skin is brightening up (terrible acne blemishes African American Woman). I have had it for a month now, not ONE break out since! Use 1-2 times daily</li>
    <li> Nice rich and creamy product. A little goes a long way. It is hard to pump for me as I have tired hands/fingers from work which strains the muscle required to pump the thick liquid up the pump tube. I bought this product to help heal hard to heal scratched opened wounds due to itchiness cause by allergies.</li>
    <li> Just received it and back it goes as the shelf life of product is 2 yrs from date of manufacture and the mfg date on the label is May 2013.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s funny is that the low-lifes who own this company tried concealing this date by putting a  label over it. They even screwed that up</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. I have used it for 2 weeks now and it makes my face clean and fresh. It has a nice scent but at the same time it is not very strong...</li>

    <li> Oh my gosh, this stuff in amazing!  Yes, it is hard to get out of the bottle due to its consistency, but I don&#x27;t care.  I just received my package a few days ago and my skin already looks amazing.  And the smell...wonderful!  In fact, I&#x27;m getting on here tonight to see what other products they offer.</li>
    <li> This is an okay cleanser....The pump is horrible though...only a teeny tiny bit of product comes out.</li>
