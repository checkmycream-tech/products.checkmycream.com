      <li>This is a good toothpaste for me in every way but the flavor.  </li>

      <li>Clean effect is very good.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This toothpaste seemed wonderful at first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was able to turn around a periodontal problem with two things: the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste series and my perfect special [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>After listening to that four times every year, I went looking for my own solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste has a nice minty flavor.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, some people report tooth staining with stannous fluoride products, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who didn&#x27;t have a good reason to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>Succinctly, this is an effective toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My periodontist was a nice guy and all</li>
      <li>It does have a very strong taste that my kids don&#x27;t care for</li>
      <li>The cheap toothpaste I had before this was just as good.</li>
      <li>This Crest is by far the best tasting paste I can remember using.</li>
      <li>It has a good taste and lasts pretty good after I brush.</li>
      <li>Well, in my opinion, it has a milder mint flavor, which is pleasant but not the face full of mint I&#x27;ve come to expect from toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection provides a nicely foaming toothpaste, that leaves my teeth feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that I still have a clean mouth after a good night sleep.</li>
      <li>Feels like a good clean after brushing.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is great as it provides benefits such as preventing cavities, gingivitis, helps with sensitivity and has a great taste.</li>
      <li>This had the most flavor--kind of like a very strong mint flavor.</li>
      <li>It may have been my imagination, since I was paying closer attention this time, but it seemed to foam up more than the others, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is my favorite Crest Pro-Health &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>If you like it and the dentist says its okay for you, then give it a try.</li>
      <li>another like this one better at gum protection.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with all of them including this product</li>
      <li>You cannot rollup the tube either, since it is made of a thicker plastic than many tubes.</li>
      <li>It has a wintergreen flavor which I haven&#x27;t had in toothpaste before, but I find enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>I use the most.  </li>
      <li>Would love it if they added whitener to this.</li>
      <li>so brushing is more appealing.</li>
      <li>Most of us see our dentist every 6mo at the most.</li>
      <li>teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done brushing</li>
      <li>Sadly my favorite Crest pro health morning and night toothpastes have not been readily available in my area</li>
      <li>It was really minty and tasted good.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel very smooth and clean after using it.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it was too strong for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product has a strong mint taste that is not disagreeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to make that kind of commitment to children and dogs but not a periodontist.  </li>
      <li>This was a great purchase on Amazon with a coupon, but the coupon only could be used once.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>you want a strong tasting toothpaste that is designed to prevent gingivitis - this would be for you; however if you prefer a more gentle toothpaste look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is the freshest and the best that I have tried so far, but it said it was a package of 2, instead I received only 1.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have all natural ingredients, but if that isn&#x27;t a concern then this is one of the best toothpastes you can get, especially when used in conjunction with [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>My teeth feel clean after using it.  </li>
      <li>Since gingivitis is caused by bacterial growth, what I use currently is more likely to be effective than this</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection toothpaste is a good product and one that I enjoy using, but not enough to go out of my way to find.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed when first using this product was that there was something in the paste, kind of like exfoliates in face cream.  </li>
      <li>That taste is also strangely similar to that paste, which is a pleasant clinical mint.  </li>
      <li>That is my one complaint with this otherwise wonderful toothpaste.</li>
      <li>have tried the Clean Mint, Fresh Clean Mint and Invigorating versions.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste has a mild mint taste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a mild minty flavor to it.</li>
      <li>forward many many years later</li>
      <li>The only methods to really evaluate this product effectively are taste (acceptable, without being overwhelming) and texture (not overly displeasing).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s aimed at fighting plaque and gingivitis, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed anything really unique or superior about this brand than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don&#x27;t need or want large</li>
      <li>But overall I don&#x27;t think its anything amazing.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive teeth, get this stuff, you will love it.</li>
      <li>This toothpast is my favorite one so far.</li>
      <li>but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>my mouth feeling fresh; my teeth scrubbed</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that my teeth were more sensitive in using this, so perhaps it is living up to its claims.</li>
      <li>But it does taste minty and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>I prefer the Crest Complete with Scope Outlast, which keeps my breath fresh longer, but this milder mint would be better if I was brushing before a meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have problems with gingivitis or tooth sensitivity, Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health line might be worth a try.  </li>
      <li>The Pro-Health products use stannous fluoride instead of the more common (and cheaper) sodium fluoride, and from what I&#x27;ve read, there are some studies that indicate that stannous flouride may be more effective on gingivitis or sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perhaps too effective since when I leave it in my mouth too long</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little stronger than the others and the taste is better - more like a paste than the others, but somewhere in between a paste and a gel.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonder that something this strong says it is for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one, but I didn&#x27;t really care for it as it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
      <li>It works better than regular tooth paste.</li>
      <li>It does make the claim that it will help reverse gingivitis in four weeks, but regular brushing and flossing should accomplish that with most any</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, we really like this line of toothpaste!</li>
      <li>The product has really improved my gum health!  </li>
      <li>you plan to use this, take it to your dentist first and see what they think.</li>
      <li>After I am done with this tube, I will probably try a different product that does all those things but tastes better and does not have any flakes in it.</li>
      <li>being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this toothpaste very much--it provides a fresh feeling, even the next morning. I would recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> But not so great taste. Oh well, you can&#x27;t have it all. I buy this regularly, but it does not whiten. Would love it if they added whitener to this.</li>
    <li> They stopped selling this item in my area. It is my favorite Crest Pro-Health &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;. I have had excellent results at the dentist ever since I started using this gum protection line.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my local grocery store. My mouth felt very dry the first time I used it. Then I noticed skin inside my mouth began to peel off. I did a quick research online and realized that it is a common problem. I can&#x27;t believe with all the people who had problems with this product, it is still being sold without any warnings. I am definitely not going try any other Crest products.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my grocery store, but I do review on amazon often. This toothpaste seemed wonderful at first. It was really minty and tasted good. But almost ten minuted after using it, I went to open my mouth and it literally was stringy. It was disgusting and literally sickening. I had to brush my teeth again with a discount toothpaste my parents got. And then eat carrots for another twenty minutes because I couldn&#x27;t stand without something moving in myiuth because the goo would come back. Never buying again, I&#x27;d rather go without brushing than go through that ordeal again. Nasty.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is great. Will buy elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great as it provides benefits such as preventing cavities, gingivitis, helps with sensitivity and has a great taste. I personally prefer gels (like the Listerine one) than pastes, but this one is not as thick as other pastes so I have stuck using it for quite some time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since toothpaste is one of these products that you&#x27;ll have to use daily, then I suggest you consider using Amazon Subscribe and Save and have it delivered automatically to save extra.</li>
    <li> not so good value for money as I later found the same product at a much cheaper price</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I use, leaves your mouth with a cleaner feeling than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The inner part of my mouth had skins coming out in white creamy form as a result of this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product everything and more it advertises.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This was a great purchase on Amazon with a coupon, but the coupon only could be used once. I wish Amazon could offer repeated use of coupons for this great toothpaste. Clean effect is very good.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the good reviews I read. After using it for 2 weeks. I have to say its pretty average. Its just like any other tooth paste. It has a good taste and lasts pretty good after I brush. Feels like a good clean after brushing. But overall I don&#x27;t think its anything amazing. The cheap toothpaste I had before this was just as good. I&#x27;ll give it four stars just because well I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
    <li> An excellent toothpaste, originally recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from periodontal disease, I am a little familiar with products designed to help cut plaque and reduced the incidence of gingivitis. My dentist has his list of preferred toothpastes, and I have tried a number of them. This is not on his list and I can see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is stannous fluoride. Many toothpastes have this as an active ingredient, so it comes up pretty standard there. In fact, the toothpaste I use regularly has both fluoride and an active antibacterial agent. Since gingivitis is caused by bacterial growth, what I use currently is more likely to be effective than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t mention there is grit in the paste as a whitening agent. When I first started to brush for the first time I thought I had put the wrong material on my brush. It felt like there was sand in the toothpaste. The grit acts as a whitening agent, but if you ask any dentist, they will tell you to stay far away from it because it scours the enamel on the teeth. And, enamel is not replaceable....once it is gone it is gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a strong mint taste that is not disagreeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to use this, take it to your dentist first and see what they think. If you like it and the dentist says its okay for you, then give it a try. Both my periodontist and my regular dentists said they wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone due to the grit.</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands and kinds of toothpaste in the past but I have never been left with such a fresh and clean feeling for so long after brushing me teeth. It does have a very strong taste that my kids don&#x27;t care for but it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband or I. I have not noticed any change as far as staining goes but even if that perk of the toothpaste wasn&#x27;t there I would still be buying this again. Love it!</li>
    <li> This toothpast is my favorite one so far. It is great at reducing tooth sensitivity, it has a very handy snap on and off cap. It also seems to whiten well, and makes my teeth feel clean, but not a strong peppermint that can sometimes feel too strong. This toothpaste has a mild mint taste. Since using it, eating ice cream no longer hurts my teeth. If you have sensitive teeth, get this stuff, you will love it. Even if you don&#x27;t have sensitivity, you will still like it because it is a great all around toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have tried three Crest Pro-health toothpastes. I am pleased with all of them including this product and I like the taste and how they make my mouth feel after brushing (though I liked this this the least of the three) but I am troubled by information on each box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used. I gave all four stars because they seem to work well but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using them. Further the information is listed on each box under an \\&quot;Other information\\&quot; section rather than a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; section but what I read seems like a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boxes state under \\&quot;Other information\\&quot;  that \\&quot;products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of teeth.\\&quot; The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.  The boxes then state \\&quot;this Crest is especially formulated to help prevent staining.\\&quot;  This troubles me. I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride and I will be talking to my dentist about this product when I see him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web. I know nothing about fluoride. I assumed before I tried this that all toothpaste was the same so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the ingredients on all three boxes and they seem to be the same so I am not sure what makes one better at whitening and another like this one better at gum protection. The box does say this has been clinically proven to remove gingivitis in four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Clean Mint, Fresh Clean Mint and Invigorating versions. This had the most flavor--kind of like a very strong mint flavor. The flavor lasted longer in my mouth than the other two and I found this more harsh than the other two. It is my least favorite of the three but flavor is a matter of taste so if you like stronger tasting tooth paste you probably would like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was not for the information I referenced above and how it was listed on the box I would give this five stars.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when first using this product was that there was something in the paste, kind of like exfoliates in face cream.  I am not sure if this is as good idea for your teeth as it is for your skin (that is a question for your doctor) but I do find it a bit strange.  The next thing I noticed was the taste, it taste like old timey toothpaste that did not really have any flavor, it just tasted just like, well, paste.  This has a small hint of mint and it does linger for a while leaving almost a burning sensation to my lips.  On the plus side it does claims to fight cavities, harmful plaque, tarter, bad breath, while helping to reverse gingivitis, builds increasing protection against painful sensitivity (I am very sensitive to cold water in certain areas but did not notice any difference after a week of use), and whitens teeth.  After I am done with this tube, I will probably try a different product that does all those things but tastes better and does not have any flakes in it.</li>
    <li> My periodontist was a nice guy and all but I never liked it when he said we would be together forever.  I&#x27;m willing to make that kind of commitment to children and dogs but not a periodontist.  After listening to that four times every year, I went looking for my own solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to turn around a periodontal problem with two things: the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste series and my perfect special [[ASIN:B00A35Q0AQ Philips Sonicare(R) FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]].  Sadly my favorite Crest pro health morning and night toothpastes have not been readily available in my area so I&#x27;ve been experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The invigorating mint has a good flavor to it.  I&#x27;ve put it in the morning slot.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with gingivitis or tooth sensitivity, Crest&#x27;s Pro-Health line might be worth a try.  The Pro-Health products use stannous fluoride instead of the more common (and cheaper) sodium fluoride, and from what I&#x27;ve read, there are some studies that indicate that stannous flouride may be more effective on gingivitis or sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you DON&#x27;T have any special needs, this may not be worth the extra expense.  What&#x27;s more, some people report tooth staining with stannous fluoride products, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who didn&#x27;t have a good reason to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it differ from other toothpastes in the Pro-Health line?  Well, in my opinion, it has a milder mint flavor, which is pleasant but not the face full of mint I&#x27;ve come to expect from toothpaste.  (Which is odd, because some of the other reviewers find the taste unusually strong).  It also is advertised as providing \\&quot;clinical gum protection,\\&quot; but I am not sure how it differs from any other product with the same active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like the flavor, and I would recommend that people with particular gingivitis or sensitivity concerns give this toothpaste a try.</li>
    <li> I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you&#x27;re rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I&#x27;m getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I&#x27;m miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that&#x27;s just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don&#x27;t think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I&#x27;ve permanently damaged my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awful, awful products.  Research them, and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes like spearmint, and leaves a refreshing taste in your mouth for about a half an hour or so after you use it.  It is a gritty toothpaste, but not so gritty that it feels like you are brushing with sand.  My teeth feel clean after using it.  I don&#x27;t know if it can reverse gingivitis, as I&#x27;m not sure that any toothpaste has the power to do that.  I will see what my dentist says at my next appointment in June.  I usually use Sensodyne, because my teeth are really sensitive.  This toothpaste claims to help with that as well.  I didn&#x27;t notice that my teeth were more sensitive in using this, so perhaps it is living up to its claims.</li>
    <li> I was always jealous of my cousin, Tony. Her mother bought crest. My mom made us use pepsodent. I can remember how wonderful crest tasted. Tony and I used to sneak into the bathroom at her house, squeeze the crest onto our fingers, and eat it! Like a treat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward many many years later and I decided to give crest a try. The idea of actively removing gingivitis made the product all that much more appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering and receiving the crest pro-health I noticed, while reading the label, a warning that it had an ingredient that could cause staining. I researched Pro-health and staining and decided not to eat the crest anymore! Brown teeth! Stains that need removing professionally by a dentist. The reports of stringy mouth goo and tongue numbing. Now I know you can&#x27;t believe everything on the internet.. but there is a lot of scary anecdotal evidence out there, and a lot of alternative products that don&#x27;t use the staining fluoride found in the crest. Personally I don&#x27;t choose to take the chance and find out. This is a pass for me.</li>
    <li> The active ingredient in this toothpaste is Stannous Floride.  The same as regular Crest, so the only reason to purchase this paste versus regular ole Crest is because of the minty freshness.  I found that it was much stronger than Crest&#x27;s regular minty taste.  In fact, it was too strong for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left my mouth feeling fresh; my teeth scrubbed clean.&lt;br /&gt;(note: there&#x27;s a warning not to use it longer than 2 weeks with out dentist approval.  A puzzle that.)</li>
    <li> More than one dental hygienist have told me that toothpastes have very little effect on your teeth and gums. It&#x27;s mostly the mechanical action of brushing to remove loose plaques which does the job. Flouride seems to work though to avert cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Crest Pro-Health toothpaste makes lots of claims for health but I suspect they would not stand up in a rigorous test. Some whiteners actually cause gum tenderness, this has happened to me and my hygienist reports that this is common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all like toothpaste though because it feels good in the mouth and \\&quot;freshens the breath\\&quot;. This Crest is by far the best tasting paste I can remember using. But when it is used up I&#x27;ll go back to generic with fluoride.</li>
    <li> I never had any problems with Crest toothpaste. It feel it cleans my mouth wonderfully. At times the toothpaste was a little grainy, but overall it had a good taste and left my mouth feeling clean. I would buy.</li>
    <li> The product has really improved my gum health!  I appreciate that I still have a clean mouth after a good night sleep.</li>
    <li> In some sense, toothpaste is toothpaste, and you can only do so many different things with it. While I haven&#x27;t noticed any great increase in my oral health, I haven&#x27;t noticed a great decline either. The only methods to really evaluate this product effectively are taste (acceptable, without being overwhelming) and texture (not overly displeasing). I will probably keep buying until and/or unless I find something less expensive with similar stated benefits.</li>
    <li> Succinctly, this is an effective toothpaste. Perhaps too effective since when I leave it in my mouth too long I tend to get things that feel like dead skin that may have been scoured off my cheeks or tongue. That is my one complaint with this otherwise wonderful toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t have all natural ingredients, but if that isn&#x27;t a concern then this is one of the best toothpastes you can get, especially when used in conjunction with [[ASIN:B000NKJIXM Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse]]. The combination of these two products provides a wonderful clean for your teeth and mouth. Highly recommended, but use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to review this toothpaste based on it&#x27;s clinical claims. Most of us see our dentist every 6mo at the most. The packaging states that it reverses gingivitis in 2 weeks, but how would you know other than a general sense that your gums are bleeding less and less inflamed? Still, I like the toothpaste and my family prefers the taste to any of the other gel toothpastes I have purchased recently. I&#x27;m guessing that the toothpaste itself makes less of a difference in gum disease than diligent and careful brushing, flossing and irrigating, but it can&#x27;t hurt to have a toothpaste that has a pleasant, mild taste so brushing is more appealing.</li>
    <li> My dentist says that its not the toothpaste but the act of brushing that cleans teeth. But the ingredients can have a beneficial effect. This toothpaste tries to cover everything that can go wrong. Good for Crest. This is the thickest toothpaste I have ever used. I think it has been helpful for my gums although I regularly brush my gums vertically to toughen them so they don&#x27;t bleed from my flossing. It is harder to use up the last of the toothpaste because the nozzle is fairly hard to compress.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The fact that it caters to the health of your gums is plus and my family likes too.</li>
    <li> Good buy and great product</li>
    <li> I should start by saying that this \\&quot;Gum Protection\\&quot; toothpaste has the same active ingredient (.454% stannuous fluoride) as other Crest Pro Health toothpaste.  I am not sure what makes it particularly good for the gums.  With that said, I like the texture of this version, which is very thick and a bit gritty, similar to the fluoride paste used by my dentist.  That taste is also strangely similar to that paste, which is a pleasant clinical mint.  I prefer the Crest Complete with Scope Outlast, which keeps my breath fresh longer, but this milder mint would be better if I was brushing before a meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection toothpaste is a good product and one that I enjoy using, but not enough to go out of my way to find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a couple of these Crest Pro-Health Clinical Series toothpastes lately, and this is my favorite so far.  It&#x27;s a little stronger than the others and the taste is better - more like a paste than the others, but somewhere in between a paste and a gel.  Afterward, there is a slight aftertaste as though you just washed with Hydrogen Peroxide.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s in the ingredient list, but something similar is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price note:  If you didn&#x27;t notice, these \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; toothpastes usually come in 6 oz. tubes instead of the common 8 oz. size.  This one is different as it is 5.8 oz.  Just food for thought.</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection provides a nicely foaming toothpaste, that leaves my teeth feeling very clean. The flavor is that signature Crest flavor that all their other toothpastes [that I have tried] have - it reminds me of those \\&quot;Smarties\\&quot; candies commonly passed out on Halloween, that come in a little cellophane wrap in the shape of a roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to not only prevent gingivitis, but also to help reverse gingivitis in four weeks; I am unable to confirm this claim, but I would not want gingivitis in either forward or reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only warning this toothpaste comes with is to not use it for sensitivity for longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist. Its active ingredient is 0.454% stannous flouride, which may surface staining; fortunately, this can be removed by a dentist.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is the freshest and the best that I have tried so far, but it said it was a package of 2, instead I received only 1.</li>
    <li> This is a toothpaste with a lot of claims, but the one I was hoping for was helping with sensitivity.  Perhaps, but even on the tube it says \\&quot;Do not use for sensitivity longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist.\\&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t say like my Sensodyne to see the dentist if the problem persists for four weeks.  Nonetheless, my dentist has handed me out samples of Crest and the toothpaste has proven to be a good one.  Just don&#x27;t count on it being another Sensodyne because it just plain isn&#x27;t.  The active antihypersensitivity ingredient, potassium nitrate, isn&#x27;t listed.  It does make the claim that it will help reverse gingivitis in four weeks, but regular brushing and flossing should accomplish that with most any toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one, but I didn&#x27;t really care for it as it&#x27;s strong.  It&#x27;s a quite a bit heavier mint taste than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest.  If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off.  I do appreciate products that aren&#x27;t set to expire a month after purchase.  Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don&#x27;t need or want large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights cavities&lt;br /&gt;~  Whitens teeth&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights gingivitis&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights tartar&lt;br /&gt;~  Freshens breath&lt;br /&gt;~  Fights plaque&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stannous fluoride 0.454% (0.16 w/v fluoride ion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin, hydrated silica, sodium hexametaphosphate, proplene glycol, PEG-6, water, zinc lactate, flavor, trisodium phosphate, sodium gluconate, sodium lauryl sulfate, carrageenan, sodium saccharin, stannous chloride,  xanthan gum, polyethylene, titanium dioxide, blue 1 lake</li>
    <li> I ordered this Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Invigorating Clean Mint toothpaste as I had recently purchased the same \\&quot;flavor/type\\&quot; mouthwash that matches it.  The taste isn&#x27;t bad and combining the two makes my mouth feel clean.  If memory serves me correctly, it will take longer than 30 days for any health-related changes to take place with my teeth and gums.  In that case, I will need to add to my review at a later time.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste.  I sometimes don&#x27;t like toothpaste flavors but the taste of this one is great.  It leaves my mouth and gums tingling and feeling refreshed.  My teeth feel very smooth and clean after using it.  I have noticed my gums are looking better after using this for the last month; they are less red and I have no more bleeding when I brush.  I definitely recommend this toothpaste for improving and maintaining your gum health!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a nice minty flavor. It cleanses well and does not irritate my mouth or gums. I like that this toothpaste helps relieve and helps prevent gingivitis because that is sometimes a problem for me. I have not had any flare ups of my gingivitis while using this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is recommended to me by my dentist. It works better than regular tooth paste. My gum has improved</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s aimed at fighting plaque and gingivitis, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed anything really unique or superior about this brand than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried. But it does taste minty and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> This Crest toothpaste is probably the strongest mint toothpaste I have ever used. It is a wonder that something this strong says it is for sensitive teeth. I do have one tooth that is sensitive and this did not bother it. The strength of the mint lingered for a long time, much like a strong mouthwash does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint against this is that it is so hard to squeeze out of the tube. It does have a flat cap which means you can stand it up rather than having it lie flat on your shelf taking up so much room. One would think that that would allow the toothpaste to move towards the opening, but it does not. You cannot rollup the tube either, since it is made of a thicker plastic than many tubes. You just wind up having to press it flat in order to empty the contents as it gets lower.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a strong tasting toothpaste that is designed to prevent gingivitis - this would be for you; however if you prefer a more gentle toothpaste look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothpaste for me in every way but the flavor.  My teeth can sometimes be sensitive so I appreciate that aspect and we all want help against cavities, gingivitis, plaque and tartar. When you add in that it has ingredients for whitening and freshening breath, it has pretty much everything an adult wants toothpaste to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is stannous fluoride 0.45% (0.16% w/v fluoride ion) compared to the sodium fluoride used in the Colgate toothpaste I use the most.  There is a warning on the package that stannous fluoride might cause staining.  Crest has the following Q&amp;A on its website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Why does Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste have a warning about staining?&lt;br /&gt; Current FDA regulations require that toothpastes containing stannous fluoride be labeled about their staining potential. But Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste, with our Polyfluorite System(tm), contains a high-cleaning silica and sodium hexametaphosphate, a unique whitening ingredient, to remove and help prevent external stains. This toothpaste has been accepted by the ADA for its whitening benefit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel very clean when I&#x27;m done brushing and I assume Crest has clinical trials that support its claim to help reverse gingivitis in 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the tube they used.  This one stands on the large cap end so it takes up less room on my bathroom counter than the typical tube of toothpaste that lies flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after all that, it comes down to the taste for me.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because the mint (sort of wintergreen) is too strong for me or if there is a slight amount of bitter ingredient but this toothpaste leaves me with a strong taste on the tip of my tongue that is slightly unpleasant.  Taste is such a personal thing that if you are used to the taste of Crest toothpaste, I think you will wonder what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It leaves my mouth feeling tingly clean and freshens my breath for longer than my last toothpaste. It has a wintergreen flavor which I haven&#x27;t had in toothpaste before, but I find enjoyable.  It looks like it has slightly whitened my teeth since using it for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to help prevent tartar, gingivitis,  plaque, sensitivity, whitens, and freshens breath.  I like that in addition to the  freshening my mouth it also has all these dental health aids.  Excellent product offered at a good price through Amazon.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro Health toothpaste for a couple of years now, but this is the first time we&#x27;ve used this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild minty flavor to it. It seemed to make my mouth feel cooler afterwards more so than the other kinds we&#x27;ve used. It may have been my imagination, since I was paying closer attention this time, but it seemed to foam up more than the others, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we really like this line of toothpaste! We like the taste and our mouth feels cleaner than when we&#x27;ve used other kinds.</li>
