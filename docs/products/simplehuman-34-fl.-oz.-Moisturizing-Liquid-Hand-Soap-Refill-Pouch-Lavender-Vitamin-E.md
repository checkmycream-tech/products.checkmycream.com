<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells wonderful and my hands feel great after using this.  It reminds me hand wash used in High End Rest Rooms.  I use it in a 1-3 ratio with water for a small foaming dispenser in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I really love the moisturizing liquid hand soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a nice scent that doesn&#x27;t linger and is fairly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my wife and I first switched to it it did dry out our knuckles for about a week as our hands adjusted to the new pH or whatever it was causing by constant use. After a few days of dried out knuckles we still use it all the time and are doing fine.</li>
    <li> Using soap OTHER than simplehuman soap in a simplehuman soap dispenser appears to be too thick and wears the mechanism faster. So, I decided to buy the simplehuman soap in bulk and have found that the soap is better quality-- less is more!</li>
    <li> This is a thin soap made for the Simple Human sensor soap dispensers. It is gentle on my hands, and a little seems to work.  I&#x27;m sure it would work on others kinds of dispensers.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this soap and the dispenser.  It is just the right amount to keep your hands clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> You may think this is expensive but since you only need a small amount AND you don&#x27;t need a separate hand lotion since this formula is so moisturizing, it really is a bargain.  Love my hands-free Simple Human soap dispenser with this soap.</li>
    <li> I can never find this in stores. . . instead, I find stickers on the shelves where the product is supposed to be. It is far more convenient to order this through Amazon.com than to try to find it on foot! And, it&#x27;s easy on skin because it has moisturizing features, and it&#x27;s refreshing because of a wonderful lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this soap!  Nice smell and is not harsh on your skin.</li>
    <li> It came today Dec 12.  It was a refill for my Simple Human soap dispenser.  It is nice on the hands and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I used a soap I get from Trader Joes but it too thick for this dispenser and did not save me money, so why not order the one made for the dispenser?  Perfect, smells great, affordable, and great from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Simplehuman hand soap refill Pouch for over 2 years since I bought the Simplehuman soap dispenser, and the Lavender Plus Vitamin especially... I wish Simplehuman has variety of perfumes not only 3...&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best soap we&#x27;ve been using so far</li>
    <li> Best part about this soap is how well it works with the automatic dispensers it is designed for. I have several friends who bought the dispensers and decided to use their own soap and they have nothing but problems. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few months but the viscosity of this soap gives no indication that it will gum up the works any time soon. It&#x27;s hard to find the antibacterial soap that has a green logo on it so I have this scent and since I only smell it while washing my hands, I&#x27;m not bothered by it much.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell of this soap.  i like the ease of use of the simple human sensor pump soap dispenser.  Works out well for us.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome!  Very rich soap.  I have the dispenser set to low (only letting a little out), as just a little dab&#x27;ll do ya.  Granted, it&#x27;s the ONLY kind of soap that works well in this Simplehuman dispenser but at least it&#x27;s high-quality stuff.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, the color, the way it feels on my hands when I wash.  I will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> The branded soap is the best to use on the sensor pumps, to prevent clogging. This particular one has a great smell that isn&#x27;t too strong, and moisturizes as well.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> The smell and consistancy of this product makes it my favorite hand soap. It smells like authentic lavendar. I like the ease of the packaging for refilling my soap dispenser.</li>
    <li> Bought this to be used in my Simple Human automatic soap dispenser.  Hasn&#x27;t caused any clogs yet, smells pleasant and is just the right consistency where it washes off relatively easily while still feeling like you actually cleaned your hands.  This one refill will probably last me the entire year of use due to the enforced small soap usage from the automated dispenser.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product because achievement fulfill all that was needed.&lt;br /&gt;Fulfilled with my expectations completely.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider buying again.</li>
    <li> The liquid soap is ok.  The scent is barely there.  The soap doesn&#x27;t lather much.&lt;br /&gt;And doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feel soft.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this soap for over a year now, and I have zero complaints about it.  Smells great and leaves my hands feeling soft.  Even after several washes in a day, your hands are still feeling nice and soft which is a major plus for me since I wash my hands several times a day.  It&#x27;s also easy to refill your soap dispenser.  the screw off cap comes off easily and then there is a little spout that you just stick inside your container and then squeeze.  Super simple.</li>
    <li> Great product! Cleans well and keeps my hands soft and moisturized. Easy to pour mess free packaging. Definitely recommend. I plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> The lavender scent is really nice--not too fragrant. This goes really well with my simple human soap dispenser.</li>
    <li> We love the scent of this soap. This soap is so gentle on your hands. The bag has a great screw on top that makes it very easy to open and close. Makes refilling the dispenser so easy.</li>
    <li> This soap is not drying to your hands and has a very nice fragrance</li>
    <li> I thought the Simple Human refil was too expensive until I purchased a big jug of some substantially cheaper product. I found the cheaper replacment was watered down and required much more soap (we had to adjust the dispenser to pump more out) to wash your hands properly. We finally ordered this when the cheap stuff ran out and have been satisified. Oh, and my wife loves the aroma!</li>
    <li> We bought the Simple Human Automatic Soap Dispenser for the kitchen (I have a horror of chicken juice being transferred to soap pumps while cooking), and so far this has worked very well. It does not clog the dispenser, and while it is a bit more expensive than the big liquid soap refill I buy for the other manual dispensers in my home, it isn&#x27;t too bad if you go with the subscribe and save option. One refill pouch lasts us two months (only in the one pump in the kitchen though). I like the packaging - a little more eco-friendly than big plastic bottles. Would the regular liquid soap work in the dispenser? I don&#x27;t know - it is a little thicker than this soap, and I don&#x27;t want to run the risk of clogging my rather pricey automatic dispenser. Also has a decent moisturizing effect. The smell of lavender is a bit strong, but not unpleasant. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love the simple human products. The sensors keep hands from touching dirty objects around my house. The lavender soap smells great and is the perfect consistency for my dispenser. You have to try to mix other soaps with water and it makes a big mess and the soaps do not smell well anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap along with the automatic dispenser a few months ago. The dispenser once you get it adjusted to your liking is really nice to have in the kitchen when your are cooking and need to constantly wash your hands, hand free makes it so easy. The soap is a bit more expensive than your &amp;#34;Walmart&amp;#34; jug of soap, but it is so much better in quality, thick, cleans great and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> wonderful scent, not too overpowering and easy to use pouch.&lt;br /&gt;Love the simple human products. Gentle on your hands also.</li>
    <li> Good price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great value and a beautiful fresh scent!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s what you wash your hands with.  this stuff works just fine to wash hands, and other stuff.  kitchen, bath, basement.  you can wash your hands anywhere that has a source of water with this soap.</li>
    <li> Love our Simple Human soap dispensers. I only use their soap because I dont want to risk messing them up.</li>
    <li> Second one I&#x27;ve ordered. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> The only thing to use in the dispenser</li>
    <li> I have 2 simple human soap dispensers..... I can&#x27;t find this now on amazon- the smell is wonderful -  I have tried using other soap in the sensor dispenser and it just didn&#x27;t work as well.  please amazon bring it back</li>
    <li> Five stars more for the dispenser than the soap. Total luxury and probably a waste of money but I love mine. Guest at our house comment often. Screw on top make for no mess pouring into dispenser.</li>
    <li> This is the soap that comes with the simplehuman soap dispensers.  The texture is just right and the fragrance is nice and not too strong.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands when used often.  I would recommend it, especially to refill simplehuman soap dispensers.  It seems very economical to me if you are an Amazon Prime member and can get it with free shipping.</li>
    <li> We love this product and our clients love it too. The scent is a lovely lavender scent without being too strong and overpowering. The soap suds well and removes the massage oil from our hands and forearms without drying out our skin. And bonus, no one seems to be allergic to it!</li>
    <li> Great, will order again.</li>
    <li> Hey, I like almost everything about this product. Yes, the price is a little higher than normal hand-soap, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great with my SimpleHuman automatic dispensers. The &amp;#34;no clogging&amp;#34; claim they make is true.&lt;br /&gt;Love the packaging, and I wish more products were packaged in this manner, saving our landfills from senseless waste.&lt;br /&gt;Not an overpowering smell, but a light lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of soap in here! The pouch lasts quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish it lathered up a little bit more, but otherwise a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is the only liquid soap to use and it smells great and so refreshing. It is so convenient to have it sent to me every 6 months without incurring shipping fees.</li>
    <li> There is a price mess up here but I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star just for the awesomeness of the soap</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I like it better even than the Method soap from places like Target and Home Depot!  This stuff feels and smells great, and the add on is a nice deal.</li>
    <li> I like that this is creamy and I love the scent. I have used the gels and they clog and get thicker in the winter and don&#x27;t dispense very well.</li>
    <li> Just as expected - works fine in the simple human motion sensing soap pumps.  Not too strong of a smell.</li>
    <li> Like all Simple Human products, this is the right refill for not only the Simple Human soap dispensers, but for any dispenser where the soap cannot be too thick.</li>
    <li> The best soap, just the price too high</li>
    <li> Love the soap and dispenser but the refill pouches are expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smell is a perfect combination of &#x27;Doctor&#x27;s Office Sanitation&#x27; &amp; &#x27;Floral Scent&#x27;. It&#x27;s scent gives me a clean and sanitized feeling in my mind. I like how well it lathers and it&#x27;s consistency.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the consistency!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this locally, so thanks Amazon!!! Love the product, works great in self dispensing soap dispensers.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing, feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out.  it&#x27;s January right now and I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 months.  It lasts forever (we have it set to dispense about a dime size) and it never dries out my hands.  I use it 4-6 times while I&#x27;m making dinner some times (handing raw meats) and everything else dries my hands out.  It&#x27;s a gentle smell.  I don&#x27;t do well with over powering things or things that want to compete with my perfume (like bath and body works).  the smell is there but it&#x27;s not going to be noticed before you are.</li>
    <li> This soap smells terrible! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Love my Simple Human soap dispenser and I like the refill pouches. I am not a fan of the &amp;#34;anti-bacterial&amp;#34; refill, so like to have this option.</li>
    <li> Love the soap, but $6.99 everywhere else!  Amazon, are you hiking the prices on prime items to cover shipping?  Seems that way recently.</li>
    <li> Does the job real well. We are glad we bought this system. It is easy to use. We use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Smells good, rinses off easily, priced fine. We will buy this again once ours run out.</li>
    <li> Gooding cleaning power and easy to use</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Purchased the 3 pack with my $5 coupon they sent.</li>
    <li> It is a refill to the soap dispenser.  It has a great smell and texture on your hands.  And the soap dispenses really well.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with the SimpleHuman auto-dispenser pump.  Just the right consistency, not too thick and not watery.  A light lavender scent but not overpowering.  Great product and nice large amount - good for several refills.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way.  this soap is awesome.  This bag lasts a year</li>
    <li> I was getting ready to purchase a generic hand soap refill when my family objected.  They said the liked this product and did not want me to substitute.  The soap cleaned well, was not hard on the skin and has a pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> nice mild scent and rich lather, good to the hands that are washed 15 times a day! Very easy to dispense into unit.</li>
    <li> This hand soap feels good, works well, smells wonderful and works perfectly in an automatic soap dispenser. High quality in every way, and I love the packaging that takes up less landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly sensitive to flower smells (allergic) and wondered how I would do with this lavender soap that came with my SimpleHuman automatic soap dispenser. It&#x27;s so gentle and it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies a bit. I was amazed! Therefore, I bought a bunch more! yea -- a good-smelling soap that my sensitive system can handle. ;)</li>
    <li> I bought two of the simplehuman soap dispensers and really like them.  Figured I might as well get the right soap to use in them.  Didn&#x27;t want to mess up the dispenser by trying out store bought stuff.  Price for simplehuman soap was reasonable, does a nice job, comes in a nice resealable bag.  Very pleased.  Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love that this is a no mess, easy pour container and that the soap is gentle with no harsh chemicals. It  also creates major bubbles in a jacuzzi tub. I only wish the soap came in a clear or amber color instead of the lavender.</li>
    <li> I like the convenience of this hand soap and machine, but I do not like the smell of this soap. It does keep the bathroom clearer, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with messy soap bars etc., but the machine uses a lot of soap and I am not sure if the cost of the machine and the soap out ways the use of a hand pump soap container. I am not sure if I will buy again. I will have to think about it.</li>
    <li> This is a great choice for folks like me who do not want to constantly replace bottles of liquid soap but instead refill them. Sure, you can buy large bottles and pour the contents into your smaller bottles, but there&#x27;s always some leftover soap in the large bottle. This product is cleverly designed as a squeeze pouch to enable you easily to transfer all the contents—and it&#x27;s better for the environment as well. Tip: The cap may be hard to turn the first time; use pliers if necessary.</li>
    <li> Some of this refill soap came with the Simple Human sensor pump dispenser. When it ran out and I refilled it with the liquid refill soap I had before, everyone in the house complined and wanted the other soap again! So I bought a number of refills to have on hand so there will be peace in the house again! The soap is nice with a great scent and moisturizing feel to it.</li>
    <li> The liquid is not too thick for using my simple human sensor pump. It is a great product I will continue to buy for extra stock up.</li>
    <li> It came with Simplehuman&#x27;s small sensor dispenser as a sample.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer unscented products but this is very mild scent, which does not bother me at all. Simplehuman also has unscented soap but without moisturizer. So I decided to buy this ones. It is out of stock now so I hope they will be delivered before the sample runs out.</li>
    <li> it was leaking. smell good. packing not good.</li>
    <li> The soap is good, the sent isn&#x27;t as appealing as I would have hoped. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like any lavender I have been around.</li>
    <li> We have the Simple Human sensor soap dispenser (the large one...about 13oz) and this soap came with it as a sample.  It is honestly the best smelling soap I have smelled, and it is the best lavender smelling soap I have smelled.  I saw that Soft Soap (what we used to buy) sold a lavender soap and at a better price, so I tried those.  The Soft Soap lavender liquid soap is thicker and doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the Simple Human soap.  In fact, the Soft Soap smelled &amp;#34;soapy,&amp;#34; instead of like lavender.  The Simple Human liquid lavender soap has a nice consistency (less thick) and it smells unbelievable.  I actually couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hands to smell this stuff again!  We ended up buying several more of the Simple Human lavender soap refills and we also purchased a couple more of the Simple Human sensor soap dispensers since the first one has been working out great.</li>
    <li> Very pleasing smell - gentle hand soap.  Works well in Simple Human Dispenser. I like that it comes in convenient container for filling the Simple Human Dispenser.</li>
    <li> Great soap, great smell.</li>
    <li> The Simplehuman lavender hand soap is excellent. I use this soap in Simplehuman dispensers. It takes very little soap to generate a rich lather and the soap rinses off easily. I like the subtle lavender smell. The packaging is outstanding, the screw cap seals tightly. It is easy to fill a soap dispenser. The pouch itself is just the right thickness to easily get all the soap out of this package. I like that I&#x27;m using a whole lot less packaging for this amount of soap than bottles or disposable dispensers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap cleans well, smells nice, and leaves my hands soft. Just about perfect.</li>
    <li> This hand soap smells wonderful and cleans very well. It creates suds quickly and rinses very well. I feel confident that all bacteria is removed from areas where this is used.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant smelling soap that cleans good &amp; works great, with no clogging, in store purchased manual soap dispensers.  I&#x27;m taking away 1 star because it&#x27;s not organic.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister, she is going thru chemo, and has to wash her hands a lot, and this did not dry her skin and smelled wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very mild and luxurious soap it cleans and leaves your hands feeling relaxed, refreshed and ready to do battle again! I highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Soft lavender scent. Very light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love it. No more messy bar soap. Such a nice fragrance and doesn t dry out my skin-very sensitive hands. Great soap.</li>
    <li> Refills the soap dispenser 3 times and love that it has a cap to reseal it.</li>
    <li> I like to soap and it works perfectly in the machine. It smells very good and feels good when washing hands.</li>
    <li> Love this product for the office. Easy to use and easy to order refills. Highly recommended. Love the options of also ordering different smells that are antibacterial.</li>
    <li> The one thing that drove me crazy about this soap is that the bag it comes in is a pain to use when filling up your dispenser. Wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal however it doesn&#x27;t look like the bag is even recyclable (I checked everywhere for a recycling label but couldn&#x27;t find one). I&#x27;d much rather buy a larger plastic bottle of soap that is easier to use when filling up a dispenser PLUS it&#x27;s recyclable.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase a very expensive soap in fancy soap dispensers, but found that this refilling package contains really great quality soap and protect the environment by reducing the number of bottles we purchase. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Wanted a soap without all the chemicals.  The fragrance is natural lavender which is a pleasing scent.  It isn&#x27;t as drying as other liquid hand soap.  But gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it has coloring to make it purple.  Wish it were available as a Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> The soap is soft and has a very pleasing aroma.</li>
    <li> The best part about this soap is how easily it rinses off.  Same for the dish soap.  A bit expensive.</li>
    <li> For half the price this would be a 5 star product. The Simple Human soap works fine in their sensor pump. For now, I am using a bulk soft soap product that is inexpensive and don&#x27;t like it as much - but it works fine to. For a little scent and maybe a few minor additives, Simple Human charges a lot. If you don&#x27;t mind spending an extra 4 bucks to get a somewhat superior product; or you want to pamper yourself a little for a few bucks, I would recommend Simple Human. If you use your soap sensor often, and want to save $50 a year or more, I think we can all convince Simple Human to lower their price or offer significant sales for bulk purchases; or, just use a cheaper soap.</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t let me put anything but this soap in our simple human soap dispensers.  Not harsh and smells great.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. smells great too.</li>
    <li> I must admit that we first considered just using one of the REGULAR liquid soaps. However, the soap that came with the unit lasted for a while - only two of us - and found this to be a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this purchase we will have several refills which will last...</li>
    <li> I like it, but I&#x27;d prefer clear (no hue) for glass dispensers.  I like the smell of lavender but don&#x27;t need the color!</li>
    <li> Ordered it because it has the correct viscosity to use in our auto-soap dispenser.  Soap works great and smells great.</li>
    <li> We purchased this because we have a Simple Human automatic soap dispenser, and a free sample of this soap was included with the dispenser. This soap has a STRONG sent, which may be too much for some people. You will notice the smell when you use it and it will linger on your hands for a few minutes after you wash them too. For us, this is a bonus, especially in the kitchen since we are often washing up after handling strong smelling stuff. We like it so much, we decided to buy more!</li>
    <li> Not every liquid soap product works in the sensor dispensers.  Many are too think for the dispenser.  This item does the job.</li>
    <li> This was a re-order of a product I&#x27;ve used for well over a year. It has become my favorite hand soap for the Simplehuman soap dispensers I have at home. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and this soap does not dry my hands out even during winter.  The scent is nice as well</li>
    <li> I love the lavender scent and the fact that it works perfectly in the dispenser.  It&#x27;s really convenient to have this on hand to quickly refill.</li>
    <li> The product appeared used, mainly because of the dispensing cap not being intact. The smell was not authentic to Lavender.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and use it with the Simple Human auto-dispenser. It smells great, is not too overpowering, and has a very light texture that rinses easily.</li>
    <li> The soap has a very nice smell, and the consistency seems to be just rght for te SimpleHuman dispenser.  I also bought Method refills from Target at about 60% of the Simple Human&#x27;s price.  Method&#x27;s consistency is not as fit as the Simple Human soap but considering the price difference, I would opt for Method at Target.</li>
    <li> The dispenser came with some of this, and we loved it.  The refill is easy to use and will refill the dispenser almost twice.</li>
    <li> Fragrance not exactly my cup of tea.  I guess I&#x27;m getting used to it.  The soap seems milder which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I originally received the lavendar scent as a sample with the soap dispenser. I am very sensitive to flowery scents so I was cautious when I opened the package. As it turns out, it has just the right amount of lavendar and each handwashing is very pleasant. I now use it in all of my soap dispensers.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap - just wish the price was less - but will buy again.  It does a nice job on the hands.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff have it at every sink.  Easy to refill the dispensers.</li>
    <li> I give five stars to all simple human products.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. It has a nice aroma and feels good on the skin.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all.  Of course it is up to the individual as to whether you will like it or not.  For me, it was a good buy and works well in the simplehuman Sensor Pump.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the way this moisturizing hand soap treats her hands and myself I like the way it acts as a hand soap with such a small amount that I can use with the handy Simple Human Liquid Hand Soap Dispenser. Of the different varieties of liquid hand soap offered by Simple Human the moisturizing liquid hand soap is our favorite.</li>
    <li> We purchased this with the automatic soap dispenser. Great product. The smell is fantastic and even after using it constantly with a new baby in the house, I don&#x27;t find that it dries out my hands.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It rinses clean and smells wonderful. This is my favorite soap and I cannot find it in stores. It never makes a sticky mess on the dispenser and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
