      <li>It gets all my makeup off, but does not dry my skin out.</li>
      <li>The other products that I tried left my skin very irritated and overdried.</li>
      <li>I bought this cleanser to clear up my face, i also have minimal acne, but i still like to take care of my face, but this cleanser would turn my face red..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No oil here great product</li>
    <li> everytime when I am using this product I get compliments about my skin. I had stopped using it because its hard to find in shops and used Neutrogena instead. I started breaking out from using Neutrogena , and then switchedd back to this product  and now my skin is clearer and brighter</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as ordered.  It performs well on facial tissue and rinses easily in the shower.  Ingredients on the label include laurel sulfate, my primary requirement for the product.  Lathered (or foamed) as advertized.  Pump is harder to push than expected, but probably necessary for the viscocity of the product.  Clean and fresh feel after shower.</li>
    <li> I was actually on vacation with friends and borrowed this from one of my girlfriends to wash my face one morning.  It left my skin feeling soft and smooth.  It smelled nice too.  Best of all, it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash twice a day, with Differin every evening, for about a year, and my skin is completely clear now. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in months and months! It gets all my makeup off, but does not dry my skin out. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY face wash I&#x27;ve used out of at least a dozen in the last few years that cleans my face AND doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I rarely see it in stores anymore, so I have many times tried to find a suitable substitute. Never can. Most similar products dry my skin out and cause me to break out. So I&#x27;m going to just order it from now on. Just goes to show that fancy packaging is meaningless.</li>
    <li> My skin is just too sensitive for this wash. I usually have combination skin, but this wash completely stripped my face of all oils and made it extremely dry and flaky. Using Cetaphil for sensitive skin now. VERY happy with that product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product looking for an alternative other then the products that irritate my skin to clean my face. The other products that I tried left my skin very irritated and overdried. When I tried this it left my skin clean and un-irritated, and without overdrying it.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser to clear up my face, i also have minimal acne, but i still like to take care of my face, but this cleanser would turn my face red.. hmmm maybe this cleanser only works for some people, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this cleanser after venturing off and trying others. I have acne prone combination skin and this does an excellent job getting rid of my minimal daily skin makeup and keeping my zits at bay. It has a slight scent and can be worked to a nice bubbly foam. Doesn&#x27;t do much for existing acne or improving skin tone. It&#x27;s not holy grail status but seeing how it has reliably cleansed my skin without problems over the years, this has definitely become a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> This takes off ALL my makeup, smells good and does not leave my face feeling stripped. I have Rosacea and this works great!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, and my cleaners always left my face tight and dry. My skin feels clearer and looks better.this cleanse doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and certainly doesn&#x27;t leave you with pimples in the morning!</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this face wash (me, hubbie, teens, even 10 yr old). It is the best! I&#x27;ve been using it for over three years now. I CAN&#x27;T find anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price - GREAT&lt;br /&gt;Quality - GREAT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product rivals any expensive department store product.</li>
    <li> This item is effective for oily skins. It removes all the filthy things from my skin. I feel fresh skin after using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.It&#x27;s really good for sensitive skin and it really does the job!After a short while of using it my face is already cleared up!It also has an amazing smell!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and most acne products cause a lot of irritation or redness but this product doesn&#x27;t. Literally within 6 hours, give or take, I saw a noticeable difference. However, I did use this product, then deep cleaning toner for sensitive skin which is step 2, and last the dual action moisturizer. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell but if anything it just smells like a scented soap!</li>
    <li> this face was is great for any and every type of skin type (except maybe those needing medication with severe breakouts)......it&#x27;s good for my teenagers faces (oily) and mine (combination/oily/dry).....a great face wash for the price..........better than the more expensive ones</li>
    <li> This is a facial cleanser worthy of an award! It&#x27;s gentle and effective in removing make-up, even mascara, yet leaves the skin soft, refreshed and clean. It never seems to leave my skin dry or tight. It&#x27;s just right. There are many, many other cleansers on the market but this is a stand out. Also, when I checked the ingredient labels on this product and Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s other cleanser, Purpose, the ingredients are exactly the same! Yet this product costs far less.</li>
    <li> It dried my skin out  and made skin really flaky and it broke me out little bumps all over my face this is false advertisement for people with sensitive skin.</li>
