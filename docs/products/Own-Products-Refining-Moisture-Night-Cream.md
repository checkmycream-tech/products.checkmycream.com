### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>The best moisturizers are not greasy, don&#x27;t smell, and don&#x27;t irritate the skin around the eye.</li>
      <li>I have used the cream for about 4 weeks and am very impressed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This company advertises that the product is Paraben and sulfate-free which I think is great.  </li>
      <li>Great</li>

      <li>Win Win.</li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>The Own Refining Moisture Night Cream had a very good, medium consistency.</li>
      <li>Might not be a great a birthday gift, but it&#x27;d probably be a good one for Mother&#x27;s day or just to say thank you to the woman who puts up with you.</li>
      <li>Good price, good product.</li>
      <li>There is no scent that I could detect, which was good.</li>
      <li>I manage using lotion and astringent, while aimed at women I thought this might be a good thing to try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>are crow&#x27;s feet and creases on my neck), but to be fair, the product claims that it takes 6-8 weeks for changes to be noticeable (and we have a maximum of four weeks to write a review for Amazon Vine</li>
      <li>This is a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This is especially true for the day cream with SPF.</li>
      <li>It feels good going on, isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>needed a night cream that would remain on my skin, hydrate it and feel good.</li>
      <li>good:</li>
      <li>and you get a lot more for your money!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect way to put your face to sleep each night and when you wake up in the morning, your skin is ready for the day!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and I found OWN products easy with great results.  </li>
      <li>He liked the texture and the lack of fragrance.</li>
      <li>However, the effects are quite nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Own Refining Moisture Night Cream for over a month now.  </li>
      <li>This cream is nice to the touch and smell</li>
      <li>Own Refining Moisture Night Cream, 1.7 oz]]</li>
      <li>I liked this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have never used OWN products before, but I am a fan now and will try out their day cream next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Own products ever since.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of Own&#x27;s Refining Moisture Night Cream through a beauty box subscription and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>This cream is the perfect little treat for yourself each night for FACING the day bravely.</li>
      <li>This night cream absorbs quickly and smells pleasant like lemons.</li>
      <li>The cost of Own is about $7 more than my Olay, but if I like it more after it&#x27;s gone</li>
      <li>This product performs nicely and better than many I have tried.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a pretty nice moisturizing cream, this could be a good choice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Own also says that the product is fragrance free, but then list parfum as an ingredient...?  </li>
      <li>i stopped using this for about a year and realized my skin was a lot drier and, actually, more prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>so I finally have the perfect nighttime product.</li>
      <li>You will one day be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many lines or wrinkles on my face</li>
      <li>and I love the way it feels.</li>
      <li>I had never head of this brand, and most night creams just don&#x27;t moisturize like I need them to--</li>
      <li>However, this is just another option with slightly better philosophy towards ingredients and efficacy.</li>
      <li>I liked the smooth feel of my skin after using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So smooth!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this for the 8 weeks the product says will yield results, but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love the night cream and the day lotion with SPF 30.</li>
      <li>But, after a couple more days, I noticed some itching and redness in some places, mostly along my jawline.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would think of trying something new when I was already happy with what I had been using.</li>
      <li>The scent (or lack thereof) is one of the most important things in a night cream for me.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good product, looking to diminish already existing lines, not so much.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not as friendly to your skin and your body as they would lead you to believe ( I researched this product more at a site called Environmental Working Group [ewg dot org]).  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy and absorbs easily.</li>
      <li>It spreads easily.</li>
      <li>Since he thought it was fine</li>
      <li>all, a fine emulsion that does its job.</li>
      <li>The lotion feels super buttery smooth and silky, just lovely.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
      <li>It provides plenty of moisture and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>but it went on smoothly and had a bit of an odor.  </li>
      <li>I do apply it an hour or so before I shut out the light, so it has set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had not used OWN products before, but now that I have, I highly recommend their use.</li>
      <li>The cream itself is rich and moisturizing without a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>It goes on so richly</li>
      <li>like this enough and the price is very good that I would absolutely consider getting it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She says it seems to have removed some fine lines (which if she reads this I swear never noticed!), and she also likes that it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel like her Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless Pomegranate cream which she really likes except for the greasy</li>
      <li>It smells like fresh linen, something spring-ish, and instantly gives your face a nice glow to sleep well with!</li>
      <li>have mature skin, and in pretty good condition for my age.</li>
      <li>and I have mature, sensitive dry skin in very good condition for my age as I take good care of it.</li>
      <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Love this, leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I was blowing my nose a tremendous amount</li>
      <li>My face seems to get pretty dry, this night cream is easy to use and feels really good.</li>
      <li>It comes in a very cute packaging, and the product itself is stored in a brushed glass container, giving it texture when held.  </li>
      <li>This I like very much!</li>
      <li>So far I am happy with the product and it works well enough that I am willing to overlook the smell, which isn&#x27;t terribly strong but could probably stand to be improved.</li>
      <li>While it didn&#x27;t help do away with the lines on my face, as a moisturizer it definitely moisturizes -- so perfect for those with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>and when I finally felt better, my nose looked fine.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t break out, which is a huge plus, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in using it.</li>
      <li>It felt really nice when I put it around my eyes and on my upper cheeks, however...</li>
      <li>First and foremost, this has no cloying, sweet odor, nor does it have a chemical scent.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and not scented.</li>
      <li>and I notice that it is staying soft for far longer than it used to after a good moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It is worth it to me.</li>
      <li>OWN Refining Moisture Night Cream - Anti-Aging is terrific!!!  </li>
      <li>Perhaps after using the whole jar I&#x27;ll have a better idea if perhaps it&#x27;s time for me to embrace a new cream after all these years!</li>
      <li>On the other hand, the skin on my four head tends to be fairly oily as do the areas below my eyes.</li>
      <li>night cream is light, smooth and silky, it has a very delicate, pleasant citrusy smell.  </li>
      <li>For me, I believe it will work best in the winter, when my skin is dry and flaky and really needs the extra care and refining.</li>
      <li>This night cream is the perfect solution to add moisture where needed and at the same time, tone down my oily spots - all while I sleep.</li>
      <li>I noticed during first application that the cream was not quite absorbed by my face.  </li>
      <li>But I will confess this: the result will need to improve pretty dramatically from what I&#x27;m seeing now to make me think that the product is worth $20 for a .8oz jar.</li>
      <li>(I have experienced discomfort if lotion gets in my eye, but rinsing it usually fixes it), but all I know is that I will not be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>OWN products are fast and simple to use.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin tends to be a bit sensitive, so I am careful when I introduce new products.  Right away I was a bit put-off of this cream because it had a very chemically smell to it,  but I decided to give it a go anyway to see what happened.  It didn&#x27;t take long for me to notice that my skin was a bit more soft and supple.  After just a couple of weeks, my skin seems to be brighter and I notice that it is staying soft for far longer than it used to after a good moisturizing.  So far I am happy with the product and it works well enough that I am willing to overlook the smell, which isn&#x27;t terribly strong but could probably stand to be improved.</li>
    <li> From my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 60 and I have mature, sensitive dry skin in very good condition for my age as I take good care of it. I am very picky about the quality of face products I use. I have never used OWN products before, but I am a fan now and will try out their day cream next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night cream is light, smooth and silky, it has a very delicate, pleasant citrusy smell.  It is not greasy and absorbs easily. The container is small - 1.7 oz, but you only need a small quantity to apply as it is rich and smooth , so it should go a long way. I haven&#x27;t used this cream for 8 weeks yet to be able to see whether it will result in the reduction in wrinkles it promises, but my skin does feel very moisturized and silky soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> This night cream absorbs quickly and smells pleasant like lemons. Clean and fresh. I like the fact it is not greasy and oily. No residue on your pillow in the am when you wake up.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again. Good price, good product. Win Win.</li>
    <li> I mainly used this cream on my neck, with occasional use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs easily without a greasy feel. It definitely moisturized&lt;br /&gt;the area well. I can&#x27;t say that it reduced the appearance of any&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles. I liked the smooth feel of my skin after using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for mature skin types that are dry to very dry.</li>
    <li> I got this Night cream for my wife to try out. She claims that she likes it, however the first few times she applied it, her face was sensitive to the ingredients. However after a few applications over a few days, the sensitivity went away and it works well for her. She used to use Olay products, but she says this is very comparable. My wife claims it does firm up the skin around her temples and eyes.</li>
    <li> I just didn&#x27;t see the results I had hoped to see with this product. The texture is great, there is virtually no scent, but also no noticeable results. So, if you are looking for a moisturizer it&#x27;s a good product, looking to diminish already existing lines, not so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Own Refining Moisture Night Cream for over a month now.  It comes in a very cute packaging, and the product itself is stored in a brushed glass container, giving it texture when held.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a night cream for awhile, and had high hopes for this cream.  I have naturally oily skin, so I like my facial products to NOT make my face more oily.  I noticed during first application that the cream was not quite absorbed by my face.  I applied about a quarter sized amount, and which, I felt, was enough to cover my entire face.  I liked the subtle calming scent of the cream.  I did not like the fact that the cream was not absorbed by face.  It left my face feeling wet.  In my late 30s, I do have some noticeable lines on my face.  After a few weeks of using the cream, I did not notice a huge difference in the noticeability of the lines.  There were many nights that I felt the cream was so wet on my face that it got all over my pillow.  To account for the creaminess of the product, you must use a very small amount, less you want your pillow to end up smelling like the cream.  Overall, I&#x27;m neutral to this product.  While it didn&#x27;t help do away with the lines on my face, as a moisturizer it definitely moisturizes -- so perfect for those with dry skin.  For folks like me with oily skin, I recommend something less creamy and heavy.  I had to move on from this product since it was just getting all over my pillow.  The scent itself is not so bad.  But I assume folks by facial products not solely on scent.</li>
    <li> I discovered Own at a local Whole Foods store when I was looking for cosmetics that contain the absolute minimum amount of chemicals. I&#x27;ve been using Own products ever since. I love the night cream and the day lotion with SPF 30. Unlike some of the other more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; skin care products, these creams are smooth without leaving any weird sticky residue. This is especially true for the day cream with SPF. I&#x27;ve tried other products that contain zinc oxide and they left a white sticky film.</li>
    <li> Love this, leaves my skin soft and smooth. Would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry skin on my face, well I should say it&#x27;s a combination. It&#x27;s quite annoying to have flaky dead skin between your eyes. Not exactly attractive. On the other hand, the skin on my four head tends to be fairly oily as do the areas below my eyes. I manage using lotion and astringent, while aimed at women I thought this might be a good thing to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m much of a fan of the smell or the texture. It&#x27;s not exactly pleasant putting it on my face, but then again it&#x27;s not awful. However, the effects are quite nice. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, the area that was dry before seems to be maintaining its moisture. I don&#x27;t have the flaky skin anymore. The oily areas, they seem somewhat less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d not say my wife has aged since we met, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m not anxious to be found in a shallow grave, but I let her be a guinea pig as well and she likes it too.  It&#x27;s a little early to tell since it says 8 weeks to do it&#x27;s full job, but her skin looks a little younger after a couple weeks.  She says it seems to have removed some fine lines (which if she reads this I swear never noticed!), and she also likes that it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel like her Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless Pomegranate cream which she really likes except for the greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the stuff.  It works for both of us and it&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced.  Good product. Might not be a great a birthday gift, but it&#x27;d probably be a good one for Mother&#x27;s day or just to say thank you to the woman who puts up with you.</li>
    <li> I have dry to normal skin on my face &amp; after using this product for a couple of weeks roughly 2-4 nights per week, my face has stopped flaking, become smoother &amp; had even gotten rid of some blotches/dark spots.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005KJ35D0 Own Refining Moisture Night Cream, 1.7 oz]]</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is oily in the T zone while dry on my cheeks.  This night cream is the perfect solution to add moisture where needed and at the same time, tone down my oily spots - all while I sleep. It&#x27;s the perfect way to put your face to sleep each night and when you wake up in the morning, your skin is ready for the day!  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a number of Own products for a few weeks now. My face seems to get pretty dry, this night cream is easy to use and feels really good. I like everything I&#x27;ve tried of theirs.</li>
    <li> The Own Refining Moisture Night Cream had a very good, medium consistency. It also felt very light on my face and left it pretty moisturized. I especially wanted to try the product on a dry, patchy area of my skin, and it moisturized that part very nicely. I am always excited to try a new facial moisturizer, and I hope to see this product on the retail shelves soon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that this cream was as moisturizing as some others I&#x27;ve tried however, for me that&#x27;s a huge plus. I have oily skin and extra moisture sometimes leaves my face super shiny at times. Even night creams and even after washing my face in the morning in the shower, later in the day some creams have left my face greasy/oily/shiny. I never had that problem with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I had pneumonia and was sick for almost 3 weeks. I was blowing my nose a tremendous amount and if you&#x27;ve had a cold then you know what that does to the skin on your nostrils. It gets red/shredded/flaky looking. I applied this cream every time after I blew my nose and when I finally felt better, my nose looked fine. No flaking or dry looking patches, even after I applied foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus with this is sometimes I have trouble with moisturizing creams causing acne or bumps but I never had any of those problems with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this enough and the price is very good that I would absolutely consider getting it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to Amazon and the Maker/Seller for allowing me the opportunity to try it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have many lines or wrinkles on my face but I do get dry skin that I want to keep moisturized. This cream is nice to the touch and smell but I have noticed any real changes in my skin quality from using it.</li>
    <li> The first few days, this product felt pretty good on my skin and seemed to be doing its job. There was a little tingling but not in a bad way at all. But, after a couple more days, I noticed some itching and redness in some places, mostly along my jawline. I have pretty sensitive skin, skin that breaks out easily (despite being LONG past puberty) so I&#x27;m thinking that I need to use this product sparingly. For me, I believe it will work best in the winter, when my skin is dry and flaky and really needs the extra care and refining.</li>
    <li> I tried it for a week and found that it did sting when I put it on but it went on smoothly and had a bit of an odor.  Fragrance free doesn&#x27;t mean that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell, just that it&#x27;s not \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to have any additional fragrance added.  I have sensitive skin and after the week was over I did feel that my skin was smoother, but I also had areas that became red and itchy.  I don&#x27;t think this is a product that I could use nightly for the eight weeks it says it can take to see firmer skin and after researching some of the ingredients and their toxicity I don&#x27;t think I will do the eight week trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company advertises that the product is Paraben and sulfate-free which I think is great.  And I also like that there was no animal testing.  But I get the impression that since those are hot button words, that they advertise that they don&#x27;t have these chemicals or processing, but downplay that it does contain LECITHIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCOLIC ACID, POTASSIUM SORBATE, DIMETHICONE,  and SODIUM HYDROXIDE.  Some of these have been proven to cause organ toxicity so it&#x27;s not as friendly to your skin and your body as they would lead you to believe ( I researched this product more at a site called Environmental Working Group [ewg dot org]).  Own also says that the product is fragrance free, but then list parfum as an ingredient...?  It makes me question some of their other claims as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work, some say yes, some say no.  I think it probably does after using it for just a brief period before stopping...but even if it does at what cost to your health?  After watching the Dr. Oz show several weeks ago and seeing how young his wife looks and she uses coconut oil as a moisturizer, I think I am going to try that instead since it is all natural with little to no toxic risk and you get a lot more for your money!

    <li> So this review is quite mixed, and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: The lotion feels super buttery smooth and silky, just lovely. There is no scent that I could detect, which was good. It felt really nice when I put it around my eyes and on my upper cheeks, however...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: ...When I put it on the skin around my mouth and lower cheeks my skin started to feel like it was burning. The burning sensation continued for at least 20 minutes. I really have NO idea why this happened, since I use facial lotion every day and have not felt that with any other lotion. The following days my skin did not feel any different (not better or worse). Also, I accidentally rubbed the edge of my eye with the same finger I previously had some lotion on and my eye started burning. I tried rinsing it, but it didn&#x27;t help much. The next day my eye still felt disturbed, kind of similar to an eye infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I might be allergic to an ingredient in this lotion since I&#x27;ve never had these types of reactions before (I have experienced discomfort if lotion gets in my eye, but rinsing it usually fixes it), but all I know is that I will not be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I asked my husband to try it and he didn&#x27;t experience any burning or bad side affects.  He liked the texture and the lack of fragrance. Since he thought it was fine I gave it three stars, but since I wont be using it long-term I don&#x27;t know the long-term efficacy of the product.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay night cream for \\&quot;older skin\\&quot; for well over ten years. The name and packaging has changed so much over the years that I have actually purchased the wrong formula once or twice. I am extremely satisfied with the cream, thus the long term use. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would think of trying something new when I was already happy with what I had been using. I have to say that this Own night cream feels wonderful to apply. It has a pleasant subtle smell that I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being bothered by. It does tingle just a little bit and only briefly like my Olay product does-especially if I have any break in my skin. I haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to notice any change in my skin condition, but it also has not caused any exacerbation. I actually like the feel of this cream better than my Olay. Olay goes on feeling wet and often leaves a residual feeling of greasiness; something that I sometimes still notice in the morning! That I wasn&#x27;t too fond of. The Own cream glides on with neither a greasy or wet feeling and seems to absorb fully within moments. When I stroke my face after just a few minutes post application I truly cannot even tell that I recently applied lotion. This I like very much! Perhaps after using the whole jar I&#x27;ll have a better idea if perhaps it&#x27;s time for me to embrace a new cream after all these years! The cost of Own is about $7 more than my Olay, but if I like it more after it&#x27;s gone I would not be deterred to pay the premium.</li>
    <li> OWN Refining Moisture Night Cream - Anti-Aging is terrific!!!  I have used the product a few weeks and my skin stays moisturized throughout the night.  I had not used OWN products before, but now that I have, I highly recommend their use.</li>
    <li> This cream is the perfect little treat for yourself each night for FACING the day bravely. LOL  It goes on so richly and you need less than a fingertip full because it is thick without being greasy or too strongly scented. It smells like fresh linen, something spring-ish, and instantly gives your face a nice glow to sleep well with!</li>
    <li> This night cream is pretty average as far as creams go. It&#x27;s lightweight so I don&#x27;t break out, which is a huge plus, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in using it. I think I&#x27;d rather stick with Cetaphil which is also cheaper.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, this has no cloying, sweet odor, nor does it have a chemical scent. The scent (or lack thereof) is one of the most important things in a night cream for me. This one has NONE, which is a big checkmark in the pro column for me. I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and I love the way it feels. It goes on very smoothly with very little product needed. I have very dry skin and this cream moisturizes well without heavy feeling emollients. As far as the \\&quot;refining\\&quot; aspect, I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the texture of my skin (unless you count the fact that it&#x27;s less dry). I think it&#x27;s a tad pricey too.</li>
    <li> I live in the Northeast and this time of year my skin gets very dry.  It was a relief to discover this product.  Within a few days my skin was becoming softer and within a few weeks the dryness was gone.  It did not leave my skin feeling at all oily.  Great product!</li>
    <li> As a seasoned beauty industry veteran, i break down and analyze products from an expert&#x27;s POV. The visible effects due to the high amount of glycolic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AHAs in the acid will eat away dead skin cells so you see smoother, newer, brighter skin. This is a given. The glycerin and other humectants and nourishers also add to the moisture-binding powers, which you will feel. Instantly you will see and feel plumpness and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a fine emulsion that does its job. Do other similarly formulated creams do the same thing? yes. However, this is just another option with slightly better philosophy towards ingredients and efficacy.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! So smooth!</li>
    <li> OWN products are fast and simple to use.  I won&#x27;t take too much time with my skin care and I found OWN products easy with great results.  I love the moisture cream and lip balm especially.</li>
    <li> This product performs nicely and better than many I have tried.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have noticed a difference, especially on my throat.&lt;br /&gt;It is often windy, hot and dry where I live and I have used this a few times during the day when my regular moisturizer seemed insufficient and my face immediately felt less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy this again.</li>
    <li> I took this on a trip to England because of it&#x27;s great container and great feel. The cream itself is rich and moisturizing without a greasy feel. The hydration is nice, and you only need a little bit for it to cover your entire face. I also used it during the day under my foundation. Smells fresh and not scented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never sure how to rate products like this, mostly because it&#x27;s difficult to determine whether the claims that it will reduce wrinkles are true unless you&#x27;ve been using it for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every night for three and a half weeks right before I go to bed. There hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable difference in the number of wrinkles I have (the ones I&#x27;ve been focusing on are crow&#x27;s feet and creases on my neck), but to be fair, the product claims that it takes 6-8 weeks for changes to be noticeable (and we have a maximum of four weeks to write a review for Amazon Vine products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the consistency--it feels similar to mayonnaise or Miracle Whip to me--and it rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a noticeable oily film. It also has a light, subtle scent. I will continue to use up the container I have, and if I have noticed a change by the time I&#x27;ve finished using it, I will update my review. But I will confess this: the result will need to improve pretty dramatically from what I&#x27;m seeing now to make me think that the product is worth $20 for a .8oz jar.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this night cream. It provides plenty of moisture and goes on smooth. My face feels hydrated when I get up in the mornings. The reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it feels a little bit greasy when it is applied.</li>
    <li> Evaluating this type of product after just 30 days is not easy, as it generally takes longer use to see results for moisture and texture of facial skin. So far after 30 days I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a night cream that would remain on my skin, hydrate it and feel good. This does do that. I like the way it feels going on. Just a dab on each cheek and forehead, on &amp; under the chin is all that is needed. It spreads easily. It is light, not heavy, yet in the morning when I go to wash my face, the application of water to my face makes it feel silky, much like soft water feels on a face, and I don&#x27;t have soft tap water. I can tell it stayed on my face all night. I sleep on my side so I always worry that the cream will rub off on my pillow case. I have not seen any sign of it. I do apply it an hour or so before I shut out the light, so it has set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mature skin, and in pretty good condition for my age. I often get compliments on my skin. I encourage younger women to get into a routine of taking care of their skin when they are young. Starting early is the key. It will be as routine as brushing your teeth. Remove your makeup every night, exfoliate at least once a week, use sun screen every day, and use a product like OWN every night. You will one day be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep using this product. In 30 days I have only used maybe 1/8 of the jar, so this justifies spending a little more than what drug store quality moisturizers cost. It is worth it to me. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer quite a bit. The best moisturizers are not greasy, don&#x27;t smell, and don&#x27;t irritate the skin around the eye. This is a good moisturizer. I never belief claims of rejuvenating or anti-aging, but it is common sense that moisturizing keeps skin from aging. If you are looking for a pretty nice moisturizing cream, this could be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, there is a fairly bizarre warning against small parts. I have no idea what the warning is talking about. They might be talking about different \\&quot;Own\\&quot; products, with tiny caps. But there are no small parts with this particular product, so no child could be endangered by anything. Well, unless they just ingested the cream. No idea what that would do.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product. I had never head of this brand, and most night creams just don&#x27;t moisturize like I need them to--even all the name brand expensive ones. I am 33 years old and have pretty dry skin. I live in Colorado where it is extremely arid. I have used the cream for about 4 weeks and am very impressed. I mean I don&#x27;t suddenly look 20 or anything, but my skin is hydrated. That in itself is a hefty task when you live here. It feels amazing going on, and a little goes a long way. I will definitely purchase the product when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most anti-aging products. I received a sample of Own&#x27;s Refining Moisture Night Cream through a beauty box subscription and immediately fell in love with it. Not only does the product not irritate my skin, but after a few weeks of using it, my skin was less red and irritated.</li>
    <li> I liked this moisturizer. not a bad smell and really helps with my dry skin. not greasy at all.  My daughter likes it as well,  I keep finding the jar missing at night!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for the 8 weeks the product says will yield results, but I&#x27;m satisfied. It feels good going on, isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor. I always use a night cream (normally Philosophy Hope in a Jar), so I haven&#x27;t noticed any marked improvement in my skin. I can&#x27;t speak to the product&#x27;s claim it is all natural b/c I haven&#x27;t researched it.  Overall, a decent night cream for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> i stopped using this for about a year and realized my skin was a lot drier and, actually, more prone to breakouts. i&#x27;m back on the juice and my dry winter skin has been sated. good value (i mean, it&#x27;s a tiny container, but a little goes a long way).</li>
    <li> This Own product is definitely non-greasy, and is very light compared to other night-moisturizing creams I&#x27;ve used. The cream absorbs readily, and does not take long to massage into facial skin. The rub? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as the other creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, and those fine little lines are creeping back into view since I switched to this product! So, the truth will be in the using over the next month as I use it up. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m wrong, because I definitely like the lightweight feeling, and want it to work so I finally have the perfect nighttime product.</li>
