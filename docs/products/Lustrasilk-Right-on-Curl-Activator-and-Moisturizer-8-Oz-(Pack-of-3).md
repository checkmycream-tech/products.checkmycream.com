    <li> Best product for keeping a curl looking good some people want use any thing else.</li>
    <li> it is great I have used it for 30 years or more but I can not fine it in stores any more but I can fine it on amazon.com the price is higher and the size is smaller but HEY</li>
    <li> During the summer, I always do my wet and wavy hair style which requires no hot curlers.  I have always used the Right on curl activator and moisturizer to give my hair a little more curl and shine.  This year, I discovered that the beauty supply stores in my area no longer carry this product.  Since finding this out, I have bought many curl moisturizers and none to my satisfaction.  My best friend suggested that I try on line to see if someone still carry this product.  To my surprise, I was able to find it.  So, I immediately purchased the 3 pack and I am very happy that I did.  The right on product works for my hair and the price was very good.  I received my order in a few days, which made me even happier.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair type, so I stocked up/  Still wondering why Lustrasilk stopped making the moisturizer that goes along with this product??...</li>
    <li> I hope Lustresilk keeps on making this product.  It works well to prolong my curls.  Works better than lots of the expensive Activators that I have used.</li>
    <li> good product...I love it</li>
    <li> I have used for @ least 10 yrs and now not it&#x27;s not carried in stores anymore. What&#x27;s up with that!  My hair has been normal BUT now getting thin, with grey hair comming in getting unruly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just add a quarter size dab (more is too much), rub it together in palm of hand to get it creamy then rub in hair right after wash-towel dry.It moisturizes &amp; helps manageability. I use it after every wash and sometime a smaller bit mixed with water to get rid of bedhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Believe me, I would use something else if I could find it but I have tried so many hair products &amp; NEED to use this to get the style I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really am not happy about the unavailabilty in stores but at least I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and no product on the market could replaced this product, because I have moved from New York to Georgia, and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores there and did an internet search and was very happy to find it on Amazon or ebay. However, I try almost all the product on the market for curly hair and this product work the best. I would recommend it to anyone interesting in trying it out.</li>
    <li> This hair product is perfect for my natural wavy hair.  Controls the frizz without making hair look wet or heavy.  This is a product that I use every time I wash my hair.  Hard to find in stores around here so ordering it was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Very good product. . .I have been using it for years and I love it.  It was difficult finding this item; the manufacturer has discontinued this particular item.</li>
    <li> I have looked four months in my city for this product and&lt;br /&gt;now to find it online was the best!</li>
    <li> This product is so hard to find. I have no idea what I am going to do once I run out of my order.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all with this product, I would like to return the product but it would cost too much money and I am already at a loss.</li>
    <li> My hair really loves this product and I am sooo very happy I can still buy it on Amazon.com.  This seller packages it as three 8 oz bottles for a resonable price.  This is convenient for me as I can have one bottle each in both my bathrooms.  This produce is well suited  for afro-american hair that is soft with a natural bend for a wave formation.  It works best with hair that does not do well with perms and the user wants a non-greasey way to wear their hair natural.  the product absorbs well and does not have to be applied every day, but maybe every three or four days depending on how moist you like you hair.  It will leave oil on your pillow so I recommend a bonnet at night.</li>
    <li> I read the rave reviews and brought three without ever having tried to this product. I have a mix of natural and texturized hair. It didn&#x27;t soak in for me and I felt no slip or added moisture. I felt more mositure from using aloe vera juice I had left in the refrigerator. I will probably use this up and keep looking for something else.</li>
    <li> I love, love Lustrasilk Right on Curl Activator and Moisturizer it grows my hair. Lustrasilk Right on Curl Activator and Moisturizer really stands by it&#x27;s name. I will forever use this product. When I activate my hair my curls come back instantly. It really moisturizes your hair and penetrates in your scalp. I give Lustrasilk Right on Curl Activator and Moisturizer ********************!</li>
    <li> Right on Curl Activator is my favorite product for my hair styling and texture.  I&#x27;m so sad that it&#x27;s no longer available in our stores.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Lustrasilk for Right-on activators!! The extra-light is the best, but this is next in line than any others.</li>

    <li> I used this product back in the 80&#x27;s and have changed my hair style many times I always come back to the same product no other product work as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product and sad that I can not find it any longer. It is not heavy or greasy and works well with other products.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 20 years,I love this product</li>

    <li> excellent product smooth and silky good moistirizer recommend this great activator tried and true for the curly look must use</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel. A little goes a long way and for less than you think</li>
    <li> It does wonders for my hair. I recommend it 100 percent. It is an excellent product. It should be sold in a larger size; it is only being sold in a smaller size.</li>
    <li> amazing product for hair</li>
    <li> I like that it is the same product that I use to use, with all the good and the bad of it.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4A/B hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only moisturizer that gets my hair soft and keeps my hair moisturized. Usually, I use a cream on top such as Elasta QP Olive Oil and Mango butter. The combination of the juice and cream is AMAZING on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this for my father for sometime now. I am so glad that somebody provides this for my father who will NOT use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Activator &amp; Moisturizers on the marker. I have tried many and none works like this one. Worth the money</li>
    <li> Luster silk right on hair product  I was so glad to fine it since they took it off the market  I was so glad to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> An 8 oz bottle of Right on Curl is 3.99 - the first purchase I paid 4.99 then the price was raised to 6.99 a bottle - that is overwhelming - it is unfortunate that it is not being sold any more locally.  I might find something else for my hair because that is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Lustrasilk works well with my hair texture.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy.  The product may be useful for anyone who has the curl perm.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel greasy, but it loves moisture.  Right On works best for me.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Great product. A mystery why they took it off the market.</li>
    <li> Lustrasilk right on curl activator is the best activator I have ever used.  You do not need just a curl, it is for all types of hair that can use moisture.</li>
