      <li>I absolutely love these!!!!</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with the Dove for Men line and this continues my belief.</li>
      <li>just perfect..</li>
      <li>He thought for a moment and stated that the washcloth was ideal for use with a bar of soap.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for men.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Works great for me.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I found it fine, even perfect, for scrubbing the bottoms of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you decide to purchase this, good luck washing between your butt cheeks or their neighbors.  </li>
      <li>I asked if he preferred it to his good ol&#x27; washcloth.</li>
      <li>It was a good deal</li>
      <li>These are a good value shower scrubber.</li>
      <li>So handy and works great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a great product for men, not overpriced, and about time someone got it that we want to exfoliate as well. :-)</li>
      <li>What makes this so great are the two sides -- one a softer nylon mesh side and one a more abrasive material.</li>
      <li>It seems to retain water well which is good for lathering up, but kind of a pain when trying to squeeze out all the soap.  </li>
      <li>It feels better on my skin surprisingly, even the rougher side feels good too.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen first hand how my boyfriend has rejected any loofah/sponge/cleaning tool on the market for being &amp;#34;too feminine.&amp;#34; For that, I welcome this!</li>
      <li>Great tool, buff and scrubber on one easy to handle tool.  </li>
      <li>These are amazing products.</li>
      <li>You know, the kind which comes apart after a while, This one stays together and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
      <li>None of the males in my household liked it.</li>
      <li>They are well made and have a nice hanging cord.</li>
      <li>Very nice way to get the body clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washcloths are also inexpensive, easy to rinse and wash, and have a good amount of surface</li>
      <li>This is the perfect tool for me to get a good lather on my back and get rid of an acne there.</li>
      <li>and they were a much better price with 4 in a box! :)</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re able to get that great clean feeling without feeling like we&#x27;re using a loofah that&#x27;s made for women.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll call them, but in reality these are way more effective than a washcloth or by hand if you&#x27;re using body wash;</li>
      <li>Nice idea, but needs more thought through for practical purposes.</li>
      <li>My son said he liked these better than the Ax brand</li>
      <li>rubber handle fits my hand better than the knobby handle on the Axe</li>
      <li>Dove is a reputable manufacturer who is known for producing quality products.  </li>
      <li>It cleans, it works, what more can be said.</li>
      <li>Also a washcloth conformed to his body better.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>found this to be a better solution than just a run-of-the-mill shower poof.</li>
      <li>but I am not even sure when that would be</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this.</li>
      <li>and I love everything that Dove makes.</li>
      <li>Both of which are characteristics that (most) women love in regards to mens</li>
      <li>Chances are you will not, and will be glad you didn&#x27;t buy a 4 pack like I did.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask?</li>
      <li>/&gt;The pouf side would probably be ok, but the rubber surround gets in the way.</li>
      <li>I love these shower scrubbers.</li>
      <li>However the &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;, worked better when used with body wash.</li>
      <li>My husband says it is just OK and not to buy another.</li>
      <li>Works great with any body wash soap and comes with convenient &#x27;grips&#x27; for when you&#x27;re really scrubbing away.</li>
      <li>This is okay.</li>
      <li>and I think I like this one better.</li>
      <li>the scrubber-coated sponge, because the Dove product is more substantial and doesn&#x27;t compress into uselessness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to either product, the Dove product is more versatile, having two sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>top part.  </li>
      <li>The tool is comfortable to hold with either side up, as the gray rubber grip fits nicely in your hand.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>These are fairly decent to great bath scrubs for men.</li>
      <li>single best attribute of the implement is the design.</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;m using a choreboy wire pad on my body, but it fits comfortably in my hand, better than the Axe version of this.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable, stylish, does the job.  </li>
      <li>The size is perfect, but the rubber (where you hold on to it to use) could be of a harder material -</li>
      <li>He likes the fact that there is a &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; side and that they are easy to hold onto.</li>
      <li>&quot; It&#x27;s quite easy if you have any sort of motor</li>
      <li>The elastic cord makes it easy to hang the Shower Tool on a fixture and keep it within easy reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This feature alone easily pays for the Shower Tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also a cord attached, making it easy to hang on a shower hook.</li>
      <li>easily before.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a rounded triangle shape that is easy to grip when using either side.</li>
      <li>Chances are pretty good that you&#x27;ll love this tool as much as your favorite wrench, ratchet, or power tool.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a loofah to a wash cloth, but most loofahs seem to come unraveled quickly.  </li>
      <li>If you like the feel of something mildly abrasive and exfoliation, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
      <li>Appreciated this tool to keep my husband away from my bath scrubbers - so much better than a washcloth!</li>
      <li>Great for the entire family.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always found those regular-type nylon mesh pouf sponges too flimsy and light to use efficiently.  </li>
      <li>I primarily use body gel now instead of bar soap</li>
      <li>I have psoriasis and this is gentle yet effective at removing any scale build up.</li>
      <li>It also works great for scrubbing my feet and using the front side cloth to wash my face with facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>It is a great deal when ordering several on auto ship.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit your hand.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the roughness, and I feel like I can tell a difference between using this and using nothing.  </li>
      <li>They work great and definitely get you clean.  </li>
      <li>On one side, you have a pumice stone like thing to scrub all the grime off with, and on the reverse side you have a loofah to wash it all away with, leaving you power washed like a man, but clean and smooth, like, well,  a man.  </li>
      <li>Having a dual sided shower tool for guys that is easy to grip and doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous is impressive.</li>
      <li>Work well, clean well, holds up</li>
      <li>I have tried  many many types of bath sponges and brushes -- from loofahs and natural hemp to all sorts of synthetic materials including nylon mesh, nylon bristles, and Buff Puff-type sponges.</li>
      <li>These are designed to get you clean.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;You can&#x27;t use that &#x27;tool&#x27; to clean your ears.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>clean</li>
      <li>A bit flimsier than I expected but works great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also designed to hold soap better, so you can really lather</li>
      <li>It holds just as much suds but is more substantial in texture.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t think of a way to really make that better, so</li>
      <li>So I definitely would have to say that it&#x27;s a good shower tool.</li>
      <li>That statement is 250% true.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Compared to a wash cloth, it makes more efficient use of body wash - I find I need to use much less to maintain a good lather because I can pour the body wash into the &amp;#34;luffa side&amp;#34; of this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered 4 of these things for deployment. Not much to say except they do their job and clean you off.</li>
    <li> I got this four pack after doing research and finding out they were more expensive to buy signally from Walmart.    They work great and definitely get you clean.  It took a little getting used to. At first it was if it irritated my skin, but it really didn&#x27;t. It was as if it was getting scratched... but I guess that was just it working.    I think I use a little less of the body wash... with better lather.    I disagree with the other person who said they&#x27;d just use a cheap o applicator.  These are designed to get you clean.  And that they do.</li>
    <li> It is a small product and the plastic covers a lot of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I LOVE IT.  So handy and works great.  Holds soap well and holds up to the rigors of a vigorous shower.</li>
    <li> This is one item every man should have in his shower.  Very nice way to get the body clean.  I&#x27;m. Glad I ordered four of them, they will last about a year.  Please tell Dave to keep it up!</li>
    <li> This was not worth the money or time ordering it. None of the males in my household liked it. It was hard to use and did not do a good job.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why everyone is bashing this product. I have tried both the axe and dove versions (basically the same things but the tan side of the dove scrubber is a little nicer than the red side of the axe version) and they do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to be doing, making me clean. Some people are saying it doesn&#x27;t allow the scrubber to be replaced.... DEAL WITH IT. Its meant to last for 4-6 weeks so I don&#x27;t know why you would need \\&quot;replacement parts,\\&quot; just buy a new one! Secondly, I don&#x27;t know how some people say they can&#x27;t reach their \\&quot;junk\\&quot; with this. I don&#x27;t know anyone who isn&#x27;t either one, strong enough to squeeze the scrubber (Its made of rubber, mesh, and cloth; all three can bend/fold/etc. pretty easily) or two, flexible enough to touch their \\&quot;junk.\\&quot; It&#x27;s quite easy if you have any sort of motor skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I just want to say I thoroughly enjoy this product (both sides) and that by combining it with the dove exfoliating body wash, I have very soft and smooth skin. Both of which are characteristics that (most) women love in regards to mens skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY issue I have with this scrubber is that I feel like it&#x27;s difficult to thoroughly wash the soap out of it at the end of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LASTLY, I AM A MAN, not a woman or dove representative that has a tainted perspective of this product. I like it because it WORKS.</li>
    <li> Then this is the shower tool for you.  I purchased these for my fiance&#x27;, he used it once and said it was terrible.  I tried it once and completely agreed with him.  The exfoliate side is nice but the pouf side is so rough it&#x27;s like showering with a Brillo Pad.  Not to mention it isn&#x27;t poufy enough to use on some parts of the body.  I was unable to complete one shower with this \\&quot;shower tool\\&quot; I had to go back to my normal pouf.  If you like roughness when you take a shower and no lather with your soap than this item is for you.  I disagree with the other reviewers when they say this item provides enough lather because it doesn&#x27;t provide any.  I totally agree with the other person who said that you could not use this item to clean your \\&quot;personal area\\&quot;.  That statement is 250% true.  It&#x27;s unfortunate for me that I purchased the 4 pack, now I am with 3 extras to collect dust.  I guess when I need to use a brillo pad for cleaning a pan I could use this instead.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this 4 pack before you at least purchase 1 to make sure you like them.  Chances are you will not, and will be glad you didn&#x27;t buy a 4 pack like I did.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Axe Detailer thing, but I got these because they were cheaper. Both Axe and Dove are Unilever companies, and while they&#x27;re pretty comparable, I prefer the Axe ones, because they&#x27;re firmer, and the back abrasive side is more abrasive. This one isn&#x27;t bad, and I can see how someone would feel the opposite way, so I guess it&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
    <li> I love these shower scrubbers. I primarily use body gel now instead of bar soap and I think that&#x27;s the better way to go in general. This scrubber gets off the dead skin and they last well over 3 months on average use.</li>
    <li> This loofah is just wwaaayyy too small. A waste of money</li>
    <li> The body puff side feels rough, and is good for scouring pores in the chest and upper back areas.  My skin does feel smoother afterwards.  It&#x27;s not very good at creating lather though.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because the mesh is rougher, or the mesh is only exposed on one side.      The back side is too rough for the skin -- I&#x27;ve been using it to sand down foot calluses.      Might need to just use a regular body puff to apply soap, and use the Dove shower tool as a loofah and pumice stone.</li>
    <li> These are fairly decent to great bath scrubs for men. They are well made and have a nice hanging cord. The scrubber side is good for giving your self a nice hard scrub and then the softer side for lathering and washing. I&#x27;m really enjoying this.</li>
    <li> I bought tis because I thought this would be a little more masculine that my white puff tool in the shower.  It turns out it pretty much sucks and I&#x27;m stuck with four of them.  I guess for all those teens that are using the Axe equivalent, it wouldn&#x27;t matter, but I just don&#x27;t get suds I need from the same amount of soap I use from a standard bath scrunchie.  Just saying I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, and I&#x27;m passing out the other three to family members.</li>
    <li> These are a good value shower scrubber.</li>
    <li> This item isn&#x27;t bad, but it has two big problems, it needs a replaceable pad, so one wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new one every so often, eliminates a lot of waste that way, as with many things. The second problem is that it needs a second rope on the other side, to allow for pulling back and forth (especially on the hard to reach places on the back, nearest the neck, I modified my unit to do this. It is the same with the one made to use with AXE products. Nice idea, but needs more thought through for practical purposes.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;lasts for a very long time, much much longer than the puffs&lt;br /&gt;scurbs the hell out of you, if you want a good hard scrub this is your &#x27;tool&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I get a ton of suds from it, all depends on what soap you are using and I put liquid soap on it when I shower&lt;br /&gt;cons: the nylon is the only functional side, I have yet to find the brown scrubber to be of any use at all. I bought 3 of these and it lasted nearly the entire year and I am here now to buy my next pack. but it is a rough scurb,so if you have &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; this would not be for you</li>
    <li> I have one of these type of shower tools from Axe and I think I like this one better. It feels better on my skin surprisingly, even the rougher side feels good too. I may have to replace my old one for this. I mainly been using it in the shower at gym. The shape of the shower tool makes it easier to hold. So I definitely would have to say that it&#x27;s a good shower tool.</li>
    <li> I was initially very excited when I bought this product, but was disappointed upon using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I begin?  The abrasive loofah side doesn&#x27;t create any lather and ends whatever lather you created with the pouf. That makes the abrasive side just about useless because soap won&#x27;t stay on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouf side would probably be ok, but the rubber surround gets in the way. This rubber border makes it impossible to effectively clean your &amp;#34;man parts&amp;#34;. This item only works on your back, stomach, legs, and arms. Forget about your underarms and rear... Just not gonna happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many other reviewers have stated, a regular shower pouf is a better option. This is very cool looking and manly, but not very useful.</li>
    <li> I got this in a large pack of Dove body wash at a big name bulk store and was excited to try it out.  I normally use the pouf to shower with (Don&#x27;t tell my Pals!), but decided to give this a go.  It&#x27;s, as another person posted, \\&quot;Like using a Brillo Pad!\\&quot;.  I have very sensitive skin so it&#x27;s way too rough for me.  It&#x27;s too small, gets very slick, and it&#x27;s impossible to reach in between the Guy parts.  I don&#x27;t see how any Man could ever use this other than for scrubbing dirty, greasy hands.  It&#x27;s made more for the mechanic or coal miner who needs to scrub their skin to get clean and definitely not for a Guy who occasionally does some yard work, etc.  If you arrive home looking like Mike Rowe after a hard day at \\&quot;Dirty Jobs\\&quot; then this may just be for you!</li>
    <li> I use to buy this product all the time when it was in stores, but now I can only find it on Amazon. I&#x27;m a big fan of this shower tool. Other reviews said that it was too hard and hurt their skin when they used it, but that&#x27;s most likely because they have more delicate skin. It might be a little rough on the first use, but it is definitely worth breaking in. This is the perfect tool for me to get a good lather on my back and get rid of an acne there. It also works great for scrubbing my feet and using the front side cloth to wash my face with facial cleanser. I&#x27;ll be buying the four pack about 2 to 3 times a year since the recommendation is to replace around every month.</li>
    <li> The problem with this shower tool is the ridged rubber top attached to the mess part makes it hard to clean your deep dark areas.  Also, i have not really found a use for the &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; top part.  The other issue is at the time you could not find these individually wrapped. The pack of 4 is a little much for me but these could be a good alternative if you have a few henchmen you need to keep clean as well.</li>
    <li> These were a hit with my Dad for Christmas! He likes the fact that there is a &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; side and that they are easy to hold onto.</li>
    <li> I thought my review from the single item listing would carry over to here, but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got to warn guys off of this useless \\&quot;tool.\\&quot;    This thing was obviously designed by a woman. Trying to be \\&quot;proper\\&quot; with my comments, women don&#x27;t have the same \\&quot;hardware\\&quot; to be cleaned.    It doesn&#x27;t fit your hand. When you&#x27;re slick with soap the plastic shell makes it hard to hold onto. It&#x27;s useless for building lather, even with our soft water. Both sides are too small. Because of the shell, you can&#x27;t run it between your toes, nor use it even on ground-in dirt between your fingers.     And I&#x27;ll try to be as delicate as I can here-- For washing male \\&quot;private parts,\\&quot; it&#x27;s impossible. Both front and back.     My wife&#x27;s normal pink \\&quot;poof\\&quot; is far better.     Put it in packaging you might see in an auto parts store, and label it a \\&quot;tool.\\&quot; (Obvious male-directed marketing.) It&#x27;s still trash. If I were to buy a tool as useless as this, it would be returned to the parts store ASAP.</li>
    <li> What a great idea -- a mesh washer on one side and a loofa scrubber on the other.  I think it would be better if it was just a little bit larger, but I suppose the current size makes it easier to use for people with smaller hands.  I don&#x27;t know how long this will last before it starts falling apart, but so far I like having two different textures of washing surfaces on one tool.</li>
    <li> These are far superior to the other brands on the market! Having the two sides always you to have different options dependent upon your skin type or what type of the body you are using it on. These hold up way better than other brands and also are not too rough like some brands are. They have the right balance of exfoliation without feeling scratchy or too hard.</li>
    <li> So far, my husband appreciates this inventive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing it to previously used products, he likes it better than...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...the &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; (scrunched nylon net), because the Dove product retains more of the soap and the plastic frame provides a firmer grip.&lt;br /&gt;...the scrubber-coated sponge, because the Dove product is more substantial and doesn&#x27;t compress into uselessness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to either product, the Dove product is more versatile, having two sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure this needs to be replaced every 4-6 weeks, as indicated, though it is important to keep bath implements mold-free. If I toss this in a laundry bag when I&#x27;m using hot water (and Oxi-clean) to wash certain white laundry items, that should do it. But time will tell if it will hold up. I will report back in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I prefer a loofah to a wash cloth, but most loofahs seem to come unraveled quickly.  The design of this loofah prevents it from unraveling.</li>
    <li> Forget the scrubby which is just a bunch of nylon. You know, the kind which comes apart after a while, This one stays together and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Men Care, though, is for men: The Dove Men Care is a little rougher than the ones you pick up for dollar and it takes a while to get used to it. However, once you are used to it, it seems natural. Another advantage is the two sides. One is the typical scrubby (albeit a little rougher). The other side is more defoliating or scraping  (e.g., getting grease on your leg from bicycling. I could never get this off easily before.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because it a little rough. Too bad you can&#x27;t give it 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> If you like the feel of something mildly abrasive and exfoliation, you&#x27;ll love this.  My boyfriend prefers something softer and thought this was too harsh and made him feel like he was giving himself a sunburn.  But I actually enjoy a little scratchiness like dry brushing, so I thought the feel of this was perfect.</li>
    <li> Until now, men had to trade in their manliness in order to use a loofa sponge or exfoliating scrubber.  Now Bud, Big Al, Rusty, or any other guy can grab onto this ergonomically designed tool for men and experience the wonders that previously only women could enjoy.  Wet the loofa side (not the tan side, which is for exfoliating), apply a little body wash liquid, and lather up your burly bod without wasting the body wash.  Then, turn over the tool and use the tan side to exfoliate.  For those of you who haven&#x27;t exfoliated before, it is a fancy word for using a mild abrasive to remove dead skin cells.  Think of it like using a little turtle wax on the car.  In order to get a nicer shine, you have to start with a little rough stuff.  The tool is comfortable to hold with either side up, as the gray rubber grip fits nicely in your hand.  There is a loop, as well, for hanging the tool in your shower to dry each day when you are done.  Chances are pretty good that you&#x27;ll love this tool as much as your favorite wrench, ratchet, or power tool.  But don&#x27;t go around bragging about it.  The boys will start to worry about you.</li>
    <li> I have always used the soap.  Now I have a durable luffa to use with it.  It has lasted 10x longer than a typical nylon luffa.</li>
    <li> this is just the ticket to get deep down clean.  A bit flimsier than I expected but works great.  Price cannot be beat</li>
    <li> These are amazing products. I am very impressed with the Dove for Men line and this continues my belief. Having a dual sided shower tool for guys that is easy to grip and doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous is impressive. I will be buying again once these run their course but I am not even sure when that would be because they are so well made.</li>
    <li> I freaking love these things, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them in store anywhere around me. These, though similar to the Axe scrubbers, are way higher quality; the mesh and scrubbing part on these do not have the hard plastic-y feel of the Axe models that can be had for slightly cheaper. If you&#x27;ve ever considered the Axe Shower Tool, definitely splurge for the Dove Men+Care shower tool... you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Arrived two days ago, and put to use right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dual sided loofa/mesh poof&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliates&lt;br /&gt;Grippy/easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Small size&lt;br /&gt;Uses a lot of liquid soap&lt;br /&gt;Rubber sides collapse into itself during use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who has used mesh exfoliators for the last decade, using this is a step down in size.  Too much effort is needed due to the small size, to get the same results as a mesh pouf.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews before I bought these. So many negative ones. Works great for me. The pouf wasn&#x27;t so unbearably rough like all the nancyboys claims. Worth the price for the four pack.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I like having two different surfaces that I can use to scrub with if I&#x27;d like.  It seems to retain water well which is good for lathering up, but kind of a pain when trying to squeeze out all the soap.  I can&#x27;t think of a way to really make that better, so I can&#x27;t really complain about it either.  I enjoy the roughness, and I feel like I can tell a difference between using this and using nothing.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying it out if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
    <li> This is okay. It was a good deal and I love everything that Dove makes. But, the loofah part is pretty soft. I was looking for something more rough to get my elbows and knees. But, it doesn&#x27;t get the dead skin very well. However, the lather part works well and helps keep us fresh.</li>
    <li> Very satified with the product and the arrival,this is a hard item to find in stores,love the bulk pack and price.</li>
    <li> not enough loofa area.  rubbing yourself clean with a rubber triangle is awkward.  Useful in the gym bag for those showers.  Not recommended for use at home.</li>
    <li> Works great. My only issue is the tan scrubber. It is made of felt and I do not like the feel of felt.</li>
    <li> My son loves these.  It is a great deal when ordering several on auto ship.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the $3 ones at Walmart that look the same but have different brand names on them</li>
    <li> Why the hell would I ever need 4 loofahs?!! Am I going to gift it to people? Is it for when my guy friends come over and we all shower together?!!&lt;br /&gt;Single Dove Mens Shower Tool $3.49 as an Add on Item. Is that so hard?!!</li>
    <li> So, I got the luffa as one would probably expect, though I guess I read it wrong. I was Hoping for &amp;#34;Dove Men,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Plus care.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;No ones cared in a long time.</li>
    <li> I took a look at a lot of the critical reviews on this product before trying it out, and frankly - I&#x27;m not sure that we&#x27;re reviewing the same item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be a better solution than just a run-of-the-mill shower poof. The soft plastic part gave me a better grip on the poof and made it quicker for me to lather up. The opposite side was definitely rougher, but not like sand paper as other reviews suggested. I found it fine, even perfect, for scrubbing the bottoms of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nether side is particularly pleasant for scrubbing your most sensitive areas, or even the face for that matter, but if you&#x27;re the type of person to use shower poofs, I think this is a definite upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend on throwing one of these in my gym bag with a small bottle of body wash for those quick showers. I do think marketing it as a &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; is pretty lame, but for what it does and what it is - I have no complaints. I actually like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I tried a very similar two-sided shower &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; by Axe a couple of years ago, and I thought it was just ok. Despite looking almost identical, this Dove brand device was actually a lot better. Basically, it combines a typical mesh scrubber with an exfoliating pad, with a soft rubber rim that I suppose looks more masculine than a big poofy sponge. With the Axe tool, I always felt the rubber rim was too rough yet the exfoliating pad was too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove tool gets it right. The rubber rim is unubtrusive and soft, it doesn&#x27;t scratch or irritate me during a shower. The exfoliating side is just tough enough to make a difference,  providing a pleasant contrast to the very soft mesh side. The mesh side, although smaller than I&#x27;m used to, is high quality.  Anyone who purchases mesh scrubbers from various grocery stores will know that there is a big difference in quality (Wal-Mart versus Target, etcetera). This Dove mesh is on the upper end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging says to replace every 4 to 6 weeks, which is about average. All in all, this one worked well for me and I would consider it again.</li>
    <li> A little underwhelmed. It does have the added element of the loofah and the scrub. however I don&#x27;t know that I would pay $15 for it when you can get a regular loofah and scrubber for $3. We actually thought you could insert the soap into the loofah and THAT would have been definitely worth it</li>
    <li> Even the loofah is very coarse. If you like a soft scrub as well you will need an additional &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s also relatively small. Note that you are buying FOUR of them. Couldn&#x27;t give these things away.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been using Nivea Body Wash with a wash cloth instead of soap.  I was intrigued by the reviews of this product which compare it to a luffa but not to a wash cloth (doesn&#x27;t anybody use wash cloths anymore?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, something that was not clear to me from the product description nor the reviews: this is not Dove soap or body wash packaged inside a shower tool - you have to use some other product to make a lather, presumably a liquid body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a wash cloth, it makes more efficient use of body wash - I find I need to use much less to maintain a good lather because I can pour the body wash into the &amp;#34;luffa side&amp;#34; of this and the liquid is held by the &amp;#34;pumice side&amp;#34; and rubber holder, which forms kind of a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself wishing it had a long handle so I could scrub my back.  I don&#x27;t think this will replace my wash cloth but I do think I will look for a shower brush with a long handle.</li>
    <li> I usually by the Axe brand, because that&#x27;s what my grocery store carries, and I find this to be comparable. It&#x27;s only a little big smaller, not enough to bother me, and the rope it hangs from is longer, which is inconsequential from my point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality-wise they seem similar. I really don&#x27;t understand the complaints about the texture - it is supposed to be abrasive. I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about it being too small or lacking an extra rope, etc. Is it possible these other reviewers misunderstand how to use this too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer who also gave this product 5 stars said, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re all reviewing the same item. I cannot explain the divergence of opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a quite serviceable shower tool for men. It is about the same price as the Axe and accomplishes the same tasks. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for anyone who experiences dry skin. One side is similar to a loofa and will take off dry skin. The other side is for gentler cleansing with a nylon scrubber that produces a lot of foam.&lt;br /&gt;While this is not an extraordinary product, the dual sides make it convenient.&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism would be the need for a long handle to reach everywhere.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend already uses Dove for Men products (not that it would be necessary with this tool!), and he also uses a sponge - that&#x27;s right, an ordinary kitchen sponge - to clean himself, so I&#x27;ve been harrassing him for a while that it was time for an upgrade. When I saw this product, I immediately ordered it for him. My only concern with it is the price/durability factor, namely that for hygiene reasons I&#x27;d want to get him a new one fairly often, but for price reasons, I&#x27;d want to keep it as long as he could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what he has to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;The two faces of the sponge are great, with one side for the body and one for the feet or other hard areas, but using it on your face isn&#x27;t comfortable. The size is perfect, but the rubber (where you hold on to it to use) could be of a harder material - it&#x27;s difficult to keep a hold on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note: I&#x27;m usually skeptical about &amp;#34;male branded&amp;#34; products, but I&#x27;ve seen first hand how my boyfriend has rejected any loofah/sponge/cleaning tool on the market for being &amp;#34;too feminine.&amp;#34; For that, I welcome this!</li>
    <li> I would actually give this less than one star if I could. This product is ridiculous and completely unnecessary. It basically combines a pouf or &amp;#34;suds builder&amp;#34; with a washcloth, but is too cumbersome with small surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow I thought we were past the whole pouf-being-girly thing, especially since you can now buy them for $2-$3 in colors like black, brown, and gray. Plus, they work well, are soft, rinse easily, and fit everybody&#x27;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washcloths are also inexpensive, easy to rinse and wash, and have a good amount of surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shower tool is too big for my hands and too small for hubby&#x27;s. Add in the small surface areas of the pouf and washcloth (it is hard to reach your back with this, even if you are small), and the difficulty rinsing, and this is just a useless and unnecessary item.</li>
    <li> Makes the Axe men&#x27;s tool it&#x27;s lil bitch.  This thing rocks and is made very well!  I recommend it to anyone!  The axe one that I bought fell apart but this one is built well and is larger than the axe brand competitor.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these!!!! and the fact that I got a box of FOUR.... just perfect.. I now have have one for travel, one for home, one for the gym and an extra to spare!!</li>
    <li> I see why this is marketed for men. It is large and anyone, like me, with a small hand will have trouble using it. My husband says it is just OK and not to buy another. The poof side is no better than a $1 poof, actually a little less useful as it can&#x27;t go as many places, like between toes and fingers and the scrubby side is not nearly as good as a BufPuf.</li>
    <li> This thing is worthless!  Please, save your hard earned money.  If you decide to purchase this, good luck washing between your butt cheeks or their neighbors.  Keep trying Dove.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the multi pack pricing for this item. I like the Dove scrub brush much more then the Axe one that I was previously using. The face scrub part is much softer but not too soft. The Axe one feels like your scrubbing your face with plastic. I usually pay about $5 for just one of these. Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> This tool isn&#x27;t worth the price. It&#x27;s nothing special compared to regular shower scrubbers. I have used it for several months as I purchased a 4-pack for a fraction of the cost that it sells for today, after believing some rave reviews on here. I think the price has increased something like 40% in a year. Ridiculous! It&#x27;s basically plastic made in China most likely for 40 cents per \\&quot;tool\\&quot;. And it&#x27;s no more \\&quot;active clean\\&quot; than any other scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> really get you clean without feeling it&#x27;s taking off your hide</li>
    <li> Great tool, buff and scrubber on one easy to handle tool.  The surround is soft, like rubber, easy to grip with a rope to boot.&lt;br /&gt;I could stand for the scrubber side to be a little stiffer, but nice, none the less.  Great for the entire family.</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s a little rough on skin.  I feel like I&#x27;m using a choreboy wire pad on my body, but it fits comfortably in my hand, better than the Axe version of this.  I still miss having my regular plastic mesh.  If you&#x27;ve got tough skin and don&#x27;t mind the feeling of scrubbing your skin (i.e. you&#x27;re a mechanic with oil constantly on your hands) then this is perfect for you.  Otherwise if you rarely work with your hands, you might want to use something else.</li>
    <li> This two-sided bathing implement is really quite useful. One side is the same material as those poofs that are sold everywhere in varying colors and the other is a mild loofah-like surface. Each side has the appearance of the material that inspired it, but is different from the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poof-like side is a bit more solid than the poofs. It holds just as much suds but is more substantial in texture. While not being abrasive it is also less soft. The loofah-like side is less abrasive than an actual loofah but has more substance than the poof-side or a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single best attribute of the implement is the design. It has a rounded triangle shape that is easy to grip when using either side. It is encased in a soft rubber holder that has multiple drainage holes (especially along the bottom) to ensure that it drains well and prevent the growth of mold from retained humidity, and it has a string that makes it easy to hang to dry between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the color. The poof side is a blue-gray color that has the look of having been blue at one time and is now old and faded. I guess this is Dove&#x27;s idea of a macho color but I would have preferred that they went either in the direction of gray or of blue rather than this in-between. How is that for nit picking?</li>
    <li> Great for gentle scrubbing of dry skin areas.  I have psoriasis and this is gentle yet effective at removing any scale build up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace the Axe Detailer Shower Tool I have used for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This Dove Men+Care Dual Sided Shower Tool is very similar. A soft mesh for applying body wash and a rough scrub pad for removing ground in dirt.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Dove product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;The neutral colors fit into more bathroom color schemes compared to the black and red colors of the Axe product.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber handle fits my hand better than the knobby handle on the Axe product.&lt;br /&gt;The scrub pad is softer than the rough scrub pad on the Axe product. It has the natural appearance of a luftha, but I think it is actually a synthetic pad.</li>
    <li> It cleans, it works, what more can be said. Like the dove ones more then others since the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; side is softer; some brands are too rough for my skin.</li>
    <li> I got these to try instead of my regular shower balls I had before. The problem with these are the plastic around the poof ball blocks it from giving you area. Before when I would use the regular poof ball lathering up would be much faster. I will use them but probably would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Although I wish it was a little more cushioned to absorb soap</li>
    <li> Great body buff and loofah! Appreciated this tool to keep my husband away from my bath scrubbers - so much better than a washcloth!</li>
    <li> Bought several of these for my boyfriend after noticing he only used washclothes for the shower. He loves it and it works great! Similar to the Axe shower tool but the dove brand.</li>
    <li> This thing is a total waste of money. This scrubber has two sides, both are abrasive as hell. I felt like my skin was going to fall off after using this thing. It also doesn&#x27;t lather up no matter how much soap you put on it. Save your money and use your girlfriends shower pouf. If you already bought one, like me, use it after working on your car or dirty yard work so your girlfriend doesn&#x27;t know you are using her pouf lol.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for men. We&#x27;re able to get that great clean feeling without feeling like we&#x27;re using a loofah that&#x27;s made for women.</li>
    <li> Not sure what everybody else saying about how rough this shower tool is, it feels pretty standard but maybe not as soft as a woman&#x27;s poof. Works great with any body wash soap and comes with convenient &#x27;grips&#x27; for when you&#x27;re really scrubbing away. Overall, I wanted to exfoliate more often to try to reduce the amount of dust in my apartment. For those that don&#x27;t know, about 75%-90% of dust in your home is derived from dead skin! Pretty gross right? Anyway, I shower daily and moisturize but it didn&#x27;t seem enough, this tool exfoliates and gets me feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy so there is this stigma with guy&#x27;s and \\&quot;loofahs\\&quot;, at least just from what I&#x27;ve noticed. Axe and Dove both make these type of Hybrid Loofah&#x27;s I guess I&#x27;ll call them, but in reality these are way more effective than a washcloth or by hand if you&#x27;re using body wash; which a growing number of guys do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also hold up better than loofahs which start to fall apart after a few washes, but unfortunately these loosen up after a few washes as well, and that&#x27;s the only reason for deducting a star.</li>
    <li> Does not break down and fall apart. Soft enough where it doesn&#x27;t tear your skin apart. Holds the cleanser product and doesn&#x27;t fall out upon skin contact.</li>
    <li> I used to use Axe&#x27;s scrub, but the annoying thing about Axe is that the &amp;#34;detailer&amp;#34; part of the scrub has &amp;#34;AXE&amp;#34; written across the middle, so you&#x27;re scrubbing the uneven logo surface on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove Scrub doesn&#x27;t have the logo and the detailer surface area is much larger without feeling as harsh as the Axe scrub. I only buy these Dove scrubs now.</li>
    <li> A few people claimed the product is a bit rough, too rough to use even, but I don&#x27;t see it. Yes, it&#x27;s more rough than the puffs the ladies use but it&#x27;s not sandpaper.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the product itself, but docked a star because of cost. I understand &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, but the price is on the high side.</li>
    <li> Just kidding, you&#x27;re still a guy using a \\&quot;pouf sponge\\&quot;. Nothing wrong with that, but let&#x27;s call it what it is. I like the way it fits in your hand conveniently, so that you can really scrub your chest, upper &amp; lower back, etc. but I still can&#x27;t reach the middle of my back with this (I had to buy a disappointing back scrubber). As far as soap, this holds it well, I have finally gotten used to using the correct amount as opposed to using too much. I recommend this for a man who wants to scrub clean with something that doesn&#x27;t come in pink or electric yellow varieties. Also I would recommend not referring to this as a \\&quot;shower tool\\&quot; in the presence of women you might have staying the night, it really kills the mood...</li>
    <li> Go buy one at your local dollar store. It will get you much cleaner than this useless thing, it doesn&#x27;t even get that soapy.</li>
    <li> I have tried  many many types of bath sponges and brushes -- from loofahs and natural hemp to all sorts of synthetic materials including nylon mesh, nylon bristles, and Buff Puff-type sponges. This shower sponge from Dove is one of my all-time favorites.  What makes this so great are the two sides -- one a softer nylon mesh side and one a more abrasive material. I use both sides, applying the abrasive side to rougher areas such as heels and elbows and knees, and using the nylon mesh side for all other areas.  It&#x27;s also great because there is a firm base between the two sides AND the entire sponge is nice and thick.  This allows me to get a good firm grip on it and clean faster and more efficiently. I&#x27;ve always found those regular-type nylon mesh pouf sponges too flimsy and light to use efficiently.  I do wish it came with a detachable handle so you can use it to also wash your back. I would buy it in a second. So for now, I&#x27;ll have to keep my back brush alongside this one in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these plentiful at my local department stores, as well as in the bathrooms of some family members. I&#x27;ve always used the cheapo loofahs you can get in bulk for a buck, and just got into the routine of replacing them when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve seen Dove&#x27;s tool ubiquitously, I&#x27;ve always wanted to try it out. I finally did, but now I&#x27;m waiting for the day it craps out so I can replace it with my old standard ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, I use regular bars of soap and the loofah to lather it up. The bars of soap are of usually better quality than body wash, not to mention are they cheaper in the long run and last longer. I simply use the loofah to scrub against the the bar of soap, build a lather, and use the loofah to wash my body without having to refill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Dove tool, you get half a loofah that doesn&#x27;t maintain a lather very well. I always start with my top half, and by the time I reach my bottom half there is no soap to be found on the Dove tool. So I&#x27;ve gotten used to scrubbing the bars of soap on the other side of the tool, but that leaves little to no soap on my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the plastic board containing the two halves is a bit difficult to hold and often slips off my hand when I&#x27;m scrubbing my body. Not only that, but there&#x27;s no way this bulkier soap scrub can shrink, meaning you can&#x27;t get into certain crevices, which is pretty necessary to have a fully clean body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive for what it is, and I&#x27;m sure it works for somebody, but in my experience it doesn&#x27;t work well with me and my bars of soap. I&#x27;ll stick with the regular loofahs, even though they tear apart sooner than desired.</li>
    <li> My son said he liked these better than the Ax brand and they were a much better price with 4 in a box! :)</li>
    <li> I had one of these a while back and after about 6 months I tried the Axe shower tool as a replacement...this one is way better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s larger than the Axe one, so there&#x27;s less scrubbing involved, and it holds a lather longer.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised to see all of the negative reviews! I&#x27;ve used these for the last 3 years and it&#x27;s the only shower scrubber I&#x27;ll buy. I love it! The catch; I&#x27;m a woman. It fits my hand perfectly and I guess I like a strong/rough scrub. It&#x27;s more gentle than my dry brush though so these people that think this is a &amp;#34;Brillo pad&amp;#34; must have the most delicate skin in the world. I&#x27;ve never once thought this was rough at all?? So weird.</li>
    <li> it sucks was a one time buy. after that i said good bye!! will not buy again.</li>
    <li> A bit rough at first use, but you get used to it. It doesn&#x27;t create suds too well, but you&#x27;re not taking a shower to be a walking bubble either. Gets the job done and hard to beat the price.</li>
    <li> Power scrubbing loofahs for men! On one side, you have a pumice stone like thing to scrub all the grime off with, and on the reverse side you have a loofah to wash it all away with, leaving you power washed like a man, but clean and smooth, like, well,  a man.  Rawr! Boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> The Dove Men+Care Shower Tool takes a little getting used to. I usually used the fancy sponge thing my wife bought or a rag. The tool works really well and helps make you feel clean. My only real issue with it is that it is a tad bulky for my tastes.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men+Care Shower Tool has become an essential in my shower. Dove is a reputable manufacturer who is known for producing quality products.  I believe its Shower Tool is a useful accessory that belongs in any home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Shower Tool has a plastic loofa that is great for working a small amount of shower gel into a lather for an overall clean. This is critical for getting the most from a bottle of shower gel.  This feature alone easily pays for the Shower Tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Shower Tool has a scrubber side that is useful for targeting grime, dead skin feet and other challenging tasks. The elastic cord makes it easy to hang the Shower Tool on a fixture and keep it within easy reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Dove Men+Care Shower Tool to everyone.</li>
    <li> My dad commandeered this shower &#x27;tool&#x27;. I asked if he preferred it to his good ol&#x27; washcloth. He thought for a moment and stated that the washcloth was ideal for use with a bar of soap. Also a washcloth conformed to his body better. &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t use that &#x27;tool&#x27; to clean your ears.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; However the &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;, worked better when used with body wash.</li>
    <li> I know, it seems to only be a loofah, and it si a loofah in part, but it exfoliates with aplomb. I can definitively feel a difference when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean I feel after using it is different from cheap loofah&#x27;s and it is clearly a man&#x27;s product, so it does not get used by anyone but me. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also designed to hold soap better, so you can really lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product for men, not overpriced, and about time someone got it that we want to exfoliate as well. :-)</li>
    <li> My husband loves these shower tools, and has been using them for the past few years. He prefers them over regular &amp;#34;poofs&amp;#34;. Due to the rubber part, they are easier to hold onto when showering. The rubber part is stiff enough to hold its shape, but not so stiff to be painful when showering. There&#x27;s also a cord attached, making it easy to hang on a shower hook.</li>
    <li> Work well, clean well, holds up</li>
    <li> Yeah, this works.  Comfortable, stylish, does the job.  Axe has some too that come in different colors if you want to brighten up your shower time...</li>
