<li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  </li>

    <li> Love my angel bath gel</li>

    <li> This is my all time favorite, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 25 years and it is still my favorite, not matter what I buy I still have this</li>
    <li> This is a good size to travel with in a suitcase. Good size to have around. Angel is a very light pretty scent. Love using it in shower as a gel. Makes me smell good all over but lightly.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and lathers a lot</li>
    <li> it Was Good&lt;br /&gt;  Not What I Expected</li>
    <li> This shower gel lathers so richly and the scent is very light. I am enjoying this so much I&#x27;ve decided to try the body lotion and can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.</li>
    <li> Do not know what it is about Thierry Mugler Angel products that makes them so special, but man-o-man do I like this fragrance.  Guess it is the combination of the citrus and vanilla scents, maybe mostly the vanilla, that are so darned appealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it is probably the great combination of the fragrance as worn by the woman I love and have been married to for a couple decades now. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago my wife was given a gift of the Angel perfume and she really liked it. Once she realized how much I liked it, she continued to branch out to the shower gels and body lotions too.  Since they can sometimes be tough to find in the store, we are very glad that they are readily available here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the products are high quality, leaving no residue or greasy feeling at all. a little goes a long way too, so you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - try this, you will like it if you like vanilla-based scents. If you are a dude, I am telling you now to go ahead and get this as a gift as your lady will like it. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>
    <li> i love this scent and have been wearing it off and on for 10 years...  the shower gel has just enough scent left on ones skin after a shower or bath..  soft scent without overpowering others around you....  wonderful!</li>
    <li> i like it  i like the scent</li>
    <li> I have loved Angel since it debuted! It has become my signature scent. Everyone I work with remarks how good, clean or amazing it smells. This is the first Angel shower gel I have purchased and it does not disappoint. The two together are not overwhelming and that is a great thing, even after I moisturize  with almond oil. I will be purchasing more of this shower gel!!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance that will last all day.</li>
    <li> Smells nice!! I enjoy this product!</li>
    <li> smells like the perfume, what a crazy idea! who would&#x27;ve thought that up, they&#x27;re genius! Sheer genius! I probably should&#x27;ve gone to college.</li>
    <li> Gave for a present and it was to a very happy person who got it I need to order another for myself</li>
    <li> Love this shower gel. I discovered Angel when I was 17, I&#x27;m 25 now. I love this perfume. Tried the shower gel for the first time today and it smells wonderful in the shower. I didn&#x27;t want to leave my bathroom, it smelt so good. You don&#x27;t need much, so this should last me at least a month if I use it every day. It doesn&#x27;t lather like, lets say, bath and body works, but I prefer it this way. I applied some angel perfume and now 20 min later, it&#x27;s the only thing I smell.</li>
