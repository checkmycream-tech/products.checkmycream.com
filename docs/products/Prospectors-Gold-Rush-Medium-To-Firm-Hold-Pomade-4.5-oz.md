    <li> I like this hair product because it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair overly hard and smells good. Works much better then the oil based product that I was using previously and washes out much easier.</li>
    <li> All natural, really?  Take a look at the ingredients and decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  It smells great, holds well, lasts all day, and easily washes out.  Oh, and there&#x27;s no flaking!  It is much better than the Axe pomade, which admittedly is the only pom I have to compare it to.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best water based (ringing gel) pomade I have used. The scent took me time to get used to but I&#x27;m really liking it. It stays with you all day. The hold is wonderful and I love the tin! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff! I bought more today!</li>
    <li> This is my go to pomade right now. The hold is decent, I have longer hair on top that I slick back and at times it does fall out of place. Unfortunately remolding it with water doesn&#x27;t always do the trick. I also love the barbershop smell. The can claims &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; but when you flip it over and look at the ingredients.. it&#x27;s far from. Not sure how that works. Four stars for now because I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite pomade. Easy to work in your hair, and the hold is great. The smell is amazing as lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, medium hold, extremely easy to wash out. Unfortunately the smell was the deal breaker.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff! Nothing else holds his hair as well as this. He can sleep on his hair and wake up looking just as good as he did the day before, but it still washes out easily! Pleasant smell, great texture, and neat packaging concept.</li>
    <li> A newer brand, but easily the highest quality water-based product I have used. Hemp oil helps the hair/scalp to actually get healthier with use, something you can feel every time you rinse this stuff out. Nice, clean barbershop scent that lingers for most of the day but doesn&#x27;t overpower. Overall, I have tried dozens of water-based pomades (Layrite, Imperial, Railcar, Ruezel, Suavecito) and none are as easy or pleasing to work with. Low shine, high hold goodness in one of the coolest looking tins around.</li>
    <li> Better than suavecito,  layrite, and imperial. Smells great, works better than other pomades I&#x27;ve tried</li>

    <li> Great product and best water-based pomade I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Great hold, yet still flexible and long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;No flakes.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in place all day!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great- it&#x27;s got a pretty strong hold for not being a &#x27;extra firm&#x27; hold pomade- and it&#x27;s got the best smell of any pomade I&#x27;ve used. Not like coconut or overly sweet crap a lot of pomades smell like- nice and clean and like a barbershop. This is now my go to pomade.</li>
    <li> I like the smell personally... It is a very unique manly smell, but in a good way! It has a very good hold and is very easy to wash out and doesn&#x27;t cause you to break out unlike oil based pomades. It is a bit expensive yes.... but it works very well, better than crew! They just released a new strong hold version which works very well!</li>
    <li> Great product. This is the only product that keeps my pomp styled all day</li>
    <li> Dries out quickly, does not re-comb/reactivate well. The smell isn&#x27;t all that pleasant. It&#x27;s not worth the price reuzel red or Layeite are leaps and bounds better.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing pomade and I love the way it works. BUT...the smell is a deal breaker. Described to me by co-worker and girlfriend as smelling like bug spray. Smell was potent enough that it bothered co-worker in an open space office. Totally bummed, hope they work on it in the future.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Water based so a quick rinse washes all the product out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells great, holds well and the packaging is great. It&#x27;s easier to work with than Suavecito. It&#x27;s also easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> great hold/shine and smell , very little flake</li>
    <li> its ok but you have to continue brushing water through it to keep the intended style you want</li>
