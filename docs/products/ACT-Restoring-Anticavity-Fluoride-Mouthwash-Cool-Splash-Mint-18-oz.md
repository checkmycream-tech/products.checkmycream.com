      <li>/&gt;Great flavor, great price, fantastic results!</li>
      <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t rinse out a layer of your mouth tissue like most mouth rinse do.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and is really works!  </li>
      <li>Costco used to carry ACT, but they now sell their own brand, which is okay, but not as pleasant tasting.</li>
      <li>I have been using this in conjunction with Dr. Wilson&#x27;s Restore toothpaste, and the results have been amazing.</li>
      <li>My mouth has undergone an amazing ph-balance transformation.</li>
      <li>Leaves my teeth looking nice, and my breath smelling nice.</li>
      <li>Nice minty taset.</li>
      <li>This mouthwash is not approved by the ADA,  meaning it is not proven to be effective towards building enamel</li>
      <li>Loving it.</li>
      <li>I was kind of scared</li>
      <li>Too many people are spoiled by Listerine and Scope.</li>
      <li>but it got even more stronger to the point where it burned my tongue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll make sure my dentist knows this...</li>
      <li>MANY COMPLIMENTS TO MY TEETH</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing she had receding gums on the top teeth on the side because of it.</li>
      <li>Most mouth washes are TWICE a day though</li>
      <li>but make sure to buy the 18oz because it has more fluoride</li>
      <li>and I see no reason why I shouldn&#x27;t keep buying more when the time comes.</li>
      <li>- Pleased with the ACT Mouthwash</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, my teeth feels more polished, and my breath feels more refreshed.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels a lot cleaner and fresher when I finish which leaves me confident the product did what it is supposed to</li>
      <li>I have not gotten any more ulcers, the pain is somehow minimized.</li>
      <li>Love this rinse for strengthening my teeth.</li>
      <li>What more do you want from a mouthwash?</li>
      <li>Love that it does not burn your mouth and love the flavor.</li>
      <li>My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  </li>
      <li>My favorite mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Everything else, it for sure helped.</li>
      <li>Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it</li>
      <li>one point I decided I should make my dentist&#x27;s life easier and take care of my teeth better.</li>
      <li>I feel like if people were getting their teeth brown from this, more people would be writing reviews by now about it.</li>
      <li>made sure to brush twice a day, and I still got cavities.</li>
      <li>and I didnt realize that so many bottles were included in that price.  </li>
      <li>The product is one I prefer to use, and when I learned that it could be purchased on Amazon and delivered to my front door cheaper than buying it a a big box store, I was impressed.</li>
      <li>Use Subscribe &amp; Save for an even better deal.</li>
      <li>I love that I can stock up on mouthwash on amazon</li>
      <li>but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel mouth refreshing after each rinse</li>
      <li>I bought this having read Brian Johnston&#x27;s review at the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I love the deal I got for the four pack of them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a peppermint than spearmint.</li>
      <li>ACT is my favorite mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Fresh breath &amp; good oral hygiene, use this &amp; a strong ADA approved mouthwash &amp; enjoy !</li>
      <li>but I am very pleased with how this mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling fresh for hours after use.</li>
      <li>These seemed like a pretty good deal for 4 of them</li>
      <li>Stick to the original!</li>
      <li>cool mint feels good in my mouth, which means I don&#x27;t spit it out before getting full benefit from the flouride.  </li>
      <li>easier on the mouth than most washes, doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like listering or others, the flavor is very nice and it does help with sensitive teeth, i use it with pronamel</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps your breath fresh, very convenient, and easy to use...one of my favorite mouthwashes...would buy again in the future, thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use after flossing helps remineralize enamel and prevent interproximal decay.  If you want to prevent tooth decay this product is an optimum chouce for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal. A lot of the time, you don&#x27;t necessarily save money from purchasing items such as this from Amazon. That&#x27;s not true in this case. I save at least $2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, keep in mind that this is the ONCE A DAY version. Most mouth washes are TWICE a day though so you may not be expecting that. Because of that, I recommend using it BEFORE going to bed (and after brushing your teeth + flossing). That way it&#x27;s active all night long with no food touching your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people use this at night, and then a twice-a-day mouth wash in the morning, which is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way: the taste isn&#x27;t bad and (in my opinion) it isn&#x27;t harsh on your mouth so do not worry about the typical burning sensation you experience with other mouth washes. I personally like that feeling, but hey, some people don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> At my dental cleaning in Dec 12 my dentist told me I had some soft spots.&lt;br /&gt;He told me to start using Act.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to do a review until I had used the product for a while and...&lt;br /&gt;Six months later, I had my six month exam, x rays, cleaning and my soft spots are gone.&lt;br /&gt;Yayy....ACT rules.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended, we use daily, but e were lays running out. Now we have it on subscribe and save it comes like clockwork to the door, perfect!</li>
    <li> I have always had sensitive, fairly brittle teeth.  I was fairly desperate and looking for something to help them, and half-heartedly tried Act Restore.  I noticed an immediate difference, with my teeth less sensitive.  I am very happy with this product, and will probably use it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Just to clarify from previous reviews, the product listed has \\&quot;non-diluted\\&quot; (once a day) 0.05% sodium fluoride and does contain 11% alcohol as listed in the inactive ingredients.  Having had a \\&quot;toothpaste diet\\&quot; suggested to me by my dentist for receding gums, this product was just what I was looking for and a great deal compared to the ~$7/bottle from CVS or Target for the same rinse.</li>
    <li> My teeth have suddenly started having troubles, so I picked this up, and it does seem to be helping. I do wish it didn&#x27;t have lots of artificial flavors and colors, but oh well. Do make sure you check the specific bottle you&#x27;re buying---this should have .05% fluoride (this size does list that); some larger sizes are diluted to .025% --- half-strength, when you&#x27;re likely to assume, since the labeling is largely the same, that you&#x27;re getting the same product. The taste is a bit medicinal at first, but I found I got used to it.</li>
    <li> ALSO RECOMMENDED BY MY DENTIST OFFICE AND HAS A PLEASANT TASTE.</li>
    <li> My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  He recommended to me these following products:    1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),   2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)   3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).    4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson &amp; Johnson  5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.   This is the regiment he advised me to follow:  1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.  2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it&#x27;s the best time of day for using fluoride.  3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.  4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \\&quot;glides\\&quot; right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \\&quot;grips\\&quot; the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it&#x27;s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don&#x27;t even think about it!  5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don&#x27;t have to wonder \\&quot;did I brush good enough\\&quot;. It tells you when you are done!  CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!    I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \\&quot;the tunnel\\&quot; using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!  I wish you happy, healthy teeth!</li>
    <li> My dentist loves it, so it must be working</li>
    <li> I found little black bugs floating around at the bottom of my brand new, factory sealed act restoring mouth wash. As I said, it was still FACTORY SEALED. Good thing I noticed it before I opened and USED the product. I sent ACT an email and am taking the bottle back to the store for a refund but since this obviously happened inside one of the factories i&#x27;m sure there are other bottles out there with the same thing in them so please be careful. if you own this, check it thoroughly before using it or just throw it out and don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> I have added this mouthwash to my subscribe and save item list. I have always used Listerine mouthwash but I am very pleased with how this mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling fresh for hours after use.</li>
    <li> I volunteered as a patient for a dental student who was trying to pass his dental exam to become a dentist, and he and his professor recognized immediately that I was using a fluoride mouthwash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for the last two years, and it has done wonders to my teeth. I actually only started using it because my roommate insists on using a Brita filter for water instead of boiling water, and I was worried about the loss of fluoride from filtered water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my teeth feels more polished, and my breath feels more refreshed. I can&#x27;t speak for its anti-cavities property because I haven&#x27;t gotten a cavity since I was a kid, but I really recommend this mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t sting as bad as Listerine, and it definitely feels like there&#x27;s an improvement in my teeth, unlike with Colgate or Crest mouthwash (yes, I&#x27;ve tried them all).</li>
    <li> easier on the mouth than most washes, doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like listering or others, the flavor is very nice and it does help with sensitive teeth, i use it with pronamel</li>
    <li> MY DENTIST ORIGINALLY TOLD ME TO GET ACT YEARS AGO AND I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT SINCE.  THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS GREAT FOR ENAMEL RESTORATION, TRUST ME ...  I HAVE BRUSHED SO MUCH OF THE ENAMEL RIGHT OFF MY FRONT TEETH FROM ACIDIC JUICE POPS STAINS &amp; DOCTORS ARE VERY HESITANT TO VENEER THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL MY OWN NATURAL TEETH, CARE FOR IMPLICITLY ALL MY LIFE.  THEY WERE ALSO WEAKENED FROM A BIKE ACCIDENT SO THAT DOESN&#x27;T HELP THE SHAPE THEY ARE IN -&gt;BUT ACT DOES &amp; IT REALLY WORKS!!  LAST VISIT MY DENTIST SAID SHE SAW A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVMENT &amp; SO HAVE I IN THE MIRROR -&gt; FOR REAL!!  MANY COMPLIMENTS TO MY TEETH ALSO &amp; I LOVE THAT!!</li>
    <li> It gives that extra clean feeling after using it for about a week every day, twice a day and also that added benefit of minty freshness. I wish they made it in a clear formula even though the blue is a very pretty color.</li>
    <li> Not as rough as Listerine and leave a fresh feel to your teeth and tongue.</li>
    <li> - Pleased with the ACT Mouthwash as much as more expensive brands&lt;br /&gt;- 4 Pack means it will last a while without having to reorder&lt;br /&gt;- Taste is not strong as some, but not weak either. It seems to be a medium level of strength to it.&lt;br /&gt;-Does it protect your teeth better than other brands? Hard to tell, but had no cavities at last dentist visit since using it, which is a good sign!&lt;br /&gt;- Fast shipping from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really clean well. I didn&#x27;t feel mouth refreshing after each rinse and it also leaves a light blue stein on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Dr. Katz TheraBreath Oral Rinse, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2). Works great and doesn&#x27;t rinse out a layer of your mouth tissue like most mouth rinse do.</li>
    <li> It works for me, my dentist recommended this. I always like ACT.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT TO PROTECT TEETH.  AS WE AGE WE LOOSE OUR PROTECTIVE COATING AND THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO HELP.</li>
    <li> I have been informed by a dentist that ACT Restoring offers no therapeutic benefit beyond original formula ACT, and the added chemicals may cause gum irritation.  Stick to the original!</li>
    <li> I started using ACT few months ago after a dentist visit. They said I should floss better/more often and use a fluoride mouthwash to help keep the enamel from eroding. A more recent visit has shown a good improvement so I&#x27;m definitely happy with the ACT mouthwash. That said, this stuff tastes pretty nasty and that makes it hard to avoid rinsing/drinking which you&#x27;re not supposed to do</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the green flavored stuff all that much, and this Cool Splash Mint is delightful. It&#x27;s a very subtle minty flavor that&#x27;s just right before bed.</li>
    <li> I buy this in bulk to help restore my enamel.</li>
    <li> An excellent mouth wash for anyone who suffers from dry mouth and the extra amount of fluoride is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Extra fluoride helps your teeth fend of the erosion that tends to show up around your gumline and dental work as you age.  Your dentist may suggest that you use this highest-fluoride-content-you-can-get-without-a-prescription mouthwash. It tastes fine.  Rinse once a day, right before going to bed, and do not drink water afterwards.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for about a year, and the results are starting to show in my check-ups.  (You can use this like a mouthwash too...it&#x27;s formulated to work as a breath enhancer.  But the key is...not more than once a day.  ACT has lower fluoride formula mouthwashes if you want to rinse twice a day)</li>
    <li> My dentist recommneded me use this rinse for the flouride content.  I can&#x27;t stand listering as it is, too spicy.  This does not pack the kick listerine does but we are using it to add that extra flouride to our enamel.  Plus many rinses don&#x27;t trully kill the microbes in our mouth, they simply just aid in dislodging them from your teeth.  So don&#x27;t forget to brush and floss.</li>
    <li> Fresh and kissable! Oh yeah, and I&#x27;m single! I like the portion control lid. I feel like I am constantly buying mouthwash at the store. So I figured I might as well buy multi-pack and save a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> Works well for me and includes the flouride recommended by my dentist plus. If that wasn&#x27;t enough it tastes good too.</li>
    <li> We (my wife and I) order a four pack of these approximately every 2.5 months.  These don&#x27;t have the regulator nozzle the other Act products have which leads to a little more usage, however this brand has the best taste, makes your mouth feel fresh, and contains fluoride.  The downfall is that it does contain alcohol but I&#x27;ve gotten used to rinsing my mouth with water afterwards.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been buying the bulk mouthwash from a local warehouse distribution store, but bought this one just to try something new.  So far I&#x27;m a believer.  Mouth feels fresh afterwards without the stinging sensation from alcohol based mouthwashes.  Instructions say to use it once a day too, which saves time of using it twice a day which other brands suggest.  Loving it.</li>
    <li> My dentist said that I had a couple areas that I should watch out for and should you this to make sure they dont become cavaties and it really seems to work, no cavities yet.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It feels great, it taste great and it&#x27;s the iconic blue color I grow up. I love the deal I got for the four pack of them.</li>
    <li> I used amazon prime when ordering these which meant they were at my door literally the next door, didn&#x27;t even have to wait the 2 days! Love this mouthwash, seems to be much better than the other brands I have tried and the price Amazon offers them at can&#x27;t be beat, trust me I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I started using this a few years ago because my dentist recommended it.  I had never been a big believer in mouthwash for anything other than fresh beath - I was very wrong....  I have not had a single cavity since I started using this particular product.  My mouth has undergone an amazing ph-balance transformation.</li>
    <li> The product is one I prefer to use, and when I learned that it could be purchased on Amazon and delivered to my front door cheaper than buying it a a big box store, I was impressed. I will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mouthwash, what can I say?  It doesn&#x27;t disable your ability to taste anything for 24 hours like the Crest Pro-health.  But realistically I just get this stuff because the Fluoride content is higher than anything else off the shelf.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash, has helped with some sensitivity problems I had in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these alot</li>
    <li> This rinse works very well, leaves your mouth feeling well protected. Not a strong medicine taste either.</li>
    <li> Fluoride is there in toothpaste and drinking water. But I need in higher concentrations which this product ACT provides. Great post-brushing rinse to protect your teeth and improve sensitivity. Do it every night. 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> I start using mouthwash a month ago. This is my first one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because of the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It seems good for my teeth!</li>
    <li> This fluoride rinse works best if you could hold off on eating a bit after use.  Topical fluoride is good for tooth enamel without the potential problems of ingested fluoride supplements (or fluoridated tap water--yuck!). Taste is fine.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED ACT MOUTHWASH BEFORE AND FOUND IT TO BE FINE.  HOWEVER, THIS STUFF IS ONE THAT TESTS THE TASTE BUDS.  CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SPIT IT OUT ONCE PLACING SOME IN MY MOUTH.  TO THINK I BOUGHT FOUR BOTTLES OF THE STUFF AS PART OF THE DEAL.  HOPEFULLY, IT WORKS AS WELL AS IT DOESN&#x27;T TASTE.</li>
    <li> I just checked for myself at the drugstore and it turns out it&#x27;s true that the 32 oz is nothing more than watered down mouthwash.  The 32oz has .02% fluroid while the 18 oz has .05% (more than twice the strength of the watered down version)     I&#x27;ll make sure my dentist knows this...</li>
    <li> I like this mouth wash but it&#x27;s not as strong as I&#x27;d like it.  The taste isn&#x27;t great but the after taste is a little better.  It doesn&#x27;t give you that strong taste that Listerine does so if you don&#x27;t like that strong taste then this may be for you.  My mouth still feels very clean and fresh after.  Probably going back to Listerine after this is gone though!</li>
    <li> works well - negative is the blue stuff will drip down from cap after re-sealing and eventually gums up the bottom (sticks to and lifts the shelf in my medicine cabinet)</li>
    <li> I like it, does the job but prefer the green mint flavor one.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I had a hard time with super sensitive teeth.  It turns out the Crest 3D Whitening toothpaste that I used was working too hard on the sides of my molars, and I was brushing too hard, leading to gum recession and lots of toothaches and sensitivity.  My dentist even tried painting my tooth with something to help the sensitivity, but it didn&#x27;t last very long, and the aches and pains came back.  My husband uses ACT Restoring, and I thought, why not give it a try?  Within a week of swishing for at least a minute after every brushing (twice a day), my teeth were feeling much better, and the aches stopped!  I&#x27;m definitely a believer in this product, and I was able to find it at the lowest price on Amazon.  Use Subscribe &amp; Save for an even better deal.</li>
    <li> Good quality mouth wash.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this a few years ago and it has been an asset to my dental health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved ACT&#x27;s refreshing taste without the super burn I get from other mouthwash. It really has helped with my gum sensitivity and occasional &amp;#34;funky breath&amp;#34; (let&#x27;s face it-- everyone&#x27;s breath can smell like rotten squid at times). Prompt delivery as well.</li>
    <li> Does not have too much alcohol and provides fluoride since I have a well, so do not get any fluoride from drinking water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a strong believer in this product and I have a few stories to tell. First let me clear the air about somethings that I noticed in other reviews, that I didn&#x27;t even know about the product itself and people are giving it 1 stars because they write it off before even trying it. I hate reviews like that.    CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride) - I didn&#x27;t even know about this ingredient, let alone it was in the mouthwash. I learned it&#x27;s put in pesticides and people automatically assume you&#x27;re going to die because it&#x27;s in the mouth wash. Firstly, as an adult you shouldn&#x27;t be swallowing this anyway, and secondly, it&#x27;s in pesticides because its an antiseptic. It fights bacteria. Antibacterial soap is on the market, that can kill bugs. Will that stop you from using it? Or soap in general? No.    Now about those brown stains or turning your teeth black... I&#x27;ve used this product for years, I never got it. My dentist always tells me good job, and really likes my teeth and my oral health. I feel like if people were getting their teeth brown from this, more people would be writing reviews by now about it. Also dentist wouldn&#x27;t be recommending this either. That&#x27;s just my thoughts on that...    Alcohol content 11% - I didn&#x27;t even know this product had alcohol in it. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it, unlike Listerine (which I don&#x27;t like anymore, too strong for nothing). I use to use Listerine (and went back and forth with it) and at first I liked it, then I don&#x27;t know if they changed something but it got even more stronger to the point where it burned my tongue. I don&#x27;t mind it being strong but it feels like it was actually stripping away at my teeth and mouth... that&#x27;s not good.    Anyway, I feel like ACT is gentle. Also I have no issue with the taste, I don&#x27;t know why people say it&#x27;s bad. It tastes like a regular fluoride rinse from the dentist. Too many people are spoiled by Listerine and Scope. This mouthwash is for the general health of your mouth, not to mask your bad breath to be mintyso the whole world can smell it now.    Now for some stories. I just got out of the dentist office, and everything was GREAT! Dentist was happy about my teeth and overall oral health. If anything she really complimented me and that kind of inflated my ego. I mean she even said \\&quot;we should switch teeth!\\&quot;. I thought well damn, my teeth can take care of itself then. I now did stupid stuff like brush once a day, sometimes I even only brushed when I went out and would miss 1-2 days overall. Six months rolled around for my next check up, and I realize I have been disgusted with myself. I even forgot I had the ACT mouthwash. So I went to my regular routine. Floss, brush, ACT before bed time. Did it a week before my check up. I was kind of scared my dentist would ask me what the hell did I do? Thing is I noticed nothing was really wrong with my teeth, as in no cavities, gum issues, but I thought it might have looked worse than my last check up.    The verdict? Dentist tells me keep doing what I&#x27;m doing. Heck, my check up was shorter than last time. Just some plaque that I always have on the bottom teeth because of deposits. Everything else was fine and dandy. I really do credit ACT for putting my mouth back to shape in like a week. In other words, this is good for neglect! Haha. Now obviously, results vary. I did not have bad teeth to begin with.    Another story I have is actually with my mom. I think she brushed too hard or something and her gum started to hurt. I&#x27;m guessing she had receding gums on the top teeth on the side because of it. She never used mouth washes, and I told her to try the ACT. Low and behold, few days later she says it has improved and it&#x27;s helping her. The pain has reduced and she keeps saying \\&quot;its helping!\\&quot; everytime she steals it from me. She continues to use it today as well.    Damn this was long. Btw, I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought it at the store. I never really thought to buy it in bulk, but I do own the ACT Restoring Cool Mint.    Theonly thing I am skeptical of is the rebuilding enamel. I don&#x27;t think it does. I mean again, my teeth feel smooth and polished, but I read somewhere it&#x27;s impossible to rebuild enamel. Once it&#x27;s gone, that&#x27;s it. I never had enamel problems before so I can&#x27;t confirm if it did help or not. Everything else, it for sure helped. Gums, teeth, never got cavities while using this. I haven&#x27;t had any cavities since I was 7-8 years old though.    Overall, I would say give this a try. Use it for a few months, 4-6 months if your mouth is in bad shape. Heck, you will probably see results in the first few weeks. Also buy the 18oz, cause this stuff is actually pretty expensive and the bigger bottle you have to use it TWICE a day (less fluoride content with each dosage). With smaller bottle, just use it once before bed.    Just some background and my mouth routine. I have good teeth, didn&#x27;t take care of it as a child, had cavities very young just because I ate so much sugar and bad food without brushing. As I got older, reduced sweets and took care of my teeth, but it wasn&#x27;t anything special. Got braces, couldn&#x27;t brush properly, got swollen gums, bloody because of it. Got lot of calculus build up too, that was the worst years of life for my mouth not counting by 8 year old cavities. I got a dental clean up after, same dentist was very concerned about my gums. Like a year later I fixed all of that, I don&#x27;t remember if I used ACT or not, but heck 5 years later with ACT and regular routine, its at the best ever.    Routine - floss once at night, brush twice a day with some regular colgate tooth paste (I don&#x27;t even care about the type, I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference as long as it fights cavities), ACT restoring mouth wash BEFORE bed, once a day. BOOM! That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> we have been buying this for years.  Price used to be good but now it is much more expensive.</li>
    <li> Nothing with restore your enamel but this product does strengthen and &amp;#34;remineralize&amp;#34; sensitive spots. Over the years my dental cleanings became so painful it was unbearable.  I looked into many products and stumbled upon this one a few months ago hoping for a miracle.  To be honest I was not all that optimistic but really needed to try something new.  Of course, you do not see results immediately; that is unrealistic.  However, over time (3 months or so) I began to notice that cold beverages didn&#x27;t effect the usual sensitive spots but the mindblowing results were realized once I had my dental teeth cleaning.  It was amazing in that there was at least a 90% reduction in pain and during my last visit there was no pain.  I would recommend using this product for at least 3 to 5 months before making your own decision because it is eventually worth it!</li>
    <li> This is highly recommended by our dentist. We go through the 4 pack once a month and have it on subscribe and save. Very happy with the purchase and great price.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use ACT to help strengthen my teeth, but said to be sure to get the one with no alcohol because it&#x27;s hard on the tissues in your mouth (I am no expert, but that&#x27;s what he told me). I read the description of this product to make sure I got the right one, but apparently I should have read the reviews instead. The product description says alcohol free, but it is NOT. There&#x27;s nothing else wrong with this product. I&#x27;m just irritated that I spent the money to buy four bottles when it&#x27;s apparently not the product I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it looks like they have updated the product description since I wrote this review so it no longer says that it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
    <li> Here is my story:&lt;br /&gt;I go to the dentist every 6 months.  I floss and brush on a regular basis.  One day I was chewing on something and a small piece of my tooth cracked off.  I read the label on this product and decided to use it and ONLY use it to see how effective it is.  That being said....... This is  the only mouthwash to use!  I have been using this product for two years.  It really does strengthen teeth and make them less susceptible to  damage.  I have had no issues since I have been using this product.  I have noticed that all the soft sensitive spots have gotten better as well.</li>
    <li> Wow!!  Came fast and I didnt realize that so many bottles were included in that price.  Good deal!!  Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Works. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Liked very much really a great price for 3 bottles use it everyday</li>
    <li> Just watched the ACT Restoring Mouthwash commercial on TV.  First it shows a pic of holes in the enamel caused by coffee???,  Then it shows ACT repairing the enamel back to new condition.  I don&#x27;t think so!  The ad is just too unbelieveable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and is really works!  for years i didnt floss my teeth properly through out my childhood and teen years.  now im an adult and wish i had been cause my x rays showed  soft spots in between my teeth.  they weren&#x27;t cavities but the beginnings before the cavities started.  so i started flossing with dentek comfort clean/triple clean floss twice daily.  and that kept it under control for years.  the dentist said flossing will slow or stop the rotting process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years of flossing i saw a commercial on TV about this stuff.  and decided to try it.  i had 4 soft spots.  in less than 6 months of using it  this stuff brought it back to 1!  the dentist didnt even recognize my Xray! and  she asked me what i was doing differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thats my story :P  i highly recommend this stuff!  and i havent tried it yet but Colgate has released a calcium replacing tooth restoring paste recently. i would try that in conjunction with this product for best results if your teeth are getting weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moral of the story just remember to floss.  no matter what the internet saids.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me that I need to use this product.  So, I bought it here on Amazon for a killer price and use it when I remember.  It is a great size and fits in my medicine cabinet on the wall.</li>
    <li> I really do like the fact that I can order these in a four-pack supply.  I like this particular brand and mint flavor and it is not always&lt;br /&gt;available at my store.  It arrives in two or three days and is packaged extremely well.</li>
    <li> Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
    <li> Nice minty taset. Leaves mouth clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> ACT is unlike other mouthwashes. So we use both kinds. ACT is a specific product that gives a positive restoring action. You can actually feel it working. At least twice a day we rinse with this &amp; also regular hard core mouthwash. Obviously at different times so each product has a chance to work properly. It makes such a difference in our lives, we rarely ever get a cold year round. Fresh breath &amp; good oral hygiene, use this &amp; a strong ADA approved mouthwash &amp; enjoy !</li>
    <li> Kids like the taste and its dispenser.</li>
    <li> I feel this product working immediately when using it. It give me a clean mouth feeling without the harsh feeling. All this while fight cavities.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extreme canker sores. They&#x27;re awful. My friend recommended this product to help my discomfort when I declined a lunch date, trying to gracefully bow out. Hiding behind my shame &amp; raw agony. This product seems to help- I have not gotten any more ulcers, the pain is somehow minimized. It seems like a miracle!!!</li>
    <li> I got these to qualify for super saver shipping.  Act mouthwash is part of my daily routine and makes me feel great.  The smaller 18 oz bottles are easier to deal with and pack a higher fluoride punch than the 33 oz version.</li>
    <li> Great fluoride protection  Has a good taste that doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.  I plan on sticking with ACT Restoring Mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been totally sold on the notion of fluoride keeping your teeth from developing cavities, probably because the scientific evidence behind it is so ambiguous and under-exemplified. Not that I&#x27;d call myself a full-blown conspiracist, but I do find the notion of fluoride being inserted into municipal water supplies a bit odd(?) since the research typically shoes that topical application of sodium fluoride helps harden tooth enamel, as opposed to ingestion. I also tend to feel better about using health products that err on the side of natural (i.e. no artificial chemicals which I can&#x27;t pronounce).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m also someone with pretty bad teeth which I can thank my mother for. At 23, I&#x27;ve got one molar gone and another one capped, and I didn&#x27;t feel like going through any of that again (or losing any more of my natural teeth), so I decided to start using this mouthwash as a part of my oral hygiene routine in place of the Tom&#x27;s mouthwash I&#x27;d been using (which did little else beside fight breath odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this mouthwash for about a month, I have to admit that I am surprised at how different my teeth feel— they are considerably smoother to the touch, almost as if the surface enamel has been polished/smoothed out. I&#x27;ve also noticed that several spots, particularly on my front teeth, which were decalcified, have considerably diminished in appearance— they seem to be fading away and blending in with the rest of the color of the tooth. I can only presume that this is due to remineralization that has been brought about by using this mouthwash every night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the Tom&#x27;s toothpaste I use, and daily flossing, my teeth seem to be in better shape than they have been in a long time, and the only thing that&#x27;s changed is I have started using this mouthwash. I&#x27;m still skeptical about fluoride in general, but I have to say that I have noticed a visible and palpable difference in my teeth since I started rinsingwith this, which leads me to believe that the topical application of fluoride actually is beneficial to the surface of your teeth— still not sold on ingesting it, but that&#x27;s why I have well water.</li>
    <li> Use this in the evening before going to bed and leaves mouth feeling ffesh and clean, recommend it for use</li>
    <li> ACT is my favorite mouthwash. I like that it leaves my breath fresh - and for a long time. This is my favorite flavor (cool mint). It&#x27;s more of a peppermint than spearmint. I also like that it contains fluoride - to help protect again cavities.  I highly recommend this brand and flavor for those who like having a fresh, clean mouth.</li>
    <li> I really love this mouthwash. In the past I had been using a mouthwash that burned, numbed my mouth, and took away some of my sense of taste! (Crest Prohealth). Absolutely horrible. I threw the mostly unused product in the trash (as much as I hate to waste - it was that bad), and looked up some reviews for what mouthwash I could trust. This one came up and I&#x27;m so happy with my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having lots of teeth issues lately, including a possible pending root canal following a botched filling. All this even though I take great care of my teeth. I know I need something to strengthen my enamel, since these issues are hereditary for me. I have been using this in conjunction with Dr. Wilson&#x27;s Restore toothpaste, and the results have been amazing. This mouthwash tastes great, NO BURN!, and leaves me mouth feeling great with no altered taste. My teeth feel and look clean, and this feels very soothing on my sore/sensitive parts. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It might have worked, but it tasted gross so I stopped using it and went back to Listerine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mouthwash - it washes my mouth and leaves my mouth feeling clean after. What more do you want from a mouthwash? Doesn&#x27;t hurt that it comes with fluoride (I&#x27;m a big fan of it). If you are looking for a mouth wash that offers the three things I mentioned above then you should probably order some.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to experiment. I had a cavity, and I decided I wanted to try to get rid of it instead of go to the dentist, since I HATE the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started using this product when I brushed in the morning and at night. I don&#x27;t know much about CPCs or whatnot, but my teeth didn&#x27;t turn black. In fact, after using for two days, I no longer had that painful stabbing sensation when I drank cold water. I could chew my food again. I continued to use it, and I have not had a problem with this cavity since. So needless to say, ACT is now a part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> It may be #1 among dentists, but the stores are gung ho for Crest, Colgate, Listerine and Scope mouthwashes, and have no room on their shelves for Act. I can order it from Safeway on line, but I can get multiple packs easier from Amazon and with free shipping. I chose this for the cool mint but find it does have alcohol and so has a lot of bite to it. I may order the kind without the alcohol next time, but with four large bottles on hand, that may be awhile. I like that it has fluoride so I can avoid those $135 treatments at Dental Village, and that it tells you to swish it in your mouth for a full minute as opposed to 30 seconds for the other mouthwashes I had bought in the store. 60 seconds is a long time for my cheek muscles, but they will get into shape with daily workouts. My mouth feels a lot cleaner and fresher when I finish which leaves me confident the product did what it is supposed to and I see no reason why I shouldn&#x27;t keep buying more when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist. These should last several months. Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;and tastes fine. Measuring cup built in to the cap.</li>
    <li> Been using this mouthwash on recommendation from my dentist, and have been preventing cavities for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that these 18oz bottles have a higher concentration (.05%) of Sodium Fluoride than the 32oz bottles available on Amazon (with .02%). I would not use that diluted formula, which won&#x27;t have the same effects as the more powerful .05% formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great flavor, great price, fantastic results!</li>
    <li> I love ACT (especially the once daily use bottles). This deal is fantastic. 4 bottles for this price? Normally you can get 2 1/2 for this price at Walgreens. Great product, great deal, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.... ...my checkups are getting better, but I&#x27;m also doing more self-oral care in general, e.g., more frequent and thorough flossing, switching to electric toothbrushing, never missing regular hygienist cleanings, etc.  Anyway, whatever, recommend following your professional&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far cheaper and less painful than dental work....  ...and after $30,000 the last 7 years, I know something about what dental work can cost.</li>
    <li> Love this rinse for strengthening my teeth. I can feel the deference, it makes my teeth feel smooth and sealed. Buy the 18oz size over the 32oz.. if you look at the product they are different in that they have a different fluoride content - the 18z bottle is labeled for once a day use with a higher concentration of fluoride and the 32oz is labeled for twice a day use and is diluted! Price is the same by oz so get the  more powerful brew 18OZ!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this as the best preventative and restorative mouthwash.  Use it at least once every day, and you will notice improved checkups!</li>
    <li> I love that I can stock up on mouthwash on amazon and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out and forgetting it at the store. I used ACT when I was growing up, so I trust it. The flavor is not as good as scope, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This is very good mouthwash. I had never tried Act until my dentist recommended it several years ago. Since then, this is more or less what I use all the time. Leaves my teeth looking nice, and my breath smelling nice. From what I&#x27;ve been told this is one of the best mouthwashes to protect teeth from cavities.</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash. Works well.</li>
    <li> Works great, you will get a slight burn after prolonged washing, but that just shows you that it is working!</li>
    <li> I always had problems with cavities. Probably more so because I was lazy with dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point I decided I should make my dentist&#x27;s life easier and take care of my teeth better. Or it might have been the pain of the abscessed tooth that changed my thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to brush twice a day, and I still got cavities. I then added in a fluoride mouth wash, twice a day. I still can get lazy, but I always at least rinse with a fluoride mouthwash twice a day. It&#x27;s been 5 years now, no cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this specific product, I didn&#x27;t realize it has alcohol in it. So that makes for a good burn. Also, I don&#x27;t care much for the cup method of distribution. It gets messy and sticky. After using this I found that I definitely prefer the ones with the attached cup and the squeeze to fill. With this one, the capillary action seems to pull the residual mouthwash up onto the outside of the cup. This leaves it all sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to my old ACT after I use these up. These seemed like a pretty good deal for 4 of them</li>
    <li> I bought this having read Brian Johnston&#x27;s review at the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the ACT mouthwash did such a good job, I now use the system he suggests in his review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash doesn&#x27;t burn, it tastes ok, does a good job, and my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> We have used this for years at the recommendation from our dentist.  Love that it does not burn your mouth and love the flavor.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash works well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is not approved by the ADA,  meaning it is not proven to be effective towards building enamel but if you want mouthwash that is from ACT and is proven by the American Dental Association and does fights cavities and rebuilds enamel choose the act mouthwash anticavity.  but make sure to buy the 18oz because it has more fluoride and you only have to use it once a day unlike the 33oz</li>
    <li> great for the value! however i would shop around for different brands. I am not sure how effective this actually is.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other kinds of mouth wash and found them to be too astringent and leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  Act cool mint feels good in my mouth, which means I don&#x27;t spit it out before getting full benefit from the flouride.  Costco used to carry ACT, but they now sell their own brand, which is okay, but not as pleasant tasting.</li>
    <li> My son recommended this to me and I really like it.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working as the product says it will but I flavor isn&#x27;t as strong as other mouthwashes I&#x27;ve previously used and I like that.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried. Besides the fresh feel, the fluoride definitely helps protects your teeth from decay and enamel loss. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> ACT Restoring was recommended by my Dentist.</li>
    <li> Dentist really does recommend this over the others.</li>
    <li> I use this every day because my dentist recommended it, and I do like it better than Listerine because it isn&#x27;t as harsh.</li>
    <li> As advertised and good stuff.</li>
    <li> Tastes great, doesn&#x27;t burn. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> My dentist has always recommended ACT because it has fluoride in it. This one also has alcohol so it kills bacteria at the same time. I started using this when I realized that Crest Prohealth (which is generally less expensive) was making my teeth brown. (This is normal - check the product reviews.) Thus, I used this one. So far it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: it&#x27;s pretty expensive stuff that goes pretty quickly. But it&#x27;s cheaper and less painful than a root canal.</li>
    <li> tastes great and pleasant for rinsing the mouth. Additional benefit of fluoride is just the right mix along with the toothpaste.</li>
