      <li>but I think I&#x27;m a 3c mostly with some 4a at the top and 3b at the very bottom)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m overall very satisfied, even though I think I&#x27;m still going to combine it to some type of oil to give my hair more shine and keep it moisturized.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many different products, including most of the DevaCurl products,</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and lovely and OMG Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I used BOBEAM soap bars to clean my hair before use.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair crunchy and tangled, but I didn&#x27;t care as I got to smell that sweet scent 2&#x27;o clock in the morning detangling, not caring about my pass overdue homework.</li>
      <li>I dont use much throughout my hair and it also seems to help keep my hair smooth.</li>

      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product and will definitely be ordering more when I run out :).</li>
      <li>I knew I didnt want to spend a lot of money to find the right one for me.</li>
      <li>It does actually hold down edges very nicely and i love the smell.</li>
      <li>The thing that I love so much about this is that my hair dries so soft, yet it feels moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m at the tail end of my transitioning ... and most of my hair is natural, except for the very ends that I need to just cut off ...</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even get first day hair.</li>
      <li>always dry (not too sure</li>
      <li>My hair has been straight for over 20 years of my life</li>
      <li>The creator of this product really did their homework, you can tell.  </li>
      <li>but really I don&#x27;t know</li>
      <li>The product went on smooth and the initial application of the product was moisturizing, however it became drying during the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It curled up my baby&#x27;s hair as I was massaging it through and it leaves it feeling very silky.</li>
      <li>This product helps to define, and reduce too much frizz.  </li>
      <li>I only wish it were available in stores.</li>
      <li>just exactly what I am looking for in natural hair products.</li>

      <li>Therefore I would normally use gel to manage my hand.</li>
      <li>It is so hard to find great products especially for different textures of hair.</li>
      <li>It offers that control that one dreams of!  </li>
      <li>Finally used it last nigh and woke up this morning a little unsure because I never twisted my hair like I was instructed and wasn&#x27;t sure if I could do the curls.</li>
      <li>but with a soft touch.</li>
      <li>Hairs shiny and soft and it moves.  </li>
      <li>I used this product with the OBIA Natural Hair Care Cream.</li>
      <li>relaxed (chemically treated) hair to my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this Obia Natural Hair Care Custard to try on my baby&#x27;s hair, it does just what it says.</li>
      <li>pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Throughout the day the style grew on my because the curls actually held all day and even though the majority of my hair is straight it held the style.....</li>
      <li>My search is over because my natural curls just pop with OBI Curl Enhancing Custard.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and takes out the frizz.</li>
      <li>My hair is still soft when it dries and it keeps my hair from being frizzy.</li>
      <li>Purchased obia for my medium length nAtural hair.</li>
      <li>I received the product a few days ago and was excited to use it being that I am transitioning from</li>

<ol>
    <li> I love this curling custard.  It is not sticky and gives great curl definition for my 4C hair.  I am glad I took a chance and bought it and this will be my go-to product!  Great price too.</li>
    <li> This is the whip!!  I can use it on wet or dry hair. No flaking curls for days</li>
    <li> The shipper mailed promptly and the packaging was fine. The product itself, was just okay for me. While I will continue to use, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> The best styler for curly kinky hair!!! It defines curls and coils without leaving hair hard or full of build up!</li>
    <li> This entire product line is amazing!!!! The curl custard is my favorite! It&#x27;s perfect for natural hair and it retains shine and moisture very well! Definitely my favorite product line! ❤️</li>
    <li> I saw a vlogger with 4b hair using this gel and giving a tut online. This gel left my hair sticky and frizzy. I didn&#x27;t even get first day hair. After trying different leave ins with the gel, I ended up throwing the rest away.</li>
    <li> Hi makes the hair very dry not happy with product</li>
    <li> I love this curl enhancing custard. It isn&#x27;t flaky or sticky. My hair is still soft when it dries and it keeps my hair from being frizzy. Its a bit pricey but I love the outcome of it.</li>
    <li> good service. love it. just exactly what I am looking for in natural hair products. will recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> This is the first product that has my twist outs looking moisturized and full of body. I add a little gel and oil over it and voila! Your hair has to be soaking wet though. The style lasts the entire work week, usually ending up in a bun. Now I&#x27;m gonna try other products in this line. It&#x27;s wonderful, try it!</li>
    <li> Became a lot of white specks throughout my hair.  I am returning it and not ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I received the product a few days ago and was excited to use it being that I am transitioning from relaxed (chemically treated) hair to my natural hair. I was vey nervous at first because I have tried to go natural once and it didn&#x27;t go well. My hair is a 3c and 4a mix. It is so hard to find great products especially for different textures of hair. My hair has been straight for over 20 years of my life and I don&#x27;t want to continue using chemicals in my hair. I was introduced to this product by looking at another cream recommendation but it had some bad reviews. I came across this one and read all the great reviews and decided to try it. Finally used it last nigh and woke up this morning a little unsure because I never twisted my hair like I was instructed and wasn&#x27;t sure if I could do the curls. Throughout the day the style grew on my because the curls actually held all day and even though the majority of my hair is straight it held the style..... pleasantly surprised. My hair also was soft and not hard like other products that I have used in the past that left my hair dry, crunchy and unappealing. I used this product with the OBIA Natural Hair Care Cream. Great products and it smells great....not like when you use a curling iron and you smell burnt hair.</li>
    <li> Great Product. My braid out yielded much better results with the use of the custard! Will definitely repurchase and pass the word.</li>
    <li> If I could eat it I would. The smell is so decadent and delicious. My nostrils were flabbergast on site. It does not work well on my 3c/4a hair but boy does it smell like grinded up newborns. It made my hair crunchy and tangled, but I didn&#x27;t care as I got to smell that sweet scent 2&#x27;o clock in the morning detangling, not caring about my pass overdue homework. I think I&#x27;ll buy another just so I can smell it while I visit grandma, take a s***, maybe I&#x27;ll have it in my will to get my body covered with it when I die. All in all, it works like s***, feels like snot, looks like semen jelly, but smells like heaven.</li>
    <li> The product went on smooth and the initial application of the product was moisturizing, however it became drying during the end of the day. I will not repurchase this product. Hair type: Daughter, 3c; myself, 4a</li>
    <li> my hair is obscenely curly and humidity totals my hair..I did have to combine it with a regular conditioner for curls..but I tell you it&#x27;s just curls.. no frizz at all..extremely pleased</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is an awesome, awesome product.  I am so happy I took a chance and bought this.  I&#x27;ve tried sooo many products and nothing, nothing works like this. I&#x27;m really pleased. This product helps to define, and reduce too much frizz.  It offers that control that one dreams of!  Control but with a soft touch. The creator of this product really did their homework, you can tell.  I&#x27;ve used this for my wash and go&#x27;s and to twist on dry hair and it is stupendous, to say the least.  The thing that I love so much about this is that my hair dries so soft, yet it feels moisturized.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to be slapping some oil or spritz with water or re-add product all the time.  This thing is the truth.  I&#x27;m definitely going to be one of their loyal customers.  I was so happy with this product that I just bought the trial pack, so I could try out their other two products, the moisture cream and the hydrating spray.  If they work this good, I&#x27;m going to be purchasing the full size.  My hair is very picky, it&#x27;s coarse, thick and low porosity, always dry (not too sure but I think I&#x27;m a 3c mostly with some 4a at the top and 3b at the very bottom).... I&#x27;m at the tail end of my transitioning ... and most of my hair is natural, except for the very ends that I need to just cut off ... if that helps any one. -Tanya P.</li>
    <li> Yes I absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It does actually hold down edges very nicely and i love the smell. I dont use much throughout my hair and it also seems to help keep my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> It made my hair hard. Wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I love it! I continue to reorder you still need to use oil with it as well though!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have found to put on my very frizzy, curly hair.  It leaves my hair soft and takes out the frizz.</li>
    <li> Best curling custard EVER.  It sets my hair so beautifully and maintains the moisture in my curls well after.  I ALWAYS get compliments on my wash and go styles after using this.  I HIGHLY recommend this product and will definitely be ordering more when I run out :).</li>
    <li> I love this custard for my hair. I transitioned this summer and was so overwhelmed with the different products on the market today. I knew I didnt want to spend a lot of money to find the right one for me. I&#x27;ve had my selection of expensive and the reasonable priced. My search is over because my natural curls just pop with OBI Curl Enhancing Custard.</li>
    <li> 4A/4B/4C Hair type of girl here and this stuff is  OMG.  For me this stuff is amazing.  I think the low PH has something to do with it but really I don&#x27;t know I just know I am a buyer for life.  I am and always will be a KCCC type person but this stuff OMG.  I can use it on all my hair types on my head with out needing to be soaking wet unlike KCCC.  My hair is so soft and lovely and OMG Love this stuff.  I immediately purchase more from their home site (shipping was not crazy either) LOVE this product.  Thank you OBIA!!!  OH I used BOBEAM soap bars to clean my hair before use.  Love Bobeam too!!</li>
    <li> I bought this Obia Natural Hair Care Custard to try on my baby&#x27;s hair, it does just what it says. It curled up my baby&#x27;s hair as I was massaging it through and it leaves it feeling very silky. The product arrived faster than I was told, and I love it. I would definitely recommend this product and this seller, five stars all the way.</li>
    <li> Excellent source of moisture for my hair, I absolutely love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> I expected my hair to curl at its natural state, but that didn&#x27;t happen.  This product is sitting on my shelf collecting dust.  I feel like I wasted money!</li>
    <li> I have beenn going natural for about half a year and nearly half of my hair is still processed. It is really difficult to manage because I am mixed and my hair is super thick and wavy. I must say that this product is better than anything I have ever used on my hair. It does not frizz or anything, it just lays down perfectly.</li>
    <li> This, is the best hair product I have ever used! I have natural hair that is really thick and difficult to manage. Therefore I would normally use gel to manage my hand. With this product I can manage my hair and there&#x27;s no breakage or flakes. I highly recommend this product. Bye bye gel, hello Obia.</li>
    <li> This product smells very good, but it didn&#x27;t work well in my hair. It left my hair dried and difficult to untangle.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used when it comes to defining curls. I&#x27;m overall very satisfied, even though I think I&#x27;m still going to combine it to some type of oil to give my hair more shine and keep it moisturized.</li>
    <li> Defines my natural curls w/o making them crunchy and or hard!  I&#x27;m heavy handed with product and no matter how much I used no hair crunchies! And it moisturizes!</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and how it works in my hair. I have 3C/4A hair. I am a hair junkie meaning I have alot of different products I used but never finished... I FINISHED this product!!I will be repurchasing when ever I have the funds!</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a hair. I found it made my hair dry. Smelled great, though.</li>
    <li> Purchased obia for my medium length nAtural hair. I have used it twice on a twist out already, product works great doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or weighed down. Hair was left bouncy and soft will purchase again.</li>
    <li> For my hair, this is the product of my dreams! It smooths my hair and (this might sound weird) but it weighs it down in a way that allows my hair to clump into curls.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  The product moisturizes and hydrates without an oily greasy feel.  Hairs shiny and soft and it moves.  I have tried many, many different products, including most of the DevaCurl products, As I Am, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, etc.  This custard is amazing.  I have been using it all winter so I can&#x27;t speak to its anti-frizz potential, but this has been my go to for months. I have been using generous amounts and the &amp;#34;rake and shake&amp;#34; method to get awesome clumping curls.  I let air dry/diffuse and then break up the bigger clumps.  My hair has a ton of volume and movement and I get at least 2 days out of my wash and go.  Other products barely lasted a day.  Smells great.  I only wish it were available in stores.</li>
