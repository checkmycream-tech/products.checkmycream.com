      <li>Nice soap, but a bit espensive.</li>
      <li>It treats body odor effectively.</li>
      <li>but I  have not noticed any kind of advantage to using this.</li>

      <li>I did itch a bit more, after about 2 weeks; but the good news was:</li>

      <li>Lovely product.</li>
      <li>Love the soap.</li>
      <li>Love how this product cleans so thoroughly without drying out my skin</li>
      <li>I ordered more of it, and it can be used safely for face as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just use more cologne.</li>
      <li>I KNOW I WILL LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most of the soaps out there and do not like using &#x27;oatmeal&#x27; soap all the time.  </li>
      <li>Smells awesome on my skin, even the next day.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the soap and have been washing all over with it, including my scalp which is where I detected the most problem.</li>
      <li>Plus, nice clean feeling after bath time</li>
      <li>easy transaction.pleased with product</li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>Non drying and find it is fine for body and face.</li>
      <li>, it will get you very clean and fresh</li>
      <li>Lots of suds, and feel really clean after using in the shower.  </li>
      <li>It has a light citrus fragrance that goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>sure enough it&#x27;s alkaline PH makes it suitable for treating eczema.</li>
      <li>It works, but is VERY drying and caused a rash where I used it most.</li>
      <li>While this may work effectively for eliminating natural body odor for some people, I found that it made my skin uncontrollably itchy all over.  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s good as a soap--</li>
      <li>This soap is clean, mild, and does the job</li>
      <li>I have notice a definite change in my body odor... for the good.</li>
      <li>Still determining if this product leaves me fresh and odor free.</li>
      <li>Short on leaving the skin moisturized but foams good.  </li>
      <li>I am giving it 2 stars instead of one because the seller did get it out quickly.</li>
      <li>received quickly, without any problems.</li>
      <li>I started paying close attention, and realized not only does this product clean wonderfully, but it does not leave my skin dry the way most other effective cleansers and soaps do.</li>
      <li>Good soap, lasts long.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice glycerin feeling soap, but the bar is tiny and will quickly be gone.  </li>
      <li>Until Mirai: now I feel fresh all day.</li>
      <li>Everyone is different of course, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all to be honest.  </li>
      <li>Her grandmother likes the feel of the soap and that it leaves her skin feeling fresh</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how good it is on &#x27;deodorizing&#x27; as I am not suffering from that issue due to age.  </li>
      <li>This soap cleans thoroughly, yet very gently.  </li>
      <li>Very nice soap, though I use it only occasionally do to the expense of it.</li>
      <li>again from this seller, my item came very fast</li>
      <li>Basically pleased and will it order it again as no other soap seems to work this reasonably well.</li>
      <li>I now have a small, natural amount of odor which is warm and a little spicy/sweet again which makes me INSANELY HAPPY!  </li>
      <li>Second purchase, well satisfied, whill purha again.</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>Two years ago I didn&#x27;t even use deodorant (I tend to enjoy natural body odor)</li>
      <li>This worked from the first day</li>
      <li>This soap does exactly as it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Works pretty well</li>
      <li>and I have to say this is the first time all year that I smell like myself again.  </li>
      <li>People should be made aware that some persons might get a reaction.</li>
      <li>This soap was very pricey for my budget, but I haven&#x27;t been happy lately with the products I have been using.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much a nothing product</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t dry my skin after the shower, love it.</li>
      <li>My wife and i now only use Mirai cleansers, and to save shipping costs we ordered a big supply (we live in Singapore - high international shipping cost - it is super hot and humid here, which makes us perspire more, leading to more odour).</li>
      <li>really does nothing.</li>
      <li>But this really works..</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>It rinses squeaky clean and leaves no slippery residue, yet my skin is not dry from it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;PS:  after using about 4 bars of this soap, I ended up with pruritus (dermatological itch/skin breakdown) that the colo-rectal doctor chalked up to \\&quot;too much soap.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>But this stuff does very well.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>but it really bothered me.</li>
      <li>sometimes twice a day and make sure the soap is completely able to dry out and not get wasted.</li>
      <li>This really gets rid of that old man smell!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice soap, but a bit espensive.</li>
    <li> Horrible fragrance; reminds me of dog shampoo.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Another senior citizen cruel trick.</li>
    <li> Actually I bought this bar for a friend to give to her grandmother.  She had noticed that her grandmothers home and clothes had this &amp;#34;old people&amp;#34; smell and when she studied and found the cause was due to  the presence of more omega-7 unsaturated fatty acids in the older people that causes the 2-nonenal odor, and that the odorl comes from the breakdown of these fatty acid chains. She ran across this soap  that was said to alleviate that problem.  She reports that it did what it claims to do and the smell is no longer around.  Her grandmother likes the feel of the soap and that it leaves her skin feeling fresh so she is more than happy to keep the soap.  The day my friend has me order an extra bar and has me keep one -  I guess I will take the hint and head for the shower!</li>
    <li> Everyone is different of course, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all to be honest.  Didn&#x27;t leave my skin any softer or fresher smelling than any bar soap or bath wash.  It&#x27;s a LOT of money to pay for one small bar of soap too.  Won&#x27;t be ordering this again.  I am giving it 2 stars instead of one because the seller did get it out quickly.</li>
    <li> This soap does exactly as it says it will do.  Any problem with body odor will be resolved.  Used twice daily, it will not last 2 months, but it is worth every dime!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and effectiveness!</li>
    <li> I think that this is a great soap.  Does what it says but doesn&#x27;t last 2 months.  I shower every day...sometimes twice a day and make sure the soap is completely able to dry out and not get wasted. I; also, purchased the serum, spray, and wash all of which are great products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it did just what i hope it would.  I am very satisfied with this product and have and will order again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Really works!</li>
    <li> This really gets rid of that old man smell!! Or hat head as my wife calls it!!!</li>
    <li> Basically a $20.00 bar of lye soap that actually smells pretty much like all the other lye soap I have used that I opnly paid pennies for.</li>
    <li> Just received and so far it has softened my skin.  Too soon to review the other claims. Would rate a 5 if the cost was a little more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I had blamed the health food store deodorant for &amp;#34;breaking&amp;#34; my underarms, and for failing to do their job. Until Mirai: now I feel fresh all day. It has the lightest, natural scent that does not trigger my scent sensitivities or extra-sensitive skin. And a little goes a long way. I use it to wash my underarms whenever I shower, and nightly on my face before bed.</li>
    <li> This soap worked. How do I know? Easy. I have Seborrheic Keratosis. This is a skin condition that commonly affects people over 60 years of age. There is an &#x27;aroma&#x27; that is VERY unpleasant and is detectable by the person with the condition. Me. As well as others, I assume. When I read about this soap&#x27;s ability to &#x27;dissolve&#x27; &amp;#34;2-Nonenal&amp;#34; (sometimes misspelled as noneal; 2-Nonenal is an unsaturated aldehyde. It apparently comes with having seborrheic keratosis), I knew I found the answer.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this soap and I tried one bar of it. It lathered extremely well and there was an evanescent appeal to it.&lt;br /&gt;No specific odor to it, though. I did itch a bit more, after about 2 weeks; but the good news was: IT WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;I did not continue to &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; my own &#x27;aroma&#x27; after showering with Mirai soap.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the soap is the cost. It&#x27;s too expensive. Period.&lt;br /&gt;I challenge anyone to come up with a soap product, that can duplicate the results of this soap, for old people like me.&lt;br /&gt;$19.00 plus $5.00 shipping for one bar of soap is ridiculous. I refuse to pay $24.95 a month for one bar of soap!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d pay $5.00 a bar, if I could get it off the shelf, somewhere. I&#x27;m soon to be 65 years old. I won&#x27;t buy this again, unless there are no other options. And believe me, I am searching relentlessly for one.</li>
    <li> Nice soap with a very light fragrance.  Wanted to try it as an alternative to the mass-produced deodorizing bar soaps on the market.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any extreme drying effects -- at least not yet -- as some other users have.  Works pretty well but it&#x27;s just too pricey for soap, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Completely dried my skin out. Gave it a couple of weeks but had to stop using it. Found baking soda worked the best. Nothing wrong with the product, just didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
    <li> I think I like this soap.  Maybe I see a difference in odor.  Just not sure yet.  Pricey for soap.</li>
    <li> I have notice a definite change in my body odor... for the good. Plus, nice clean feeling after bath time</li>
    <li> Great product, good smell, added to my shower products, purchased the body wash as well. received quickly, without any problems.</li>
    <li> It was no different then any other soap on the market that you can buy for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I started noticing a weird odor about two years ago....I think I am the only one who noticed (hopefully) but it really bothered me. Turns out that I have been going through Menopause and it really started hitting hard about 9 months ago. I can only assume the odor is caused by fluctuating hormones. Nothing I did could get rid of that weird smell. 5 weeks ago I read an article about this problem and Mirai soap. I had never heard of 2-Nonenal and age-related odor caused by this breakdown of chemicals in the skin, but a light-bulb went off in my head. I ordered the soap and have been washing all over with it, including my scalp which is where I detected the most problem. Bingo! Odor gone. From day one. This is like a miracle for me. Maybe people without this odor problem would not notice anything remarkable about this soap, but give it a try if you do have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is soap.  It gets you clean and slips out of your hand at inconvenient times exactly like other soap.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any other difference.  If you like the scent use it.  I like the scent.</li>
    <li> Lots of suds, and feel really clean after using in the shower.  Highly recommended.  Only drawback is the price and non existence in local stores.</li>
    <li> They scared me into thinking I now have an odor caused by aging which my other soaps are not removing&lt;br /&gt;so I bought a bar.  It&#x27;s a nice glycerin feeling soap, but the bar is tiny and will quickly be gone.  If I smell&lt;br /&gt;better I&#x27;m unaware of it and I won&#x27;t be spending $20 again.  I&#x27;ll just use more cologne. ;-)</li>
    <li> I have struggled for a while through various deodorants and powders and vitamins and supplements to combat my changing body order which I believe is due to perimenopause.  Two years ago I didn&#x27;t even use deodorant (I tend to enjoy natural body odor) but in the past year I have noticed a change in over all scent which has been quite troublesome.  My Persimmon bar arrived yesterday and I showered with it this morning and I have to say this is the first time all year that I smell like myself again.  This soap does not, for me at least, erase all odor, and I don&#x27;t want it to.  What is seems to have done is tackle the sharp, bitter, kind of sour smell that I&#x27;ve been dealing with.  I now have a small, natural amount of odor which is warm and a little spicy/sweet again which makes me INSANELY HAPPY!  I will definitely be buying and using this soap regularly.  Thank you Mirai!</li>
    <li> As we age, our bio-chemistry changes. I began to notice subtle things: my skin didn&#x27;t seem to hold the scent of perfume the way it once did, it was drier than normal, and even my deodorant didn&#x27;t seem to work the way it once did. I read an article about Mirai, which said persimmon soap was the only proven product guaranteed to rid the body of nonenal (old people smell), and it seemed to describe the very changes I was experiencing. OMG! Old people smell! I bought the soap the same day, and I have not been disappointed. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I am happy that I can get it here. I will purchase again soon.</li>
    <li> Love how this product cleans so thoroughly without drying out my skin</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin. Doesn&#x27;t have a great fragrance--its ok, but doesn&#x27;t smell like persimmons at all.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Will be reordering.</li>
    <li> My elderly parents loved it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap! Smells awesome on my skin, even the next day.  Has not dried my skin out, or caused any acne.  It is expensive, but that would be my only complaint.  And yes, even though it seems impossible, it does get rid of any unpleasant body odors related to aging!</li>
    <li> My wife and I are getting older (ughhh..) but when I realized OUR bedroom had the same stale mouldy smell I remember from my grandparents, I freaked out. I tried Ozium air freshener (used in hospitals) but no help. Finally I realized the smell came from OUR  bed sheets, which meant it came from us! I told my wife and she freaked out! Out of the blue I heard about Mirai, and I tried it. It works! Odour totally eliminated. I started paying close attention, and realized not only does this product clean wonderfully, but it does not leave my skin dry the way most other effective cleansers and soaps do. Then I experimented using it on my face because my skin is a bit oily but it also has dry patches. Not only did it clean my face without causing dryness, it seems to cure my dry skin patches. Too good to believe, I looked up persimmon, and sure enough it&#x27;s alkaline PH makes it suitable for treating eczema. My wife and i now only use Mirai cleansers, and to save shipping costs we ordered a big supply (we live in Singapore - high international shipping cost - it is super hot and humid here, which makes us perspire more, leading to more odour). BTW, my wife prefers the body wash, but I&#x27;m accustomed to showering with the solid bar, which is also convenient for traveling (it&#x27;s become part of my standard travel packing). I tried her body wash and result seems to be the same as the solid bar. Also, my wife tried Mirai face serum, and tells me it&#x27;s just as good as the Swiss La Prairie face products, but at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I use this and it does everything it is suppose to, and more.  I wash my body by hand and the soap is creamy, thick and rinses off without leaving any itch or residue feeling.  Product leaves a slight scent.  Since I am allergic to perfumes and don&#x27;t have a problem with this product, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT TRIED THE SOAP BAR YET BUT IF IT IS ANYTHING LIKE THE BODY WASH I KNOW I WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> easy transaction.pleased with product</li>
    <li> While this may work effectively for eliminating natural body odor for some people, I found that it made my skin uncontrollably itchy all over.  My skin is not usually sensitive to anything, but this was an exception.  No way can I use this!  People should be made aware that some persons might get a reaction.</li>
    <li> Is as advertised. Product arrived on time and while a little expensive for one bar of soap, does work effectively with no perfumes.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap, though I use it only occasionally do to the expense of it. It lives outside the shower on in a dish on the sink, and I only use it for bathing in between showers. I especially like it on my legs, because the skin on my legs seems to be drying and aging faster than the skin on the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> This product really works. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> It treats body odor effectively.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned at first , as I have only used soaps that would be familiar to ones from the market, CVS, Target, Walgreens or Walmart.  But this really works..</li>
    <li> uhhh just something to try but my face did feel softer.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most of the soaps out there and do not like using &#x27;oatmeal&#x27; soap all the time.  This soap is clean, mild, and does the job and I do not suffer from itchy skin after using it.  I don&#x27;t know how good it is on &#x27;deodorizing&#x27; as I am not suffering from that issue due to age.  It is a bit expensive but lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I thought it was very expensive for what you get.  I don&#x27;t know yet if the product is effective for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Great seller to deal with.  Too soon to rate the product itself but bought this at recommendation of a family member who has been using it for awhile and likes it.</li>
    <li> Good soap, lasts long. Got it for my 84 yo mother. No soapy residue.</li>
    <li> Short on leaving the skin moisturized but foams good.  Probably would not go to the expense to buy another.</li>
    <li> Still determining if this product leaves me fresh and odor free. Only time will tell. 3 bars to go before I decide if I will re order.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing.  The service is prompt and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had a broader line of such wonderful product.  Great stuff !!!</li>
    <li> Very expensive, goes fast. Jury still out  on it. Use us on my husband. Not sure I will buy again ??</li>
    <li> really does nothing. tried hormone balance pills which helped. this was a waste of money in my opinion. everyone is different</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.This worked from the first day I used it. No more old people smell in my house.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. The soap is different than other soaps and has a mile smell that really works well with every body type.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap to used if you are going thru menopause or if you have bad&lt;br /&gt;body odor this will help with that, it will get you very clean and fresh, I would&lt;br /&gt;buy again from this seller, my item came very fast</li>
    <li> I think this is a nice soap, but I&#x27;m not convinced that Neutrogena or some other clear soap wouldn&#x27;t work just as well at cleaning away body oils and preventing stale odors. It has a light citrus fragrance that goes away quickly. Makes decent levels of suds on a cloth. Overall it&#x27;s good as a soap--but I think something much less expensive would do as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. Very expensive however and that is why I give it only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Vague scent.  Seems to do what it states-eliminates odors that other soaps cannot.  I especially noticed decreased or no foot odor.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap that cleanses and moisturizes while providing a very fresh feeling.  Love it and will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Non drying and find it is fine for body and face.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this, it may be pure but I  have not noticed any kind of advantage to using this. Pretty much a nothing product</li>
    <li> Ever since menopause I was convinced my soap or deodorant wasn&#x27;t doing its job---maybe it was psychological, but I do think there&#x27;s something to the theory of nonenal and aging/change in body odors.  This soap has put me back on track.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, and with shipping, even more so, but I contacted the company about the expensive shipping and they are going to offer free shipping with purchase of multiple bars.  I hope Amazon gets on board with that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  after using about 4 bars of this soap, I ended up with pruritus (dermatological itch/skin breakdown) that the colo-rectal doctor chalked up to \\&quot;too much soap.\\&quot;  So I quit with it and am back to square one in terms of odor.  While it may seem like a gentle soap, I actually think it&#x27;s much more powerful than other soaps.  I wish I understood the chemistry of all this, and what to do next...</li>
    <li> The scent is very soft and medical, cleans the body efficiently. I ordered more of it, and it can be used safely for face as well. Didn&#x27;t dry my skin after the shower, love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product as well. Great for travelling !</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother. She had read about it. She loves it!</li>
    <li> This is excellent Soap!  Removes all unpleasant scents from an older body.  I will continue to order this soap as it&#x27;s such a great product!!</li>
    <li> This soap was very pricey for my budget, but I haven&#x27;t been happy lately with the products I have been using.  This soap cleans thoroughly, yet very gently.  It rinses squeaky clean and leaves no slippery residue, yet my skin is not dry from it.  I am careful to keep the bar in a dish so as to limit &amp;#34;water melt&amp;#34;, which other customers complained about, and so far, so good.  As for the promise that it leaves you smelling better, difficult for me to quantify.  All I can say is, no one around me is complaining.  I will see how long this bar lasts before I order another one.  I am liking it a lot at this point in time.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to combat nonenal. Have been using it for two weeks now. It seems to have removed approximately 75-80% of the odour most of the time. Basically pleased and will it order it again as no other soap seems to work this reasonably well.</li>
    <li> This is a pricey soap but I like how it feels on the skin and it does take away odor.  I purchased the body lotion but have not used it yet.  This is my second bar.  I have found a few of the commercial soaps just sit on the skin and don&#x27;t really take away the odor (armpit, crotch, feet).  But this stuff does very well.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Price seems to be the only drawback.</li>
    <li> Need fabric soap and shampoo with the same formula. I would also like to say that this product made a great difference in the first usage. It was obvious that a film was removed that other soaps were not effective on, as there was immediately a &amp;#34;squeeky clean&amp;#34; feel to the skin. I use it as a pre-wash before shampooing also.</li>
    <li> It works, but is VERY drying and caused a rash where I used it most. Use sparingly and with caution.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap!!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Second purchase, well satisfied, whill purha again.</li>
