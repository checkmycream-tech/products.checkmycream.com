### Positive Reviews

      <li>I think it is the best.  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Great value!</li>
      <li>There is just nothing else to compare it to, so if you want the best product, you found it.</li>
      <li>I suppose if they are unaccustomed to this product, it may seem too oily for them, but the fact is that the oily skin lotions work best in repairing overly-dry skin.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the best thing out there for my hands</li>
      <li>This is an amazing lotion!!</li>
      <li>but with consistency your skin will be beautiful in no time</li>

      <li>This lotion is amazing.</li>
      <li>bottle has a nice sturdy-looking pump, but it was dented in shipment</li>
      <li>An added plus is the fact that&#x27;s unscented which makes it nice for those of us with allergies.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve liked every Eucerin product I&#x27;ve tried, and this lotion is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Eucerin really is the best lotion on the market.</li>
      <li>It has 10% urea and really works great - I loved it.  </li>
      <li>The ceramides alone are a good idea, but the texture and the fact that the lotion absorbs fast make it a good product to have around.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with product as I am familiar with it for a couple years.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not my favorite, because it leaves a bit of a sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The consistency at the end of the bottle was more like what I was used to from this brand, so maybe I just got a sample that had been sitting around in a warehouse, and just needed some shaking?  </li>
      <li>It has been below zero for too many days, causing the sides of my fingers (by the nail) to crack.  </li>
      <li>No, but it works better than most watery lotions that say they are specifically for hands.</li>
      <li>Helps my skin and is fragrance free, Yeh!</li>
      <li>Helps my skin and is fragrance free, Yeh!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s in the top 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But whatever it is, I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for a couple years and love it.</li>
      <li>definitely more of a medicine than a luxurious moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Most of them were ineffective.</li>
      <li>It is a cream, not a lotion, but it&#x27;s my favorite dry-skin fixer-upper.</li>
      <li>favorite is Eucerin Body Creme Eczema Relief.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Healed Thumbs UP : )</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is surprisingly lightweight and absorbs right in and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>An excellent choice for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am always looking for the perfect one that will sooth my dry skin, and keep it protected.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading a great deal recently about why &#x27;serums&#x27; are so effective.</li>
      <li>It smooths easily into your skin, leaving it soft to the touch and beautiful to look at.  </li>
      <li>this lotion is the best for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>My husband has VERY dry skin and is very happy with this lotion.</li>
      <li>You have to decide for yourself what&#x27;s more important.</li>
      <li>but it absorbs fairly quickly leaving your feeling nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>it did wash off my hands easily...</li>
      <li>It does not wash easily off your hands, if that is an issue for you.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While this lotion is great for those problem areas (heels and elbows for me), I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using this as a general moisturizing lotion.  </li>
      <li>When I first put this lotion on it felt amazing.  </li>
      <li>The water-based products feel fine on the skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pleased at how well and how quickly this Eucerin brand lotion worked on both my body and my hands at relieving the itch and moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>The scent&#x27;s mild, as most of Eucerin&#x27;s line of products seems to be.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance-free is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are lighter and easier for the important ingredients to transfer to where they are needed.</li>
      <li>Though this one is fragrance free</li>
      <li>Delighted to try this Eucerin Professional Repair body lotion.  </li>
      <li>This particular product is unscented, although it does have some &#x27;scent&#x27; to it, it&#x27;s not a scent that is added to make it smell nice</li>
      <li>to this lotion specifically it is rich and somewhat oily.  </li>
      <li>Think of this product as a “treatment” v/s a rich, creamy moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>The biggest difference between this variety of Eucerin and the original is the consistency of the material.</li>
      <li>I have used Aveno products in the past, and these work the best.  </li>
      <li>Great for aging dry skin.</li>
      <li>Great on dry heels.</li>
      <li>I washed my hands in liquid soap and water to clean it off.  </li>
      <li>Overall this product does a superior job of reducing dryness</li>
      <li>wife says she loves it, because it really works, and works for more than 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>From what I can tell, this product is just as good as the standard Eucerin that comes in the jar.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This particular variety spreads out more easily and covers more area with the same portion than the original variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>goes on pretty smoothly and conveniently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Winter does a number on my hands, and I am always looking for a good lotion to relieve the dryness and aching that comes from the annual bought with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, the lotion did have a good effect on my dry skin, though I felt the need the reapply often.</li>
      <li>No problems with any strong scents (I don&#x27;t really smell anything at all).</li>
      <li>Within 12 hours of the first application I can see and feel a significant difference.</li>
      <li>Eucerin is a superior brand for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I really like that it comes in a huge bottle and has a pump.  </li>
      <li>Since this moisturizer is designed to protect the skin by creating a kind of barrier, I suppose that “coated” feeling is inevitable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad there&#x27;s not a heavy perfume smell.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and looks so much better.</li>
      <li>The results are worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*Contains Alpha Hydroxy Acids which can make skin more sensitive to sunlight</li>
      <li>far, I&#x27;m enjoying this lotion.  </li>
      <li>It dries into your skin pretty quickly</li>
      <li>Having more of an issue in winter than summer with dry skin, I find that this Eucerin Professional Repair Body Lotion is very effective in relieving and getting rid of most of my dry skin issues.</li>
      <li>- this is a good thing for me... for others who put on clothing or other items</li>
      <li>The texture is more runny than I had expected from a concentration lotion, but it spreads easily.  </li>
      <li>I find that Eucerin Professional Repair Body Lotion does a great job at softening my old-lady, weathered, dry skin.</li>
      <li>I personally feel like I need to go to a meeting when it comes to how many different types of lotion I own.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d say this is probably some pretty powerful stuff.  </li>
      <li>is the second ingredient in this lotion and, after some digging, I found that it contains 10% urea, which is fairly high and not that easy to find in most drugstore brand</li>
      <li>This product is very heavy, so if you&#x27;re looking for a lighter body lotion Eucerin has a great one for that as well.</li>
      <li>The original is more of a thick cream, while this is a more viscous lotion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Eucerin makes great body lotions.  This is no exception.  It smooths easily into your skin, leaving it soft to the touch and beautiful to look at.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!  The scent&#x27;s mild, as most of Eucerin&#x27;s line of products seems to be.  I like that.</li>
    <li> Since it has been another cold winter, I gleefully chose this lotion in hopes it would help heal our dried out skin. But I would not recommend this lotion unless you have seriously dry skin.  And even then, I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this.  It does not feel soothing or pleasant on this skin.  definitely more of a medicine than a luxurious moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion feels kind of creepy and thin when you try to apply it.  And despite it not being very thick, it is difficult to spread.  I don&#x27;t doubt it probably has some miraculous effects on some people&#x27;s skin, but on mine, I just couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off.  I feels very strange and never seems to soak in.  I first applied this to my hands, but then had to wash it off.  I also applied it to my calve (which are very dry), and it did seem to help, I&#x27;d say this is probably some pretty powerful stuff.  But the feel and also scent (it is labeled as &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but definitely has a chemical smell) quickly convinced me that i would not be applying this all over my body like I normally do with my regular Vaseline Intensive Care. This is clearly just too strong for my needs.</li>
    <li> I have been using different Eucerin lotions for my extreme dry skin for a couple of years now, the most recent I used was the Intensive repair which worked well.  I tried this Professional repair concentrated lotion which is for extremely dry skin and love it.  It isn&#x27;t to thick, so it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  My hands don&#x27;t feel greasy after I apply it and I can keep working, typing or painting without having slippery hands.  It works well through a couple of hand washes.  I really like that it comes in a huge bottle and has a pump.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> When I first put this lotion on it felt amazing.  However, it didn&#x27;t take long for it to start getting really sticky on my skin.  Not only was it very sticky when it dried, but I couldn&#x27;t get the sticky off when I scrubbed and scrubbed in the shower.  It eventually wore off after all the scrubbing and 36 hours had passed.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light-weight lotion for dry skin. I was expecting a thicker lotion with the name &amp;#34;professional repair concentrated lotion for extremely dry skin,&amp;#34; but this is pretty runny and thin. Nevertheless, the lotion did have a good effect on my dry skin, though I felt the need the reapply often. There is a slight chemical smell to this lotion that I didn&#x27;t love, but it is very faint. I&#x27;m just glad there&#x27;s not a heavy perfume smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion differs from the more traditional Eurcerin formulas that I am familiar with, and as a result, is closer to a topical skin treatment than merely a moisturizer.  It&#x27;s fairly powerful medicine, between the alpha hydroxy acid and the urea, and works great on dealing with thick, scaly skin patches.  For normal moisturizing on more normal skin, it might be a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a heavy lotion, with a LOT of oil in it, and it takes time to be absorbed into the skin.  If your hands aren&#x27;t the affected area, you are likely to have to wash them to free your skin from that oily feeling.  In our case, the lotion had leaked during shipping, and by the time we had cleaned up the bottle, our hands were greasy enough to grease our entire bodies.  It really does take 15-30 minutes to be absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this lotion is great for those problem areas (heels and elbows for me), I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using this as a general moisturizing lotion.  It&#x27;s hard on nails and would leave you more prone to sunburning.  It&#x27;s also just too heavy for use on the face or anything but the driest of skin.</li>
    <li> Winter does a number on my hands, and I am always looking for a good lotion to relieve the dryness and aching that comes from the annual bought with dry skin.  I had high hopes for the Eucerin Professional Repair Body Lotion, but it just didn’t do a lot to relieve the dryness and cracking.  I have used Aveno products in the past, and these work the best.  I will be returning to them after less than desirable results from this lotion.  I wouldn’t recommend it if you have a tough case of dry skin from winter.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this emollient, long lasting lotion.</li>
    <li> Extremely sticky, do not recommend</li>
    <li> My skin Dr.  Says it is the best and sells it in his office.  I think it is the best.  I put it on all over after bathing.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked every Eucerin product I&#x27;ve tried, and this lotion is no exception.  It moisturizes well, absorbs quickly, and has little to no scent.  But it&#x27;s not my favorite, because it leaves a bit of a sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is Eucerin Body Creme Eczema Relief.  It is a cream, not a lotion, but it&#x27;s my favorite dry-skin fixer-upper.</li>
    <li> Can rest assured products, trusted brand</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. This was recommended by my dermatologist for uneven skin on my arms and after about a month it seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple years and love it. I was glad to find it in this larger size. It keeps my skin moisturized all day without reapplying.</li>
    <li> Helps my skin and is fragrance free, Yeh!</li>
    <li> Eucerin Professional Repair Body Lotion is helping heal the splits in my winter hands.  It has been below zero for too many days, causing the sides of my fingers (by the nail) to crack.  The pads of my thumbs split too.  My fingers were split and bleeding UNTIL I used Eucerin Professional Repair Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain is gone and the skin on my hands is supple.  No more cracking. splitting and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some of the lotion in a small container so I can take it with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healed Thumbs UP : )</li>
    <li> Good for itchy dry winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;Lotion goes on smoothly with a thin slightly greasy feel which initially concerned me but it absorbs fairly quickly leaving your feeling nice and smooth.  I applied some this morning after my shower and for once didn&#x27;t have to deal with the usual dry itchy skin, An added plus is the fact that&#x27;s unscented which makes it nice for those of us with allergies.</li>
    <li> This product definitely arrived at the right time.  The double-whammy of bitter cold weather outdoors and dry indoor heating has left my skin feeling much drier than usual.  I use this when I get out of the shower, while my skin is still slightly damp.  This moisturizer is surprisingly lightweight and absorbs right in and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  This is truly a fragrance-free product – not even a hint of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I don’t care for is that my skin feels a little sticky.  Since this moisturizer is designed to protect the skin by creating a kind of barrier, I suppose that “coated” feeling is inevitable.  It does relieve dry, itchy, irritated skin and (with continued use) helps keep your skin feeling and looking healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d recommend this for very dry, problematic skin.  Think of this product as a “treatment” v/s a rich, creamy moisturizer.  Fragrance-free is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Contains Alpha Hydroxy Acids which can make skin more sensitive to sunlight</li>
    <li> Love me some Eucerin in general, but for me, the consistency was a little too liquidy here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says she loves it, because it really works, and works for more than 24 hours.  I am not as convinced, but she does know lotion.  It does seem to keep my skin well nourished compared to what one would think given the thin consistency, I will give it that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, knowing and having used other Eucerin lotions before, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to quite stack up.  I will stay with their thicker stuff in future, even if it&#x27;s just to make me THINK it&#x27;s moisturizing better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is almost non-existent, so that&#x27;s a big positive for me, and one of the reason I use Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those who like a lighter lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I just finished the bottle, and realized that when it was full, it was quite a bit more liquidy than when the bottle was almost empty.  I don&#x27;t remember that happening with other lotions.  The consistency at the end of the bottle was more like what I was used to from this brand, so maybe I just got a sample that had been sitting around in a warehouse, and just needed some shaking?  Adding one star back from 3.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me to get this. It is good but quite thick and sticky.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product as I am familiar with it for a couple years. Hard to find locally at times and I look forward to timed deliveries. Great for aging dry skin.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of all dead skin the 1st week will be the worst you will start to peel a little but with consistency your skin will be beautiful in no time</li>
    <li> Great on dry heels. A bit heavy for hands.</li>
    <li> This lotion has been an amazing rescue for my extremely dry skin and feet. I love it! My skin feels repaired, and replenished. Even the appearance of my skin has improved. Very pleased with Eucerin</li>
    <li> I tend to suffer from really bad dry skin on various parts of my body in the winter time, particularly on my hands.  This is due partly to the dry winter air and due to a lot of hand-washing.  I often have to slather myself in lotion every few days in the winter to avoid the &#x27;winter itchies&#x27; as I call them, and to keep my hands from cracking at their driest spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased at how well and how quickly this Eucerin brand lotion worked on both my body and my hands at relieving the itch and moisturizing.  The itch relief was almost instant and lasted for a long time.  The lotion does feel a bit greasy as you&#x27;re rubbing it in but it absorbs fairly quickly although I&#x27;ve noticed when using on my hands that my hands feel a bit sticky for a few minutes until the lotion is absorbed. A small amount of lotion goes a long way so this 16.9 ounce bottle will last me for at least a month or two, depending on usage.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands every morning and every evening and so far my hands have not cracked or developed dry red chapped areas like they are prone to do in winter.  This particular product is unscented, although it does have some &#x27;scent&#x27; to it, it&#x27;s not a scent that is added to make it smell nice it&#x27;s just the smell of the ingredients and it&#x27;s not very strong and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I very much like the product and I think the price is great for the size/amount of lotion. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Having more of an issue in winter than summer with dry skin, I find that this Eucerin Professional Repair Body Lotion is very effective in relieving and getting rid of most of my dry skin issues. Though this one is fragrance free I have always liked a little fragrance with my lotion. Overall this product does a superior job of reducing dryness and so I would recommend people give it a try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amusing to see that some people complained about this product leaving a residue on their hands. Have they never heard of rinsing after use? Why slam a product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do? The whole point of the lotion is to moisturize really dry skin. That can&#x27;t happen with a product that leaves nothing behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion really coats the skin, and stays on for quite some time. For extremely dry skin, like mine, this is a big plus. Like others with very dry skin, I&#x27;ve tried a large number of creams and lotions. Most of them were ineffective. This lotion really does help. It doesn&#x27;t completely remedy the dry skin. I don&#x27;t think anything could at this point. But it definitely improves it - perhaps as much as 60%. So I have no hesitation in recommending it.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is a superior brand for very dry skin. Professional repair formula is easy to apply, thin lotion spreads easy and fels so light on your skin. Absorbs into skin and gentle on sensitive skin.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Helps my skin and is fragrance free, Yeh!</li>
    <li> A wonderful Bod Lotion....the best!</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry and sensitive skin, and Eucerin is the only product that works. This product is very heavy, so if you&#x27;re looking for a lighter body lotion Eucerin has a great one for that as well. I usually use this product on my elbows and feet, and the lighter versin for arms and legs. Do not put this lotion on a few minutes before getting dressed and heading out the door.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a mom and washing your hands a hundred times a day, I recommend this. It is a bit greasy, but I put it on at night before i go to bed and it helps, is it a cure? No, but it works better than most watery lotions that say they are specifically for hands. This isn&#x27;t the best thing out there for my hands but it&#x27;s in the top 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this as a body lotion, I prefer what I use.</li>
    <li> An excellent choice for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading a great deal recently about why &#x27;serums&#x27; are so effective. They are lighter and easier for the important ingredients to transfer to where they are needed. This Eucerin Professional Repair Body Lotion is similar in weight and texture to a &#x27;serum&#x27; and contains Ceramide-3, an ingredient known to be effective in skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving little or no residue. After applying it on my hands, I didn&#x27;t have to wait before continuing with my work.  The ceramides alone are a good idea, but the texture and the fact that the lotion absorbs fast make it a good product to have around. I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The second ingredient in this lotion is urea (after water).  Urea in cosmetics is made from synthetic sources (no worries there).  Urea is naturally present in skin.  Adding it to the skin helps to soften rough skin and encourage it to cycle or shed more often.  Dead skin is removed more quickly.  The underlying skin is not as hard and rough, and is better hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used urea cremes on my feet to keep them soft, and they work well.  The eczema cr&amp;egrave;me my son is prescribed for mild eczema also has urea as the second ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, urea cr&amp;egrave;me can be irritating, and leave your skin burning and stinging, especially if you have any small cuts or abrasions. I STRONG suggest you try a bit of this on a small area, and leave it for several hours before spreading it all over your skin.  Wash your hands (especially your nails) after applying,  urea is not great for your nails.  In fact urea is used (in a higher concentration) to remove infected nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to this lotion specifically it is rich and somewhat oily.  It feels a little sticky and greasy for about 15 minutes after you put it on, and then it absorbs into the skin.  It has almost no smell, just a faint odor that dissipates quickly.  The texture is more runny than I had expected from a concentration lotion, but it spreads easily.  It really helps the dry scaly skin I get in the winter on my feet and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has alpha hydroxy acid, which may increase the possibility of sunburn.  The warning on the bottle states to “use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For rough and scaly skin this lotion is great.  For mildly dry skin I would chose something a bit less intense and with fewer issues.</li>
    <li> believe it or not, down here along the Gulf of Mexico things can get a bit dry during the winter: feet can crack, heels get chapped, and legs and elbows dry out... my problem is with dryness along the calves and front of legs, from the tops of the feet, by the ankles, and up the shins...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my &#x27;Go-To&#x27; stuff has been an olive-oil/shea butter solid sold locally by a lovely gal from Tarpon Springs, but lately, i&#x27;ve bypassed the inconvenience of solid butter for the convenience of Jergens Shea Butter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, i must say that this product (first time i&#x27;ve used a Eurerin product, btw) goes on pretty smoothly and conveniently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does, however, have a &#x27;greasy&#x27; feel after application, and doesn&#x27;t seem to work into the skin like the other products... it did wash off my hands easily...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have a problem with the after effects, as i wear shorts all the time - but it does leave a shine, and after 15 minutes was still there on the skin - this is a good thing for me... for others who put on clothing or other items, this &#x27;feature&#x27; could be a deal-breaker...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it well enough - definitely won&#x27;t last as long as that tub of solid shea butter though!</li>
    <li> very nice,came form china</li>
    <li> From what I can tell, this product is just as good as the standard Eucerin that comes in the jar. My  wife and I have been using that product for as long as we&#x27;ve been married, so I was pretty certain that this would be something that we would both use and approve of. The biggest difference between this variety of Eucerin and the original is the consistency of the material. The original is more of a thick cream, while this is a more viscous lotion. Both feel the same on the skin (i.e. oily) and seem to work as well. This particular variety spreads out more easily and covers more area with the same portion than the original variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that a few reviewers have commented on the oiliness of this product. I suppose if they are unaccustomed to this product, it may seem too oily for them, but the fact is that the oily skin lotions work best in repairing overly-dry skin. The water-based products feel fine on the skin but they do dry up and wear off much more quickly than a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product IS oily, you aren&#x27;t going to want to put it on your skin just any time. The best time to put it on is either before bed or just before a period of relatively little activity (like before sitting down to watch some TV or a movie). When the Eucerin is on your fingers, you WILL leave greasy fingerprints on eyewear, electronics, drinking glasses, paper products and other stuff, so the idea is to put it on when you aren&#x27;t going to be handling a lot of stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works and is soothing to the skin - not burning like some products. If you have extremely dry skin, it&#x27;s definitely something that I would recommend you try for some relief.</li>
    <li> I find that Eucerin Professional Repair Body Lotion does a great job at softening my old-lady, weathered, dry skin. Within 12 hours of the first application I can see and feel a significant difference. My skin is noticeably softer, and there is no itching or flaking. It not a miracle treatment. I&#x27;ve used Eucerin before and the big changes are cumulative, not instant. But, it&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call a luxurious product. The texture is thick and a little heavy on the skin even after a few hours, but I guess that&#x27;s what is needed to achieve these results. I have to shake it vigorously before using it or it comes out separated into clear oily and opaque white liquids. I have to wash it off my palms and fingers if I&#x27;m going to be using a touch screen or handling fabric or paper within an hour of applying. Not a big deal. The results are worth it. The only thing is the scent. It is very faint, but I have an excellent sense of smell so others might not notice it. It smells ever so vaguely of some type of industrial fluid when it first comes out of the bottle. I suggest you use it in advance if you plan on wearing a scent that day so there&#x27;s no competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this lotion does the job on seriously dry skin. However, do not expect a luxurious or aromatic experience. You have to decide for yourself what&#x27;s more important.</li>
    <li> My husband has VERY dry skin and is very happy with this lotion. The bottle says it “restores the skin barrier” and improves skin condition, and it seems to do that for him better than other products he has used. That “barrier” is probably what I find unsatisfactory. The Eucerin leaves my skin feeling faintly “tacky” for a number of hours after I apply it but does not do any more for my skin than my current lotion, Cerave, which does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says Fragrance Free, which I have come to realize means it has no added perfumes. Often such products have an odor from their ingredients themselves. No one is likely to smell this lotion on you from a reasonable distance, but close up there is a slight not-unpleasant spicy aroma. You can wear the fragrance of your choice without competition from your skin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a nice sturdy-looking pump, but it was dented in shipment so I suspect you do not want to drop it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that if your skin problem is not severe you may want to try other products first, but Eucerin is a good choice if other products fail.</li>
    <li> Just like some of the other Eucerin lotions I have tried. I really like how my skin feels after using this product. No problems with any strong scents (I don&#x27;t really smell anything at all). It dries into your skin pretty quickly</li>
    <li> It does a nice job of softening very dry skin - and mine is VERY dry. There were a couple of things I didn&#x27;t like, though. First, even though it was supposedly unscented, there was a faint unpleasant smell left after using it. The second thing was that it left my skin a bit sticky, even after several minutes. I ended up washing my palms to get the sticky feel off, but leaving it on the rest of my skin because it did soften it.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that makes my hands feel wonderful after being outside in the cold weather.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin balanced. Having Psoriasis, it truly helps seal moisture in.</li>
    <li> I write a whole lot of skincare reviews - I have sensitive skin and psoriasis and have tried a ton of products and so, over the years, have become something of an expert on the subject. I wish I weren&#x27;t but...well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I learned about urea at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. Yes, urea is an ingredient in, well, urine. But try not to think too much about that.  It&#x27;s also a really great ingredient for skin care. It&#x27;s a natural humectant (contains lots of water) so it moisturizes well, but it&#x27;s also a natural exfoliant and it makes skin more permeable for other moisturizers. So it moisturizes, makes skin smooth, and makes it easier for other moisturizers to get into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Urea is the second ingredient in this lotion and, after some digging, I found that it contains 10% urea, which is fairly high and not that easy to find in most drugstore brand lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using a cream made by Avene that my dermatologist sells. It has 10% urea and really works great - I loved it.  The only problem was that it costs $25 for 6 ounces and when you&#x27;re using it all over, that can get very expensive.  I did some research and found that Eucerin Professional Repair has the same ingredients, so I tried it.  And it works exactly the same as the more expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel quite like other moisturizers - the urea can give it a slightly tacky feeling when it first goes on your skin, and it sometimes tingles a bit. Don&#x27;t let that throw you off - this is amazing stuff.  Moisturizes so well and keeps my skin moisturized for longer than almost anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Plus, it makes bumpy and rough skin softer and smoother almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that it helps lighten the hyper-pigmentation marks that I have on my skin from psoriasis. I assume that&#x27;s the exfoliant properties.  But whatever it is, I love it.  Use it every day and just signed up for it on subscribe and save. It&#x27;s not like other lotions...you really just have to try and see for yourself.  They also make a face version, but not in the U.S. You can get it on the Amazon U.S. site, it just takes forever to get to you from England - but that works very well too.  Please never stop making this stuff!ly just have to try and see for yourself.

    <li> My doctor recommended that I use this for my dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I don&#x27;t really see the effect of it.  It only makes my skin is smoother when i use it but my skin is the same kinda driest without using it.</li>
    <li> Great value! My wife swears by this product for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle of body lotion as a gift but it is going on my permanent buy list! I have seriously dry skin. My regular doctor just recommended I see a dermatologist. Then I tried this! This lotion is amazing. My skin feels soft and looks so much better. I can start wearing shorts and short sleeve shirts again because I don&#x27;t have to cover up my scaly skin. And I don&#x27;t need to go for professional help---just use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much, Eucerin!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion!! I personally feel like I need to go to a meeting when it comes to how many different types of lotion I own.  I am always looking for the perfect one that will sooth my dry skin, and keep it protected.  I do a lot of dishes, work with my hands continually, so I wash them very often.  My skin is often dry.  I really want a lotion that will add a protective layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a creamy lotion, it feels soft and silky.  You will feel like you are putting on a protective layer on your hand.  This lotion feels so amazing,  it reminds me of my L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter lotion.  This is much more reasonably priced than higher end lines, but has a very similar feel.  It is heavier, and will give your hands a protective layer that will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> We have a wood burning stove.  The stove plus the cold outdoors multiplies the dryness factor in the winter.  Delighted to try this Eucerin Professional Repair body lotion.  It is easy to apply, stays on your skin and hours later you can still feel it.  It does not wash easily off your hands, if that is an issue for you.  I washed my hands in liquid soap and water to clean it off.  My hands feel more smooth than usual, even with the washing.  I don&#x27;t mind that the lotion takes effort to wash off my hands for the benefit of having it remain longer on my face.  Guess that speaks to its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the lotion did come out in the packaging in the innards of the box.  Not much, but thought packaging may want to be looked at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m enjoying this lotion.  Will update if there is anything new to report.</li>
    <li> Eucerin really is the best lotion on the market. It keys your skin moisturized and actually heals (or aids in healing) damaged skin. Having used several product over the years there is simply nothing that is better. You notice that your skin still feels silky even 24 hours later. Not many other products can say that (especially not at this price). On this particular model (describing the bottle) the pump dispenses quite a bit at one time, so discretion is necessary (be careful). There is just nothing else to compare it to, so if you want the best product, you found it. It is just up to you to decide how much you want and what type of dispensing system.</li>
    <li> this lotion is the best for very dry skin. amazing product</li>
