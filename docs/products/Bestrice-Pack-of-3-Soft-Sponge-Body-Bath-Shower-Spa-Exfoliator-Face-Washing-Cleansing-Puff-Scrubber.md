      <li>Super soft, small in package originally, but they soak up much bigger.</li>
      <li>My husband uses his every day and it has gotten way bigger and softer and less rubbery, so maybe it works better now?</li>
      <li>Soft sponges...plentiful.</li>
      <li>very tuff ..sent back</li>
      <li>buy again, but they may be beneficial for those with extremely sensitive skin for short-term use.</li>
      <li>big problem is that they&#x27;re an absolute pain to rinse out.  </li>
      <li>Very soft and gentle but smaller than I expected.</li>
      <li>to be honest theyre so hard to rinse and its just not worth it, their color starts to change after a couple week of use.</li>

    <li> I love the softness and texture of the sponges but was unhappy at the amount of water they hold after each use.</li>
    <li> I was lookng for a nice soft sponge for my kiddos. I am very happy with these sponges. My kids love them too.</li>
    <li> I really like these Soft Sponges the color is just like the picture, very soft</li>
    <li> It took forever to get these sponges. They are small and not really useful. I use them as decorations in my guest bath.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this</li>
    <li> Squeezing the water out so it&#x27;s dries out is tough.  Had to hang it out in the sun to get completely dried out.</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband and me. They were really small upon arrival and I was disappointed. I used it anyway and it was rubbery and didn&#x27;t exfoliate like I expected, which I guess is ok for people with sensitive skin, but not what I like. My husband uses his every day and it has gotten way bigger and softer and less rubbery, so maybe it works better now? He seems to like it ok.</li>
    <li> Very soft and gentle but smaller than I expected. Colors are beautiful. Bright and vibrant.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice sponge, but there is something in the sponge..  Maybe a soap or something??? Smells pretty but I&#x27;m not sure what it is so I don&#x27;t want to use it and I can&#x27;t get it out of the sponge!!!</li>
    <li> Soft sponges...plentiful. Easy to hold, easy to crush in my hand. String is a plus, can find after each shower. Love different colors, can give away as gifts. Wears well. Holds soap well.</li>
    <li> I Like Them. I Prefer Them Over Washcloth</li>
    <li> Great! But it seems like you never have quite enough bubbles to last. Super soft, small in package originally, but they soak up much bigger.</li>
    <li> love these sponges so much. they fit in the palm of your hand and help make all my different soaps really foam up. thank you.</li>
    <li> These are a lot smaller than I thought they would be. They are nice and colorful.</li>
    <li> I have only used one of the sponges once and it is already falling apart.  These may work for your face but do not try to use them for your body.</li>
    <li> They have a firm but comfortable texture that exfoliates pretty well.  The three sponges in the pack I received were of widely differing sizes.  I got one that was about 4 inches in diameter, and two that were about 2 and 1/2 inches.  Not as durable as I had hoped: They last about 4 - 6 weeks with daily use and a weekly wash in the washing machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the description says they are &amp;#34;for the ladies,&amp;#34; they seem to have worked quite well on my dude bod.  I have not noticed myself growing breasts or anything.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. These sponges feel nice on the skin and keep suds plentiful</li>
    <li> These were EXACTLY what I had wanted. Very soft and spongie, the colors are very pretty and will work well as add ons to the bath gift sets I&#x27;m giving as christmas presents.</li>
    <li> love it for black hair, makes a great curl pattern without damage to the hair</li>
    <li> Solid and well made. Good for  slow exfoliation, very thick sponges here folks, quality feel too. Not a large sponge, fist-size for almost anyone. Nice bulk, should last  a while. Keep a handful in the closet for guests.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t crumble, they&#x27;re soft and come in fun colors for a great price!</li>
    <li> to be honest theyre so hard to rinse and its just not worth it, their color starts to change after a couple week of use.</li>
    <li> very small ...smell funny...very tuff ..sent back</li>
    <li> Nice quality sponges but they are extremely small definitely made for face which they are not advertised as which is disappointing</li>
    <li> The sponges are pretty however, they easily start to come apart after two uses. Perhaps you might want to invest your money in s better quality sponge 😕</li>
    <li> These are a nice size. I like the rope handles and having the different colors to use with different body washes.</li>
    <li> These are very soft and gentle, so they&#x27;d be good for very delicate skin.  Unfortunately they offer no exfoliation which is what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big problem is that they&#x27;re an absolute pain to rinse out.  You&#x27;ll be standing there in the shower wringing these sponges out for at least ten minutes before you get all of the residual soap out - good luck with that!  I usually just give up and let them stay somewhat soapy.

Not exactly the most sanitary in the long-run as they hold stagnant water, possibly inviting bacterial growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but they may be beneficial for those with extremely sensitive skin for short-term use.</li>
    <li> They do what they are intended to do and look better than other sponges I&#x27;m my opinion.</li>
