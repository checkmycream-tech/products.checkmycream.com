      <li>Nothing, absolutely nothing!!!  </li>
      <li>and then I used wraps for the last month and had Amazing Results!</li>

      <li>You get my cell phone, email, Facebook (English and Spanish) whatever it takes for me to help you on the road to better HEALTH and a BEAUTIFUL looking</li>
      <li>as a loyal customer.</li>
      <li>Because I signed up with their loyal plan, I am stuck purchasing for 3 months (I bought through a distributor)..  </li>
      <li>I address with my clients BEFORE, DURING and AFTER wrapping them because I follow the company&#x27;s policies and my clients have tremendous success!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I address with my clients BEFORE, DURING and AFTER wrapping them because I follow the company&#x27;s policies and my clients have tremendous success!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and im pretty fit....</li>
      <li>Great Product Got mine for half off at http://excellenthealth.myitworks.com/shop/</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping?</li>
      <li>Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping?</li>
      <li>The prices they are asking for their products are more than what you&#x27;d pay going through the actual company and being a loyal customer or distributor.</li>
      <li>: I rated the Ultimate Body Applicator 5 STARS because IT IS a 5 STAR product regardless of it being sold against company policies :)</li>
      <li>should have gone with first instinct</li>
      <li>It worked for the first wrap</li>
      <li>They really do work!</li>
      <li>: I rated the Ultimate Body Applicator 5 STARS because IT IS a 5 STAR product regardless of it being sold against company policies :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>but it really works.</li>
      <li>DID YOU KNOW it is highly recommended you take BEFORE</li>
      <li>My skin is more firm and my cellulite is diminishing.</li>
      <li>I was right all along, only exercise and eating well</li>
      <li>If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself</li>
      <li>In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature.</li>
      <li>These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occurring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life.</li>
      <li>getting ready to order a second pack.</li>
      <li>Half your body weight in ounces is the right amount.</li>
      <li>Ultimate Body Applicator is made with ALL NATURAL ingredients and has a shelf life.</li>
      <li>So, I bought the Ultimate applicator and have used 3 wraps, so far.  </li>
      <li>I loved the crazy wrap thing it worked with me</li>
      <li>I used them before in the past and i would recommend them to anyone who needs a quick fix.</li>
      <li>but after the first pad I could see  a little difference on the second one I measured and it had shrunk.</li>

    <li> It Works Global, the company that created and markets the Ultimate Body Applicator, SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS distributors from selling their products on Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist as well as other places such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Body Applicator is made with ALL NATURAL ingredients and has a shelf life. When items are ordered through these venues, by sellers who are violating company policies, there is no guarantee as to the purchase or expiration date(s) of the product. In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature. There is no guarantee as to where the seller obtained the items or how they were stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, is that our company is designed to provide ongoing support. We are a team - a FAMILY. When someone purchases through me, I guide them EVERY step of the way. If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself (I&#x27;ve done it on the phone and via text as well). I will explain the ingredients, the way the product is supposed to be applied, the way the product is designed to work, the way the product may affect the body, what to expect from the Ultimate Body Applicator after 1st application (1/4 of a FULL treatment) and what they need to do to have the GREATEST success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR INSTANCE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID YOU KNOW that one wrap is actually ¼ of a FULL treatment? A full treatment is a box of FOUR (4) wraps. DID YOU KNOW that the wrap continues to work for 72 hours after you put it on? DID YOU KNOW that you need to drink LOTS of water while wearing it, (preferably) before wearing the wrap and during the 72 hours it continues to work? Half your body weight in ounces is the right amount. DID YOU KNOW that you are supposed to measure in 3 places before, after and then in 72 hours after applying the wrap to track your results better? DID YOU KNOW it is highly recommended you take BEFORE and AFTER pictures because they help track your progress? DID YOU KNOW that you cannot have any lotions on before wrapping? Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping? ALL these things AND MORE I address with my clients BEFORE, DURING and AFTER wrapping them because I follow the company&#x27;s policies and my clients have tremendous success!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE don&#x27;t let the practices of someone violating company policies STOP you from becoming HEALTHY and having the body of your dreams in the process. PLEASE friend me on FB. I have tons of before and after pictures (some of myself) which I will share with you. There is tons of information on my page which I update daily. I will give you tips. You get my cell phone, email, Facebook (English and Spanish) whatever it takes for me to help you on the road to better HEALTH and a BEAUTIFUL looking you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I rated the Ultimate Body Applicator 5 STARS because IT IS a 5 STAR product regardless of it being sold against company policies :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OFFICIAL COMPANY WEBSITE: wrapspa.myitworks.com&lt;br /&gt;FACEBOOK: facebook.com/wrap.spass?

    <li> Seller was awesome!! Product was excellent</li>
    <li> Loved them came in sooner then expected and worked great</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love!! I used The Greens for a month to cleanse, then Thermofit for a month and then I used wraps for the last month and had Amazing Results! :) my distributor is so caring, involved and works with me for my progress. She will walk you threw your fitness journey. She loves what she does! Check her out [...]</li>
    <li> Bought cheaper at wraps.howtonow.org - reason 3 stars.  Very happy with results!!  These are personal results with just 1 wrap - cannot wait to do more!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me. If anything, I looked  as if I had more fat. I followed directions to the tee. Wasted $</li>
    <li> Was great and would recommend this to any one that wanted to try it great product but a little pricey</li>
    <li> Get any It Works products for an It Works distributor. Molly Carr</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never believed in anything but exercising and eating healthy.  Of course, after children, routines change!  What can I say, I was desperate!  I tried the It Works Fat Fighters, nothing!  Because I signed up with their loyal plan, I am stuck purchasing for 3 months (I bought through a distributor)..  So, I bought the Ultimate applicator and have used 3 wraps, so far.  Every 3 days as directed.  I wore them to bed (8hrs) in hopes of maximizing results!  Nothing, absolutely nothing!!!  Supposedly people notice a change after one wrap.  These scams prey on people&#x27;s emotions and desperation while digging into their wallets!!!  Sorry folks!!!  I was right all along, only exercise and eating well can help us improve ourselves.</li>
    <li> Didnt work at all. I followed all the instructions including drinking half your body weight in oz. Nothing changed. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I loved the crazy wrap thing it worked with me</li>
    <li> Great Product Got mine for half off at http://excellenthealth.myitworks.com/shop/</li>
    <li> used as directed, produced zero results. should have gone with first instinct</li>
    <li> It worked for the first wrap but I&#x27;m still using it so we will see.im hoping to hv the stomach I&#x27;ve always wanted</li>
    <li> its not a trick or a gimic, these wraps are amazing. I used them before in the past and i would recommend them to anyone who needs a quick fix. before the big day, a date vacation etc.... I love them!!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great for tightening and firming up my skin before my honeymoon to Mexico! I have continued using this product and wrap 1x per week and am seeing great results. My skin is more firm and my cellulite is diminishing. I highly recommend! I purchased a 4 pack for only $59 from kmstarks.myitworks.com. I have also been using the It Works Hair Skin Nails and my hair is growing like CRAZY!! I am only paying $33 for those pills and purchased through same site - kmstarks.myitworks.com. The only product I&#x27;ve tried and didn&#x27;t see results from was the Lip and Eye cream, not worth the money (boo!). Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work but it really works. I had my son at 40 and I didn&#x27;t like the pouch but after the first pad I could see  a little difference on the second one I measured and it had shrunk. The last one and the wrap is getting smaller, which show&#x27;s that my tummy is getting smaller. And I look great my clothes aren&#x27;t tight in the tummy area. I love this and for the price and the results its worth every penny. getting ready to order a second pack.</li>
    <li> Received and took it to a it works sales rep in the area and they were expired I still used since they has only just expired this month and of course it did nothing for me and I followed all the rules waste of money</li>
    <li> This product is being sold illegally. It Works Distributors are prohibited from selling products or advertising on Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, etc. If you purchase an It Works product from this site you are not guaranteeing the product. These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occurring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life. You have no idea if these are any good and ordering from a distributor allows you to gain product credit points, customer service, and you save money, or make money for yourself as a distributor! The prices they are asking for their products are more than what you&#x27;d pay going through the actual company and being a loyal customer or distributor. I rated the item 5 stars because it is a 5 star item if purchased through an It Works Independent Distributor. If you want more information, please visit my link, [...] :)</li>
    <li> I have no doubt that It Works products work but it is illegal for these distributors or customers to sell these products on Amazon.com, Ebay, Craigslist, etc - My sister sells these products... Please visit her website at deewrapped.myitworks.com to get these products MUCH cheaper and without supporting illegal practices. God bless everyone but the people who are doing this is just wrong and they know this is not acceptable in any instance as they provide training materials and set specific guidelines for distributors. Either way, my sister will be happy to serve you and do it the right way... The IT WORKS WAY :-)</li>
    <li> They really do work! If they didn&#x27;t work for you then I am sure they weren&#x27;t done right. I got mine cheaper though at [...] as a loyal customer. You save 40% off retail price as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) so it&#x27;s definitely worth it. There are also many great products to choose from.  Shop around before buying</li>
    <li> didnt care for it this prouduct never works for me this is my second time giving it a try i just wasted my money but i can honestly say this isnt for me</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work. I work out and im pretty fit.... don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
    <li> Before you try these products, please do your research It works! does not allow the sale of their products on Amazon or eBay because, they require specific instructions in order to work. They also expire and can should only be shipped through the company or an independent distributor that has gone through the training and understands the sensitivity of the products and how they work. Feel free to contact me with questions or to see my before and after pictures. The product does work and I can walk you through the proper use of it. Mariannav920@gmail.com</li>
