      <li>Great Product for Europe.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!!</li>
      <li>One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve purchased many hair dryers).</li>

      <li>but I expect it works in MOST Eu countries.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to go to Europe with it next time, it will be great!</li>
      <li>and I love them all.</li>
      <li>I use this brand in the US and love it, so i figured I&#x27;d try it out in the 220V version.  </li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I was AMAZED at how awesome the Elchim European dryer worked!!!</li>
      <li>i have been using Elchim, which most salons uses and my hair stylist recomended to me about 20 years ago.</li>
      <li>but it does not have a cool button which I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>It was powerful and worked better than trying to use an underpowered hotel or travel-weight hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>hair dryer  works great and is relatively quiet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth every dollar!</li>
      <li>that wasn&#x27;t going to really work (plus converter and adapter) since I need a good dryer to blow out my curly hair straight.</li>
      <li>So many US hair dryers give out to much heat.</li>
      <li>The ladies loved having this on our European trip.  </li>
      <li>I have coarse hair that requires high heat for drying and this blow dryer is great.  </li>
      <li>After reading all of the amazing reviews, I thought I would give this hair dryer a try for my big trip to France in July 2013.</li>
      <li>and I have used many professional dryers</li>
      <li>It is worth the money...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is powerful and dries hair in a shorter period of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The hair dryer is amazingly powerful.</li>
      <li>It was worth carrying the 2 pounds with us.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I bought the US version and use it daily!  </li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t love is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy for the suitcase, but it was completely worth taking that extra pair of shoes out of my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;Again, excellent hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I think I like this dryer better than the one I have back home in the USA.</li>
      <li>so this product saved me so much time!  </li>
      <li>I needed a 220v blowdryer for our new home and wanted to be sure I got one of professional grade.</li>
      <li>It is so much more powerful that my high end dryer back in the US!</li>
      <li>She was complaining about the converters not allowing her hair dryer to blow very well.  </li>
      <li>The travel size dryers don&#x27;t get hot or powerful enough to give me the same blowout as the full size.  </li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re the only kind that will properly dry my hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased this hair dryer as I regularly travel to Europe and wanted a full size dryer.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend</li>
      <li>My Son and his family live in Italy.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this for guest when they visit, so far everyone loves it!</li>
      <li>The pressure is far superior to what i use in the states and dried my hair in less time</li>
      <li>I almost worried the power would go out in our old boutique hotel, but there weren&#x27;t any problems.</li>
      <li>While the dryer was not too heavy , it was very strong and my hair were dry in no time.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this hair dryer for traveling around European countries with 220V.</li>
      <li>She reported back to me that she loves her new hair dryer and loves doing her hair now that she has some power.</li>
      <li>dry hair fast, not to heavy and keeps hair smooth for a long time.</li>

    <li> Wonderful and it is the best ....  people wanted to take it from me.. &#x3D;) It is worth the money...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent blowdryer. I was so happy to have found it on Amazon. It works perfectly and was a lifesaver for me during my trip to Europe.</li>

I was done in 15 minutes with this hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair dryer for traveling around European countries with 220V.

    <li> Great Product for Europe.</li>
    <li> I took this hair dryer on a trip to Eastern Europe.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer  works great and is relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;It is powerful and dries hair in a shorter period of time.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this dryer for European vacations.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for guest when they visit, so far everyone loves it! Great quality blowdryer! Dries well, no frizzy hair......</li>
    <li> After reading all of the amazing reviews, I thought I would give this hair dryer a try for my big trip to France in July 2013. In the past I have taken my US dryer and a converter, but still it didn&#x27;t work well....On its highest setting it worked worse than the lowest setting at home. Not worth it for my to drag a hair dryer to Europe that wasn&#x27;t going to really work (plus converter and adapter) since I need a good dryer to blow out my curly hair straight.

It blows very hard hard and you can still have little or no heat if you wish. So many US hair dryers give out to much heat. Also, I loved not having to deal with a converter and adapter plug. This one has the European style plug and it will not work in the US if you were not clear. For sure I will be buying the US version of this dryer! These dryers will last for YEARS.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was bought for an upcoming trip to Europe. After looking at the picture ,I assumed it came with the concentrator nozzle. It arrived without a nozzle even though the box said it was included. The company was very long in getting back to me and I had to go through Amazon the resolve the return. I am also out the amount it cost me to return ship this hairdryer. They wanted to charge me a restocking fee as well for their mistake!! I would never use this seller again!!!!</li>
    <li> i have been using Elchim, which most salons uses and my hair stylist recomended to me about 20 years ago. tried others but always went  back to Elchim. dry hair fast, not to heavy and keeps hair smooth for a long time.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought this before our trip to Europe.  Worked great with lots of power.</li>
    <li> As a hair stylist I have been using Elchim dryers for over 21 years and I love them all.</li>
    <li> took this to Italy.  It was great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Daughter in law as a Christmas present.  My Son and his family live in Italy.  She was complaining about the converters not allowing her hair dryer to blow very well.  She reported back to me that she loves her new hair dryer and loves doing her hair now that she has some power.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome and I have used many professional dryers, they&#x27;re the only kind that will properly dry my hair. I think I like this dryer better than the one I have back home in the USA. I purchased it specifically for my trip to Europe and I am so glad I did. You will not regret buying it. Worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> I took this with me to Madrid..It worked perfect, my hair looked great the entire trip!  I have coarse hair that requires high heat for drying and this blow dryer is great.  I liked it so much I bought the US version and use it daily!  Can&#x27;t wait to go to Europe with it next time, it will be great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer as I regularly travel to Europe and wanted a full size dryer.

It&#x27;s not overly heavy but it does not have a cool button which I would have liked.  It&#x27;s not the best I have ever used, but overall it met my needs and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Used this dryer ALL over Europe (France,Prague,Poland..) and it worked perfectly..everywhere! Wish my blower at home (US) worked as well. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> We were relocated to Azerbaijan for my husbands job and I bought this blowdryer to take with me.  I use this brand in the US and love it, so i figured I&#x27;d try it out in the 220V version.  It is a tad heavier than the USA version but works just as well.  There are multiple heat and pressure settings.  It also comes with a diffuser.  I am very happy with my purchase and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this EU specific hair dryer due to all the research I did on understanding how an NA hair dryer would work in EU using an EU converter.  Suffice it to say, this product is perfect!  If i can find an NA version of it I will buy it.  It can only be used in EU.  The pressure is far superior to what i use in the states and dried my hair in less time and I just cant say enough about the quality.  I have very thick naturally curly hair so this product saved me so much time!  I only used it in Germany but I expect it works in MOST Eu countries.</li>
