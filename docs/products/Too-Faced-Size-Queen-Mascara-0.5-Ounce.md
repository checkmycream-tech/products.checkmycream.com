      <li>A gift for a friend, it arrived quickly and without any damage.  </li>
      <li>Love this product for two main reasons.</li>
      <li>and she quickly mentioned this product and</li>
      <li>I hope she enjoyed it, as the other reviews in regards to the product performance seem to be amazing.</li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay the price again, but it was fun to try once.</li>
      <li>I bought it thinking it would be nice to have a larger mulitple length brushes at the end.</li>
      <li>I used to steal it from my roommate but then realized how much it was and thought it was totally worth the investment!</li>
      <li>The brush is simply huge with this particular mascara.  </li>
      <li>My first impression of this brush was that I was going to poke my eye out...</li>
      <li>Love the brand, but the brush is too big</li>
      <li>I love the big brush this has for definition of each lash.  </li>
      <li>The large brush is intimidating at first, but you get used to it.</li>

      <li>this mascara pretty much fulfilled all that I have been wanting and waiting for in a mascara.  </li>

      <li>The packaging is so cute and feminine and feels really sturdy (not cheap)</li>
      <li>Washes off easily, something I&#x27;ve struggled with finding in other volumizing and lengthening mascaras.</li>
      <li>So much product is on the brush and the brush is so huge and round it glops on my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>The size of it is ridiculous and kind of corny.</li>
      <li>It defines your eye lashes and makes it look look very natural.</li>
      <li>and after a little practice the huge size of the brush didn&#x27;t cause any issues.  </li>
      <li>Great product, lasts longer - doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast in the tube - than the less expensive discount store brands, therefore worth the money.</li>
      <li>The brush is big, but it is not hard to use.</li>
      <li>I personally prefer natural looking fuller eyelashes...</li>
      <li>Love the formula hate the brush way to big bristles are spaced too far apart for full coverage.</li>
      <li>Being an asian girl with barely there eyelashes</li>
      <li>I like it very much, not sure if I would buy again because of the cost, though.</li>

<li> I usually don&#x27;t like big brushes because it&#x27;s hard to be precise with the smaller, baby lashes around my eyes, so that was a negative for me at first, BUT i applied it anyway and let me just say one word: FALSIES!&lt;br</li>
<li> I literally cleaned the wand and using scissors cut the fibers in the brush in half simply not to waste this purchase.</li>
<li> I usually use a simple mascara to start and then top it off with a layer of this false eye lash</li>
<li> Previously I was wearing three different brands to get the same look and now have it all in one bottle.</li>
<li> I have used it for a couple of years now, and I won&#x27;t use any other.  </li>
<li> In other words</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to get every lash covered especially the ones in the outer corners...</li>
<li> It truly makes lashes thick and long.</li>
<li> I wear contacts and quite a few brands make my eyes irritated.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had it on for a few hours now</li>
<li> It gets all of the eyelashes, even the small ones.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to get the mascara on my lashes without it getting all over the rest of my eye and face.</li>
<li> With an eyelash curler and a few coats of this mascara, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already wearing mascara (loreal power volume collagen) but this too faced mascara seriously added some length to the tips of my lashes and kept a mean curl.</li>
<li> This mascara does the job by seriously lengthening and extending to the max.  </li>
<li> If you have false lashes I suppose this might work for you.</li>
<li> They seriously felt fake.</li>
<li> how it made her lashes look fake.  </li>

    <li> I like it but I wouldn&#x27;t pay the price again, but it was fun to try once.</li>
    <li> Love the brand, but the brush is too big</li>
    <li> Love the Two Faced line and use many of its products, including three Two Faced mascaras. The brush is simply huge with this particular mascara.  I liken it to a bottle brush. So much product is on the brush and the brush is so huge and round it glops on my eyelashes. I literally cleaned the wand and using scissors cut the fibers in the brush in half simply not to waste this purchase. If you have false lashes I suppose this might work for you.</li>
    <li> I was watching Rachel Talbott&#x27;s June 2013 Favorites youtube video and she quickly mentioned this product and how it made her lashes look fake.  Being an asian girl with barely there eyelashes I definitely wanted to check this one out.  I went to Sephora to test it out and was struck by how big the brush was. The box even boasts \\&quot;GIGANTIC BRUSH!\\&quot; in big bold letters. I usually don&#x27;t like big brushes because it&#x27;s hard to be precise with the smaller, baby lashes around my eyes, so that was a negative for me at first, BUT i applied it anyway and let me just say one word: FALSIES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already wearing mascara (loreal power volume collagen) but this too faced mascara seriously added some length to the tips of my lashes and kept a mean curl. They seriously felt fake. I&#x27;ve had it on for a few hours now and I can you assure it&#x27;s not like those fiber mascaras that start flaking. This mascara does the job by seriously lengthening and extending to the max.  I am not one to believe the hype or buy anything I have doubts about, so you can rest assured that this is good stuff.  this mascara pretty much fulfilled all that I have been wanting and waiting for in a mascara.  The packaging is so cute and feminine and feels really sturdy (not cheap) my only letdown is that it&#x27;s not waterproof, so I have yet to see how it holds up with water. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Never changing to another mascara ever again.</li>
    <li> I watched a lot of beauty bloggers on you tube praising this mascara and I decided to give it a shot. I have always used L&#x27;Oreal brand and been happy with it.. Well.. this mascara is not really such a hype.. I used it and honestly it went on as well as my L&#x27;Oreal faux extensions mascara except you pay twice as much for this one. The brush is BIG so it&#x27;s hard to get every lash covered especially the ones in the outer corners...yes it gives volume but the same time the lashes get separated so  you eyes look more like doll eyes. I personally prefer natural looking fuller eyelashes... In other words yes I will continue to use this until I run out but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another brand..it just did not sweep me off my feet. I will stick to telescopic</li>
    <li> I wear contacts and quite a few brands make my eyes irritated.  I love the big brush this has for definition of each lash.  Previously I was wearing three different brands to get the same look and now have it all in one bottle.</li>
    <li> My first impression of this brush was that I was going to poke my eye out...however, it made my lashes look great and after a little practice the huge size of the brush didn&#x27;t cause any issues.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my daughter. When I first got it, it had very different brush than your usual mascara, once you learn how to use it, your eye lashes will look gorgeous. It defines your eye lashes and makes it look look very natural. I like this product more than any of my other mascara that I owned. Would recommend to anyone who wants to have good mascara.</li>
    <li> Great product, lasts longer - doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast in the tube - than the less expensive discount store brands, therefore worth the money. This is the second time purchasing it and got one for my sister too.</li>
    <li> A gift for a friend, it arrived quickly and without any damage.  I hope she enjoyed it, as the other reviews in regards to the product performance seem to be amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it would be nice to have a larger mulitple length brushes at the end. The end however is the same size as my EYE! It&#x27;s hard to get the mascara on my lashes without it getting all over the rest of my eye and face. The size of it is ridiculous and kind of corny. Woulnd&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This mascara was recommended by a sales person at Ulta, but they were sold out. So I decided to get this online. The brush is big, but it is not hard to use. It gets all of the eyelashes, even the small ones. Minimum clumping, which tends to be a problem for me. I like it very much, not sure if I would buy again because of the cost, though.</li>
    <li> buy the third time. Lengthens eyelashes. Not fray on the face during the day.</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara.  I have used it for a couple of years now, and I won&#x27;t use any other.  It is quick, complete coverage! Love that!</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever!! I usually use a simple mascara to start and then top it off with a layer of this false eye lash look! I used to steal it from my roommate but then realized how much it was and thought it was totally worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years LOVE IT!!! But I put a coat underneath it of another mascara then use this over it GREAT product</li>
    <li> Love this product for two main reasons. It truly makes lashes thick and long. Washes off easily, something I&#x27;ve struggled with finding in other volumizing and lengthening mascaras.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this mascara on Amazon, as I&#x27;d been buying it from Ulta at a higher price. It is my favorite mascara! The large brush is intimidating at first, but you get used to it. With an eyelash curler and a few coats of this mascara, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes. I just bought some as a gift for my bestie.</li>
    <li> Love it but product runs out quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the formula hate the brush way to big bristles are spaced too far apart for full coverage. Have to use a different brush...</li>
