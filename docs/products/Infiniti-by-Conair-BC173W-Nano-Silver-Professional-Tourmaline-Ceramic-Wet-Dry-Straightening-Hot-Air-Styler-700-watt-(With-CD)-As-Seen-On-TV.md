      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS HAIR DRIER!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>I already had this styler but was stolen from me, so I bought it again because it&#x27;s really great.   </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with what it helps me to make out of my hair</li>
      <li>I have used it for years and love it!</li>
      <li>It took some time to learn how to effectively use it, but now I am a semi-pro at it.</li>
      <li>keep it very clean of hair!</li>
      <li>, so it dries while you comb, really easy!</li>
      <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love this hairdryer and can not seem to find it anywhere, it is always out of stock.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight and very easy to use,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great tool for maintaining smooth straight hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, but my hair is fine.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your hair shining, really smooth.</li>
      <li>worked like a dream to smooth out my hair.  </li>
      <li>Great because it works on wet hair too.</li>
      <li>Does not burn my hair and works really quick</li>
      <li>I have found this hot air styler to be an indispensable tool.</li>
      <li>and as I mentioned I have fine hair not thick hair, so for it to burn up so quickly seems unreasonable.  </li>
      <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has two hot speeds and one cool speed.</li>
      <li>It works great on long hair- and works best if used on still wet towel dried hair.</li>
      <li>So easy to use, even my 6 year old daughter asks for it!</li>
      <li>The first model I bought (prev.</li>
      <li>the barrel was smaller, but it may be more beneficial for women with longer</li>
      <li>Even after my first one caught fire.</li>
      <li>My first lasted for a few years and I really loved it.  </li>
      <li>It really helps me maintain my style.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair and this dry</li>
      <li>But when the original died and I replaced it with a new one it only lasted about a two weeks.</li>
      <li>It does dry hair smoothly and straightens it out.  </li>
      <li>With this styler it&#x27;s really easy to get your hair done, it&#x27;s not a heavy big dryer, and you don&#x27;t need a brush to comb your hair while drying, because it&#x27;s actually a brush-like that emits hot air (can be low, high or even cool)</li>
      <li>My hair is not thick, coarse, or super curly, but if I don&#x27;t straighten it, it looks frizzy and I can&#x27;t style it at all.</li>
      <li>and I finally had to buy a new one after many years of constant use.  </li>
      <li>I was afraid that I would not be able to find to purchase again after so many years and was very please that I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time on my daughter natural hair and it was user friendly and less time consuming because it played to rolls, straigtening and drying.</li>
      <li>This is supposed to work for short-medium hair, but I have long hair and it works fine for me, because I also bought the bigger one, from the same line (infiniti) that is supposed to be for longer hair, but with that one it&#x27;s not so easy, because it&#x27;s bigger, heavier, and it not tense hair as well as this one.   </li>
      <li>Your hair is not entangled because it has no small bristles, neither rotates, it grabs your hair with a tensor system that you can adjust.   </li>
      <li>I returned it and ordered a new one which was fine for a few months</li>
      <li>I am going natural and I  had my last relaxer the first week of August 2012</li>
      <li>I use my regular blow dryer to dry my hair and then use this to smooth and straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if the comb was a bit longer, that would mean the heat from the dryer would be a litte further from the scalp (no burns).</li>
      <li>It did dry it quickly, but I still needed to use my flat iron.</li>
      <li>Use this styling dryer to dry my short bob hair (right below ear level).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>Great on dry and wet hair (as advertised), I don&#x27;t like how the combs are soooooo short, as I have thick hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this styler in the past and it is the only one that gets my hair smooth.  </li>
      <li>I have natural coarse hair and blow dryer with attachment always come apart,with this infinti wet dry my hair dry faster, detangle and straightening at one time ready for me to use my hot comb</li>
      <li>It gets my hair straight and dry in ten minutes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other types of air brushes in the past, but they usually burn your hair, are not so easy to handle and are real brushes that end up tangling the hair.  </li>

    <li> I have found this hot air styler to be an indispensable tool. Contrary to the idea of using it on wet hair, I use it on dry hair only, as someone might use a curling iron or flat iron. I use my regular blow dryer to dry my hair and then use this to smooth and straighten my hair. While I do have a flat iron, it seems to take all of the body out of my hair. The Infinity gives my hair smoothness,  shine, and straightness without leaving it lifeless. My hair is not thick, coarse, or super curly, but if I don&#x27;t straighten it, it looks frizzy and I can&#x27;t style it at all. I would definitely recommend this styler to anyone whose hair needs control without taking all the life out of it.</li>
    <li> I already had this styler but was stolen from me, so I bought it again because it&#x27;s really great.   With this styler it&#x27;s really easy to get your hair done, it&#x27;s not a heavy big dryer, and you don&#x27;t need a brush to comb your hair while drying, because it&#x27;s actually a brush-like that emits hot air (can be low, high or even cool), so it dries while you comb, really easy! Your hair is not entangled because it has no small bristles, neither rotates, it grabs your hair with a tensor system that you can adjust.   It leaves your hair shining, really smooth.

All my life I&#x27;ve having trouble to get my hair comb, and I&#x27;ve always have a hard time using dryers, irons and brushes, because those things burn my hair or entangled it, but nothing of that happens with this one, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s the only styler I would ever recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product! This is my 2nd and I&#x27;m very satisfied with what it helps me to make out of my hair</li>
    <li> I like this hair-dryer. Great on dry and wet hair (as advertised), I don&#x27;t like how the combs are soooooo short, as I have thick hair. It would be nice if the comb was a bit longer, that would mean the heat from the dryer would be a litte further from the scalp (no burns). The first model I bought (prev. to this new model) was only $27 and is no way different from this newer model priced at a ridiculous amount.</li>

    <li> I love this hairdryer and can not seem to find it anywhere, it is always out of stock.  I wish that it was easier to find.  It is light weight and very easy to use, unfortunately I guess I used it so much that it quit working.  I hope to find another one soon</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair and this product and it works. Does not burn my hair and works really quick</li>
    <li> review from my girlfriend: IT IS AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time on my daughter natural hair and it was user friendly and less time consuming because it played to rolls, straigtening and drying.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for years. I was afraid that I would not be able to find to purchase again after so many years and was very please that I found it on Amazon. In fact I purchased 2 so I have a back up down road. In the 10+ years that I have used this item this is my 3rd and 4th purchase so they do last a while. I use it every single day.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if the tension switch is working because all for settings feel the same.  It does dry hair smoothly and straightens it out.  It took some time to learn how to effectively use it, but now I am a semi-pro at it.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve purchased this item. I have used it for years and love it! Even after my first one caught fire. BTW- keep it very clean of hair! It works great on long hair- and works best if used on still wet towel dried hair. So easy to use, even my 6 year old daughter asks for it! Trust me- Buy it!</li>
    <li> I have natural coarse hair and blow dryer with attachment always come apart,with this infinti wet dry my hair dry faster, detangle and straightening at one time ready for me to use my hot comb</li>
    <li> Use this styling dryer to dry my short bob hair (right below ear level).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the barrel was smaller, but it may be more beneficial for women with longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has two hot speeds and one cool speed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these before and I finally had to buy a new one after many years of constant use.  Great because it works on wet hair too.</li>
    <li> The product did everything that it was represented to do and I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have used this styler in the past and it is the only one that gets my hair smooth.  I wish it were not so hard to find and that Conair will take note and start to produce it again.</li>
    <li> I have now been through 3 of these dryers.  My first lasted for a few years and I really loved it.  I have fine curly hair and this dry worked like a dream to smooth out my hair.  But when the original died and I replaced it with a new one it only lasted about a two weeks. I returned it and ordered a new one which was fine for a few months but it just burned out on me this morning.  I only  dry my hair about 2 x a week and as I mentioned I have fine hair not thick hair, so for it to burn up so quickly seems unreasonable.  I am so disappointed because this dryer&#x27;s design is the easiest I have found to smooth out curly hair.  I&#x27;m wondering if they have switched the type of motor they put in it but I&#x27;m quite hesitant to order another one having had two burn out with in less than 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer.  I chose it because it takes the frizz out of my hair.  I would recommend it to my friends and family and anyone that doesn&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time styling your hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair and have been using this Conair piece for years. It&#x27;s a great tool for maintaining smooth straight hair.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t know what I will do if they discontinue this !!!</li>
