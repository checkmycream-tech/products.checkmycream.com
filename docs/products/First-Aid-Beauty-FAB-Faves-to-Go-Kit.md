      <li>Mainly was getting it for the moisture cream, but needed a cleanser at the time and figured this was perfect.</li>

      <li>I also now enjoy the face cleanser and the radiance wipes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great set to try these items without a big investment...</li>
      <li>This will probably last me about 2 months I would guess, which is a great deal and a nice long time to make sure that this works for my skin before I buy more.  </li>
      <li>BUT, since I am getting married this year, my friends convinced me that I need to start treating my face better and establish a skin care routine before the wedding.</li>
      <li>I took them on my first cruise and was really glad that I had them with me.  </li>
      <li>And the repair cream is great for my dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave skin looking to oily throughout the day.</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing, I have super sensitive skin, mild acne, and eczema under my eyes.</li>
      <li>but it fades quickly once you apply the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This winter for the first time, I have experienced dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have diabeties and need good products for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have never really had good skin hygiene, and I have been blessed with pretty good skin with the occasional blemish or two.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is amazing and you only need a pea size amount to get everything off your face but without it feeling dry/tight.</li>
      <li>It has a nice texture that is absorbed instantly into the skin with no residual greasiness.</li>
      <li>Worth checking out if you have some issues with redness and sensitivity</li>
      <li>The toner, while it did not irritate my skin, also didn&#x27;t do much to help clean off the remaining make-up I had on.</li>
      <li>Teh redness in my skin has gone down dramatically, and the moisture level is good.  </li>
      <li>I will probably run out pretty</li>
      <li>This is a much better value than buying them individually.</li>
      <li>My only experience before this was with the intensive repair cream which I love.</li>
      <li>It is the the number-one bestseller in the First Aid Beauty skin care line.</li>
      <li>Superrr fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I really like the Ultra Repair Cream because of how well it moisturizes my skin.</li>
      <li>The ultra repair cream is very moisturizing,  but not greasy, and soaks in well.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say anything about the radiance pads as of yet.</li>
      <li>I really recommend FAB products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an intense, all-purpose cream loaded with nourishing ingredients.</li>
      <li>Suffered from super sensitive eczema dry skin and mild acne.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness, and this product was recommended to me at one of the large beauty chain stores.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and therefore never really understood why it was so important to wash my face.</li>
      <li>Their cleanser leaves my skin clean but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards.</li>
      <li>Great product for sensitive skin, may cause random breakouts.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the same price at my local beauty stores, but I like the free 2 day prime shipping.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, completely with rosacea and periodic eczema.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt hydrated and was totally free of any irritation after using this set for an entire week in a dry mountain climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only are they very generous with their sizes (I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks</li>
      <li>I got this because it&#x27;s designed for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in facial redness yet, but I&#x27;m still holding out hope that since this is so gentle it will eventually take</li>
      <li>I keep trying to use a very small amount to make the tube last longer, but it is so nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far I have had, no stinging, no extra redness, no weird breakout and no extra greasiness.</li>
      <li>The face wash cleans deeply and rinses off easily - takes care of my oily skin without the tight feeling.  </li>
      <li>The samples are large enough to last for a while.</li>
      <li>you need a new face wash/lotion, skip the kit and invest in a larger tube of each!!</li>
      <li>Both the cleanser and moisturizer in this set worked really well with my skin and did not cause any dry patches or acne.</li>
      <li>Gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my skin gets a little more oily after a few hours, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the pros.</li>
      <li>Nothing has ever fixed my dry skin like this product.</li>

<li> I have very sensitive skin and generally have to avoid any product with fragrance or harsh cleansing agents.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores,  and it really helped eradicate a few dry patches I had.</li>
<li> I have tried every product out there for my adult acne with no success.  </li>
<li> and my eczema spots are completely gone, my skin tone is almost complete even, and I hardly have breakouts anymore.</li>
<li> am a penny pincher so to make the whole kit last longer I just cut the toner pads in half and just use half of one each time.</li>
<li> But it is something I&#x27;ll probably only use at night when my skin is feeling esp dry.</li>
<li> I used just the face cleanser before the other products for a few days first, and it didn&#x27;t break me out, previous blemishes started healing rapidly.  </li>
<li> However, after using First Aid Beauty for one week I saw dramatic change in my acne and an overall improvement in my complexion.</li>
<li> This winter I had dry skin and this cream is making my skin feel smoother and visibly hydrated.</li>
<li> This cream is for anyone with dry, itchy, or scaly skin regardless of the source.</li>
<li> Helps my horridly dry skin.</li>
<li> again no new breakouts,  no burn,</li>
<li> Over the past year, my skin has become hyper sensitive and reactive.</li>
<li> It hydrates down deep with penetration, providing relief and visible improvement.</li>
<li> I have to be honest and say that I hate washing my face.</li>
<li> I have been using this cream for the past few months and have noticed a considerable difference on my hands and feet.</li>
<li> and unlike my previous toners didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
<li> A little of that moisturizer goes a long way.</li>
<li> I got this to try other FAB items.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> The moisturizer is very thick, but I use such a little bit of it that this will last me a while.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this set. The toner pads lasted me about a month and the face wash and moisturizer I still have. I use it every day and night. Gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I have been recommending to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Over the past year, my skin has become hyper sensitive and reactive. I got this because it&#x27;s designed for sensitive skin. Im incredibly happy with it. Not only are they very generous with their sizes (I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and I haven&#x27;t even gone through half), you get what you are promised. Is it a miracle cure? No. But my skin is clearing up and it feels healthier than it has in months. I really recommend FAB products.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin, may cause random breakouts.</li>
    <li> I got this to try other FAB items. My only experience before this was with the intensive repair cream which I love. I also now enjoy the face cleanser and the radiance wipes. They are great in the winter when you have a lot of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this set! Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Thought I would get this to try FAB products and found that I LOVE them!  The face wash cleans deeply and rinses off easily - takes care of my oily skin without the tight feeling.  The Facial Pads helped smooth out the texture of my skin and the Ultra Repair Cream is great for hands, feet, elbows, etc.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness, and this product was recommended to me at one of the large beauty chain stores. Fortunately, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper on Amazon, and this kit is a perfect starter set to make sure you like it. The samples are large enough to last for a while. I think FAB is so great! It doesn&#x27;t clog my skin and it has definitely evened-out my skin tone. Worth checking out if you have some issues with redness and sensitivity and/or if you appreciate products without all those added chemicals.</li>
    <li> I first got this because of their crazy advertising through Youtubers. I really like the Ultra Repair Cream because of how well it moisturizes my skin. The cleanser removes ALL of my makeup and I feel it properly cleanses my skin. I can&#x27;t really say anything about the radiance pads as of yet.</li>
    <li> the set is a little pricy but I got to try different things, I like all of them, my favorite is the moisturizer</li>
    <li> These are really good products and I was very glad to have found them in these travel sizes.  I took them on my first cruise and was really glad that I had them with me.  I have diabeties and need good products for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great set to try these items without a big investment...and it&#x27;s the same price at my local beauty stores, but I like the free 2 day prime shipping.  The FAB face cleanser takes off all my makeup without overly drying my combo skin. It has almost no scent, lathers well, no leftover residue. Leaves my pores clean! I used just the face cleanser before the other products for a few days first, and it didn&#x27;t break me out, previous blemishes started healing rapidly.  The radiance pads I just started using after the cleanser, again no new breakouts,  no burn, and unlike my previous toners didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. The ultra repair cream is very moisturizing,  but not greasy, and soaks in well. But it is something I&#x27;ll probably only use at night when my skin is feeling esp dry. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores,  and it really helped eradicate a few dry patches I had. Overall,  an excellent line for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and generally have to avoid any product with fragrance or harsh cleansing agents. Both the cleanser and moisturizer in this set worked really well with my skin and did not cause any dry patches or acne. My skin felt hydrated and was totally free of any irritation after using this set for an entire week in a dry mountain climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the cleanser also failed to remove all my make-up (none of it was waterproof and I don&#x27;t wear eye make-up). I used the included toner wipes to try to clean up what the cleanser left behind, but they too failed to remove the remaining make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the moisturizer and cleanser in this set, but only if you also have a reliable toner to help remove what the cleanser leaves behind. The toner, while it did not irritate my skin, also didn&#x27;t do much to help clean off the remaining make-up I had on.</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever fixed my dry skin like this product. I told all of my friends about it. Makes your skin feel great and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Perfect trio of Ultra Repair products. This is a much better value than buying them individually.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and its a great way to try their products without paying to much! Their cleanser leaves my skin clean but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards. And the repair cream is great for my dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave skin looking to oily throughout the day. My skin have been breaking out a little bit, but it always does that when I change skincare</li>
    <li> Trying out these products for a few days now and I am enjoying them. The cleanser is amazing and you only need a pea size amount to get everything off your face but without it feeling dry/tight. Moisturizer leaves a velvet finish to the skin. Usually my t-zone gets oily by end of the day because it&#x27;s dehydrated, but this kept it at bay all day!</li>
    <li> Helps my horridly dry skin. I especially love the moisture cream. Mainly was getting it for the moisture cream, but needed a cleanser at the time and figured this was perfect. A little of that moisturizer goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product out there for my adult acne with no success.  However, after using First Aid Beauty for one week I saw dramatic change in my acne and an overall improvement in my complexion.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a sales person from Sephora.  It has great reviews but unfortunately it irritated my rosacea.  I now use the cream for the heels of my feet which works nicely.  I&#x27;m sure its a great product for people who suffer breakouts.  Its just not for me.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and always have a hard time finding things that help my symptoms AND don&#x27;t irritate my skin in the meantime. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and so far I have had, no stinging, no extra redness, no weird breakout and no extra greasiness. The moisturizer is very thick, but I use such a little bit of it that this will last me a while. Same for the facewash too actually. This will probably last me about 2 months I would guess, which is a great deal and a nice long time to make sure that this works for my skin before I buy more.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in facial redness yet, but I&#x27;m still holding out hope that since this is so gentle it will eventually take effect.&lt;br /&gt;The facewash removes most makeup, but I still have to use a separate remover for my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The toner pads have a odd smell, maybe licorice? but it fades quickly once you apply the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I am a penny pincher so to make the whole kit last longer I just cut the toner pads in half and just use half of one each time. Works just as well!</li>
    <li> I suffer from psoriasis and hoped this would be something natural that would have helped in conjunction with what I already do, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t not.</li>
    <li> Caused me to have a horrible skin reaction, my face turned red and started to swell... I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This winter for the first time, I have experienced dry skin. A friend recommended this repair cream.  It is the the number-one bestseller in the First Aid Beauty skin care line. It&#x27;s an intense, all-purpose cream loaded with nourishing ingredients. It hydrates down deep with penetration, providing relief and visible improvement. This multitasking cream belongs in every medicine cabinet and travel bag for daily use by everyone in the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cream is for anyone with dry, itchy, or scaly skin regardless of the source. Ultra Repair Cream does not contain greasy petroleum. It&#x27;s formulated with botanical antioxidants. It can be used from head to foot and is suitable for long-term use by every member of the household. It has a nice texture that is absorbed instantly into the skin with no residual greasiness. I Apply a generous amount in the morning and evening and as needed throughout the day. I have been using this cream for the past few months and have noticed a considerable difference on my hands and feet. This winter I had dry skin and this cream is making my skin feel smoother and visibly hydrated. I love that there&#x27;s no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Superrr fast shipping! Suffered from super sensitive eczema dry skin and mild acne. None of the products have irritated my skin.i love the lather of the cleanser!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, completely with rosacea and periodic eczema.  Teh redness in my skin has gone down dramatically, and the moisture level is good.  This kit does great at keeping my face clean, moisturized, and happy.  I don&#x27;t love the face pads too much, but they do a great job of exfoliation for sensitive skin.  I just don&#x27;t like that they do leave a layer of something on your skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I have super sensitive skin, mild acne, and eczema under my eyes. As soon as I started using it, my skin cleared up, my tone started to even out, and my eczema spots got smaller. It&#x27;s been about a month since I&#x27;ve had it and my eczema spots are completely gone, my skin tone is almost complete even, and I hardly have breakouts anymore. I have noticed that my skin gets a little more oily after a few hours, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the pros.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest and say that I hate washing my face. I have never really had good skin hygiene, and I have been blessed with pretty good skin with the occasional blemish or two. BUT, since I am getting married this year, my friends convinced me that I need to start treating my face better and establish a skin care routine before the wedding. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, and therefore never really understood why it was so important to wash my face. SO I read lots of reviews online and found the FAB line.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this kit, and I was so impressed even after the first use of each product. I wash my face with the cleanser, use a wipe (although it&#x27;s not an exfoliating wipe... has more of an astringent feel), and then apply the repair cream. The cleanser works so well that not even a STITCH of makeup is left on my face after washing. Not even mascara, which is practically cemented to my lashes. And the cream made me realize just how dehydrated my skin was. It is fantastic! I keep trying to use a very small amount to make the tube last longer, but it is so nice I will probably run out pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a new face wash/lotion, skip the kit and invest in a larger tube of each!!</li>
