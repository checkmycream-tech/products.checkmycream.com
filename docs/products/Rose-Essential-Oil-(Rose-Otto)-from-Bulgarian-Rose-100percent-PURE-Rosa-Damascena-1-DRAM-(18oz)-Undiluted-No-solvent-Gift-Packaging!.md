      <li>I spritz my face first with a rose water spray, then use just a drop or two from the vial of the Rose Otto Essential Oil Bulgaria.  </li>
      <li>Very pure!  </li>
      <li>rose otto essential oil.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have said, this product comes in the most lovely gift box.</li>
      <li>you compare it to the price of cosmetic counter perfumes  most of which  don&#x27;t even use real fragrances, the price for pure oil is logical.  </li>
      <li>a step above most of them however and worth a try ..</li>

      <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the pure rose otto oils I have obtained from other suppliers.  </li>

      <li>Highly recommend vendor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bulgarian rose otto for YEARS from various suppliers and they all smell essentially the same.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something not right about this -- too sweet or something.  </li>
      <li>The oil itself comes with a little eye dropper top which is extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being a Rose oil buyer from a very reputable supplier, I was shocked to see a retail price aT only a small fraction of wholesale price.</li>
      <li>(I have reused the packaging for other gifts to high acclaim!)</li>

<li> (I have reused the packaging for other gifts to high acclaim!)</li>
<li> I mix it with other essential oils (and a carrier oil) to make it last longer, but I love to put a drop behind my ears now and then too.</li>
<li> Otto oil smells like you are in a field of roses and is long lasting, it is overall</li>
<li> That is common drinking alcohol and should never be found in pure distilled essential oils.</li>
<li> It is a small bottle because Rose Otto oil is expensive to make.</li>
<li> CERTAINLY not the case with this company.</li>
<li> a competitively priced product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer who stated it is not pure, did not even purchase the item.</li>
<li> Yes, it&#x27;s a small amount, but man do you only need a little.</li>
<li> I used it to make a  body spray with half alcohol half water and 10 drops of oil with some vanilla as well.  </li>

<li> The bottle is small but ti is</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I gave this product 1 star because based on the deceptive advertisement, who knows if I have \\&quot;100% pure rosa damascena\\&quot;. The picture is showing a 0.5 oz  bottle while the description says 1/8 oz (0.125). This is misleading and I don&#x27;t want to see another person duped by the beautiful trappings.  The dropper bottle is width of my ring finger and 1 1/4 finger digits in height. If they are going to be \\&quot;sneaky\\&quot; in this aspect what else is misleading? I won&#x27;t order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Lovely.  Even the packaging was superb!</li>
    <li> not sure yet if this is the best stuff ...it is quite good but not as sweet as some of previous damask rose oils i have purchased .... a step above most of them however and worth a try ..</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase and am now ready to buy the larger size from this vendor.  The gift packaging was beautiful, though I am not gifting the item.  Great quality item.  I used it to make a  body spray with half alcohol half water and 10 drops of oil with some vanilla as well.  I cannot use regular perfume because I am allergic to the chemical additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you compare it to the price of cosmetic counter perfumes  most of which  don&#x27;t even use real fragrances, the price for pure oil is logical.  The bottle is small but ti is a competitively priced product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer who stated it is not pure, did not even purchase the item.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and nicely packaged item. Recommend to all!</li>
    <li> Besides being such an excellent deal for 100% pure rose otto oil, each order comes packaged beautifully. (I have reused the packaging for other gifts to high acclaim!) To me, this smells delicious and is a calming scent. I mix it with other essential oils (and a carrier oil) to make it last longer, but I love to put a drop behind my ears now and then too. I always receive compliments on it, even from my insensitive-to-scents husband. I&#x27;ve searched a lot, and this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the reviewers seem to be a bit confused by this product. It is advertised as 1/8 of an ounce, and one receives just that. It is a small bottle because Rose Otto oil is expensive to make. Also, the details given include the components that one finds in the Damascus Rose--these are not chemicals added to the oil. The oil is 100% pure Rose Otto.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this product</li>
    <li> Rose oil is good for so many things, it&#x27;s even an antiseptic. Just look it up online. I mix this rose oil in with virgin coconut oil to make DIY hair and skin conditioner, massage oil, face moisturizer and deodorant. It smells great and comes in very nice packaging.</li>
    <li> Although some may balk at the price and size this oil is an absolute joy. Excellent quality, and the packaging internally was just beautiful.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma! I&#x27;m Very satisfied with my purchase. I Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a small amount, but man do you only need a little. The reviews on packaging are NO joke. Lovely, great job and it all smells so nice and roses upon opening. My whole room reeks of Rose, in a totally good way. I don&#x27;t get the review saying it smelled bad and fake? It smells exactly like a Rose, and not too strong. Perhaps the poster had been ordering from some bad companies. CERTAINLY not the case with this company. Will definitely be back!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this product comes in the most lovely gift box. It is tear shaped with a silk rose bow and would make a lovely gift. The rose oil smell is very authentic and heavenly. Buy one for yourself and more to give as gifts!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, shipped immediately and beautifully packaged !! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, gift-like packaging and price!  Highly recommend vendor.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy a larger size from them.  Lowest price I&#x27;ve found for undilluted, untampered with pure 100% rose otto essential oil.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve order this. It comes beautifully packaged and is a wonderful gift item.</li>
    <li> Very good rose oil! An excellent value.</li>
    <li> Being a Rose oil buyer from a very reputable supplier, I was shocked to see a retail price aT only a small fraction of wholesale price. Looking at the listed ingredients, ethanol is at least one reason. That is common drinking alcohol and should never be found in pure distilled essential oils.

    <li> I bought from these people and wish that I hadn&#x27;t.  This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the pure rose otto oils I have obtained from other suppliers.  I&#x27;ve been using Bulgarian rose otto for YEARS from various suppliers and they all smell essentially the same.  There&#x27;s something not right about this -- too sweet or something.  I wrote to the company but they never wrote back - hence, this review, which I hope will scare you off.  The price is WAY TOO cheap.  I should have listened to my inner knowing.  You must pay the price for a quality oil.  Sorry, can&#x27;t believe this is it.</li>
    <li> I love the Rose Otto. It is difficult to find. Thank you,</li>
    <li> Very pure!  Very little in bottle!  Use sparingly!  Smells wonderful.  I spritz my face first with a rose water spray, then use just a drop or two from the vial of the Rose Otto Essential Oil Bulgaria.  I smell it for hours and who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of roses??</li>
