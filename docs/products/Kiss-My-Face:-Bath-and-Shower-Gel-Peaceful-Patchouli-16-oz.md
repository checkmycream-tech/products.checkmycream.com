      <li>This product has a really great aroma and my hippie husband loves it!</li>
      <li>It is a wonderful company with wonderful products.</li>
      <li>great condition/quick delivery</li>
      <li>If you want a very strong smell, this is not it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is nothing like a good shower that leaves you with a light scent of &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>love anything by &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and I love the lotion and body wash.  </li>
      <li>I really love this shower gel.</li>
      <li>and we absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and consistency of this, but it could use a bit more scent.</li>
      <li>Patchouli can be overwhelming, but I like it.</li>
      <li>It leaves our skin clean, soft and smelling great!</li>
      <li>I have bought this before and loved it, the shipping cost as much as the shower gel</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>when they change the bottle they also change the formula You can read the ingredients they&#x27;re not the same why do they always have to change a good product I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as good as it was considering finding something new kind of burns my eyes now</li>
      <li>But still leaves a light patuoli finish after a shower.</li>
      <li>This product creates a thick foamy lather and smells wonderful!</li>
      <li>The product shipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>Packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>While this product produces a lot of lather there is not nearly enough scent to make it enjoyable.</li>
      <li>I love patchouli but this was so strong that I had to shower again to tone it down to reasonable.</li>
      <li>The product has a very nice, subtle scent of patchouli.  </li>
      <li>Mine didn&#x27;t spill but the top was loose.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for every hippie in the family!</li>
      <li>This was just a bit much</li>
      <li>Lathers well, but I was looking for a much stronger scent.</li>
      <li>is gel really helps me</li>
      <li>she loves it, thanks for speedy delivery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on our skin as well.</li>
      <li>they seem to have changed the formula or maybe I am older and cant smell very well</li>
      <li>so if I didn&#x27;t live an hour form a shopping area</li>
      <li>I needed two showers to completely get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you like a soft scent this is for you.</li>
      <li>It feels so soft and  my skin is so  very dry  and moisturize from this</li>

<li> This does not last past the shower.</li>
<li> Other patchouli soaps we have tried have not lathered well.</li>
<li> I was a bit disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> always used kiss my face and I love the lotion and body wash.  It doesn&#x27;t beak out my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and consistency of this, but it could use a bit more scent. Patchouli can be overwhelming, but I like it. If you like a soft scent this is for you.</li>
    <li> Patuoli fragrance from soap out of bottle seems to have deminished over time.  But still leaves a light patuoli finish after a shower.</li>
    <li> Wanted a smell that lingered.  This does not last past the shower.</li>
    <li> they seem to have changed the formula or maybe I am older and cant smell very well</li>
    <li> love anything by &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34;. It is a wonderful company with wonderful products.</li>
    <li> The product has a very nice, subtle scent of patchouli.  If you want a very strong smell, this is not it.  The product shipped quickly.  I will definitely buy again!!  Strongly recommend.</li>

    <li> I have bought this before and loved it, the shipping cost as much as the shower gel so if I didn&#x27;t live an hour form a shopping area I wouldn&#x27;t have splurged on the postage but it is a big bottle.  Packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Lathers well. Not much scent.</li>
    <li> great condition/quick delivery</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and experiences of some whose bottles arrived open but thought I&#x27;d take the chance. Mine didn&#x27;t spill but the top was loose. I love patchouli but this was so strong that I had to shower again to tone it down to reasonable. I needed two showers to completely get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing like a good shower that leaves you with a light scent of &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34;.  This was just a bit much</li>
    <li> My family has been using this product for a while now and we absolutely love it. It leaves our skin clean, soft and smelling great! It&#x27;s gentle on our skin as well. I feel like the different scents of Kiss my Face bath and shower gel can be worn by a man or woman. They all smell wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a four star because the bottle that I received was a white bottle (the newer version) and I actually bought it from Amazon expecting the green bottle that was pictured.</li>
    <li> I really love this shower gel. It feels so soft and  my skin is so  very dry  and moisturize from this is gel really helps me</li>
    <li> she loves it, thanks for speedy delivery</li>
    <li> the scent (hint) of patchouli is only noticeable while the gel is in the container. Lathers well, but I was looking for a much stronger scent.</li>
