      <li>So worth it!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a unique scent --</li>

      <li>It smells mild.</li>
      <li>Will I enjoy using up what I have, most definitely.</li>
      <li>I had to smile because I was on a search for this perfume as I was out shopping and could not find it anywhere.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a fruit smell, very fruity almost like a grapefruit mixed with orange and sweet sugar, I love it!</li>
      <li>The rating is about right.</li>
      <li>I have been on ever since i have gotten over 50 free products of all types everything brand new!</li>
      <li>and I HAD to have it, smells amazing and lasts all day long!</li>
      <li>I was able to purchase this perfume at a local citi trends clothing store!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to everyone, Personally I&#x27;m suprised it does not cost more.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the initial spray.</li>
      <li>i was first refered to this site i didnt bother with it.</li>
      <li>I never knew Jordin Sparks had a perfume and for the low price I decided to try it, and I&#x27;m pleased with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everyone says its a light perfume but every time I wear it I get a headache and no other perfume has done that to me.</li>
      <li>My sister wants it for Christmas.</li>
      <li>price for the product and Fast shipping.</li>

      <li>review I don&#x27;t normally like celebrity fragrances</li>

      <li>I usually tend to purchase the more expensive brands, and this one smells like it should cost more!!  </li>

      <li>Granted it may not be the most complex scent out there, but for the price, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
      <li>this is more than enough perfume to last you a few months!!&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!!</li>
      <li>Not enough left on a drydown to notice it though, hence the frequent re-spraying.</li>

<li> It does not linger for a long time though</li>
<li> But i kept hearing about it , so i came back a few months later got onto the site</li>
<li> At first it smells awful like gasoline or something then dries down to more fruity but with that same pungent smell.</li>
<li> a little may go a very short way, but there&#x27;s 2.5 oz in this bottle, so that&#x27;s plenty to be getting on with!</li>
<li> The scent does not last long, I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch; but I should have stuck with my first mind and re-ordered &amp;#34;Ambition&amp;#34;</li>
<li> However, within less than a couple of hours, I can&#x27;t smell anything on me anymore.</li>
<li> I got my first botte from my sister for Christmas, and have been addicted ever since!!</li>
<li> Wear it everyday.</li>
<li> and this one is too musky and heavy.</li>
<li> , I usually use a peach spray or \\&quot;Loves</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my personal skin chemistry that caused that, but the longevity of this fragrance is the one disappointing thing.</li>
<li> Not TOO disappointing though...</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband said it smelt like men&#x27;s perfume</li>
    <li> The smell just isn&#x27;t my favorite. I guess I like more sweet or fruity scents and this one is too musky and heavy. I&#x27;ll wear it every now and again but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase it. Everyone says its a light perfume but every time I wear it I get a headache and no other perfume has done that to me.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Jordin Sparks \\&quot;Because of U\\&quot; perfume. Love it!! Its a nice light, sweet smelling fragrance that lats thru-out the day. The price is awesome!! I usually tend to purchase the more expensive brands, and this one smells like it should cost more!!  I got my first botte from my sister for Christmas, and have been addicted ever since!! I will definitly be back for more!!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Not too strong &amp; when layered with the lotion, lasts for quite a while. Not ALL DAY. But a good 5 or 6 hours. Just wish the matching lotion had a bit more moisture to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of positive reviews here and on fragrantica as being a great bargain perfume. Plus it came in such a pretty bottle, I decided to buy it and smell for myself.

    <li> I loved this perfume,it was fun and noticeable;very girly and womanish.Liked it a lot,will certainly purchase this again.The rating is about right.</li>
    <li> As I mentioned in my [[ASIN:B004IFOXFQ Reb&#x27;L Fleur by Rihanna, 3.4 Ounce]] review I don&#x27;t normally like celebrity fragrances but this one is also a pleasant one. It reminds me of cotton candy. Love it!</li>
    <li> The scent does not last long, I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch; but I should have stuck with my first mind and re-ordered &amp;#34;Ambition&amp;#34; which I will the next time.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to ship but it got here  shortly after. Love the perfume. Wear it everyday.</li>
    <li> I loved this scent.  It smells fresh and light--and people always comment on how great I smell.  My sister wants it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> These 2 Jordin Sparks perfume sprays are for my Aunts Christmas Gifts 2012. I will be buying more of this Lady&#x27;s spray perfume (Jordin Sparks Because of You)</li>

    <li> I ordered this for my sister.  I smelled this perfume on a cashier in Target,  had to find out what she was wearing.  She said Jordin Sparks &amp;#34;Because of You&amp;#34;.  She gives it five stars and so do I.</li>
    <li> I got this same fragrance free from the link below:https://www.listia.com/signup/7132912 I&#x27;ve gotten all types of brand name products free!when i was first refered to this site i didnt bother with it. But i kept hearing about it , so i came back a few months later got onto the site and it was wonderful. I have been on ever since i have gotten over 50 free products of all types everything brand new! From brands like(ex.Apple,Samsung,Amazon,LG,Disney,Coach,Chanel,Katy Perry,Beyoncé,Jessica Simpson,Nikki Minaj,Halle Berry,bath and body works,Victoria secret,Fisher Price,Nike) products like(ex.tablets,smartphones,toys,health &amp; beauty, household product,chromecast,furniture) that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg! Believe me this site is worth checking out!! Join,have fun,and enjoy!!</li>
    <li> One of my co workers walked in wearing this fragrance and I HAD to have it, smells amazing and lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> Mmmmmmm  This is my third bottle!!!</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase this perfume at a local citi trends clothing store! great deal! and it smells soooo good!&lt;br /&gt;It is a fruit smell, very fruity almost like a grapefruit mixed with orange and sweet sugar, I love it! the 2.5 ml bottle is BIG! this is more than enough perfume to last you a few months!!&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> To begin with I don&#x27;t like perfumes most of them are to strong and overbearing for me, I usually use a peach spray or \\&quot;Loves Baby Soft\\&quot; (which I also love and I have used since I was a teenager, I am 30 now), but this Jordin Sparks perfume has a light beautiful scent that I have just fell in love with, I have had strangers come up to me on the subway to ask what scent I was wearing. I would recommend this to everyone, Personally I&#x27;m suprised it does not cost more.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, fruity which i like and its not to fruity or strong!&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the product and Fast shipping. So worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume it is very light and does not give me a headache. It does not linger for a long time though but it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Because of you, has top notes of clementine, white imperial currant and orange blossom; a heart of nectarine, sharry baby orchid and coral charm peony, and a drydown of sheer musks, vanilla bean, Baltic amber and blond woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That combination makes for a good perfume. I never knew Jordin Sparks had a perfume and for the low price I decided to try it, and I&#x27;m pleased with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too sweet, not too fruity. Granted it may not be the most complex scent out there, but for the price, it&#x27;s a steal. I don&#x27;t mind re-spraying often on this one. I really enjoyed the initial spray. Not enough left on a drydown to notice it though, hence the frequent re-spraying. Will I buy again, probably not. Will I enjoy using up what I have, most definitely.</li>
    <li> it had a great and enduring smell, my friends love it. I will recommend the product to any lady put there</li>
    <li> I gave this rating a 5 star because it smells really nice and well worth the price. I would but this again</li>
    <li> Received this product on time and in good condition. It smells mild. I would recommend if you dont like strong fragrance. I smell a vanilla in it.  I like the box.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim. At first it smells awful like gasoline or something then dries down to more fruity but with that same pungent smell. I have all sorts of perfumes&lt;br /&gt;and this just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Jordin Sparks perfume is a light, fresh smelling perfume.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you; it is not a cheap&lt;br /&gt;smelling perfume.  Believe me, you&#x27;ll smell like a \\&quot;million bucks\\&quot;! I have had dozens of perfumes, and this is my favorite.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this one but the shipping took over 10 days!!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, that was What I wanted</li>
    <li> I had to smile because I was on a search for this perfume as I was out shopping and could not find it anywhere.  I really love the sweet smell of this fragrance and my other half loves it as well.  I highly recommend it to others.  It is great for my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I received it in two business day which was really cause the parfum is a christmas gift. I would do my business with this company and would tell friends and family about the company</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mother in law and she loves it. She got one for her daughter for Christmas too.</li>
