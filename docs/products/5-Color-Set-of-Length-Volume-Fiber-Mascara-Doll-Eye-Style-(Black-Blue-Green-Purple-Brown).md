      <li>worthwhile note that some of them can be a little clumpier than others, but otherwise they are all lovely mascaras!</li>

      <li>Fun for weekend football games, dances and just because</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> lousey mascara, colors were terrible. never purchase this item again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Great range of colors. Only for someone who likes their lashes or is using artificial lashes and wants color. These will not add length or volume.</li>
    <li> Lasted much longer and was easier to apply than I thought they would be. Glad I bought these to try out colored mascara, now I&#x27;m obsessed with purple. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright!  They extend your lashes superbly and don&#x27;t run or smudge!  Removing is a little taxing w/o an oil based make up remover but that&#x27;s the only issue with this product.</li>
    <li> These are TERRIBLE. Not only are the colors not as advertised, but they smell terrible, they take forever to dry and then remain sticky all day.  They&#x27;re very difficult to remove, and are basically nasty terrible poor quality paint in a tube.  I looked into returning them but the company was difficult to work with, so I wound up throwing them away.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. They can be a little clunpy at first, just gotta apply carefully. Green is the brightest.</li>
    <li> I do hair and make up for plays for various drama clubs.  To get 5 colors for this price is wonderful.  I try to keep my make up fresh, exp eye products so this is the perfect solution for me.  I can change these out 1-2xs per year.</li>
    <li> The colors included are very nice and not over the top. The quality of the mascara is very good. I was very pleased with this set as some of the colors are hard to find in the stores. Plus, this vendor has wonderful customer service. I appreciated their geat service.</li>
    <li> The colors are good but I thought they were more creamy but they were more dry.</li>
    <li> LIke it just wish the the colors were brighter. The picture make sit seem like the mascara will be very blue and it wasn&#x27;t neigther was the green</li>
    <li> She loves it, fun and funky, colors are  bright but not over the top. Fun for weekend football games, dances and just because</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it removes easily with soap and water and hasn&#x27;t damaged my lashes so far! Have yet to try the green, but Halloween is coming!</li>
    <li> i love it. there are 5 different colors, black , blue , green ,purple , charcoal , i think customers will like this.</li>
    <li> These are REALLY pretty colors for all colors of eyes. They are full size tubes of mascara, I thought at this price they would be like a sample size but they are not. I have brown eyes and all of them look great. I get compliments all the time, especially with the blue and the green.  It&#x27;s boring using black or brown mascara, have some fun and use some colors.  This product was not expensive, its waterproof and it does not flake off all day.  Simple soap wan water will remove it so it does not take any harsh makeup product remover to take it off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped quickly and I am extremely happy with it.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Delivered super fast great value and the mascaras are so awesome, I ordered it just to try it out and they turned out To be the popular thing I have in my kit! Thank you</li>
    <li> GOOD COLORS, GOES ON WELL BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT CAN GET A BIT CLUMPY. LIKE IT STILL.</li>
    <li> Well three were dry there is no color on them blue.purple,charcoal</li>
    <li> Two mascara were ruined, dried out and the brush was unusable. Products not sealed. Looked old. Threw all items away because looked like a used product. When it comes to make up I will not risk it. For all I knew someone could have already used these products.</li>
    <li> The mascara I recieved is amazing. I used the purple one for the first time and it was beautiful. Loved it</li>
    <li> This Mascara was really crappy. Dry and hard to apply, smudged easily and not very vibrant.</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous. Not too light or dark, and apply really well. I have pretty thick lashes so I normally have some clumping but these don&#x27;t clump at all! THESE DO NOT MAKE LASHES LOOK THICKER, so be warned if you have thin lashes.</li>
    <li> Colors do not show up</li>
    <li> I give this item five stars because of all the different colors I&#x27;m so glad I found them and a great price so if I were u I would defanitly purshase this</li>
    <li> these mascaras are the best. I am happy they are in Amazon instead of a being in a department store, or else they would be all gone. Every time i use them i get noticed- they are really eye-catching!</li>
    <li> They were not in any sealed type packaging and are a bit dry. I do not think they will last very long.</li>
    <li> Feels really heavy and not waterproof at all.</li>
    <li> first set was dry and appeared old.  Second set seemed fresher, but when tried to use different colors, they also were dry and didn&#x27;t go on without many many attempts.  Not noticeable to me or anyone else.</li>
    <li> I am really glad i bought this product will do so again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. The colors are pretty. The mascara is a little clumpy but I&#x27;ve managed to make them work.</li>
    <li> I love it! I get compliments on it all the time!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my bf&#x27;s sister and she was really happy and seemed to like it.&lt;br /&gt;A worthwhile note that some of them can be a little clumpier than others, but otherwise they are all lovely mascaras!</li>
    <li> Love the colors! Have had colored mascara before but couldn&#x27;t see the color. This one you can definately see! Love it.</li>
    <li> vibrant color and waterproof just as promised stays on no runs so far no mess I really like them you will too</li>
    <li> Been looking for along time for colored mascaras and I&#x27;m delighted to find them, and good quality to boot!</li>
    <li> Until I got it as a gift. The colors POP with two heavy coats. I put mascara on both sides of my lashes and a lot of other types clump or get heavy. These do not. No complaints, very very happy and very thankful.</li>
    <li> YES!  Amazing colors for your eyes and they do lengthen!  I gave a set to a friend and she is just as excited and such a super price!  You must get these!  No globs or gunk!</li>
    <li> Vibrant, all-day colors. My wife is a doughnut baker and this stays on all day even with all the heat and humidity she works around. She likes that the brushes on these: says they help expand her lash coverage and they don&#x27;t leave clumps. She LOVES these! Will very likely purchase again. :)</li>
    <li> They mascara is pretty good quality. I very very dark and very thick lashes and the green and blue still stand out on my eyes! I am still working on the purple showing up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like leaving bad reviews but I bought these expecting vibrant colors but when I got the set the blue purple and charcoal were dried out and couldn&#x27;t be used the black and green were the only ones that worked and the green doesn&#x27;t show up unless you apply layers and when i emailed the company I never got a answer DONT BUY NOT WORTH MONEY</li>
    <li> I was not very pleased with these mascaras at all. The colors do not go on very well. You have to apply way to much to even see the color. Once you have applied enough the color looks good. If you don&#x27;t mind wearing much mascara then you will be fine. One of the colors seemed old and half dried up so i just threw it away immediately. This may be why they don&#x27;t work very well but the others appeared to be fine.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
    <li> the mascara is pretty good but you have to swab on the lot to get color.  The purple is really light and makes my lashes look invisible.  Mascara is somewhat cheap and the price is a little too much but overall a good buy.  Interesting colors too.</li>
    <li> After some research, I found those as I was looking for various colored mascara. Vivid colors, stays on very well. Too bad it dries out quickly.</li>
    <li> Horrible...it was clumpy and dry very dissappointed they only smooth and good one was the black...wont order again.....there is nothing else to.say</li>
    <li> The mascara isn&#x27;t the greatest in the world. It was just OK. Like most of beauty products for women, it was overpriced. Colors were nice though.</li>
    <li> they came in every color</li>
    <li> This stuff dried out after 14 days of opening them! Hi hopes put to rest!</li>
    <li> The consistency is something to get used to, like tubes of room temperature frosting, and it takes more than your standard mascara to get color visible from farther away than the mirror. That said, these are seriously fun! They aren&#x27;t my everyday wear, but I definitely like them for days I need a little more color.</li>
    <li> Does not apply well. Would never buy again</li>
    <li> The colors do show pretty well but you have to apply carefully so you don&#x27;t get clumps. I do like that you get a lot of colors for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT COLORING FOR MASCARA!! Truly gives colors described. Bright blue, bright green, purple, etc. TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> These were dry. Like they&#x27;d be in existence for a very long time.</li>
    <li> there okay but does not go on thin lashes very well. Mine also were somewhat dried up when I rec&#x27;d them.</li>
    <li> The mascara dried out before I used it much.</li>
    <li> When I got it I was excited! The first thing I did was grab the first bottle I saw and run for the mirror. It was purple. I swabbed some on but I couldn&#x27;t see it. So I let it dry and put on another coat. No difference. Several coats later... I could finally see a small outline of purple. I was kind of let down, but I still had other colors and they would work. Right? Wrong. The ONLY COLORS were purple, blue, and green. It also came with charcoal and black, but really? I wanted COLOR MASCARA not black and &amp;#34;charcoal&amp;#34; which looks exactly the same as black to me. None of the colors worked right, the bottles weren&#x27;t sealed with wrapping, the labels were unprofessional, and the wands dipped in so you had to press down hard just to get anything on your lashes in the first place. I felt ripped off.</li>
    <li> The endurance is great. I was looking for the darker shades of these colors but... These were way too light!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara! All the colors I wanted. The purple looks amazing with green eyes. The green looks amazing with green eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I use the slate on eyebrows since my hair is grey. Too cool.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of colors you get in this package. Spices up my eyes without going crazy dramatic. If they had more colors in this brand then I would by them!</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and really set the look if you&#x27;re into pops of color in your makeup. The only issue I have is that the mascaras are a little clumpy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara set! The colors are awesome and good quality. I use them all the time and my friends love them as well! I will definitely order again when mine run out!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this mascara.  It is very hard to get the color to show, and it definitely does not lengthen you lashes, nor does it increase the volume.  Very disappointed in this item, and would not get it again.</li>
    <li> THE BRUSHES AREN&#x27;T THE GREATEST BUT THEY&#x27;RE NOT BAD EITHER, SOME OF THE COLORS LIKE THE PURPLE ARE KIND OF LIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO PUT ON ALOT TO SEE THAT IT&#x27;S PURPLE OR MAYBE USE A LIGHTER BLACK OR CHARCOAL FOR A COUPLE LAYERS  THEN USE THE COLORED  ONE JUST ON THE TIPS. ALL IN ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY</li>
    <li> If you want intensity this is the set to get. I just wish that there were 2 colors other than the black &amp; charcoal. But the quality of the mascaras are very good as far as volume &amp; lengthening.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year old woman that was drawn to this by the colors. I have already had several people ask me where I got these. They are great and most definitely worth th money. My last few mascaras I have gotten on Amazon made my lashes clump and fall out. These were like my eyelashes got a make over. Love them and it wi be hard to make me use anything else now.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice but you need to put tons of coats on to get a good mount of desired color.</li>
    <li> I love these mascaras and my eyes tend to be very sensitive to mascaras and these ones dont irritate my eyes. And the colors are great.</li>
    <li> The colors do not show up on my lashes. They are also not a product you should buy if you&#x27;re looking to lengthen your lashes. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wanting a new set of mascara that wasn&#x27;t just plain old black, perfect and after it warmed up was just what I was expecting</li>
    <li> I was completely unsatisfied with this product. Half of them were dried up and had to be thrown out the day I received them. Very disappointed and would never recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second set I&#x27;ve orderd because I really love this mascara the colors are nice my favorites are the green and purple, the brushes are good, this mascara works better when using an eyelash curler.Very fun to wear.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product.  The ones I have used so far seemed old and dried out.</li>
    <li> Love these, I am building quite the collection of color mascara&#x27;s, but I love learning how to layer the colors or how to combine them to make your own unique shade.  I have also have figured out if you use vivid color on the top lashes, like purple, blue--I have even used pink, and then a the blackest mascara you have on the bottom, along with a brightening cream or a stick (like Benefit&#x27;s IT stick), your eyes will just POP--people don&#x27;t recognize that you have used this wild bright color on the top, they just notice you eye color, because your eyes appear so bright and wide open.  :Lots of girlfriends have been trying to get my secret here, finally I clued my sister in--and she travels a lot for her work, said she has never gotten as much attention for her eyes before.  (BTW, we both have blue-green eyes--sea green as my Grandmother said, and we can manipulate the color from blue to green depending on the colors used)</li>
    <li> Unless you have some magic sharpener they are difficult. First uses are great.</li>
    <li> they are okay just made my eyelashes very sticky</li>
    <li> It is thick and not as vibrant as I had hoped, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, thank you!!</li>
    <li> some of the mascara came dry and could not use others were fine ?/</li>
    <li> Every single one of these were fresh and had a great color payoff. They are water proofwhich is true to the listing as well. I would recomend these to all the daring ladies out there.</li>
    <li> BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE. DEFINATELY WORTH THE PRICE!WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN AND AGAIN. HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THE MASCARA!</li>
    <li> I love these and the colors are brilliant.  I use them to match my clothes.  I&#x27;m going to order them again</li>
    <li> Wen you know that your eye makeup needs to stay in place go waterproof, for weddings or any occasion I like it</li>
    <li> Some of the mascara arrived dried out.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Love all the colors and that they are waterproof</li>
    <li> Makes lashes look much fuller.</li>
    <li> Being a purist I only use black but I did highlight the tips of my lashes with some of these, though not super bright these added a bit of charm and color to my lashes and was nice to have a complimentary color to my shadows. These come in a variety of colors. from top to bottom: Charcoal, blue, purple, green, black. I would have loved for a pink or red but these are just lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - i received this item in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t see the colored mascara at all. It might work if you had blonde eyelashes? And it flaked and clumped horribly. Not recommended...</li>
    <li> I love that these are true to their color pigments!  I have tried different kinds of color mascara with varying results.  These ones are the best!  They REALLY smell, but after they&#x27;re dried you wouldn&#x27;t know.  Love them!!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent Waterproof Length Volume Mascara. I love it because it is a colors mascara and I love makeup.</li>
