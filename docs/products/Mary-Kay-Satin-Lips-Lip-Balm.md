      <li>Perfect for dry lips, this is so soothing and feels like you have nothing on.</li>

      <li>pure lip magic.</li>
      <li>It was the only thing that kept my lips smooth, and I have tried many, many products.  </li>
      <li>But it is at least as good as the others I own.</li>
      <li>I have big time allergy to many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lip balms, even cocoa butter , this was a God send to me, I love it and will never be with out.</li>
      <li>i dont know why this product is so superior to every other lip balm, but it is.</li>

      <li>Used in combination with the Satin Lips Mask and its pure heaven.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.  </li>

      <li>I just wish the price wasnt so high.</li>
      <li>This is not thick, gloppy or smelly...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really expire, I think, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems thus far.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if it is better than others I have, though.  </li>
      <li>It lasts for hours, does not feel heavy, and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>(Wiped down, clean fingers, thank you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the only thing i&#x27;ve found to compare it with: Blistex Complete Moisture with SPF 15.</li>
      <li>A tiny amount produces soothing and soft textured lips in an instant.</li>

    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used and the vendor got it to me in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much! Exactly what I was looking and great shipping!</li>
    <li> i dont know why this product is so superior to every other lip balm, but it is. i&#x27;d been using some my sister gave me for months and my lips were always smooth and soft and then i lost it on a flight and so started using another chapstick. well, shortly enough , my lips began to chap and flake, even though i was applying chapstick regularly. i tried several products, both balms and chapsticks, and had zero luck. my lips were getting so flaky that they had actually split open a couple of times! so i finally had to call my sister and say \\&quot;what was that stuff?\\&quot; as i&#x27;d forgotten the brand. once she told me i placed an immediate order. within two or three days of getting this product back on my lips, they healed up and are smooth and soft again. the only thing i&#x27;ve found to compare it with: Blistex Complete Moisture with SPF 15. i use them in tandem, the blistex during the day and the satin lips at night. both have a great non-waxy texture that really feels like it is penetrating your lips. pure lip magic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lipbalm for a few months now.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  The product works well and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. But it seems like it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as it used too?</li>
    <li> I love the Mary Kay Satin Lips Lip Balm.  It works very well.  I am not sure if it is better than others I have, though.  But it is at least as good as the others I own.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the response time in receiving my order for this product.  Thank you so much.  I use it everyday, and a tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s pretty much what this is. Nothing works better on lips anyway than vaseline. It keeps lips moist and prevents them from getting windchapped and sunburned.</li>
    <li> I am a previous Mary Kay consultant but ran out of the lip balm... I absolutely love it! Used in combination with the Satin Lips Mask and its pure heaven. Helps keep my lips moisturized throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry lips, this is so soothing and feels like you have nothing on. I just wish the price wasnt so high.</li>
    <li> I have big time allergy to many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lip balms, even cocoa butter , this was a God send to me, I love it and will never be with out.</li>
    <li> First I didn&#x27;t even know you can order Mary Kay products though Amazon so i was so excited to see that you guys sell it. Its hard to consult the ladies they sell these. My husband loves this he doesn&#x27;t even use regular chap stick anymore. Ever since we tried the first time we love it.</li>
    <li> I once had a very bad reaction to some Shu Uemura lip gloss (gift, unused, unknown age) and my lips and and the skin above had terrible contact dermatitis. Even after prednisone, I continued to have pain and needed a barrier. I had some MK SatinLips around and it.didnt.hurt. Okay, so it&#x27;s basically petroleum jelly sans odor, but at that time I thought it was a Godsend. (It was WEEKS of pain.) Eventually my skin healed and now I always keep a tube in my bag and I&#x27;m always happy to share when someone says their lips are chapped. (Wiped down, clean fingers, thank you!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey at retail (for what it is) so I buy several to lower the cost. It doesn&#x27;t really expire, I think, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems thus far.</li>
    <li> Very good product, so glad a friend recommended.  This is not thick, gloppy or smelly...the only one my son will use.</li>
    <li> if you didn&#x27;t want to have a MK consultant bug you to all the time then buy this and be done with it. this product is great and makes your lips soft.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I had to buy 6 others to finally find this lip balm.  My lips are very dry and it has solved that problem. I use it twice a day!</li>
    <li> My only lip balm...how will I live without you!</li>
    <li> great product and so very glad I can get it from amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used MK Satin Lips Balm and Mask for years. The balm is a nice gloss. It doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve caked it on your lips. It has a nice smooth finish. I keep a tube in the bathroom as part of my morning  moisturizing routine. A second tube is kept in my purse for those times my lips feel dry. I recommend Satin Lips to anyone who will listen.</li>
    <li> I used to get fever blisters on my lips every month (ever since I was 8 years old) and my poor lips were absolutely wrecked - always chapped, and usually bleeding or scabbed. I promised my Mary Kay rep a converted customer if she could fix this problem for me &amp; this is the product she produced, which WORKED. While it won&#x27;t actually cure a herpes outbreak in progress, it has dramatically reduced their frequency for me (to 1-2 per year) and healed my lips to the point where they are no longer disgusting (they look okay :) So I keep buying with gratitude!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted. Thank you. I use it throughout the Chicago winters.</li>
    <li> Bye Ever since my sister started Mary Kay I have used so many products and they all work very good</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. A tiny amount produces soothing and soft textured lips in an instant. Love it! I&#x27;ll buy again in an instant.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best lip protector/moisturizer I have ever used. It lasts for hours, does not feel heavy, and is easy to apply. The seller sent it quickly and in good condition. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past.  It was the only thing that kept my lips smooth, and I have tried many, many products.  Mary Kay&#x27;s Satin Lips Lip Balm is the only answer to my prayers.</li>
    <li> Have used the Satin Lips Lip Balm from Mary Kay for many, many years.  I have found it to be the best on the market that I can find for the money.</li>
    <li> Love this product and my delivery was very fast just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Best dry lip balm I havwe ever tried!</li>
    <li> great product speedy delivery</li>
