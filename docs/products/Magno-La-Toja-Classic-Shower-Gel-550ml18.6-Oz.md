    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and I can vouch for it&#x27;s excellence.</li>
    <li> I use this shower gel to wash my sister locks. It&#x27;s gentle, suds and cleans very well,  I love the smell that stays on my locks for a couple of weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t make my locks hard. This is a must have for me. I know my locks are clean, healthy, groomed, and smell wonderful. I greet my family and friends with a hug. They always say, &amp;#34;your hair smells nice.&amp;#34; I smile.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shower gel for years, and absolutely love it.  The scent is intoxicating.</li>
    <li> wonderful smell stays with you a long time but light people like it</li>
    <li> This body soap is from Spain love it! Love it! Maybe too pricy it is about 3 euros in Spain</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s the best smelling gel soap ever! Been using it for over 30 years even before it was available in the US, had to have to brought back from Spain thou:)</li>
    <li> I was familiar with the soaps of this brand. I ordered body wash the first time and will order again. It is fenomenal</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and body wash</li>
    <li> My mother introduced me to this soap years ago.  It was in bar form and left black goo in the dish.  This liquid is so much better to deal with, is just as good as the bar and no mess to clean up.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the Magno La Toja Classic Shower Gel.  I have been using this bath gel for many years and I also use the bar soap.  It has a very pleasant fragrance.  I love the fact that it is mild and is not harsh to my sensitive skin.  This size jar (550 ml) last a long time because you need only a small amount to get the wonderful lather.

    <li> I remember when Magno was not just bathing gels and soap, but a beautiful cologne that came in a big square glass bottle.  Oh how I wish for that beautiful cologne again.  Is&#x27;nt there something that someone can do to bring the cologne back again?  I pray for the cologne again!  But in the meantime, the smell of Magno Gel brings me back to ....PEACE.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  IT IS UNIQUE AND MARVELOUS.  VERY GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN, WITH A BEAUTIFUL SCENT.</li>
    <li> Excellent, subtle fragrance with great washing power. Seven words is enough to say for this product and don&#x27;t need to say anymore.</li>
    <li> This body gel is based on a Spanish bath soap bar of the same name.  Now granted, this is body gel and you wouldn&#x27;t get the samae effect using body gel as opposed to using an actual bar of same but it smells indentical to the bar of soap and like anything else in life it&#x27;s subjective to a person&#x27;s opinion and use to it so I just have to say while the soap is actually very good and does a great job at CLEANING your body the SMELL is not the best.  I guess a lady would appreciate the smell of this soap more than a man because it very overpowering like an Oriental perfume but I don&#x27;t like to use this soap myself because it definitely smells feminine and is made for women.  So Men find something else like Dove for Men and leave this one to the ladies.</li>
    <li> Mango has a unique fragrance and is as gentle to your skin and eyes as a baby shampoo. I use it everyday. The bottle is hard to handle, I would use a pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> I liked the bar soap better. It lasts longer and smells better.</li>
    <li> Amazing fragrance; soft, smooth shower gel, good for your skin :)</li>
    <li> This product brings my family back to Spain where we lived for three years. When we first got there I noticed this smell of this product  and now we have it back.</li>
    <li> Excellent gel, but the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; fragrance is difficult to get used to - very pungent.  I previously had the &amp;#34;Marine&amp;#34; version which was fabulous.</li>
    <li> This has an amazing clove smell. It&#x27;s perfect for relaxing before bed.</li>
    <li> I love this gell and soap.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best men&#x27;s soaps that was ever created.  It smells wonderful. It is so difficult to find this product that I was overjoyed to find it here!</li>
