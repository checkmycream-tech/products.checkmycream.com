      <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
      <li>I would prefer to buy a different  kind of makeup remover .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other makeup removers &amp; this works the best.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear make up but wanted something gentle to clean the eye area.</li>
      <li>Leaves a very silky smooth texture to the skin.would love to find a purchase it in a bigger size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m honestly the lazy type of person, I somtime sleep with my makeup and wake up with eyeliner all around my eyes.clinique made it easy for me</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
      <li>I even had to do a double-take and check the label to make sure it&#x27;s oil-free (which it totally is).  </li>
      <li>I was amazed at how much dirt was on the cotton ball after use!</li>
      <li>it does exactly what is supposed to</li>
      <li>I love Clinique products, especially its Gentle Eye Makeup Remover.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna go buy the large bottle</li>
      <li>Also it is very greasy.</li>
      <li>I will buy this again when I finish the bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
      <li>not for the whole face which I wanted.</li>
      <li>It will even take lipstick off, which I appreciated.  </li>
      <li>Excelent product, Ill definitly buy other again , it looks as it will  last for ever great buy,thanks again amazon for a great product</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s more oily than other</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that worked better.</li>
      <li>I immediately felt like scrubbing my face clean, even though it was technically \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Gentle to sensitive eyes, fast, efficient with no pulling.</li>
      <li>wish the packaging was a little more official and the bottle was sealed.</li>
      <li>Takes waterproof make up off easily unlike some other product that claim to</li>
      <li>its small and cute I sit it in the bathroom sink area , where i can brush my teeth and see it.</li>
      <li>It definitely does it&#x27;s job, it just takes a little more effort.</li>
      <li>I have also tried ones that don&#x27;t completely take off all of the mascara</li>
      <li>The first bottle of the same Clinique remover I previously used (and which came with a bonus set at the mall) seemed to work better; it took off makeup faster and with less effort than this bottle.</li>
      <li>I love the product but had to give this specific one a two because it does specifically say, &amp;#34;not for individual sale.&amp;#34; As someone else posted on here the bottle is small and for $7 that is ripping you off...</li>
      <li>I felt at ease putting this near my eyes as the bottle mentions that it is for eyelashes among the other areas of the face, so I dabbed some on a cotton pad and gently wiped under my eyes, and all makeup was gone with no pain or irritation.</li>
      <li>So, when I searched Amazon and bought this, I never expected to receive a product taken from a Clinique Gift-with-Purchase giveaway.  </li>
      <li>This is the only makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I am surprised Amazon would promote such a practice.</li>
      <li>With insanely sensitive skin, I have tried many make-up removers only to find my skin completely red in the morning due to the harsh chemicals.  </li>
      <li>This stuff just wipes the makeup off clean without any hard scrubbing!</li>

<li> Gets the job done but very oily and hard to rinse off (must wash with cleanser after).</li>
<li> Never worry about taking waterproof mascara or long wear lipstick again.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think even people with dry skin should be using it.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry</li>
<li> I use it to remove waterproof eye liner and shadow, so it takes a little extra rubbing to remove.</li>
<li> You only need to use a little though or will be too oily.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t believe I spent 8$ for it.</li>
<li> It works with some scrubbing, and it&#x27;s a bit oily as expected.</li>
<li> When I saw how small the bottle was, I knew where it had come from immediately and checked for the notice on the back.  </li>
<li> Non irritating to sensitive skin and will cut your night time routine in half.</li>
<li> Feels a little oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Works great, fair price.  Never worry about taking waterproof mascara or long wear lipstick again.  Always nice to have delivered to your front door.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, Ill definitly buy other again , it looks as it will  last for ever great buy,thanks again amazon for a great product</li>
    <li> This is my go-to makeup remover. Gets my makeup off with one, maybe two swipes. It does leave your skin feeling oily, but i always thoroughly wash my face after using this anyways. Inexpensive and works great!</li>
    <li> I am lazy when it comes to makeup, but I bought this so I could remove eyeliner from the day to keep my skin happier and not just rub it off and tug at my eyelids as the skin is thinner and more delicate in that area. I felt at ease putting this near my eyes as the bottle mentions that it is for eyelashes among the other areas of the face, so I dabbed some on a cotton pad and gently wiped under my eyes, and all makeup was gone with no pain or irritation. I rinsed after use and my skin has been happy and clean all day. Definitely a good price too. I will buy this again when I finish the bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t take much so I bet that won&#x27;t be for a while.</li>
    <li> I love that it takes everything off and by everything i mean everything but when i use it i feel like i wanna wash my face immediately after its a oil free product but it feels so oily if you dont mind the feel of oil than this would be excellent but i have oily skin which i hate so to have a product make me feel more oily lol i dont like it but it does the job excellent my rating is just about the feel not how effective it is</li>
    <li> Takes off the toughest mascaras. Feels a little oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the packaging was a little more official and the bottle was sealed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too oily and gets everything off that the 3 step system wouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m gonna go buy the large bottle once I run out of this one</li>
    <li> This is the only makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried several other makeup removers &amp; this works the best. Especially if you use false eyelashes. Completely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Leaves a very silky smooth texture to the skin.would love to find a purchase it in a bigger size. Bottle size looks like sample. Wish it was bigger. really works well at removing all kind of makeup including waterproof!</li>
    <li> The description indicated that the product was not oily, but it is.  It is also an eye makeup remover.....not for the whole face which I wanted.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover is my go to! Love this stuff so much. Works great every time. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This product is just definitely not for me.  Yes, it removed my makeup.  Easily, albeit not as quickly as I&#x27;d hoped.  It will even take lipstick off, which I appreciated.  However, it left an oily feeling residue on my skin that I was just not a fan of.  I immediately felt like scrubbing my face clean, even though it was technically \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  I even had to do a double-take and check the label to make sure it&#x27;s oil-free (which it totally is).  I will say, though, that it will remove your makeup and does \\&quot;get the job done\\&quot; if you don&#x27;t mind the texture, that is.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a terrible product for this price.  I would prefer to buy a different  kind of makeup remover .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up but wanted something gentle to clean the eye area. I was amazed at how much dirt was on the cotton ball after use! You only need to use a little though or will be too oily. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> This product works ok. If I would have known it was so small I would have ordered a bigger size&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a great travel size. I&#x27;ve used other products that worked better.</li>
    <li> When I wear foundation, blush, mascara, eyeliner or any kind of makeup that is a lot at the end of the day I always use this! Its so easy to use! and it never hurts your skin , I have a hard time trying to find makeup removers that don&#x27;t hurt my skin or make me have really bad acne. This stuff just wipes the makeup off clean without any hard scrubbing! This will defiantly be another thing I buy again!</li>
    <li> but its expensive. but it&#x27;s your eyes and your under eye skin! don&#x27;t be cheap. buy this, you aren&#x27;t a teenager anymore.</li>
    <li> When I use this product My skin is going to better</li>
    <li> Its pure oil, I had to wash my face twice with a very harsh face wash. I don&#x27;t believe I spent 8$ for it. It&#x27;s completely useless for me. I don&#x27;t think even people with dry skin should be using it. If I had to use this, I would have better removed my make up with olive oil or vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> It seems to do the job but it is so oily. I personally like milky makeup removers like vichy. I decided to give a try to this type for once.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and it&#x27;s very gentle. I would highly recommend to anyone on a tight budget.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Takes waterproof make up off easily unlike some other product that claim to</li>
    <li> Effective against most eyeliners, shadows and primers but not so good when it comes to waterproof mascaras. Also it is very greasy. Reapplying make-up immediately after use is impossible. Forget about using an eye cream too, because the residual oil will prevent anything from penetrating.</li>
    <li> This product is so great! It works on the most stubborn makeup. However, it&#x27;s a little expensive. But it&#x27;s definitely worth it for people who wear a lot of eye makeup.</li>
    <li> My low rating for this product has to do with the disclaimer at the end of the instructions - NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE!  I love Clinique products, especially its Gentle Eye Makeup Remover.  So, when I searched Amazon and bought this, I never expected to receive a product taken from a Clinique Gift-with-Purchase giveaway.  When I saw how small the bottle was, I knew where it had come from immediately and checked for the notice on the back.  I am surprised Amazon would promote such a practice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly the lazy type of person, I somtime sleep with my makeup and wake up with eyeliner all around my eyes.clinique made it easy for me its small and cute I sit it in the bathroom sink area , where i can brush my teeth and see it. this is a 1 easy step wipe off and you are done ! leaves you with a clean smooth looking face.&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect for the size and the job that it does , So it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> With insanely sensitive skin, I have tried many make-up removers only to find my skin completely red in the morning due to the harsh chemicals.  I have also tried ones that don&#x27;t completely take off all of the mascara and you are left with raccoon eyes after washing your face.  Completely annoying when I just want to go to bed at the end of the night.  It does NOT encourage me to wash off my make-up when I have to do extra scrubbing to take away the raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinique Take the Day Off Make-Up removes removes even caked on mascara flawlessly.  No extra scrubbing required.  It&#x27;s not too oily and comes off cleanly with a good cleanser.  Non irritating to sensitive skin and will cut your night time routine in half.</li>
    <li> It definitely does it&#x27;s job, it just takes a little more effort. And it&#x27;s more oily than other make up removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love it it removes all the make up. Leaves an oily film but when it dries the oily film is no longer there</li>
    <li> I love the product but had to give this specific one a two because it does specifically say, &amp;#34;not for individual sale.&amp;#34; As someone else posted on here the bottle is small and for $7 that is ripping you off...</li>
    <li> Its like water going on and coming off! It leaves my skin feeling like I haven&#x27;t had any make up on at all</li>
    <li> Perfect for those few nights where I go out and wear a lot of make up. I did expect a bigger size, but I guess I didn&#x27;t visually see 1.7 oz so small. It is the size like the ones you get from clinique in their special giveaways.</li>
    <li> Overall, the makeup remover is fairly good at removing eye makeup with it&#x27;s oil-based formula. I use it to remove waterproof eye liner and shadow, so it takes a little extra rubbing to remove. The first bottle of the same Clinique remover I previously used (and which came with a bonus set at the mall) seemed to work better; it took off makeup faster and with less effort than this bottle. Also a small detail to note, the bottle to this Clinique makeup remover differs from the product picture (silver cap rather than green).</li>
    <li> The product was good, but I don&#x27;t know why the liquid is cloudy. It doesn&#x27;t look like the one in the picture. Is it supposed to be like that?</li>
    <li> This is a great product... it does exactly what is supposed to and you do not have to use a lot of it. I used to buy the lancome version of this from Macy&#x27;s which was way to expensive. Overall it was a great buy and very affordable.</li>
    <li> I always used Clinique cleansers and of course like many others love the ideal of shopping from home. I also like the price being that I save more shopping through Amazon. Overall: Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but very oily and hard to rinse off (must wash with cleanser after). Best used with cotton balls because it needs to be rubbed in a bit. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I used this stuff for a while but have now switched to Clinique&#x27;s Naturally Gentle Eye Makeup Remover which is less oily and break down makeup easier.</li>
    <li> its oily, but its not! I don&#x27;t know how clinique did it. I will be buying more of this and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Love this product. Good for removing the most heavily applied mascara. Gentle to sensitive eyes, fast, efficient with no pulling.</li>
    <li> not the best remover I have ever used. It works with some scrubbing, and it&#x27;s a bit oily as expected.</li>
</ol>
