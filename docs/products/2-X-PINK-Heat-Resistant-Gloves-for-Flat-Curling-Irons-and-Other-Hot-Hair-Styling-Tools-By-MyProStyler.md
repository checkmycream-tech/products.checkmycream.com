      <li>The quality is good, and they do what they are supposed to do, they protect your hands.</li>
      <li>I do not think it is fair</li>
      <li>good price</li>
      <li>It is a good tool to protect you against the heat out of hair styling devices.</li>
      <li>My daughters love them!</li>
      <li>I did receive these gloves to try and then give my honest opinion</li>
      <li>I have a really nice curling iron but it requires the user to twist the hair around it</li>
      <li>recevied this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>and I put them on, they are a perfect fit and should fit any hand size.</li>
      <li>and this is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>they would even be great for the ones who use the hot rollers.  </li>
      <li>I just need to figure a better system not to burn my face.</li>
      <li>Love being able to use my curling brush/dryer with these gloves to prevent my hands as well as my ears and forehead from getting burned.</li>
      <li>and I use my curling wand more than ever.</li>
      <li>Good and useful product.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I love them and will continue to use them:)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got the pair that comes with two gloves.</li>
      <li>I love being able to touch the end of my 400° styling iron (hair straightener) and not burn myself.</li>
      <li>because I can more easily handle the curling iron w/o worrying&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how well they fit and how the heat never transfers through the gloves to my hands.</li>
      <li>They are also more heat resistant and thicker than the one that came originally with the curling iron.</li>
      <li>but they work fine</li>
      <li>Because these are huge.</li>
      <li>Not to mention the color is my favorite color, bright pink:)</li>
      <li>They are heat resistant and fit comfortably.  </li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:61a7c19cc8ccee958158014f4b592f67]]These gloves are pretty and work just like they are supposed to!!  </li>
      <li>I love the color, first off.</li>
      <li>They work great with your flat iron, curling iron and hot rollers.  </li>
      <li>Love the fact that it comes with two gloves because I am able to hot my hot iron and straighten my hair at the same time.</li>
      <li>The two things I am not crazy about is the 1.)</li>
      <li>Double plus that they match my curling iron perfect, and I&#x27;m a pink freak!</li>
      <li>Most heat resistant gloves are of lesser quality and are sold with just one glove.</li>
      <li>Second, I love the fact that there is two.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try them using my hot rollers, I have used hot rollers for 30 years burning my fingers with each use.  </li>
      <li>These heat resistant gloves are a must have if you curl your hair with a styling iron or use any hot tools.</li>
      <li>My hand did not burn and it never got HOT.</li>
      <li>I love the hot pink color</li>
      <li>I bought two, one for each hand, so I can switch back and forth easily.  </li>
      <li>They were too big, fingers were long, and I could not get a good grip on my hair as the gloves felt bulky.</li>
      <li>I was standing there for a second trying to figure out exactly what type of curls to do when I looked down because my hand felt a tiny bit warm, NOT burning, Just warm</li>
      <li>I noticed I had been holding the wand in my hand the whole time..</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>They are cute and pink, but heat still comes through gloves</li>
      <li>Another nice feature is that they are long enough to cover your wrists.</li>
      <li>It insulated my fingers from the heat really well, and I enjoy that it is pink.</li>
      <li>Comes up high on my wrists</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that these are heat resistant gloves, you don&#x27;t want heat proof gloves because you want to be able to feel the heat a little bit</li>
      <li>This look like normal winter gloves</li>
      <li>These are more like extra large, so one size does not fit all.</li>
      <li>you just get two of the same glove they work on either hand just the tag will be on top with one hand and on bottom on the other.</li>
      <li>(it looks like I am a small child wearing super large gloves.</li>
      <li>When I put them on, the fingers are a full half inch longer than my fingers are.</li>
      <li>I have small hands so the gloves are a little bit big on me but still work great.</li>

<li> They are not completely heat proof with my curling iron, you just have to figure it out.  </li>
<li> I like to straighten my hair and am always grabbing hot hair and saying ouch or worse if I am alone in the house...</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re not sure these would work for you or simply cannot afford the extra expense I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t try using knit winter gloves.</li>
<li> so there was a little extra room at the fingertips for me.  </li>
<li> The little extra room didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
<li> I mean the thinner yarn like type gloves that come in lots of colors and patterns and look very similar to these gloves.</li>
<li> I have fairly average size hands for a 5&#x27;7 tall woman, I wear a 7.5 glove which is a med/large.</li>
<li> These look just like knit winter gloves but with a little looser weave.</li>
<li> These were a waste of time.  </li>
<li> They work, but don&#x27;t get them if you have little hands, it would be pointless for you.</li>
<li> I burnt my hand pretty badly with the glove it came with, so</li>
<li> No more burned fingers and hands.  </li>
<li> A person with small hands would drown in these gloves.</li>
<li> And I am not sure how these will feel in the summer.</li>
<li> I have really small hands</li>
<li> Guess I should have read the small print.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve already ordered a pair for a friend of mine that has often complained of being burned while using her curling</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t burn my clumsy self like I did repeatedly with the pair that came with my Sultra curling</li>
<li> That is bad for business.</li>
<li> I returned very disappointed by the product and seller.</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:61a7c19cc8ccee958158014f4b592f67]]These gloves are pretty and work just like they are supposed to!!  They are heat resistant and fit comfortably.  I have really small hands so there was a little extra room at the fingertips for me.  The little extra room didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It is not like I am going to wear them all over the place.  You wear them for their intended purpose.  They work great with your flat iron, curling iron and hot rollers.  No more burned fingers and hands.  I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a review of my experiences.</li>
    <li> This look like normal winter gloves</li>
    <li> Recommend buying these gloves.</li>
    <li> Good quality and nice work!</li>
    <li> I used this with a curling wand that I bought. It insulated my fingers from the heat really well, and I enjoy that it is pink.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:683e265b983e40ddda741027770e7e75]]Ok these are great!  they are the definite must have for those of us who repeatedly burn our selves picking up that hair to either curl or straighten.  they would even be great for the ones who use the hot rollers.  I like to straighten my hair and am always grabbing hot hair and saying ouch or worse if I am alone in the house...lol! They take a min to get used to but in the end they save your fingers and hands.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recevied this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my daughter who is a cosmetologist.  She loves them! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it comes with two gloves because I am able to hot my hot iron and straighten my hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> These were a waste of time.  They were too big, fingers were long, and I could not get a good grip on my hair as the gloves felt bulky.</li>
    <li> I returned very disappointed by the product and seller. I do not think it is fair I purchased a pair of heat resistant gloves item from your company that do not work. And I have to pay the return postage cost? That is bad for business. Guess I should have read the small print.</li>
    <li> The quality is good, and they do what they are supposed to do, they protect your hands. I got them to protect my hands from the steam of my Caruso hair curlers. Two stars? Because these are huge. I have fairly average size hands for a 5&#x27;7 tall woman, I wear a 7.5 glove which is a med/large. These are more like extra large, so one size does not fit all. A person with small hands would drown in these gloves. When I put them on, the fingers are a full half inch longer than my fingers are. They work, but don&#x27;t get them if you have little hands, it would be pointless for you.</li>
    <li> I chose these gloves to prevent burning my hands with my hair blower. So far it is working as expected.</li>
    <li> They are really big but they work fine</li>
    <li> L-O-V-E!! These heat resistant gloves are a must have if you curl your hair with a styling iron or use any hot tools. I love being able to touch the end of my 400° styling iron (hair straightener) and not burn myself. Keep in mind that these are heat resistant gloves, you don&#x27;t want heat proof gloves because you want to be able to feel the heat a little bit so you don&#x27;t burn your hair. Plus heat proof gloves would be big and bulky like the ove glove or something. These look just like knit winter gloves but with a little looser weave. I have small hands so the gloves are a little bit big on me but still work great. I love the hot pink color and I&#x27;m glad I got the pair that comes with two gloves. Most heat resistant gloves are of lesser quality and are sold with just one glove. Because it is a universal glove there is no right or left hand you just get two of the same glove they work on either hand just the tag will be on top with one hand and on bottom on the other. It makes no difference I switch them from hand to hand and you can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two. Another nice feature is that they are long enough to cover your wrists. If you&#x27;re not sure these would work for you or simply cannot afford the extra expense I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t try using knit winter gloves. I&#x27;m not talking about waterproof ski gloves here I mean the thinner yarn like type gloves that come in lots of colors and patterns and look very similar to these gloves. However, I could see winter gloves maybe making your hair frizzy or staticy.</li>
    <li> No more burns on my hands from handling a hot curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;And because I can more easily handle the curling iron w/o worrying&lt;br /&gt;about  my hands being burned, I no longer get burns on my forehead either.&lt;br /&gt;Love the gloves!</li>
    <li> Good and useful product. It is a good tool to protect you against the heat out of hair styling devices.Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> not save on heter tks</li>
    <li> I can not believe how well these hold up. The heat resistant gloves are perfect!!! I was doing my hair today and decided to use them since I&#x27;m accident prone to my wand when doing my hair and I put them on, they are a perfect fit and should fit any hand size. I turned my wand on and let it heat up, after it was fully heated ,which it goes up to 300 degrees ,I decided to do my hair. I was standing there for a second trying to figure out exactly what type of curls to do when I looked down because my hand felt a tiny bit warm, NOT burning, Just warm I noticed I had been holding the wand in my hand the whole time.. My hand did not burn and it never got HOT. I&#x27;m so impressed with these gloves!!!  They work great. Now the last time I did that I did that I burnt my hand pretty badly with the glove it came with, so these work wonderful!!! and what a heck of a good price to save yourself from being burnt!! Not to mention the color is my favorite color, bright pink:) Perfect all the way around!!! I did receive these gloves to try and then give my honest opinion and this is 100% my honest opinion. I love them and will continue to use them:)</li>
    <li> Love these!! good price and I use my curling wand more than ever.</li>
    <li> The gloves are way too big!</li>
    <li> They are cute and pink, but heat still comes through gloves</li>
    <li> I wish I would have invented these!  They are not completely heat proof with my curling iron, you just have to figure it out.  I would buy again and again!  I bought two, one for each hand, so I can switch back and forth easily.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them using my hot rollers, I have used hot rollers for 30 years burning my fingers with each use.  I just need to figure a better system not to burn my face.</li>
    <li> Big, but not too big. Comes up high on my wrists so I don&#x27;t burn my clumsy self like I did repeatedly with the pair that came with my Sultra curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I like that there&#x27;s a pair of them and not just one. They are also more heat resistant and thicker than the one that came originally with the curling iron. Very happy I purchased these.</li>
    <li> My daughters love them!</li>
    <li> Love being able to use my curling brush/dryer with these gloves to prevent my hands as well as my ears and forehead from getting burned.</li>
    <li> they work not the material i thought but they get the job done and u get two!</li>
    <li> Love these. I can finally get a loose wave in my hair without burning my fingers!</li>
    <li> Does not protect from the heat! Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I love the color, first off. Second, I love the fact that there is two. You can use two or one if you choose. The two things I am not crazy about is the 1.) Size (it looks like I am a small child wearing super large gloves. And I am not sure how these will feel in the summer. They look like winter gloves but feel different. Maybe my hands wont sweat.</li>
    <li> I have a really nice curling iron but it requires the user to twist the hair around it and I kept getting burned. I had no idea they even sold heat resistant gloves for this reason, and these have changed my life! I now use my curling iron almost daily and don&#x27;t worry at all about burning my fingers or hands. I love how well they fit and how the heat never transfers through the gloves to my hands. Double plus that they match my curling iron perfect, and I&#x27;m a pink freak! These are a must have for anyone that has a curling iron without a clamp on it you can still use you hands as if you weren&#x27;t wearing gloves at all. I&#x27;ve already ordered a pair for a friend of mine that has often complained of being burned while using her curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
