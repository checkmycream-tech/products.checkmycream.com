    <li> good stuff..alsome i.ll buy it agin last long time.....use it only for sex wife loves it...glides in and out gooood:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different massage oils on my wife and each of them was lacking.  I decided to try this oil and we&#x27;re now on our third bottle.  We love the scent and feel of this oil.  It absorbs great and the next morning, our skin isn&#x27;t dry like with other oils.  If there was a six-star rating, I would give it to this oil.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. A little goes a long way and the smell is great. Feeling is less greasy/sticky than other similar oils.</li>
    <li> TO MUCH PERFUME IN PRODUCT NOT WHAT I PREFER FOR SENSUAL TIMES, BEEN MARRIED 35 YEARS, PREFER&lt;br /&gt;KAMRA SUTRA TYPE PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> 5 star oil! It&#x27;ll change your life.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Whatever the planned use for this oil is, it is very pleasant and smell very good. First time that I purchased something like that and I am very satisfied with it.</li>

    <li> My husband and I love this spray. It really adds to the intimate moment. The smell when it is first applied makes me melt inside. I love massages and he loves giving them. This oil feels really great on the skin and since it is actually healthy for the skin, my husband is not only making me feel good with a massage but he is helping me make my skin look good as well.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my wife and she really enjoyed the smell and now she is asking me for massages! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> i was hesitant to spend almost twenty dollars on oil ?&lt;br /&gt;this is lovely to use, pleasant fragrance for men and women. its nice to use, not being greasy or sticky&lt;br /&gt;buy this  - you deserve it</li>
    <li> good product showed up on time</li>
    <li> Nice feel and scent can use all over. Don&#x27;t use too much, is not needed a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a more erotic smell but this is fine, think I go back to my old Kama Sutra favorites next go around.</li>
    <li> They should really remove the sex part. If youre using these oils your making some love, baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spray bottle is super legit.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the reviews saying how great it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;It did smell good when first applied, but shortly after application it turned into&lt;br /&gt;kind of a weird smell.  May be just how it interacted with my skin, but I was&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.  I do like that it is in a spray bottle which makes application&lt;br /&gt;much easier.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great.  makes it nice to have an intimate massage and not worry about being to greasy or getting it on anything.  enjoy using this product.  def. a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This oil does exactly what you would expect it to do. It is one of the better oils out there today.</li>
    <li> Sensual, erotic...promotes sensuality, imo!  It&#x27;s a tad greasy imo, but it does dissipate.  Hay, it&#x27;s oil, and a great lubricator, so what isn&#x27;t going to be &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just love this oil!!! It smells divine and hydrates my skin without staying oily. I and my boy friend cannot stop using during our special time. IT IS A GREAT OIL .</li>
    <li> feels really nice and smooth when massaging. even use it in a bath with warm water and you will feel and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, but the smell (and taste) is very, very strong, like perfume. It is okay lube. It loses its slipperiness after a few minutes unlike other oils, but it is great for a quick massage, and you don&#x27;t have to put on perfume after!</li>
    <li> Great scent, great feeling on the skin. Does wonders for dry winter skin.  Doesn&#x27;t stain the bedding! Would recommend it for all my friends.</li>
