      <li>It is so cute wish I had known it would be my perfect pink</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I love it , and my order arrived rather quickly.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this lipstick for years, and I was so happy when I saw you sell it on Amazon as they no longer carry it at my local target.</li>

      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>Its fabulous, for real.  </li>
      <li>but I love it as a sheer pink with a good color.</li>
      <li>very cheaply made case, not worth more than the $2 I spent on it, honestly.</li>
      <li>Arrived as promised and super fast.</li>
      <li>It really pops and shines on your lips!</li>
      <li>I like deep colors but its one of my favorite lighter colors.</li>

      <li>Just as I expected and goes on smoothly, love it.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Is not too loud just right.</li>
      <li>I bougfht this color and a few othes, and just ordered more today.  </li>
      <li>color is ok, case is so flimsy, can&#x27;t be thrown into purse, afraid the top will come off and lipstick will get all over everything.  </li>
      <li>I guess I thought it would  be a different color, but I cant complain, because overall the product was really cheap.</li>
      <li>I have used this lipstick in the past and I love the color.</li>
      <li>The listing I paid for clearly stated that the lipsticks I was buying were NEW.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too comfortable using this lipstick, since it did not have a safety seal and it looks like it is slightly used.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and while doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it would, it isn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear much color on my lips but this pink is nice.</li>
      <li>I was clearly misled and tricked into buying something that was misrepresented in the listing.</li>
      <li>Glad it is not bright.</li>
      <li>but this is more of an everyday any occasion pink.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes, it&#x27;s priced reasonably, and I have purchased many high priced cosmetics until Im sick of it, they are not better in Most cases.</li>
      <li>I have no regrets!</li>
      <li>soft and creamy, leaves my lips the same way.</li>
      <li>The pink really gives the lips a pop of color</li>

<li> Plus it felt a bit dry on the lips .</li>
<li> It has sparkle but its not as overpowering as the glitter look of Disco Pink or Pink Freeze.</li>
<li> Just a warning, if you are like me and want to know shades, this is pink with blue shades but on me at least, it has some white in it, which I do not like for winter.  </li>
<li> I found this in a last chance bin for less than 3$!</li>
<li> I never thought I could wear pink!</li>
<li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth returning it</li>
<li> I wear it almost everyday ..</li>
<li> I do like my lipstick but its just not a love for me.</li>
<li> I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE AND DEFINITELY WITH THE VENDOR!</li>
<li> Make up should not be a budget killer, and the hype about very expensive brands, does not bear out.</li>

    <li> I love this color.  It goes on smoothly and while doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it would, it isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;as drying as some that are longer lasting.  Will be buying again</li>
    <li> A+ product....love the color n the shine n everything abt it..def recommend it. Buy it now!! Best and friendly seller :)</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t the same color as the picture but I love it as a sheer pink with a good color. I like deep colors but its one of my favorite lighter colors. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected and goes on smoothly, love it. The pink really gives the lips a pop of color</li>

    <li> Just received the lipstick today and the lip color is such a beautiful pink/fuchsia color! It really pops and shines on your lips!</li>
    <li> Have used this brand/color of lipstick for a number of years.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the local stores I ordered it.  I am completely satisfied with the ordering process, timing, and the lipstick itself.</li>
    <li> I have used this lipstick in the past and I love the color. The listing I paid for clearly stated that the lipsticks I was buying were NEW. When I received the items, 2 out of the 3 lipsticks were USED. How gross is that? I was clearly misled and tricked into buying something that was misrepresented in the listing. I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE AND DEFINITELY WITH THE VENDOR! Buyer BEWARE.</li>
    <li> I love this shade on me! I never thought I could wear pink! Is not too loud just right. Glad it is not bright.</li>

    <li> La mercancia es de excelente calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo 100 %... Venezuela</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and super fast. Love it. Thank you very much!</li>

    <li> Thankfully, I love it , and my order arrived rather quickly. I am giving it A+ and 5 stars because I tried it when it came and I love love it. The color looks lovly on me,</li>
    <li> Wow... Am really very happy that I bought this product.. Beautiful pink color with right amount of shimmer! It makes my lips look beautiful.. I wear it almost everyday ..</li>
    <li> soft and creamy, leaves my lips the same way.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff,but the lady said it was ok-it just don&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too comfortable using this lipstick, since it did not have a safety seal and it looks like it is slightly used. Perhaps store returns? For the price, it&#x27;s not worth returning it but I will definitely toss it in the trash. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking buying lipsticks from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Te color stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and great with any out fit, easy application, and somewhat moisturizing! My new favorite lipstick!</li>
    <li> I think I am in love! I found this in a last chance bin for less than 3$! It is so cute wish I had known it would be my perfect pink I would have bought the rest. Its the darker of pinks in this line. It has sparkle but its not as overpowering as the glitter look of Disco Pink or Pink Freeze. They are all cute but this is more of an everyday any occasion pink. This and Fruit Punch are my top choices.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice lipstick. I don&#x27;t usually wear much color on my lips but this pink is nice.</li>
