      <li>I expect better from Kent.  </li>
      <li>It was ok for a while.</li>
      <li>It is a bit narrower than many brushes and packs conveniently in a toiletry bag.</li>
      <li>Great product at a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>This is the most effective and comfortable brush for my hair.</li>
      <li>Love this brush.  </li>
      <li>Might be better for people with thinner hair.</li>
      <li>It seems to add fullness and more bounce to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Ordered two more :)</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the brush in my hand and how it goes through my hair.</li>
      <li>The brush is very light and easy to move around.  </li>
      <li>It is a very good product but for me personally the one I had before turned out to be a better product.</li>

      <li>I think it will work fine for any type hair.  </li>
      <li>It does not take up a lot of space in my purse, so many times take with me, for quick touch ups.  </li>

      <li>Comfortable on my scalp.</li>
      <li>Liked the brush so much</li>

      <li>It does NOT break hair and it goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great brush, but over the last 6-7 years, the quality has been deteriorating.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s well shaped and comfortable in my hand.</li>
      <li>very nice brush for fairlly short man&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Original lasted years</li>
      <li>If you are only going to own or use one brush then let it be this one!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with this brush as I have been with all Kent products I&#x27;ve bought, but I have fine hair and the wide spaced bristles</li>
      <li>I wear my hair rather long, and this is by far the best brush I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It is a perfect balance between the firm and the gentle.</li>
      <li>My wife loved it so much I ordered a second one for her.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
      <li>no disappointment here</li>
      <li>For me, this was worth the money</li>
      <li>The bristles do their job and somehow make it actually fun to brush my hair.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The size is perfect to wrap long hair around for blow dry curling.  </li>
      <li>and I think does a better job on my hair due to more densely compacted bristles.</li>
      <li>The bristles didn&#x27;t have a good finish and had some sharp edges from what looks like an injection mold</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy another one since the price is right.  </li>
      <li>This brush gets right into the hair, without bringing out clumps.  </li>
      <li>I have fine thick hair, and it brushes through to my scalp giving a good massage.  </li>
      <li>My favorite hair brush, I have few hairs, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck and pull more hair out</li>
      <li>i like it very much.  </li>
      <li>I like the rubbery part on the handle and the brush itself is very gentle to my scalp as well as my hair.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size - not too big not too small.</li>
      <li>Just hope that it lasts longer than the first one.</li>
      <li>The grip is a natural fit in my hand.  </li>
      <li>I bought the large oval boar bristle brush and use it to brush my hair every night.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy with that purchase that I bought this little brush for daily styling.</li>
      <li>really....</li>
      <li>so i can&#x27;t really compare it to anything.</li>
      <li>It provides a gentle scalp massage while gliding through the hair removing snarls and tangles gently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle on your hair.</li>
      <li>It feels a bit better for my hair but this product is by no means less of a product its just for my hair the other one works better.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is total worth it.</li>
      <li>works great with long thick beards</li>
      <li>better quality than the one I ordered from Amazon a few years ago</li>
      <li>Good quality and comes broken in.</li>
      <li>I replaced my wife&#x27;s pink Wal-Mart special.</li>
      <li>In two of the four brushes I&#x27;ve bought over this period, the supporting surface for the bristles has detached gradually from the wooden frame after a year or two of use.</li>
      <li>Other reviews had mentioned this lovely brush seems to have a short life.  </li>
      <li>But wow!</li>
      <li>but this one is small enough to be handy</li>
      <li>I got this to keep in my gym bag, mostly for brushing out my wet hair after showering, but it also works on dry hair if I need to make a ponytail before I get started.  </li>
      <li>Works just as well as the old one</li>
      <li>After nearly 20 years (seriously), my old headhog hairbrush had worn out.</li>

    <li> Great product at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several. Good quality and comes broken in. The Mini is good for travel.</li>
    <li> After nearly 20 years (seriously), my old headhog hairbrush had worn out. The brushes sold in pharmacies just aren&#x27;t the same. I was very happy when my wife found this on Amazon for me. This is the most effective and comfortable brush for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  It came as described and has held up well.  Easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> It was ok for a while. The flexy handle got on my nerves and really didn&#x27;t do anything except make for an awkward grip. The bristles didn&#x27;t have a good finish and had some sharp edges from what looks like an injection mold ridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what finally made me throw it out was the smell. It never subsided and could smell it on my hand and whenever I used it. About 4 months of this and I&#x27;d finally had enough and tossed it in the bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replaced it with one of these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V6PFQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_64</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. It is a perfect balance between the firm and the gentle. It provides a gentle scalp massage while gliding through the hair removing snarls and tangles gently. I wear my hair rather long, and this is by far the best brush I have ever used. Kent makes great combs too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, as advertised, and delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> Asian wife with thick hair and small hands loves brush and says its easy on scalp.I might add that this is not a large brush.Good quality.</li>
    <li> Handmade.  Old World Craftsmanship vs Chicom?  Which would you choose. I replaced my wife&#x27;s pink Wal-Mart special.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for more years than I care to remember and it&#x27;s still the best brush on the market.  It feels great on my scalp and it&#x27;s well shaped and comfortable in my hand. Great for styling. It&#x27;s well worth the price and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Junk. Bristles started to come out within just a couple of months. Do Not Bu!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush ! Ordered two more :)</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for thinning hair.  This brush gets right into the hair, without bringing out clumps.  Size is just big enough for handbag.</li>
    <li> I got this to keep in my gym bag, mostly for brushing out my wet hair after showering, but it also works on dry hair if I need to make a ponytail before I get started.  I like the rubbery part on the handle and the brush itself is very gentle to my scalp as well as my hair.  There is a mini version of this brush, [[ASIN:B0072CSKY2 Kent Mini Hog Hair Brushes]] but this one is small enough to be handy and I think does a better job on my hair due to more densely compacted bristles. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> If you are only going to own or use one brush then let it be this one! Well built and durable! It&#x27;s a Kent!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful brush! - gorgeous tortishell!  The bristles are all one piece - the bulbous tips and the stems.  It does not pull your hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the brush in my hand and how it goes through my hair.</li>
    <li> March 5, 2015.  Update. Broken!   Other reviews had mentioned this lovely brush seems to have a short life.  I thought I would be a better care giver and took a chance anyway!  Never used it with a blow dryer, only for brushing dry hair.  The bristle part is glued to the handle and over time it just comes out!  😟😟😟.  Would not purchase this again.  *********** Love this brush!  Just the right size, not too big or small. Feels good on my scalp!  I have also noticed a whole lot less hair breaking too.  Liked the brush so much I got the matching comb.  Love it too!  Sometimes an upgrade in products is just nice!</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with all Kent items I have purchased.  Well made, good looking and comfortable both in the hand and on the head.  I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this brush as I have been with all Kent products I&#x27;ve bought, but I have fine hair and the wide spaced bristles don&#x27;t work as well with my hair as it might with someone who has course thick hair.</li>
    <li> For me, this was worth the money</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my hair catching in the base of the bristles.  It is also difficult to remove the hair that stays in the brush.  A decent brush but not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair brush. My wife loved it so much I ordered a second one for her. That speaks for itself!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. Never thought a comb/hair brush would make a big difference; also was intimated by its price tag. But wow! It is THE BEST hair brush I have ever used. It does NOT break hair and it goes on smoothly. Also, unlike most hair brushes, this one does not trap hair much and it is VERY easy to clean. It is total worth it.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush a lot.  Then the handle broke after I&#x27;d had it for a month.  I expect better from Kent.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another one since the price is right.  Just hope that it lasts longer than the first one.</li>
    <li> better quality than the one I ordered from Amazon a few years ago</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this hairbrush since 1997 for myself and family members. It&#x27;s a great brush, but over the last 6-7 years, the quality has been deteriorating.In two of the four brushes I&#x27;ve bought over this period, the supporting surface for the bristles has detached gradually from the wooden frame after a year or two of use. Kent is apparently cutting corners on material and/or manufacturing.</li>
    <li> works great with long thick beards</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. I&#x27;ve got (3), two for the house and one to travel.</li>
    <li> So flimsy. Might be better for people with thinner hair. And newborns...</li>
    <li> This brush is a great addition. It is a well made brush. It is not one of those dime store cheapies!! It really adds something different to massaging the scalp wh brushing the hair. It was recommended by an English beautician/hairdresser. It is a bit narrower than many brushes and packs conveniently in a toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> Second one for my wife. Original lasted years and if she reordered it must be good. Excellent product--ask my wife.</li>
    <li> The is the best hair brush I have ever owned.  The grip is a natural fit in my hand.  The bristles do their job and somehow make it actually fun to brush my hair.  The brush is very light and easy to move around.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product but for me personally the one I had before turned out to be a better product. It is from earth theraputics and has a round shape. It feels a bit better for my hair but this product is by no means less of a product its just for my hair the other one works better.</li>
    <li> I just bought my third. They last about 4 years and I have waist length thick hair. Great to use with blow dryer. Perfect size - not too big not too small. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i like it very much.  It goes through my hair easily without pulling and tearing.  It seems to add fullness and more bounce to my hair.  The size is perfect to wrap long hair around for blow dry curling.  It does not take up a lot of space in my purse, so many times take with me, for quick touch ups.  I have fine thick hair, and it brushes through to my scalp giving a good massage.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I think it will work fine for any type hair.  I may buy another soon just to keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> very nice brush for fairlly short man&#x27;s hair. Comfortable on my scalp. I haven&#x27;t owned another hair brush since i was a kid so i can&#x27;t really compare it to anything. The brush has a good weight and feel.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It&#x27;s so gentle on your hair.</li>
    <li> wow, what are you waiting for. no disappointment here</li>
    <li> I bought the large oval boar bristle brush and use it to brush my hair every night.  I was so happy with that purchase that I bought this little brush for daily styling.</li>
    <li> I had a brush very similar to this for about 20 years that was looking pretty gross but I couldn&#x27;t find anything comparable until I found this. Works just as well as the old one and it finally went in the trash.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair brush, I have few hairs, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck and pull more hair out</li>
    <li> broken.... lasted less than 3 months on 3 inch long men&#x27;s hair no less... I mean come on... really.... what A shame... I won&#x27;t even bother to get a refund since it is a hairbrush and obviously disposable but 3 months on a 14$ hair brush is ridiculous. I&#x27;ll  never buy from this brand or company again!</li>
