      <li>Makes my skin smooth, not greasy like some lotions.</li>

      <li>I have enjoyed the lotion very much and would buy again when needed.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this lotion, I thought I&#x27;d receive the ORIGINAL scent formula, as described and pictured.</li>

      <li>And the picture is of the ORIGINAL as well.</li>

      <li>Very good quality, but I don&#x27;t use for everyday use.</li>

      <li>Takes maybe 10-20 seconds to get absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This scent is my favorite by far from bath and body.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin looking fresh all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an everyday lotion, maybe for special events when you want to smell good.</li>
      <li>It has a nice floral scent that lasts long.</li>
      <li>The smell is still pleasant, but that is no excuse as it is very generic and mild.</li>
      <li>Its kind of oily and that makes it soothing for this  dry weather.  </li>
      <li>but if you love to smell like a Japanese Cherry Blossom and you want your money&#x27;s worth(translation: you want that beautiful scent to cling to you for as long as possible in exchange for the high price you pay for it), then it&#x27;s for you!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I might be biased but I love that it smelled just like my girlfriend but it&#x27;s because she uses this lotion. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the full price for this bottle of lotion so I would give this 5 stars bc it met with my expectations and came in time while holding it&#x27;s value in quality. it&#x27;s as if I went to the store to buy this product</li>
    <li> Very satified with purchase</li>
    <li> I am glad that I bought this product. It is great for yourself or as a gift because the outside of the bottle is pretty and the lotion has a beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> I have LOVED Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; Japanese Cherry Blossom lotion since I first ran into it - It smells so exotic and alluring and natural and yes, it strongly scents your skin but if you love to smell like a Japanese Cherry Blossom and you want your money&#x27;s worth(translation: you want that beautiful scent to cling to you for as long as possible in exchange for the high price you pay for it), then it&#x27;s for you!!  It smells really beautiful and refreshing, especially when you rub it into your heated skin, a lot more natural and not chemically smelling and which lasts a lot longer than a perfume or mist.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.  I haven&#x27;t found anything like it yet in the drugstore (even with the more expensive drugstore brands) so it&#x27;s worth the long trip up to the mall or buying here on Amazon.  I like buying more of the travel size lotions than the regular size since it weighs lighter and so it&#x27;s easier/convenient to carry around when I&#x27;m out and when I feel hot and sweaty and need that beautiful scent to scent and cleanse my skin, I&#x27;ve got it.  I just wish they would carry the soap and shampoo and conditioner with this scent too at their mall shops.</li>
    <li> It does smell very good. The prices are way too high though, I mean it&#x27;s worth it if you have a money tree. It&#x27;s a very strong wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great condition. is a gift.</li>
    <li> At first, the smell is OK then i start to get a headache with it. I love different smells but this is one i will never wear</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances that I like...the lotion is soft and the smell of the lotion last a long time...the price was such a great but</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Japanese cherry blossom and I was buying this lotion as a gift for one of my friends who also loves it. With shipping it cost about $16. This is not worth it. The design of the bottle has changed and no longer looks like the picture. The lotion is pink and the cap is wider at the top. This isn&#x27;t such a big deal; however, I find the new design quite unappealing.&lt;br /&gt;The part that brings it to two stars is that the scent is different. Japanese cherry blossom has been one of my favorite scents for years and now they changed it. The smell is still pleasant, but that is no excuse as it is very generic and mild. I definitely would not have paid $16 for this boring and ugly lotion.</li>
    <li> Fresh, light, beautiful.  My third bottle.  I&#x27;d love some pillow spray, if fabric spray, or some sachet packets for in my drawers and linens.</li>
    <li> The smell is what makes this product fascinating to me.  Its kind of oily and that makes it soothing for this  dry weather.  It keeps my skin looking fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I buy it regularly :)</li>
    <li> In 2013 my sister in law had once applied this body lotion on both of my hands. The smell lingered until I washed my hands with soap. Ever since then, I was planning to purchase my very own bottle, finally I was able to buy it from amazon. I am extremely happy with the purchase. I will be using this body lotion during Spring/Summer seasons. Will buy more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift and it smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I just love this fragrance--my favorite of several from B&amp;BW. I use it not only as a lotion, but for the &amp;#34;perfume effect&amp;#34; as well. I&#x27;m often asked what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. And I happily explain that I&#x27;m wearing...a lotion. It lasts longer than a lot of colognes, and it&#x27;s much less expensive. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing, and the scent lasts for hours, I get so many compliments when I wear this lotion, and the lotion itself is thick but goes on very smooth and rubs in so quickly.  This is the best lotion I have tried in a long time.</li>
    <li> Smooth and really smells good no regrets especially if someone is very picky about there fragrances</li>
    <li> Good scent, but better prices with sales or coupons at the store!</li>
    <li> I love this sweet soothing scent.. I love that it came with shea butter within the lotion. Which help the dryness of my hands.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It&#x27;s not to strong but has a pleasant smell to it. It&#x27;s also very thick so you don&#x27;t need much of it. This should last me 2-3 months. Defiantly going to order another bottle when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this lotion. She claims that it is one of the best she has ever used. She also has most her friends using it. I was happy that Amazon carries this product and sells it a a fair price.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  The lotion is very creamy and keeps my body hydrated and soft feeling.  It is also very fragrant.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin softer but the smell isnt what i was expecting its not bad in fact it smells good it just wasnt what i thought japanese cherry blossoms smelled like</li>
    <li> My sister gave me Jap. Cherry Blos. as a gift years ago.  It remains one of my favorites, love the scent makes me feel fresh, feminine!</li>
    <li> I love this, the smel and it stays on my skin for a long time. very nice, will recommend it</li>
    <li> SERIOUSLY, who doesn&#x27;t love B&amp;BW products?!? I have a ton and this one&#x27;s a favorite. It has a nice floral scent that lasts long.</li>
    <li> thank you. it really smells beautiful. It is a great lotion. It leaves the skin feeling soft and so smooth.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the lotion very much and would buy again when needed. I&#x27;m glad I found it on line. Thanks for such a good product! Dolly Hamby</li>
    <li> Delivery and product as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, not too heavy or strong. I&#x27;m always getting compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite. Local B&amp;BW store ran out and didn&#x27;t know when their next shipment would be in. Amazon has it listed. Wife is happy &amp; makes my life easier. Stuff does smell good.</li>
    <li> I love the Bath &amp; Body Works fragrances and Amazon products are always true fragrances.</li>
    <li> scent lasts a lot longer than the body spray; really nice scent.</li>
    <li> i love the sent it is one of my favorites but it is way cheaper to just go to the store and buy it instead of buy it off amazon because you have to pay the price they are asking for and shipping and handling and when you get your bill i found it cheaper to just go to the store and buy it then off amazon but i do love the sent and hope this helped you on your decision to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Stinks. Smells like musk. Not the Bath &amp; Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom that I&#x27;ve used before. Smells like the regular cherry blossom.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this lotion, I thought I&#x27;d receive the ORIGINAL scent formula, as described and pictured. I received the new formula, which doesn&#x27;t smell the same at all, the bottle is scratched and dented. I was going to give this to my mom as a gift because it&#x27;s her favorite scent and I don&#x27;t even want to give it to her now.</li>
    <li> The was received in a promptly manner and was as discribed</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite. I received it on time.</li>
    <li> The lotion is very creamy and smells so good. I have several bottles around the house!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents. It was packaged well, so there wasn&#x27;t any problems. Funny; I just now used it after I washed my hands.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, works amazing and it smells great!!!</li>
    <li> My wife smells as pretty as she looks! (Not that she smelled bad before but this definitely made her smell a different kind of pretty and I like it).</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion&#x27;s scent was a bit too perfumey for my taste, but I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> i loooooove this lotion so much. the smell is perfect. the price was pretty good! i think i bought it for just over $6. i love a good deal hahaha</li>
    <li> love this brand it never disappoints, smell is good does good job with your skin , smells so good you even won&#x27;t need perfume</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent from Bath &amp; Body Works. I keep some at work, in my purse and at home. Makes my skin smooth, not greasy like some lotions.</li>
    <li> A student bought this lotion for me at the end of the school year. I get lots of lotions and creams as gifts but this one I really loved. This is the second time I have purchased this fragrance.</li>
    <li> love that smell and i will order more in the near future .</li>
    <li> Is a favorite, indeed! :)</li>
    <li> smells like a quality soap or shower gel. i prefer the older cherry blossom scent from a few years ago but this still smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a scent after use but enough to where if someone was close they will compliment you about it.</li>
    <li> Pleasant fragrance; good lotion</li>
    <li> never got this item, and it&#x27;s my favourite cream</li>
    <li> This scent is my favorite by far from bath and body. I use the spray and the lotion. Everyone always compliments me when I wear it.</li>
    <li> The item is advertised as Japanese Cherry Blossom ORIGINAL. And the picture is of the ORIGINAL as well. But they sent me the new formula and not the original one that I paid for. Contacted the seller about it and they want me to send it back for a refund. I am not about to pay for return shipping. So I told them that and now I am waiting for a response. Will update as they respond.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! I love it! I love most B&amp;BW products but this one is my absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> great product with zero complaints.&lt;br /&gt;definitely will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Product was as described and arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> D bottle was damaged when I received it an also it was not d original d original has gold writing</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It has a nice scent but I only wear a very little on special occasions like weddings, holidays etc.  You only need to dab on a very little but it is still a very nice product.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I ever owned from Bath and Body Works. I actually loved this scent. The only one I actually go back to. It&#x27;s not an everyday lotion, maybe for special events when you want to smell good. Very good quality, but I don&#x27;t use for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of japanese cherry blossom but the new scent is disappointing. But still it&#x27;s a good smell</li>
    <li> Smells ok, not too strong. Takes maybe 10-20 seconds to get absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels very luxurious.</li>
