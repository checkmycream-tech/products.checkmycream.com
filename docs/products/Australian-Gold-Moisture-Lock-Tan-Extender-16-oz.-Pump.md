<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got it on time. Love the smell. But to me it&#x27;s just like any other lotion. The only reason I&#x27;m still using, and will continue to, is because of the smell.</li>
    <li> this lotion works so well...packs serious hydration but absorbs well not leaving you too greasy.  nice &amp;#34;pina colada&amp;#34; type scent but not too overwheming.  Will keep buying this stuff as long as it exists~~</li>
    <li> This has a great smell and goes on smooth and like the way it feels on skin! would buy again!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion everyday. Tanning or not. It&#x27;s a great lotion! My skin feels so smooth after using it! Has a nice scent. My husband loves how smooth my legs are after using it! I love it too!</li>
    <li> i just bought it today, i had done alot of research by looking at the reviews and prices on different sights and was happy when i found it unbelievably at one of the local walmarts today($9 not sure if that is at all walmarts or if it can be found at all walmarts). i LOVE the smell and I love how ungreasy it is and how soft my skin already feels. i am going to highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am normally a very very white girl. I started tanning in the booth at my gym and use this product everyday. I tanned well the Australian Gold bronzer, and seems this product is helping hold onto that tan. Benefit, it smells great and absorbs quickly! ;)</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever found!!! Got the first bottle in Florida and could not find any here?? I finally found the lotion on amazon and I am very happy!</li>
    <li> Smells tropical and feels luxurious. My skin has not been even slightly dry since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion. I think it is just a bit runny but my husband thinks it is just right. He works out in the sun everyday &amp; thinks this is the best lotion. The only problem with it...it is VERY hard to find. We went on vacation to Alabama &amp; that is where we first was introduced to it. We can not find it anywhere else expect here on the internet. Just make sure you get the scented kind. The unscented has a terrible smell. We even had to by my mother-in-law a bottle because we used it so much last year after getting out of the pool that &amp; she loved the smell. She just got back from FL &amp; raved about the lotion!!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this product last week. I sun tan quiet alot where I live and I wanted something to make my tan stay longer. I have put this on everytime after I take a bath. It smells just like being on a beach somewhere which is great. It also makes your skin really soft. I have noticed that it really does make your tan stay longer. I would recommend this as a great product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product years ago in Canada &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  Ordered it and just love it still many years later!  Great moisturizer not just as an \\&quot;after-tan\\&quot; but even in the winter!</li>
    <li> Like most Australian Gold products I think this lotion smells great.  It is a mild tropical smell.  The best thing about this lotion is how fast in absorbs into your skin.  I am ususally in a hurry getting dressed and I can slather this on and get dressed immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Austrailian gold products, especially the Tan Extender.  I love the smell of this lotion and it really keeps your skin hydrated and your tan looking great!  I would defintely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> While vacationing in St. Marteen, I tried Australian Gold Moisture Lock. I didn&#x27;t peel and my tan lasted longer with the use of this product. I order from Amazon and believe me it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy through them.</li>
    <li> As others also stated, smell is lovely; like melons dancing with flowers on a cloud along with angels. The consistency is great; not too thick or not too runny. It absorbs in about 5 minutes which is pretty good enough for me to enjoy the smell. Also, the lotion caused me not to peel when I got tan as well. Did I tell you how good it smelled?</li>
    <li> AWESOME stuff - hard to find, but well worth the purchase!  I put this on after sitting on the beach for too long and it absorbs the red and I am dark by the morning!  AND IT MAKES YOUR TAN LAST FOREVER!!! LOVE,[[ASIN:B000FCR7MM Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender 16 oz. Pump]] LOVE, LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> I always buy this product it smells great and makes my sunless tan last longer</li>
    <li> It smells really nice like the other reviews say, but there is nothing that makes me believe that it actually is anything more than lotion...meaning there is nothing special about it extending you tan other than like they say on the bottle: moisturized skin keeps a tan longer...nice product but not really all they say it is.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent, ended up throwing it away</li>
    <li> I, absolutely, LOVE this lotion and cannot find it anywhere anymore except on Amazon.  I had heard it has been discontinued and I, sincerely, hope not.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for use after tanning to help preserve color or to lock in moisture after a shower. Goes on smooth with no oily feeling. I smell like an orange creamsicle when I wear this. Yum. I adore it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisture lotion for years and love it!!</li>
    <li> First time user of this product...smells great....not oily....why pay high end retailers for a small bottle of moisturizer for triple the price.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer that I can only find at the beach - or here at amazon.com.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I first bought a bottle of Australian Gold&#x27;s Moisture Lock Tan Extender on a cruise ship about 6 years ago.  I had been out in the sun and saltwater all day and had forgotted to bring a moisturizing lotion with me.  It was very expensive on the ship and I thought it would be a rip off, but I needed the moisturizer so I bought it anyway.  It is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and it&#x27;s not too watery and it has a great fragrance.  I use it daily now, whether I&#x27;m in the sun or not, all year round.  Love the stuff!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells and feels great! I absolutely love it, and I&#x27;m excited to use it everyday to maintain my mystic tan. It has all the recommended ingrediants to help keep a mystic tan moisturized, and the smell literally brings you to the beaches in a tropical paradise.</li>
    <li> I love the moisture lock lotion, it is very light and smells wonderful. I live in Alabama a little ways away from the beach and it is hard to find in local stores. Whenever I see it I always stock up on it. I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love Australian Gold products!  All of the sun tan lotions, gels, and oils I&#x27;ve purchased over the past few years since trying it out on vacation at the Cape.  I had never used the Australian Gold Mositure Lock Tan Extender before since I never got a sunburn! My tan always lasted past the summer since this is an unbelievably great product! You just have to keep applying it, but I never burn!  I always used the 15 SPF at the beginning of the summer, but go down to 4 SPF by August!  Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I decided to purchase the Moisture Lock Extender, but I bought the one with Bronzer which cost about another $2.00 a 16 oz bottle.  I&#x27;ve just read all the testimonials on how great it smells....the 2 bottles I bought last August smelled horrible! It was a tan/cream color, but the scent was nothing like the great orangy summer scent I&#x27;m used to from all of the other Australian Gold products I&#x27;ve purchased.  Can a moisterizer go bad???  I still have the 2 bottles unused but now it&#x27;s too late to return to manufacturer, Cosmetic Solutions.  Should I trust that the Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender WITHOUT Bronzer will be the what I&#x27;ve expected from Austrial Gold?</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this light lotion- it makes me think of summer and I use it in the summer and into the fall to keep summer alive!</li>
    <li> First off i must say how much I love the way it smells (orangy, beachy). I would use it when summer comes around and you&#x27;re at the beach every weekend. But since i started going to a tanning salon i realized this cream wasn&#x27;t cutting it, my skin was drying out. So if ur an advanced tanner like me I recommend spending a little more money on a higher quality after-tan moisturizer. But if ur not, you will absolutely love the way this lotion just glides onto your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!</li>
    <li> The product came in great condition and wrapped very well! Love the smell and provides great moisture</li>
    <li> Last year I visited Florida and purchased Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender and liked it so much that I continue to purchase via Amazon.  This product is great not only in moisture for the skin but the fragrance of the product is outstanding...like being on the beach.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It works great after being out in the sun, and it really does seem to take away that almost itchy sensation you get after you&#x27;ve been away from the sun for a few hours. And it smells of something amazing too.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, great product</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years (remember when it was actually orange?), but it&#x27;s hard to find in PA where I live. It isn&#x27;t greasy but moisurizes well. The scent is subtle and masculine enough for a guy to use. I&#x27;m glad i found it on Amazon so I won&#x27;t have to buy it 10 at a time when I do find it!</li>
    <li> This is the very best after tan lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  Ive used it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years. I use it after a day at the beach and it feels great plus smells good too. My husband likes it as much as I do!!!</li>
    <li> I absoutley love this lotion, the smell alone will make you smile...paradise in a bottle! After tanning apply, my skin feels super soft and hydrated, last throughout the day. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My skin just soaks this stuff up and I love the way it smells and feels.  I can&#x27;t find it here and I hate that I have to get it on the internet and I paid more for it than I did when I could buy it in Florida, but is so worth it that I do..  This is the real deal, too.  Not some knock off or old stuff that has lost it&#x27;s smell.</li>
    <li> The tan that I receive from an indoor tanning bed never lasts long, two days at the most, but I decided to buy this lotion because I couldn&#x27;t find the lotion that I normally buy (Hemp Malibu Bronzing Moisturizer), this lotion makes my tan last longer than 3 days! I love this lotion, I absolutely hate the smell but I love the product. This works great for my chronic eczema too! Definitely give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever. I use it every day before work. Keeps my skin soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion so I could try to find a solution for my fading tan.  I think I found the solution!  I love this stuff.  It is not greasy and goes on easily and smoothly.  It smells so great.  I feel like I am on a tropical island.  If you love tropical and coconuts then you will love the smell of this lotion.  I feel that it works because after just a week my tan looks the same instead of fading like it usually does.  I plan on using this all summer so my tan will stay.  It&#x27;s so frustrating to get some sun and a tan and then have it just fade away.  This lotion also helps for dry skin that you can get from too much tanning.  I am very happy with it and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was leaving to go out of the country within a week when I ordered and the product showed up a couple days before we left.</li>
    <li> For the price, I had hoped that this product would be something special. I found that it&#x27;s no more moisturizing than products you buy at the drugstore.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.  Besides, like the tanning accelerator, the scent is obnoxious.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Australian Gold Moisture Lock lotion while on vacation in Florida last summer.  I just wanted an after sun lotion that had Aloe and after testing several in the store this one was hands-down the best scented!  It really is like a \\&quot;vacation in a bottle\\&quot;.  I think of the beach every time I wear it.  Makes me think of sweet smelling pina coladas!</li>
    <li> I ordered two (2) bottles of this product.  It came exactly as expected.  Original product and in perfect condition.  This is hard to find so I was skeptical about the purchase and was concerned that the product may be a rip off, the unscented kind or a bootleg version, but it was not. This was perfect.</li>
    <li> love love love this lotion! came in the mail in a reasonable amount of time. thanks!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It smells so good! This lotion moisturizes very well &amp; I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it. Thank you for selling a quality product.</li>
    <li> I was not a big fan of this after tanning lotion, but my daughter loves it and uses it all the time</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for years as our after-sun lotion.  It is the best we have found and smells great!</li>
    <li> Im not an avid tanner, but when I do go i ALWAYS use this after. It smells wonderful and really helps my skin feel normal and not dry again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> This stuff is very hard to find if you don&#x27;t live anywhere near a beach. I had to order it here because of that reason. I first tried it about 3 yrs. ago when we went to Myrtle Beach. It is a great after sun lotion, especially if you get burned. Use it immediately after you get out of the shower at night and the next morning your red skin will be normal again. This is how I have always used it right before going to bed. It works the best right out of the shower. If you missed that window then just use it everytime you get out of the shower for the next couple of days it will eventually make the redness go away and keep you from peeling. I still had my bottle from Myrtle Beach until just recently when it did not work so well. I guess it was outdated. I ordered a new one and it works just like the old one did when I first got it. It has a great tropical smell</li>
    <li> Australian Gold products are always good</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this product I was on a cruise ship.  After having been sunburned I was looking for some relief and this was the only product available on the ship that I could find. To my surprise, the lotion was very soothing and moisturizing and really prevented the drying out and peeling effects after a sunburn. After I ran out of the product, I searched high and low to find it in stores in my area but couldn&#x27;t find it. This is the very best body lotion I have ever used! Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many. I cannot stand greasy body lotions - this one&#x27;s not greasy and really has long-lasting effects. I only need to use it every few days to keep my skin looking great.  I highly recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin problems.  I use it mostly on my legs and feet and not only to extend my suntan but for year-round skin moisturizing. I love, love, love this lotion!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite after sun moisturizing lotion. The scent it wonderful - it smells like summer to me. It&#x27;s hard to find during the off season, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; helps lock-in moisture to keep your skin from becoming dry &amp; flaky all year ‘round !!!  NO MINERAL OIL  - YIPPEE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product year-&#x27;round to help prevent dry skin (which means it may delay the shedding of my tan) &amp; definitely helps prevent dry itchy skin in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FORGET about exactly how long you are going to retain your tan.  Although, that&#x27;s how Australian Gold is marketing this product, the length of time you actually keep your tan is really a function of how your body works &amp; the rate at which we constantly shed layers of skin . . .  (Yes, you are constantly SHEDDING !!!  We humans SHED around a million skin cells each day - which equates to 8 to 10 pounds annually.  Our dried skin makes up much of our household dust &amp; adds about five pounds to the weight of our mattresses annually !!! )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product (as well as most &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34;) will delay our shedding a bit - but that&#x27;s really not why I like this product so much...  What makes this product great for me is that it does not contain mineral oil (a gooey  petroleum product) that is found in nearly EVERYTHING else out there.....  It may be just me, but my skin reacts negatively to mineral oil (redness, itching, &amp; “dreaded” ACNE) . . .  (Yes, there is propylene glycol in this product - but I have never had any problems with propylene glycol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the ingredients – this product is about as good as you’re going to get to help retain your body’s moisture without MINERAL OIL !!!  For best results, use it immediately after a shower to lock in the moisture from the shower.  (Keep your water temps down a bit &amp; use a “moisturizing” soap to also help prevent dry skin.)  Use this product regularly to delay shedding your tan in the summer &amp; in the winter to eliminate dry itchy winter skin !!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000FCR7MM Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender 16 oz. Pump]]  I am from the Midwest, and as you can imagine, summer doesn&#x27;t come without alot of harsh windy, cold weather, drying out your skin.  I go to Florida in the winter for a couple of months and I start my tan down there, but when I get back home I really want to continue my tan.  Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan extender is the best I have ever used  to keep my tan as well as keeping my skin nice a soft.  It is truly the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent! This is a very nice lotion. I use it year round and it always reminds me of the beach and the ocean. One of the recent bottles I purchased has a less than desirable scent. It is not the normal scent. When contacting the company directly they said I had to return it to the place of purchase. When attempting to return it on Amazon I was informed that the period for return had expired.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells horrible. I can&#x27;t figure out what it smells like, but it doesn&#x27;t have that coconut/tropical smell most lotions have. I put the lotion on in the morning and put another lotion on in the afternoon. I&#x27;m not sure which lotion is keeping the tan, but I guess it works alright.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for the past year and i LOVE it! i have sensitive skin and cant use smelly stuff, this works amazing i use it after tanning and when im not tanning it smells awesome and no skin reaction!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the smell and this lotion leaves a tacky feeling on your body after it absorbs, almost like the feeling of sweaty palms all over your body. Fast shipping and was in good shape, but I am not a fan of the smell and the texture that it leaves on my skin.</li>
    <li> I became aware of this product when I first hit the Gold Coast of Florida and have loved it ever since. The fragrance will always remind of happy days and nights on the beach! Easily applied without the greasy residue of so many lotions.</li>
    <li> good stuff, low viscosity, absorbs very easily without greasy or oily residue, good smell. Almost like an Apres-Soleil kind of lotion</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it goes on smooth and creamy and my skin just absolutely drinks it up.  Added bonus is it smells pretty good. It&#x27;s definitely not a froo froo scent, just a nice clean scent that won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume or body spray.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is soft if that makes sense</li>
    <li> I love Australian Gold products and this one is added to my arsenal of tanning products.  Not oily and helps to enhance your tan.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Very moisturizing. Has a nice scent. It is not greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin really supple all day long and i love the fruity, cocnuty scent! Great buy, will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> I ADORE this lotion! I use it mainly for the incredible scent, which is like a Caribbean vacation in a bottle...you put it on and immediately feel like you&#x27;re on a beach somewhere in the sun. Awesome. Also it moisturizes really well. I have oiler skin and am always hesitant about using moisturizers, but this one is totally non-greasy. It keeps my skin hydrated without breaking out. It&#x27;s so awesome, DEFINITELY try it!</li>
    <li> It arrived cracked but EWWW it smelled so bad. it has a coconutish smell with a grandma perfume. Threw away and was refunded w/o a hassle but just thought I&#x27;d warn people of the nasty smell</li>
    <li> I do use self-tanners or sometimes I spray tan at the salons.  This lotion is thin but it hydrated my skin. I&#x27;m a lotion freak addict as it is, and this texture was fine! It smells great and I felt that it helped my tan lasts longer by keeping my skin supple and shiny!</li>
    <li> Bought this hard to find lotion at Walmart for the first time and loved it!  Moisturizers well with a nice tropical scent. Being that I try to avoid shopping Walmart if possible, and the fact that I found I can get it cheaper on amazon with an auto ship subscription, I will be getting it here from now on.</li>
    <li> We love the product after finding it in Walgreens last summer but no where but Amazon this year!  It&#x27;s moisturizing qualities are terrific and my husband and I love the fragrance.  Keep it available please!  Carl and Judith</li>
    <li> This Australian gold lotion soaks into the skin quickly.  Has a great fragance, and sooths dry skin and enhances soft skin.</li>
    <li> Received in perfect shape and in good timing. Would purchase again from these people. Thank you.</li>
    <li> AG is my FAVORITE lotion, it has superb ingredients. It&#x27;s packed full of anti-oxidants and has an aloe base, which holds water in your skin, versus a petroleum base that sits on top of the skin. You can see it absorb instantly compared to other lotions that leave a &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; film behind. And the scent is delightful.</li>
    <li> This not only smells very nice, but it feels wonderful on your skin.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs easily.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It has been confusing what lotion to buy for indoor tanning. This is a after tanning lotion only. This is my first one I bought and it works.&lt;br /&gt;I have been on a tanning bed 5 times without any lotion. MY skin is red but does not hurt I do have one spot that does hurt  a spot that does not get sun.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I received the lotion yesterday. I did go tanning when I came back my front looked like a red lobster. Before I sat down I put on the Moister lock lotion. I actually did it twice. By the way the smell is very clean and refreshing. This morning my front is still red but not anything like last night. The area that was hurting does not hurt any more. I feel so good I am going back today for another tanning session.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you updated on this and other lotions I have ordered. I am going to stick with the Australian Gold products which everybody said was the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 30 years.  It used to only be available in tropical locations by the beach or poolside, but I am so glad I can easily purchase it from Amazon.  Great scent and glides on easily.</li>
    <li> I love it! Works great and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have used this Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender for years and I LOVE IT! I have tried other products  every once in a while and have always gone back to this. The scent is great and your skin always feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I was completely satisfied with the service, and the expedition of my order. Better than expected! I am totally satisfied</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and it smells great! Not as coconut-smelling as I&#x27;d like but still smells like summer!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Applies smooth and dries quick!</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, I read lots of reviews about its nice smell and moituring. So I thought no doubt to get this. Honestly, moisturing is okay but the scent doesnt make me pleasant .....I don&#x27;t know how to describe this smell... Someone wrote it&#x27;s tropical scent, maybe s/he was right. It&#x27;s greasy sweet smell.... Hmm more like.....June Bug cocktail.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is okay but I would get different lotion next time because of its smell :-(</li>
    <li> Could not find this in Michigan in late July and I was running out...feels good and smells Great...checked Amazon and got it for a great price + shipping...picked up a few for my good friends!!</li>
    <li> Smells good! Only need a little bit.</li>
    <li> I expected this to be very thick because it is an after sun lotion, but it is surprisingly light. It feels great to apply (especially went burned) but I do find I have to reapply more frequently. Does not feel sticky or greasy.</li>
    <li> best body moisturizer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s AMAZING. My skin felt immediately hydrated and it left my skin feeling so silky without the greasy feeling that other moisturizers will give you. Honestly, it kind of made me want to curl up in bed because it made my skin feel that comfortable! I&#x27;m not only going to use this as a tan extender but I&#x27;m definitely going to use this as my regular lotion. It has an islandy scent - kind of reminds me of pina colada&#x27;s, but I think it&#x27;s pretty light and don&#x27;t mind it (You could always put the lotion on at night before bed if you don&#x27;t like to smell like that during the day). If you get a little red from the sun and your skin is feeling hot - take a cool shower and then put this on after. It cools down your skin instantly! Perfect for people who are going on a vacation and don&#x27;t want it to have their skin feel like it&#x27;s been drying up in the sun all day. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face because I break out easily, but if you are hesitant as well you can try putting it on a small part of your face to test it.</li>
    <li> This is the the best skin lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I put in on right after a shower. Then again when I get back home after tanning. In the winter I&#x27;ll put it on even more often. It is great for the skin and most certainly enhances the appearance of one&#x27;s tan. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite moisturizing lotion for years.  I will continue to buy here since it is the best price!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever had! It smells amazing and really does help my tan from fading. I will def continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I love this and it&#x27;s really hard to get in the midwest.  I was thrilled to find it!  I bought three bottles, my husband likes it too.  It&#x27;s very light and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Australian Gold Moisture Lock is my favorite after sun tan extender.  It smells great!  I love that Amazon had it.  I found it on vacation in South Beach one year and was not able to find it in the stores at home even though I live right by the beach!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of the lotion, smells tropical. When my lotion was delivered, the top dispenser was broken, but it would have cost too much to send it back, so I just use it without the dispense top.     I am not exactly sure if the lotion is extending my tan, but it definitely gives my body a nice glow to it. We shall see how the product holds up in the winter!</li>
    <li> Actually I did not get until today this item Australian Gold Moisture Lock Tan Extender 16 oz. Pump.Mas Accelerator and perfume have reached a little while. I wonder why?? the lotion was not purchased on the same day.</li>
    <li> Smells like being at the pool. Love that it blends into the skin and leaves it smooth without being sticky. Love this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  Helps keep your tan longer. I have been using this product for 7 years, it&#x27;s the only moisture cream I use.  I have very dry skin and this keeps it moist, keeps the flakes away.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! I definitely noticed that my tan was staying longer. It soaks right into your skin and never leaves it feeling greasy. The smell is wonderful. It kind of reminds me of a tropical bubble gum scent, which wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting but it still smells great! The bottle has lasted me forever. I would absolutely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I loved the lotion but I could got it cheaper at walmart Also my pump was broken which is aggravating to open everytime</li>
    <li> Why choose, as both comments apply.  This is best used in our household, after a winter&#x27;s trip to a warm climate (albeit too short).  It not only extends the &amp;#34;memories&amp;#34; but also provides soothing comfort.</li>
    <li> Product worked great only problem is that the pump didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Works well, and I liked the smell at first. The more I used it the less I liked it. Still works as advertised, but can no longer stand the smell.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Australian gold. Its great on my sensitive skin. This moisturizer smells great and makes skin look and feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for about for about 8 years and have never had a sun burn!And I&#x27;m a beach bum!Picked them up by accident  one year while I was visiting  friends  in Florida.Loved the stuff couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere in South Jersey would have my daughter send it to me while she was attending college in Florida.It smells so good keeps me going during those long winters in the north east.Non greasy go&#x27;s on wonderfully.Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.When I&#x27;m in a store and they have the products I tell everyone how wonderful they are.I should be a spokes person for the company!</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Very moisturizing and smells great!</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews and it seemed like people either loved or hated the scent.  So, I took a chance on it and it smells horrible!!  It reminds me of a really cheap smelling tanning lotion.  But, I thought I would give it a try because sometimes it smells different on...kind of like perfume...but no, even on it smelled horrible!  I wish I could return it because it was a waste of money.  I don&#x27;t even think it was a great moisturizer either.  Total loss all the way around.</li>
    <li> Got this product as a substitute for aloe vera for when I get sunburned.  I can&#x27;t stand the sticky feeling aloe gel leaves behind, so I was looking for something else.  This is the ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth, has a semi- to moderate coconut smell that is characteristic of Australian Gold products, and dissipates very quickly.  It will keep you from peeling after a long day in the sun, which probably helps in maintaining a tan.  I cannot really speak to that claim of the product, but it beats other lotions for this and daily use, as well as aloe vera.</li>
    <li> I got the lotion for my toddlers. we liked the smell but it was not tear free. I would not recommend for baby or toddler.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite, favorite after-tan lotion in the world. When I am able to find this lotion, I usually buy out the selection. Great smell, not greasy... I love it!</li>
    <li> After tanning lotion if very nice, scent is pleasant, and it really moisturizers. The container is a good size, and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> my favorite lotion ever!  I love the smell, I love the way it feels on my skin.  It is not sticky or greasy.  It will absorb into the skin making it feel soft and silky.  Holds in my tan and helps it from not fading as fast.  My skin is never dry with this product. It is fabulous!!</li>
    <li> I use  level tanning bed.  I use this lotion everyday and it leaves my skin like silk. Smells really nice too.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, but I love Australian Gold anyway! It feels great and I love the scent ! It even makes sunburnt feel good!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best after tan moisturizer! I love the fact that it is not greasy. The fragrance is wonderful! I bought several</li>
    <li> The smell reminds me of pina coladas; which helps relax me when I apply this lotion in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a long lasting bottle. I am 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;, 190lbs, and I get about a month and a half out of each bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using this on the face.</li>
    <li> I am a Springtime tanning bed- aholic.. and i have to say that this lotion has not only done what the name says it does ,,, extend the duration of my tan ,but it also has kept my skin feeking like silk . it smells amazing and when u put it on after tanning or showering  u can actually feel the moisture seeping into your skin , as if it instantly replenishes any moisture lost in the tanning bed. its not greasy at all so getting dressed a moment later is not a problem . and amazon has it for a quarter of retail tanning saloons price !!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after a freind of mine let me use her&#x27;s while we were vacationing in Turks. I would apply this once a day at night. AFter a day of activities &amp; sun exposure, your skin can become dry and stressed.  I was extremely pleased with the moisture this lotion provided.  It wasn;t sticky, too thick, or overly oily.  It was perfect!  In addition, my tan lasted for a little longer than it would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sugeest you get this!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years and always had to have my Mom ship to me from FL before Amazon.  It is so nice to be able to order and have delivered to my door.  This is a great lotion for any time of year and any type of skin.  Love the feel after I have applied it and smells good also.</li>
    <li> Just an ok moisturizer really does nothing to extend tan...</li>
    <li> The Australian Gold family of SPF and lotions are becoming one of my favorites.  This lasts a long time and is light on the skin.  It takes a lot to build up and its always pretty soothing.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion, takes me back to the beach!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion, like how it goes on, but it doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing.....I just mix it with something a little heavier.</li>
    <li> Really like this tan extender lotion, it keeps your skin soft and silky and is not greasy!! Best I have found and would highly recommend it to any tanning junkie..</li>
    <li> Works really well for dry skin. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and absorbs very quickly. Has a pleasant tropical smell.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite after tan lotion, use it all of the time.  So glad I found it here since it is so hard to find in the winter season.  Price was exceptional as well.</li>
    <li> USED IT FOR YEARS.BEST EVER FOR HOLDING A TAN AND JUST GREAT FOR A MOISTURING LOTION ALL YEAR LONG ANY ONE I KNOW TRIES IT LIKES IT ALSO</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time today and i love it. I love the smell and how quickly it is to apply it. Its not too thick but it still feels very moistirizing and you cant beat the price! Definitely will be repurchasing. Didnt have any problems with the seller either. It actually arrived earlier than expected. :) very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best thing in the world for my skin.  I use it all the time.  It is light and smells like the beach.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift to use after indoor tanning to keep my tan up but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help at all.  It&#x27;s a decent moisturizer, but on the thin side. I won&#x27;t use again</li>
    <li> Excellent with non oily finish</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this lotion!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great after a long day in the sun and smells so good! I always use it after sun-exposure and showering in the summertime to keep from peeling and hydrate my skin - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer by Australian Gold off and on for since I was a teenager.  I lover all the&lt;br /&gt;Austrailian Gold products, even when they use to be sold exclusively by tanning salons.  My local Walmart doesn&#x27;t carry this product so I decided to order it here so I wouldn&#x27;t have to over pay at another salon.  Now if you can buy at you local WalMart then I would recommend buying it there as it is much cheaper but then again if you cannot find it, buying it here is much cheaper even if you have to pay for the shipping.  Either way you are still going to be paying WAY less for this wonderful product then from overpriced salons.  Back to the review.  This lotion smells great, goes on smoothly, and hydrates your skin.  I find myself using this product more so during the summer and have only recently found it so much cheaper here so I will be using this product all year round now since I can afford it.  This lotion does not clog my pores and I even use it on my face.  It really does extend your tan while hydrating your skin.  I use this lotion throughout the day.  I keep a botte of this stuff at home, in my car, even at work.  This product leaves your skin silky smooth while locking in your tan.  Great to use as a daily moisturizer even if you are not using it as a tan extender.  I can&#x27;t wait to use this wonderful product this winter as I know it will help keep my dry winter skin in tip top shape. HIGHLY recommend this lotion!!</li>
    <li> I really like how this isn&#x27;t too thick like most after tan moisturizers. I don&#x27;t know what others are talking about when they say it has a &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; smell. I would relate the smell more to bubble gum, anywho, it smells great!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read a review that mentioned it hand the classic Australian Gold orangie-vacation smell. I don&#x27;t know how other to describe it, the scent just makes me feel like I&#x27;m on vacation getting ready to lay out in the sun. If you&#x27;ve ever used an Australian Gold sun block, you know exactly what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong, I happen to love it. If you aren&#x27;t into scented products, this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;And as far as it&#x27;s moisturizing qualities, I don&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s nice on my legs, and body, leaves them feeling fresh and soft, but it isn&#x27;t a good hand moisturizer.,  My hands almost feel dry and greasy after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;As for it&#x27;&#x27;s tan extender qualities I can&#x27;t really say. I am pale as a ghost currently, but really any moisturizer should help extend the life of your tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy this again? YES! But mostly for the scent. I can&#x27;t get enough of it! And at the $8 Amazon offers it, its a deal. It is a fairly large bottle.</li>
    <li> I used to go tanning daily, and bought this lotion because I was going to start tanning on the daily again and needed a good moisturizer. I decided to try it before I had started tanning, and it smells so good that I can&#x27;t stop using it. I use this every morning after my shower. I feel an obvious difference in my skin&#x27;s dryness when I don&#x27;t use it. Definitely purchase!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  I have hunted for it in stores and can never find it.  This lotion has the best scent of any lotion and is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use every time after tanning, or even every day after shower. The best lotion. Would buy again, and again.</li>
    <li> Lovely sweet fragrance, soft touch and non-greasy. The skin is more moisturized and the tan last longer and is more beautiful.Recommend.I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Was not very happy with this lotion, I am a big fan of Australian Gold but not sure what is up with this after tanning lotion. It seemed my tan did not stay as long as it did when I was using a different lotion.</li>
    <li> I found this product at a store in Gulf Shores.  I liked it so much that I came home and ordered some more.  My daughter took my original bottle...I like the texture, I like the smell, and I like the way it absorbs quickly.  It makes me think of the beach every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our virgin island vacation and it felt nice, was moisturing as an after sun lotion but I wasn&#x27;t craztpy about the fragrance. It is kind of tropical but I tend to prefer the Hawaiian tropic sunscreen fragrance- this one is overly pungent sweet.</li>
    <li> I love this item.My friend recommended  to me 5 years  ago,and always somebody bring me from Florida because only is available there.Now I fonded on Internet and I am so happy.</li>
