      <li>Very happy with this straightener, especially considering the price!</li>
      <li>Two, the faux rhinestones on the top side are a cute design, but after holding it for a while, they start to hurt my fingers</li>
      <li>Wish I would have purchased more as gifts for friends and family.</li>
      <li>she uses it more than I do</li>
      <li>Other than those things, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>and he beautiful red color.</li>
      <li>the cord is awesome, the plates, looks like ceramic and go trough really smooth on my hair.it get hot enough</li>
      <li>but it does have two or three very minor aspects that I wish could be better, but it&#x27;s still really great (which is why I am keeping it).</li>
      <li>Nice long cord with a swivel top, good color, looks to be well made, heats up quickly, cools down to touch in a fair amount of time, and most importantly, it straightens your hair!</li>
      <li>hair.verry light</li>
      <li>I got it for under $7 with free 2-day shipping (Prime).</li>
      <li>This hair straightener is very easy to use and leaves your hair straight and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>, wich is good, and i just need to pass twice to straighten each hair lock, is good enough on my curly natural hair,</li>
      <li>I love the little stones on the top that shine so nicely under my bathroom vanity light.</li>
      <li>The iron itself get very hot, which I love because I have some stubborn, coarse hair and it flattens it so nicely.</li>
      <li>I received my ceramic hair straightener quick and on time.</li>
      <li>I think my young daughter was more excited than I was with the bling</li>
      <li>This is cute, heats up super fast and works very well.</li>

      <li>I am in love with this flat iron!</li>
      <li>Love my new flat iron, better than I expected for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t really hold it there.</li>
      <li>And three, the outside red plastic on top of each plate does get rather warm/hot</li>
      <li>The color is lovely and I think the fake diamonds are a cute touch.</li>
      <li>I would return it to get a new one, but I needed it now and wouldn&#x27;t get the new one in time.</li>
      <li>Because of that, I wanted a straightener that was 1 inch wide and would heat up quickly, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much for something I&#x27;d only be using for crafting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>1 Inch Pretty Red Flat Iron with the bling Ceramic plates for even heating through out the hair LED light flash when the iron is ready I have very coarse, and thick hair that takes a long time for me to straighten The iron leaves my hair feeling soft with a shine, not bad for the price I paid!</li>
      <li>I ran it through my hair while I had it on and was surprised by how well it worked.</li>
      <li>heat up fast, it lite and not to big</li>
      <li>and it has definitely replaced my old one.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want anything fancy or expensive just something good enough to get me out of a pinch when my hair decides to be a hot mess in the middle of the day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally straighten my hair; I bought this item because I needed a straightener for a craft I&#x27;m doing (yarn tail).</li>

    <li> Very happy with this straightener, especially considering the price! I got it for under $7 with free 2-day shipping (Prime). The color is lovely and I think the fake diamonds are a cute touch. I don&#x27;t normally straighten my hair; I bought this item because I needed a straightener for a craft I&#x27;m doing (yarn tail). Because of that, I wanted a straightener that was 1 inch wide and would heat up quickly, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much for something I&#x27;d only be using for crafting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener totally fits the bill. It heats up in less than a minute, and the level of heat has a number of settings. Very convenient, and well worth the price I paid. I ran it through my hair while I had it on and was surprised by how well it worked. This straightener is a bargain!</li>
    <li> The straightener itself works nicely. Great straightener for the price. It straightens and curls nicely without pulling your hair. I would have given it a 5 star, but the small circle on the side of the straightener was broken off when I received it in the mail. I would return it to get a new one, but I needed it now and wouldn&#x27;t get the new one in time. So for that reason I am giving it a 4 out of 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Love my new flat iron, better than I expected for the price I paid. Wish I would have purchased more as gifts for friends and family. Vibrant color and a little sassiness with the added bling! I think my young daughter was more excited than I was with the bling and he beautiful red color. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>

    <li> 1 Inch Pretty Red Flat Iron with the bling Ceramic plates for even heating through out the hair LED light flash when the iron is ready I have very coarse, and thick hair that takes a long time for me to straighten The iron leaves my hair feeling soft with a shine, not bad for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this flat iron! I love the little stones on the top that shine so nicely under my bathroom vanity light. The iron itself get very hot, which I love because I have some stubborn, coarse hair and it flattens it so nicely. I had no issues with any cords or the plates and I have been using it for a few days now and it has definitely replaced my old one. I try to be careful not to leave this one on because I will forget when rushing out the house. It heats up in no time (under a minute) and I am so very happy with it!</li>
    <li> For the price...it&#x27;s a steal! I have a $150 flat iron at home and needed one to keep at the office. Didn&#x27;t want anything fancy or expensive just something good enough to get me out of a pinch when my hair decides to be a hot mess in the middle of the day. This is cute, heats up super fast and works very well.</li>
    <li> This straightener is really great but it does have two or three very minor aspects that I wish could be better, but it&#x27;s still really great (which is why I am keeping it). One, the temperature settings on my straightener are in Celsius for some reason. Not a big deal, but I had to convert to Fahrenheit to estimate the temp it was set on. Two, the faux rhinestones on the top side are a cute design, but after holding it for a while, they start to hurt my fingers so i have to move them up the straightener. And three, the outside red plastic on top of each plate does get rather warm/hot so you can&#x27;t really hold it there. Other than those things, it&#x27;s perfect. Nice long cord with a swivel top, good color, looks to be well made, heats up quickly, cools down to touch in a fair amount of time, and most importantly, it straightens your hair! Awesome price too</li>
