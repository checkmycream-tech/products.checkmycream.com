      <li>The original product is great!</li>
      <li>May hair has never been better!</li>
      <li>The first time you put this shampoo on your head you will immediately realize that this is the best shampoo you have ever used.</li>
      <li>joico is so amazing.</li>
      <li>It reduces frizz and gives your hair a really nice feel.  </li>
      <li>Ask any Pro stylist who is not trying to push their own products and they will recommend Biosilk.</li>
      <li>The texture it leaves in my hair after showering and during the shampooing process is kind of &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, so to speak.</li>
      <li>I love love love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
      <li>the perfume oil is very light.</li>
      <li>I have been using Biosilk shampoo,Hair Shine,  Conditioner and Biosilk Oil Perfume for many years&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
      <li>but I am in love with this.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo :-)</li>
      <li>love this.</li>
      <li>A bunch of bubble began to form at the top of the shampoo bottle.  </li>
      <li>Love that</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>There were also many differences from the texts written on the bottles.</li>
      <li>perhaps with more use.</li>
      <li>My hair stays clean for many, many days!</li>
      <li>very nice scent, thicker than most shampoos, have not noticed much difference yet in the frizzies, though.</li>
      <li>It has great lather and a fresh clean scent.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s super nice on the hair.</li>
      <li>The duo gives my hair an incredible shine and makes it soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The conditioner and serum do the magic and when all of them used together, they make your hair smooth and silky while treating the itchy scalp and hair loss.</li>
      <li>the Biosilk Brand that I have favored for many years of my 78.&lt;br /&gt;The Bio-Silk product overall is A++!&lt;br /&gt;MDR</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean and healthy looking and</li>
      <li>but this problem is easily solved with ION Color Sealer used twice a week.</li>
      <li>The conditioner was watered down as well and neither of them had that wonderful Bio Silk smell.  </li>
      <li>and fortunately I found it.</li>
      <li>Good for someone trying to cut back on a lot of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Shampoo is ok, but you need to apply a very generous amount.</li>
      <li>I recommend buying at a real salon even if it means paying more.</li>
      <li>I for the first time in my life don&#x27;t even need a conditioner!</li>
      <li>Which caused a more alcoholic smell and made it more liquidy and more bubbly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>its so soft.. and its more pricier but hey you gt what you pay for.</li>
      <li>And yet as gentle as it is, I feel like my head and hair get clean.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the other two, surprisingly -</li>
      <li>definitely noticed a difference with repeated use after 2 months, noticed a more sheen with my hair.</li>
      <li>When it arrived, I examined both my previous authentic bottle and this new bottle and realized many differences.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>fast ship, exactly as pictured</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo first in a hotel by chance, I liked the fact that once dried, my hair stayed on place and without the frizz/volume problem.</li>
      <li>I also color my hair and have noticed that this will pull some of the color out a little more quickly</li>
      <li>It makes bubbles in quantity as a regular shampoo and the odor is fine.</li>
      <li>I really like the scent too.</li>
      <li>I have been going through a very stressful period which caused hair loss, loss of elasticity and shine.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the real Biosilk product for a while now and decided to buy it on amazon for cheaper.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t suds up as much as I would like</li>
      <li>and you have to use a larger amount than with some other shampoos to get a good lather.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t any better than any other shampoo I have tried.</li>
      <li>If you try the smaller sizes first I guarantee you will be back for more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of years and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If you want a shampoo that will really make your hair feel soft and silky</li>
      <li>but my hair is very soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several years and the results are exactly as I expect.</li>
      <li>I cannot  state enough positive remarks</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft but manageable.</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive scalp and this does not make me break out.</li>
      <li>Well if you go from using NORmal walmart shampoo to this then yes big improvement..</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that it is kind of thin and runny</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT. I bought this in a set with the silk therapy conditioner and serum. I don&#x27;t really care for the other two, surprisingly - but I am in love with this. It lathers like there&#x27;s no tomorrow so I only need a small amount. It leaves my hair clean and healthy looking and I for the first time in my life don&#x27;t even need a conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for five months now. I am a male with very thick straight black hair and around 4-6 inches long. I always had the following problem with regular shampoos: once my hair dried it was all spongy, with frizz, with too much volume. I used this shampoo first in a hotel by chance, I liked the fact that once dried, my hair stayed on place and without the frizz/volume problem. So i looked for it at amazon and fortunately I found it. So I ordered five 355ml bottles, around $8 each. I&#x27;ve just finished one and the product continues to work as that hotel&#x27;s little bottle.  The texture it leaves in my hair after showering and during the shampooing process is kind of &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;, so to speak. It makes bubbles in quantity as a regular shampoo and the odor is fine.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve used it for several years and the results are exactly as I expect. It has great lather and a fresh clean scent.</li>
    <li> Well if you go from using NORmal walmart shampoo to this then yes big improvement.. but if you go from using joico to this NO ITS HORRIBLE. joico is so amazing. its so soft.. and its more pricier but hey you gt what you pay for. it feels like your washing your hair wish silk . this made my hair very dry feeling even while i was washing it. i had ran out of joico conditioner and i heard this was good i didnt realize it was shampoo until after i bought it.</li>
    <li> If you want a shampoo that will really make your hair feel soft and silky this is the one for you.  It reduces frizz and gives your hair a really nice feel.  I really like the scent too.</li>
    <li> Good product and good company</li>
    <li> very nice scent, thicker than most shampoos, have not noticed much difference yet in the frizzies, though. perhaps with more use.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo together with the conditioner and silk treatment serum. Shampoo is ok, but you need to apply a very generous amount. The conditioner and serum do the magic and when all of them used together, they make your hair smooth and silky while treating the itchy scalp and hair loss. I have been going through a very stressful period which caused hair loss, loss of elasticity and shine. This product brought my hair back to life with visible results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Just about the best shampoo out there.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of years and highly recommend it.</li>

    <li> Like this shampoo. Good for someone trying to cut back on a lot of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo :-)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0007NIRPA Biosilk Silk Therapy Shampoo 12 Ounces ( 350ml )]]    I have used this product in the past and had to stop because of the price. I was so happy to find it on Amazon at such a great price. The first time you put this shampoo on your head you will immediately realize that this is the best shampoo you have ever used. The only drawback is that it is kind of thin and runny and you have to use a larger amount than with some other shampoos to get a good lather. This may not apply to all as I have very long and very thick hair. I also color my hair and have noticed that this will pull some of the color out a little more quickly but this problem is easily solved with ION Color Sealer used twice a week. Between the Biosilk shampoo, conditioner, and silk therapy serum your hair will be totally transformed. It will give you the healthiest, strongest hair you have ever had. Ask any Pro stylist who is not trying to push their own products and they will recommend Biosilk. There is simply not a better product made. If you try the smaller sizes first I guarantee you will be back for more.</li>
    <li> !!!Fake item!!! Bought this last week from the seller &amp;#34;Pharmapacks&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been using the real Biosilk product for a while now and decided to buy it on amazon for cheaper. Shipping was fast. When it arrived, I examined both my previous authentic bottle and this new bottle and realized many differences. There were a lot more ingredients in fake product. Which caused a more alcoholic smell and made it more liquidy and more bubbly. It also contains both kinds of SLS which actually dries out hair. There were also many differences from the texts written on the bottles. The fake bottle does not have any register trademark symbols, which an authentic bottle should have after &amp;#34;Biosilk&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Silk Therapy&amp;#34;. I do NOT recommend buying this from Amazon. I recommend buying at a real salon even if it means paying more. It&#x27;s worth the money. The original product is great!</li>
    <li> Good cleansing shampoo</li>
    <li> definitely noticed a difference with repeated use after 2 months, noticed a more sheen with my hair. love this.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! My hair stays clean for many, many days!</li>
    <li> I have just recently started using Biosilk products. I hadn&#x27;t used them prior because I was afraid they would make my hair greasy looking. My hair is very thin, so weighing it down or making it look greasy is not a desired effect. I am also trying to let my hair grow after having it cut very short for several years, so it&#x27;s in the \\&quot;drive me crazy stage.\\&quot;  I finally turned to Biosilk after my current products were leaving my hair looking ratty and in need of combing all the time. Biosilk leaves my hair looking and feeling soft and smooth and has stopped me from cutting it back off again. I use several of their products in my washing and styling process, and I will be sticking with these products.</li>
    <li> great shampoo.  Leaves your hair beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biosilk shampoo,Hair Shine,  Conditioner and Biosilk Oil Perfume for many years&lt;br /&gt;Each one is wonderful. the perfume oil is very light. I .also use the BiioSilk oil on my legs and elbows after showering.&lt;br /&gt;The spray Bio-Silk  hair shine  is especially nice after setting one&#x27;s hair style. I cannot  state enough positive remarks&lt;br /&gt;about the Biosilk Brand that I have favored for many years of my 78.&lt;br /&gt;The Bio-Silk product overall is A++!&lt;br /&gt;MDR</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo.  this is the only shampoo he uses.  Great product,</li>
    <li> May hair has never been better! A little bit goes a long way.  I think it is a great value.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!! I use it with the silk therapy conditioner. The duo gives my hair an incredible shine and makes it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment!  As soon as I opened the bottle of shampoo Iknew something was wrong.  A bunch of bubble began to form at the top of the shampoo bottle.  I smelled the conditioner and it didn&#x27;t smell as good as the ones that I buy at the store.  When I poured the shampoo out into my hand to wash my hair, it was CLEARLY WATERED DOWN!!!  The conditioner was watered down as well and neither of them had that wonderful Bio Silk smell.  I woulkd NOT receommend EVER ordering this, or any other \\&quot;beauty product\\&quot; again....</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo! I have a sensitive scalp and this does not make me break out. But it&#x27;s super nice on the hair. I used to always have to use conditioner. I&#x27;ve dropped my conditioner usage to once a week. And yet as gentle as it is, I feel like my head and hair get clean.</li>
    <li> Great product at a wonderful price. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Smells divine!! Leaves my hair feeling soft but manageable.</li>
