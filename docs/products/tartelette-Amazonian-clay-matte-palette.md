      <li>I&#x27;d have more luck with a lottery</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>and I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love the formula.</li>
      <li>I love matte colors.</li>
      <li>Very versatile and great color selection.</li>
      <li>Overall great product!  </li>
      <li>MUCH better price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just perfect, cannot recommend it enough.</li>
      <li>already have a lot, but this one is only matte and colours are superb: warm tones, cool tones and purple tones.  </li>
      <li>And didn&#x27;t take long to ship out to me :) very happy...</li>
      <li>Also Tarte is 100% vegan and cruelty free  ; ) wonderful high quality brand, nice to see it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This pallette makes it SO easy to put together a beautiful, classy look!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 100% amazing and worth my money.</li>
      <li>I have zero problems with the pigment, in fact I was surprised at how great the color payoff is.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Easily blendable.  </li>
      <li>Those darker colors are well pigmented and are easily blendable.</li>
      <li>Easily blendable, the powder has a creamy consistency.  </li>
      <li>Nice, vibrant colors (as vibrant as this palette can be lol)</li>
      <li>That being said, this is the first truly neutral matte palette by Tarte that I own</li>
      <li>This pallette is hands down the best palette I have ever owned!</li>
      <li>These are delightfully pigmented, not ashy at all, and little to no fallout, a miracle for a matte</li>
      <li>The shades are neutral yet versatile at the same time, you can apply with a light hand for a great day time look or apply a bit heavier and smoke it out for an evening look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Speaking of &#x27;cheap,&#x27; both Sephora and Ulta sell this at (ahem)</li>
      <li>an all matte line up in three shade categories, and a smooth application.</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday wear</li>
      <li>The case itself is substantial with a clasp; nothing cheap going on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the addition to my routine!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I debated this palette for awhile, I wanted an all matte shadow look but wasn&#x27;t sure if this or the Naked basic palette would be best.</li>
      <li>It is worth the money!</li>
      <li>I love the purple packaging and it has a nice big mirror.</li>
      <li>As most of the eye pallets from other brands have shimmery colors, this one is really good found</li>
      <li>The colors are lovely, they blend well and seem very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Nice matte finish, soft on eye lids, day or night wear</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s actually USEFUL, vs. a mirror that seems like a cheap afterthought.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love my new shadows!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also loving the mirror, which stays open, and it&#x27;s huge.</li>
      <li>You totally need a good eye primer or this stuff slides right off within an hour.</li>
      <li>Texture is smooth and there is a large mirror.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>There are a few colors in which the color payout is not that great</li>
      <li>I gave it a 3 because of the colors don&#x27;t produce much pigment (the light colors).</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the trasaction was smooth.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>There are not any colors that I do not think I will use, which is rare for me and buying eye palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the shades and the  classy</li>
      <li>My cousin was right, the Tarte Tartelette Clay Matte Eyeshadow is a must have.</li>
      <li>, I will use no other eyeshadow than this one, the pigment is perfection, the longevity is outstanding.</li>
      <li>After seeing both in person, this won me over for a few reasons, the most important being the eyeshadow shades were varied, smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a woman over 40 who is looking for matte neutrals that will have people commenting on how pretty you look, vs.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pretty pallet.</li>
      <li>I first saw Tarte&#x27;s Tartelette Clay Matte Eyeshadow at Ulta.</li>
      <li>shades are varied enough, but without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>These colors are wonderful because they are matte and true matte eyeshadow is almost impossible to find.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome authentic product, took a bit to receive but it was worth the wait:)</li>
    <li> I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks GOD that I have it.</li>
    <li> I just love how all the colors blend beautifully together</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> matte eyeshadows and it lasts long - this is the first time that I bought an eye palette without the glitter/shimmery eyeshadows. Perfect for everyday wear</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette I love the purple packaging and it has a nice big mirror. The shadows are pigmented and creamy highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner and met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great colors!  This pallette sells out everywhere, but I found it here at a great price.  It comes with an insert to show you a couple of looks.  My only complaint is that it does not come with a brush, a lot of comparable palettes.  The colors are warm and neutral.  There are not any colors that I do not think I will use, which is rare for me and buying eye palettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am a big fan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 100% amazing and worth my money. These colors are gorgeous and you can use them in the morning or at night. I wish though it comes with its own brush. Go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably the queen of matte  palettes, which means I have a small kingdom. There are very few &#x27;all matte, all the time&#x27; palettes out there. And all matte neutrals? I&#x27;d have more luck with a lottery ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarte&#x27;s foray into this category, then, for me, is perfection. It has everything I want: NICE sized pans (instead of little dinky ones, where you love one color, hit pan, and then you&#x27;re stuck with making some weird purple or fuscia you never touch work for you), an all matte line up in three shade categories, and a smooth application. These are delightfully pigmented, not ashy at all, and little to no fallout, a miracle for a matte set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of this palette is just so nice! I&#x27;m also loving the mirror, which stays open, and it&#x27;s huge. it&#x27;s actually USEFUL, vs. a mirror that seems like a cheap afterthought. The case itself is substantial with a clasp; nothing cheap going on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of &#x27;cheap,&#x27; both Sephora and Ulta sell this at (ahem) MUCH better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a woman over 40 who is looking for matte neutrals that will have people commenting on how pretty you look, vs. how garish your makeup is, this is the palette for you!</li>
    <li> These came double packed to insure a damage free product. The eye shadows are in a beautiful case with a ample sized mirrow. All the shadows are matte and are so beautiful. I am so looking forward to use every day.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous Colors! Pigmented and Shades Well.</li>
    <li> Colores espectaculares</li>
    <li> i received this item and it has scratches all over it and it didn&#x27;t have any protection for delivery at all</li>
    <li> I first saw Tarte&#x27;s Tartelette Clay Matte Eyeshadow at Ulta. I loved the colors but I decided to wait on buying it because the price was a little high for my budgett. Then my cousin bought it and told me that it was a must have, so I bought it on Amazon and I am so glad I did. My cousin was right, the Tarte Tartelette Clay Matte Eyeshadow is a must have. I wear it everyday and the color stays on all day. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Overall great product!  I&#x27;d love to see a lighter, medium and darker palette unto themselves!  I basically only use half the palette, but love the product.  I use eyeshadow primer and it stays on all day and blends beautifully!  I get comments all the time!</li>
    <li> If you are thirty five years and older, this is a must have palette!&lt;br /&gt;All the colors on the palette are not offensive and can be used from day to evening.&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much use all the colors on the palette. It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> I saw them in the mall. they are really beautiful in life. I love matte colors. As most of the eye pallets from other brands have shimmery colors, this one is really good found</li>
    <li> Tarte cosmetics are the absolute best!  I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have used it since my twenties, I will use no other eyeshadow than this one, the pigment is perfection, the longevity is outstanding. the very feel of it is like satin on my skin. It never fades or flakes. Just perfect, cannot recommend it enough. Also Tarte is 100% vegan and cruelty free  ; ) wonderful high quality brand, nice to see it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was an Urban Decay fanatic, since receiving Tarte, have not used anything else!!  Love these colors and the staying power!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Easily blendable.  Nice matte finish, soft on eye lids, day or night wear</li>
    <li> Great color payoff and very easy to blend. Love all matte shadows!!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy I bought this palette!&lt;br /&gt;I already have a lot, but this one is only matte and colours are superb: warm tones, cool tones and purple tones.  Texture is smooth and there is a large mirror.&lt;br /&gt;This palette is now one of my favourites :-)</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the trasaction was smooth. The palatte was great! The quality is as expected.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ll be buying again cuz I&#x27;ll help out a family business with my purchases.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pretty pallet. Colors are not very pigmented and not blend able.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best make up purchases I have made in years. I am 60, and matte is best. The color palette is great in this set. Good texture, easy to build color. Completely effortless to come up with a natural look.</li>
    <li> These colors are wonderful because they are matte and true matte eyeshadow is almost impossible to find.  If you are older (or just have wrinkled eyelids )  ; ) these are for you.  The sparkle and even the sheen type eyeshadows just highlight wrinkles. Try these; you will like the difference.</li>
    <li> You totally need a good eye primer or this stuff slides right off within an hour. But with a good primer? Nice, vibrant colors (as vibrant as this palette can be lol) that lasted 14 hours! I love the shades and the  classy looks one may create with this palette. It is too pricey imo but it was a treat to myself and I am very happy I bought it. I use it every day, sometimes using something like Burberry Pale Barley eyeshadow in the crease, over one of the Tartelette colors.. it all blends so beautifully and I am very happy with this purchase--both the item and the quick service.</li>
    <li> Love this palette!  Greatly saturated neutral, cool and warm shades. All of the guesswork is taken out so consumer knows which color goes with which. Easily blendable, the powder has a creamy consistency.  Worth every penny! I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my new shadows! And didn&#x27;t take long to ship out to me :) very happy...</li>
    <li> I really liked the colors but it was a little pricey than what I wanted to pay but my daughter was going to the prom and I end up using it afterwards</li>
    <li> i like this palette because of the matte texture and the colors are blendable. perfect for those who like natural eyelook.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ممتازة صراحة</li>
    <li> I was waiting eagerly for a chance to buy this palette and purchased it immediately when I saw it on the Sephora website (for $44 there and at Ulta and Tarte websites). Since I&#x27;m a pure Tartelette through and through I have several other Tarte eyeshadow palettes already. That being said, this is the first truly neutral matte palette by Tarte that I own and I am extremely pleased with it. The colors are highly pigmented and buildable. The first and last rows are brown tones, and the middle line is pink/purplish-brown/mauve rows. There is a helpful card enclosed showing how to apply two of the color lines for different looks. The compact is beautiful and includes a mirror, always a nice bonus. It&#x27;s small enough to carry in your purse or a travel bag. Love it!</li>
    <li> There are a few colors in which the color payout is not that great but luckily it is only the lights ones. The entire right side of the palette however, is another story. That black though! Those darker colors are well pigmented and are easily blendable. I gave it a 3 because of the colors don&#x27;t produce much pigment (the light colors).</li>
    <li> I debated this palette for awhile, I wanted an all matte shadow look but wasn&#x27;t sure if this or the Naked basic palette would be best. After seeing both in person, this won me over for a few reasons, the most important being the eyeshadow shades were varied, smooth and creamy. I have zero problems with the pigment, in fact I was surprised at how great the color payoff is.&lt;br /&gt;The shades are varied enough, but without being overwhelming. Definitely worth the addition to my routine!</li>
    <li> This pallette is hands down the best palette I have ever owned! There is not one thing that I dislike about this pallette. The shades are neutral yet versatile at the same time, you can apply with a light hand for a great day time look or apply a bit heavier and smoke it out for an evening look. All of the shadows are matte and have very fun empowering names which I love! They all blend seamlessly and have excellent pigmentation. I think this is a staple in anyone&#x27;s makeup routine.</li>
    <li> One of the must have platte</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! The colors are gorgeous, blendable, and matte. I love the formula. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, even if you&#x27;re just starting out with eyeshadow. This pallette makes it SO easy to put together a beautiful, classy look!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real pallet because the real one cost $44 always has and will... Also tarts doesn&#x27;t sell through Amazon</li>
    <li> Love the idea of these colors all in &amp;#34;Matte&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this palette! The colors are lovely, they blend well and seem very pigmented. It&#x27;s my first tarte product but definitely not my last.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, elegant palette. It&#x27;s everything I expected and more. Very versatile and great color selection.</li>
