<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just received my order, I bought them for my husband. They do not work for crap. Def a waste of money wish I could return them</li>
    <li> They are really great..</li>
    <li> I tried another brand first and was hoping this one would be more real-looking. They are, but they are much more difficult to fit...at least for my needs. There is a shelf on the back that your own teeth rest on, but it actually gets in the way for mine and makes this device sit lower and pushes my lip outward, creating more of a hillbilly look. Also, the impression material doesn&#x27;t adhere well to this one for the fitting process.</li>
    <li> Received the item broken in half in the package. Was marked large but appeared to be very small. They are a rigid design, so if it doesn&#x27;t fit, you can&#x27;t make it fit. I returned these and purchased Imako Cosmetic Teeth® Novelty Smile Overlay-Size: Large-Color: Natural, which worked perfectly and are flexible, so they will fit anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the dumbest thing ever! Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
    <li> as soon as I put the mold to my mouth it stocked to my teeth within a second.  I thought I was going to have to go to the ER, I just had to suffer a burnt mouth with blisters thanks</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! THEY DON&#x27;T WORK. BUY IMAKO IF YOU WANT A GOOD TEMPORARY PAIR OF COSMETICS!</li>
    <li> Tooooooooo fun! Thank you!</li>
    <li> They were not made the way I thought they would be so I was dissappointed.I do like the way they look but I cannot get the pearls that came with them hot enough to stick and hold anything. Tried using regular denture cream but it doesn&#x27;t hold well enough either. I would NOT recommend this item.</li>
    <li> These teeth are not even quality enough to be called, \\&quot;Costume teeth\\&quot;. Which is what they are called at eBay, where they&#x27;re sold for as little as $24.95. That would make them 24.00 too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re the cheapest crap you can buy. They aren&#x27;t meant to be worn while eating or drinking. There&#x27;s a reason for that! They&#x27;ll not last you a month, if you wear them ever other day. If you wear them every day, you&#x27;ll be done in a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the worst thing I have ever seen. I mean, there were costume teeth at Dollar Tree, right before Halloween that were better quality than these! I am NOT kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spend your money on these, when you get them you&#x27;ll be ticked off.&lt;br /&gt;These are so bad, and the \\&quot;Secure Smile\\&quot; company knows this, that their channel at You Tube features the typical \\&quot;How To\\&quot; apply them video, that&#x27;s also at the official Secure Smile website, where they now try to tell people these teeth are so popular they won&#x27;t be restocked until December (because the company family is on vacation! Not because they&#x27;re sold out, because they&#x27;re so dang popular), that ALL comments about the Secure Smile product advertised at you Tube have to be approved before they appear in print!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s because if you were free to comment, and you bought these, you would tell everyone what garbage they are before the Secure Smile channel owner could delete the comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save the money you&#x27;d spend on these, even if they were two cents plus shipping, and go to a dentist. Or research on line how to replace a missing tooth. But whatever you do, don&#x27;t fall for this crap! They aren&#x27;t fit to fit over your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re like baby teeth, they&#x27;re so small and unrealistic looking.&lt;br /&gt;RUN! Do not walk to a Dentist. But do not buy this garbage and make someone rich who knows they&#x27;re selling a rip off product.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why Secure Smile&#x27;s official site return policy is a double rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your appearance, your self worth, your hard earned money deserves BETTER than being wasted on this product!&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package and I could not believe my eyes! This product is the literal example of that old adage. A fool and their money soon part!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read this review, and don&#x27;t be a fool. DO NOT BUY THIS worthless waste of money!on this product!   I opened the package and I could not believe my eyes! This product is the literal example of that old adage. A fool and their money soon part!    Read this review, and don&#x27;t be a fool. DO NOT BUY THIS worthless waste of money!</li>
    <li> Secure Smile is a dental prosthesis that is more durable that Imaku, and looks more realistic.  It is very fragile and hard to fit correctly.  The teeth, even though stated \\&quot;small to medium\\&quot; are really quite large!  The company needs to make a much smaller version so we who buy this product don&#x27;t look like horses! However, it seems to be the best low cost option for cosmetic teeth available...</li>
    <li> could have made better</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY THANK  YOU</li>
    <li> This is a JOKE! Thew them in the trash. Made me look like a horse with fake teeth.....terrible. All i could do is laugh. Even my children laughed at me for putting them on.</li>
    <li> I am usually skeptical when I read bad reviews. With this one, it is right on the money! I have a medium sized mouth and teeth and the Secure Smile looked ridiculous! I seriously felt like I was in Deliverance! I can hardly talk...completely sounds garbled like I have a mouthful of food. I also seen someone comment about the color...I am a smoker so my teeth are not sparkling white. These made my real teeth looks like I just got done with a bleaching! No lie, they are like a brownish yellow. I agree, they do look like Austin Powers teeth, that not being a compliment. I did not feel \\&quot;secure\\&quot; with my \\&quot;smile\\&quot; like the name implies, the actual only thing I am secure about with this product is that it was a complete disappointment and a waste of money. I am glad Amazon has this listed as a toy, because that is the only category I can see it under, or novelty/gag gifts.</li>
    <li> its good when you don&#x27;t have teeth only kidding</li>
    <li> Good puduct for missing or messed up teeth;thankyou  bobby</li>
    <li> So riducuous.  Do not look like real teeth at all.  They make you lisp when you talk and stick out so much it looks like you have buck teeth ( and I bought the small size).  They do not stay in either.  What a waste of $</li>
    <li> A WAIST OF TIME &amp; MONEY... PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE OR YOU&#x27;LL BE SORRY LATER !!!</li>
    <li> These are NOT secure smile! They are some cheap costume teeth that are awful!  Returning g the.  Asap!</li>
    <li> They were a joke. It&#x27;s false advertisement. These are not meant to &amp;#34;make your smile better&amp;#34; these are costume teeth for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Too small do not waste your money.They also broke.</li>
    <li> The fix wasn&#x27;t right they where to Big&lt;br /&gt;I order small and got medium ..</li>
    <li> Ridiculous to think this product is even passable.They are big and bulky and you cannot even close your mouth with them in! They do not give at all, they are hard plastic! Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I did not like these at all.  Just as one reviewer said-too big and goofy looking.  I should have believed her.</li>
    <li> If u have teeth but they are rotten  or chipped this is not product for you. It will fit over your teeth but you will look like a horse  and it would be very uncomfortable. If u have no teeth or missing teeth then this product is for you. I have three missing front teeth on the left side of my mouth . So I cut this denture with a sharp knife down the middle to just put in the half that I needed . Because  like I said this denture doesn&#x27;t fit well over real teeth . After I put the half denture in to replace the missing teeth that I needed it looked much better . It blends well with my real teeth.</li>
    <li> The product should of stated child size or small something to state what the size it was.  I was so surprised at the size. What a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> next time make sure people know what size and for what age it would be for.</li>
    <li> this item was very cheap I molded it then it shrank soon after  and it would not stay in place plus it sticks out super far.  the gums also was short so my gums  also show. would be a good item  for a younger kid.</li>
    <li> First read that these are fake!!! lol really people nothing you would want to put into your mouth, they do not fit, they are huge, they are hard fake plastic!!! I would not use them for Halloween even truly speaking they fall out easy very easy. But take my advice and do not  waste your MONEY !! I really hope this help someone here, I have  tried the beads, they are ok but hard to form as a real tooth like,they melt in hot water and harden really fast to fast I think not enough time to form them into a tooth like shape, I wish you all luck, I say go get your teeth fix from a dentist that your are guaranteed good work and real looking if not better results! PS these teeth make you look silly they stick way way out of your mouth fall out they look stupid and feel nasty in my mouth WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY &amp; TIME!!  Speaking the truth..</li>
    <li> I love these teeth. I have bought 2 of them for me and have  helped fit friends purchase who could&#x27;nt believe they were under 20 dollars. I do think that bad reviews come from people who expect to much or just can&#x27;t get the fitting right. I admit I am better at fitting now and do it slightly different than the directions. A couple hints. Use a utility knife and enlarge the holes in the bottom under the fitting tray. Carefully create a partial cone wider at the bottom leave as is on the top tray. A round dove tail. This causes the hardened fitting material to hold tighter. Do the initial fit with the teeth warmed and no fitting material. Then heat the beads and form a snake the length of the teeth. Press the snake into the tray of the teeth. Take your time. Reheat the whole teeth and fitted beads if needed to get the snake well press to the tray. Press above and under the tray to make sure the dovetailed holes are filled and any excess is flattened around holes on bottom. Reheat the appliance, it doesn&#x27;t need to be boiling but should be very warm and flexible. Align center of appliance with lip center and press hard to your teeth and gumline. Press hard all around your natural curves  I also recommend pushing up hard  on gum part while pushing the bottom of  teeth  inward, especially  on sides, for 30  seconds. Remove and wait a bit. It should fit nicely. If not reheat, repress fitting material into tray and reheat and fit again. Don&#x27;t worry you can refit a number of times. I promise you that once you get a easy and proper fit, no matter your negative thoughts on how the appliance looks. No one will know your wearing it. Your self consciousness will go away with time. I do suppose a very small or very large mouth could be an exception. I soak mine nightly in a very very light bleach and water solution to remove stains. My current upper is a year and a half old and doing well. And no you can&#x27;t eat with them.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> When I first got these teeth, I did not spend a lot of time fitting them, just about 10 minutes.  They were very big and insanely difficult to talk in, eat, or even close my mouth.  After a few days of wearing them, better but still difficult.  Then I began reading some reviews and people saying that they filed and spent a long time to fit their teeth.  So after about two hours of filing and fitting, they were a lot better.  I can close my mouth, talk, and eat soft foods.  You have to be patient fitting them.  I am 20 years old, and an actress/model.  I have spacing and slightly crooked teeth, as well as a missing tooth which I normally wear a flipper for. To be honest they do look a little fake.  I can&#x27;t say that they look super natural, but they look much better than my natural smile and they work great for the camera.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Too thick talk like you have a lisp</li>
    <li> I had ordered this same(supposedly) product just from a different company. The description needs to be better,when selling. The package clearly defines the difference in the product, but the company I bought it from did not. I still have both products, and package if you want to see what I am talking about.The first one is better made, the packages are clearly marked, small to med and one size fits all. The company should check into their description practices for the products they are selling.</li>
    <li> First off I want to say that I am a real person - not a paid actor or tied with this company in any way shape or form even though it may sound like it in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome. And I will tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from bone loss in my jaw/teeth, it is a hereditary condition. I also suffer with bad gums due to this condition. When one of my teeth starts to get loose I know its only a matter of time before the gums start to recede and reject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started losing teeth within the past 4 years, there is nothing that the doctors or dentists can do about it besides evasive surgery and false implants. I refuse to go this route while I have some teeth left to anchor something in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By happen-chance after losing two of my front teeth (showing my obvious condition) I stumbled onto IMAKO teeth - and gave it a try.. Looked kind of good although it also gave a thin-tooth appearance because there is no molding to the shape of the teeth.. The teeth also started to yellow very badly, and the manufacturer even states that it will discolor through exposure to sunlight. I was also very dis-satisfied because I could not eat even soft foods with them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then found these teeth - and tried almost all the different styles (this one , which is small to medium, being the best looking and fitting). There is a medium to large - and provides a little more spacing between the teeth. It may look good on some people, but not on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectations were actually exceeded after I finally got the teeth to mold and anchor in comfortably to my existing teeth. But there is a drawback, so for anyone reading this please note the following. If you intend to try and eat and drink with these in, there is not enough molding pellets which come with the teeth to give you enough filler to eat without fear of breaking the teeth or it being uncomfortable. Do yourself a favor and buy a container of \\&quot;InstaMorph\\&quot; molding pellets, also found on Amazon. You can use both together, but I wouldnt use too much - perhaps measure out an equal second of what comes with the teeth. Do the molding process just as the instructions that come with the teeth tell you to do and use the extra molding material to strengthen up the empty spaces where your teeth are missing, and any gaps between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all , you will want to make more of a mold around your teeth and not just in between them.. Do not get discouraged, it took me about 20 attempts to heat and cool the molding to get a really comfortable fit, and also one that I could slide out of my mouth comfortably with a little effort. Its worth it once you get the proper fit and arc in your mouth..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOONE can tell that my teeth are not real, co workers ask me if I have had work done on my teeth and my answer is an honest - yes. They think it looks really good, and think it&#x27;s real&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are confronted with a situation of eating with the teeth.. pick softer foods, do not try to chew a steak up - believe me, it doesnt work very well and can get painful.. Always let your food cool a little before biting into it - if the molding starts feeling a little soft or gel-like, swish some cold water over them and wait a little longer until the food cools more. The same needs to apply for liquids - warm is ok, hot is a nono unless you want the teeth to move out of place, dislodge, or have the moldable plastic hanging down in your mouth (not a pretty sight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After eating, take a trip to the bathroom - remove the teeth and rinse out any debris under the sink with lukewarm or cold water (again, dont heat them up). Also rinse out your mouth because food left in your gums or between teeth will start getting painful after a while and you will have to take them out again. Do your refitting in the bathroom by the sink, because you can if necessary heat the molding up a little if there is plastic showing anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these teeth are absolutely wonderful - brush them normally and rinse them with mouthwash. If the molding starts getting to be dirty looking, and you bought what I suggested, the InstaMorph - you can remove the old molding and replace it with new molding any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keep smiling, you deserve it :) :) :) :)/&gt;~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these teeth are absolutely wonderful - brush them normally and rinse them with mouthwash.

    <li> gum line is too short.</li>
    <li> Here is the complete truth about Secure Smile AND Imako cosmetic teeth---I have tried them both. Unless you are missing all of your front teeth, or your teeth are tiny like a baby&#x27;s teeth, both of these products will protrude and make you look like a horse, and they feel like the plastic fangs you wear as part of a vampire costume on Halloween. They BOTH protrude and make it difficult to close your mouth and talk, and will give you a profile like a chimpanzee. No amount of filing and sanding will help this problem. Don&#x27;t believe it when they tell you that you will get used to them...you won&#x27;t they feel horrible in your mouth and cause drooling.&lt;br /&gt;The thermal fitting beads (when molded to your teeth and cooled) will either make your remaining teeth ache by forcing your them to move because of pressure (as they did to me) or will not hold and the teeth will fall out constantly. In reality, You CANNOT eat or drink with them, because they fall out and could cause the danger of choking. I&#x27;ve tried them both and wasted a lot of money and aggravation for nothing....Just keep saving your money until you can get real teeth custom made by your dentist. Ask him/her to give you a monthly payment plan and he/she will most likely do it for you if you have no insurance (like me). Both of these \\&quot;cosmetic teeth\\&quot; are jokes and people do notice when you wear them because they truly look like kid&#x27;s Halloween joke teeth. I bet George Washington&#x27;s wooden teeth were better than these rip-offs. Do not buy them, they are terrible! Sorry, but that is the complete truth...</li>
    <li> Nope this didnt work for me at all, too thick, lip on bottom in the way, they do look like horse teeth unless u naturally have a large mouth then maybe u can make them work for u</li>
    <li> The product was shipped very quickly.  The product is extremely realistic looking. It matched my teeth perfectly.  It takes a bit of work to get the proper mold to my mouth but when it fits it looks really good. I have had a huge gap and crooked teeth my  whole life and being able to smile confidently again is truly wonderful.  However, the teeth do not stay in your mouth.  If you are thinking about purchasing the product you should add the Secure Smile Adhesive to your cart.  Without the adhesive it is hard to keep them in your mouth without falling out.  Overall the Secure Smile exceeded my expectations and I look forward to taking more beautiful pictures with my new smile.</li>
    <li> The teeth look and work good. However the MFG does not provide enough material to get a tight fit. I had to buy extra beads  and use two bags to get a tight fit.  Still a good product, just need more beads in the first shipment.</li>
    <li> It nearly got stuck in my mouth! Plus it sticks out way too far. The teeth are yellow and the gums look diseased!</li>
    <li> Functions as stated.  I am very happy</li>
    <li> These broke removing them from the package.The company I ordered from on Amazon, wouldn&#x27;t even answer my email. So, that was 16 wasted dollars plus shipping.  I ordered another set off Amazon from the REAL company that distributes these.( you can look them up at their website)  Even though they looked much better than the original set, they were made just as poorly as these knock offs. These have a set of 4 small holes drilled in them,and a little ridge that fits under your teeth. If you don&#x27;t mind looking like a horse, these would be fine. I purchased the recommended beads for fitting and used them as directed. The 2nd set of teeth broke while being shaped to fit the mouth. One of the places where the little holes are drilled in the back just cracked and then broke completely in half after hardening again. I also tried the Imako brand, which fit perfectly and looked real and were easily fitted to be perfect,but look SO yellow, like you smoke 6 packs a day. These are fragile, impossible to fit unless you have only a few teeth on the side. There is no way to fit these over your real teeth without them sticking out. Save your money and get a snap on smile set for 1800.00 if you have real tooth problems. If using for fun go with Imako. At least you won&#x27;t look like a horse in your costume.</li>
    <li> Way to big for me. Just wish it was a little smaller to fit my teeth, because it made me buck tooth looking. However excellent product and service! Came quick and was easy to use.</li>
    <li> Hard to get to stay hard to mold to fit they broke and cannot use them would like replacement hoping not all are like this</li>
    <li> Plastic is not moldable, it is thick and not realistic looking!</li>
    <li> it was very difficult for me to mold and adjust my Husband said the look like horse teeth lol and they poked out my top lip alot  I might have ordered a size too big (I ordered the medium size)</li>
    <li> love them!! they look like my own &amp; fit perfectly!!....</li>
    <li> I was told these were thick so i bought a dremel tool to sand down the back. It helped a little. The shelf on the back had to come off and they looked like a huge over bite when in...i really don&#x27;t  like them. I bo8ght the because i had a frint tooth brake and wanted to cover it untill i could get it fixed. I had better luck peeling the poly plastic off the back (the white pearls) and molding a single tooth out of that.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to look semi real but it was very bad paint job. Planned to use as a temporary fix until getting to dentist. They looked too thick to be remotely comfortable.  We didn&#x27;t open them just sent them back for a refund.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste the time or money.  I&#x27;m tempted to try the Imako false cosmetic teeth however a little weary to have the same outcome.d</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I found and ordered this product, but so disappointed when I received it. I ordered these b/c I have really bad top teeth and I just don&#x27;t have the money to see a dentist right now. I thought that I would be on my way to feeling a little bit more comfortable about smiling but I was sadly mistaken. To start, the teeth and gums are pretty oversized and the gumline is way too low especially inbetween the two front teeth. They also are not a \\&quot;natural white\\&quot; but closer to the yellowish side and they are just overall thick, uncomfortable, don&#x27;t mold to your teeth well and look just plain out ridiculous. In short I found nothing positive at all about this product, very far from a \\&quot;perfect movie star smile\\&quot; as it claims to be. The only thing I can see these MAYBE being useful for is on halloween if you want to dress up as Austin Powers. Complete WASTE of time and more importantly money.</li>
    <li> Terrible product this is a joke unless ubhave no teeth in your mouth at all and they look crooked and very bulky dont bother if your liking for a temporary cosmetic fix or something this is like for Halloween or something</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I worked with the fitting beads so it wouldn&#x27;t affect my speech. But very comfortable to wear secure fit..the instructions need to be bigger print and more detail so people understand the product.</li>
    <li> The item was to small for my teeth</li>
    <li> They are pretty, but you can tell at least with me that they are fake! I do like the shape better than the secure smile, the bottom piece is great and helps keep it in place, I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it, I have horrible teeth and this is my way to feel better about them while I get the work done! They are kinda large, thinking since I naturally have large teeth, they are more longer than actually bigger!</li>
    <li> This product was horrible. It arrived in a small package. And was not able to use right away. had to file and file some more and still did not work. definite waste of money. Wish i would have listen to the reviews.</li>
    <li> do not buy this! if you want to look like Mr. ed, than fine. they look horrible and are a waste of money. no one would go out in public with them! i threw mine away and bought the other brand  thats a few dollars more but is wearable and you do not look like walking joke.</li>
    <li> Prior to getting this product, I was using the Imako cosmetic teeth. They were OK but they stained easily and were difficult to fit due to their flimsy material. I am missing bicuspids and incisors now. I knew I could not get another shell as they would be harder to fit this time around.    After seeing a comparison of Imako and Secure Smile, I was convinced to give this a try. The results are amazing! The instructions were perspicuous and detailed. The durability of this product allowed me to fit this within 10 minutes.     I read a bad review about the thermoplastic not sticking so I filed down the back to roughen the surface before using the fitting material. I am somewhat mechanically inclined so I found this process to be simple. If you are impatient, or not willing to put in the effort it requires to do your own fitting, this product is not for you.     The color of the teeth are as realistic as it gets! These look better than dentures I have seen out there. This product is comfortable too, they feel like real teeth. This item should not be listed as a toy, by comparison and experience, I can say the Imako is.    Shipping was faster than expected, I ordered this on Wednesday afternoon and they arrived here on Friday (California to Florida within 48 hours!) WOW! Thanks for proficient and timely service!    I would highly recommend this \\&quot;Modern Day MIRACLE\\&quot; to anyone who feels guilt or shame with the appearance of their teeth. You do not have to spend a fortune at the dentist office to have that Hollywood smile! This was money well spent and I will be looking forward to doing business with this retailer again!     Thank you Dr. Baily! You have given me a reason to SMILE!</li>
    <li> Teeth look like dentures, maybe good for someone without any teeth. I ordered for pageant use &amp; they are not wearable because they look too unrealistic</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with them</li>
    <li> WASTED MY MONEY TOO BIG AND BULKY.</li>
    <li> Yes, it requires some effort and patience to get these to work, but they do work great.  I&#x27;ve been using these for about 6 months now and am about to order my third. I wear them every day and eat with them on many occasions and they hold up well.  The first one started to crack down the middle from all the wear and tear.  My second one is holding up, but I&#x27;m worried that the same will happen soon.  Plus I sometimes drink coffee with these on and they definitely have yellowed some.  It&#x27;s true that these are not pearl white when you get them, but they seemed to have a natural look to them to me.  A big improvement from what I look like right now without them as I save up to get my dental work completed.  My first one was a large and I took other reviewers advice and got the small on the second order and was happier with the fit and look of the small, so I would recommend the same for most people.</li>
    <li> Just received this item and I&#x27;m not impressed. They&#x27;re only made for the facial structure of a larger male . If you&#x27;re on the thin side, don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money. It will give you a severe overbite, unless that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for. I was excited at first, but sadly dissapointed after I tried them. Oh, and they broke within 15 mins. Great.</li>
    <li> Even after filing, the device still appears like &#x27;buck teeth&#x27; &amp; will not stay secure even with denture adhesive while talking/drinking/etc.</li>
    <li> They suck. Broke in half the second day.Very fake looking. They are impossible to get them to fit in your mouth naturally. Would not recommend to anyone. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> its really hard to apply and it looks like horse teeth .....total waste of money</li>
    <li> This is not designed to put in your mouth, it&#x27;s hard plastic and overall can cause a lot of pain even when in for a few minutes. It looks nothing like a real set of teeth. Novelty is the keyword here.</li>
    <li> The three times I purchased these teeth on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, they arrived broken into three or four pieces. I think it&#x27;s time the company realized their packaging is not protecting a fragile product.</li>
    <li> if you are missing your teeth on top and can&#x27;t afford dentures these are great. the color looks good and if you use denture cream they stay in real good. you can drink with these and eat soft foods, and soups, and drinks. can&#x27;t eat hard foods, or something real chewy with these. but over all they are great. better than imako. don&#x27;t waste your money on the imako one&#x27;s because they are rubbery and worthless. and even the natural color of the imako are way too white so they look so phoney.&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps</li>
    <li> The teeth will help if you are between seeking cosmetic dentistry and do not have the immediate funds or insurance to cover the procedure. You cannot wear these teeth all the time, nor while you eat. The teeth causes your mouth to protrude slightly, yet they do look real in your mouth. The best bet is to save about 800.00 dollars and buy snap on teeth, but be careful they can break. I also would recommend imako teeth that is sold on Amazon they are flatter and mouth friendly. good luck</li>
    <li> Now I can smile all the time! Just kidding! But it&#x27;s sure fun messing with people,they look so taken back and shocked, so realistic!</li>
    <li> this is not a permanent fix but is damn better than having a missing tooth. you need to work with it and to be honest they look better than other products. take the bottom lip of and work with it shaving and moulding until you are happy and they look just fine.  if you do it right you can even use them to eat small bites it does discolor however but a bit of bleach will get them back to looking like the first day you got them.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a good cheap product that does its job if you willing to work a bit with it!</li>
    <li> OMG they are fake as can be. Extremely hard to talk I ordered them so I would not have a missing front tooth on our wedding day.  It will be good enough for the pictures but that&#x27;s all these are good for I got size small and they are still too big!?! The teeth don&#x27;t mold so well but the fitting beeds  do but that doesn&#x27;t help to make it look any better</li>
    <li> The first time I tried to fit the product I followed direction exactly and when I was shaping the product to fit my own mouth the the whole assembly snapped in two while cooling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other products simuliar to this one that worked great! I just lost them one day. so when looking saw these others for cheaper and figured how bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. When I submitted the refund/return of the product the company informed me that health products cannot be returned.  The product is listed as COSMETIC NOVELTY teeth. Not health. But they list it in the heath section to avoid having to refund anyones money.</li>
    <li> Was not looking to use as a novelty or toy.  Very realistic looking - much better than another product I had purchased much earlier.  Had a problem with the \\&quot;ledge\\&quot; but was able to resolve.  Overall a very good product for the cost.</li>
    <li> I was very,very disappointed! I ordered them with the &amp;#34; recieve by Monday &amp;#34; if ordered by a certain time, but the next day,&lt;br /&gt;I got an email notification of a &amp;#34; Shipping Delay.&amp;#34; The item got to me a day later. Regardless, when I opened the mailing carton they were cracked in 3 places. Furthermore, the photo is very, very misleading. The actual product dosen&#x27;t look anything like the picture. I never even opened the package. It&#x27;s going back to the company! This is not a good item for Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it this time as my shipment of the product was broke in half now I got to pack it up and send it back and wait somore time whoever did the packing had to of done it with their eyes closed I&#x27; going to try it again one more time and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;  Charlene Dickmann</li>
    <li> I currently have a missing front tooth and can&#x27;t afford any dental work so I usually warm this product with warm water and cut out a tooth that matches my others in size where mine is missing, file the sides for a better fit and use an oral adhesive to keep it in place. It looks as if it were real.</li>
    <li> Got this to wear for some pics I was taking as I did not like the way my own looked.  These are made for men even the small size it was so dissapoining that they would not fit no matter what I trried. I would never recomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> too big does not fit well</li>
    <li> I pulled the item from package and it broke in my hand, I glued it back together but it is not holding up as well as I thought</li>
    <li> Saw it, was curious about it, read reviews and trusted them.  I bought them to see what they were like face to face.</li>
    <li> These teeth look great in the package but in your mouth that&#x27;s a whole different story. First the gums need to be higher because when you smile you can see the top of the dentures. Second the gum color needs to be a lighter shade of pink to match your gums. And....the teeth are to thick even after filing, it looks like you have a major over bite. Plus its hard to close your lips over the teeth. And you can&#x27;t talk normal. Its a big thumbs down for me.</li>
    <li> There was no way to secure the teeth so you could smile. I ordered this for Halloween, the first set came broken, the second set didn&#x27;t make it to the location on time and the 3rd set didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll never buy from this co. again. It was a test run for a school.</li>
    <li> It came broken into two pieces</li>
    <li> A mess , not what it is stated to be or advistied to be item was returned , no stars from me.</li>
    <li> one of the sets,cant remember which one,made me look like I had a horse mouth, wouldnt bend to fit or the mold wouldnt grasp a place in gap in teeth where they wouldnt indent in place where teeth was gapped and missing as to supposedly be what holds the teeth to &amp;#34;snap back in&amp;#34; ....as it DEFINITELY DIDNT DO.waste of money and directions are way off as far as clearly explaining each step</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as it claims.  ordered a medium...got a small. NOT at all happy with this buying experience</li>
    <li> What a joke! Unbeleleivable! DON&amp;#34;T BUY Unless you want to look like a  monster from a  bad 1950&#x27;s Horror Movie .&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t stay in your mouth, they jut, look like a huge overbite and ugly as hell. THey broke into pieces after the third attempt to make them fit. I have veneers that I paid over $1000.00 for and they got chewed by my Saint Bernard, so I needed something temporarily until my new vaneers were ready, I ended up getting a mask from my physician and pretended to have the flue until my new teeth, professionally made were ready. So don&#x27;t buy these , your throwing your $$ away if you do, buy a box of masks and save for a set made by a real dentist...Understand?</li>
    <li> I bought a upper for me and upper and lower for my husband. They were easy to fit and performed just like advertised. We received the products in a timely manner too.  Unfortunately, they just didnt work with my mouth like they did with my husband.  My husband looks like a brand new man.  But with me, I just look stupid and bucktoothed. They were too big for my mouth and even though I refitted a couple of times, they were just too big to look good.  My husband has not stopped smiling since he put his in!  Im so happy for him that we found this product.  He feels so much better about himself.</li>
    <li> Great teeth for my grandma,she look younger whenever she smile</li>
    <li> I bought these teeth knowing that I would have to modify them.  I sanded the lip off and then sanded the teeth back until it was very thin because I still have front teeth and the added thickness was too much.  I don&#x27;t use the beads at all and found that denture adhesive strips work amazingly.  With modifications these are wonderful and exactly what I thought they would be.  I don&#x27;t have to lisp or anything because nothing is touching the roof of my mouth.  It takes some getting used to but I mean come on...  You have teeth glued to your teeth.  It&#x27;s expected.  I feel that they do stick out of little but again.  It&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> I can understand why these secure smile teeth are labelled as a \\&quot;novelty\\&quot;  They would be absolutely wonderful if you were attending a halloween costume party as an equine!! They are HUGE to say the least.  I would rather stay missing a tooth than wear these.  Even after filing off the ledge and trying to refit, the results were no better.  They look natural and realistic until you place them in your mouth--they are bulky, uncomfortable and most definitely unattractive.  Bottom line, save your money unless you are looking for a good laugh at your own expense</li>
    <li> Cheep plastic teeth held on with wax. They don&#x27;t even stay on. Stick with your money and don&#x27;t buy these, then you won&#x27;t be stuck with teeth that don&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> First of all these teeth are a diamond in the rough meaning they are huge and cumbersome when you first open them.  but after a few hours of fileing down and fitting after fitting they finally look very real. I filed them down to be very thin and I completely took the shelf off.  I did not use the molding plastic, instead I use fixodent paste.</li>
    <li> I only got the  top going to get the bottoms because I have no teeth at the top and with the easy instructions they look great I recommend you to try them what can you lose great price and good alternative to getting real dentures which a lot of us can&#x27;t afford.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your $$.  Unless you have a  huge mouth these won&#x27;t fit you and you will look like Mr. Ed.  wonder why this company makes teeth so big they would fit a horse&#x27;s mouth?  I got a pair and they broke into 3 pieces even after soaking them as the directions said in hot water.  I tried the competitor, Imako, and they do not look as good but they work and aren&#x27;t bad.  Secure Smile stinks.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> This was a rip off.  This product did not do what it was advertised to do.  what a joke this product is</li>
    <li> Secure Smile &amp; Instant Smile Are the Same product as are Dr. Baileys Instant Smile Teeth. These are all the same &amp;as far as I know were first marketed by &amp;#34;Billy Bob&amp;#34; which also included &#x27;thermal shaping beads&#x27; which are now sold thru some sellers with the product &amp; I notice some without. OK now to split hairs, the difference if any, is the sizing. The &amp;#34;one Size&amp;#34; would be good for nearly everyone unless your mouth (for the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34;, is REALLY small as there is a 3/8 ths difference !&amp;iexcl;between both the length of the teeth, meaning each one, as well as the overall length of the entire ,&amp;#34; strip&amp;#34; of teeth). This product is FAR SUPERIOR IN LOOK compared to the &amp;#34;Imako&amp;#34; product, BUT you MUST KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM FIT CORRECTLY.  NOTE HERE: If you do take your time everyone will think you had implants done, with Imako the teeth are so Unnatural I hate to think of anyone wasting money &amp; looking So Fake it&#x27;s embarrassing. Back to the Original Secure/Instant veneer. The instructions and for some this may work, but I have Never used the &#x27;thermal beads&amp;#34; for anyone I have helped with their fitting. I have used this product for several of my patients over the past years (I am a Counselor) &amp; when one does not have the $ to have dental work done it can be awful. I use this method for fitting, remember the longer time you spend, like modeling clay, the better your result.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth are a strip with an extra &amp;#34;bridge&amp;#34; type thing on the back. They can be shaped to ANY position in warm/hot water. You need to have a file, like a craft one that can be purchased at a &amp;#34;Home Depot&amp;#34; or probably rt. here on Amazon. Costs about 15.00 at HDepot.  I have no use for the beads but rely on a polident type adhesive to keep them on when ready. THESE ARE NOT FOR EATING HARD THINGS WITH&lt;br /&gt;but when you become accustomed to wearing them there are tricks you find that will be helpful in knowing how far you can go with them and what you can/ can&#x27;t do.  You must first make the strip straight to remove the extra material from all around the strip. You can hold them under very hot tap water and VERY GENTLY bend them to straight. You will see where they are straining and at this point I recommend using a nail clipper or pair of scissors to clip part of that extra backing. YOUR GOAL IS TO GET THE &amp;#34;STRIP, straight and as thin as possible so when placed over your teeth, the strip will conform to your GUM LINE and cover your own teeth as closely as possible. This is why you need the file &amp;why it needs to be electric. You are removing ALL the extra pink material from the strip that does not Just cover your gums and all or any white &amp;#34; tooth&amp;#34;material that would make the strip too thick to wear without feeling like you have a foreign object in your mouth.  So, have an electric file, nail clippers, nail sissors, and water source as well as a polident type denture adhesive and Time. After you do one you will understand the process &amp; moving swiftly you can create a custom top in about an hour. Same for the bottom but I would not advise wearing top &amp; bottom together till you are ablr to REALLY SHAPE the veneer to fit like a glove over your own teeth. Also, if you plan to wear these every day you MUST make more than one because you are actually creating a VERY THIN STRIP which Will Wear out or break from wear over time. I have seen other reviews and there was one from a man that was very closre to this one. I have purchasrd the bottom strips as well and will write more there when I can.&lt;br /&gt;Remember: you WILL have to do work with them to get what you want but if you do it correctly, you will have great looking teeth, with a back-up so you are not left without when your first one wears out. About every three months if you take care of them and trrat them like Very Fragile dentures. Clean them every night remove all adhesive and remember they are as thin as can be so whateber you do, don&#x27;t drop them on a hard surface.  More later but this should let you know the basics and that the teeth take work from you. BUT THEY WORK.urface.  More later but this should let you know the basics and that the teeth take work from you. BUT THEY WORK.</li>
    <li> They were for a friend of mine they broke right when she had gotten them .be careful when trying to fit your mouth . They harden back up fast after boiled . but those beads it came with were a life saver she made her own . Lol</li>
    <li> They push out your front lip horribly and are obviously fake. I tried filling them down, and making them fit better and it didnt work! They broke within hours after getting them also.,</li>
    <li> Could be the cheapest online but you get a size that&#x27;s utterly useless.  There must be size choices and guidelines on what to buy.</li>
    <li> The mold beads is a pain.  I tried denture glue which was uncomfortable and pushed the teeth outward, complete mess, need one that can just snap onto regular teeth.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. First they are kinda yellow. Then they don&#x27;t fit a mouth that is medium more like only a small but they claim they&#x27;re medium. They&#x27;re too thick and the teeth are too short and small. Not worth it and hopefully I get my money back!</li>
    <li> No problems - love these.  They look great and if used as directed (for cosmetic purposes) they are swell.</li>
    <li> These are very flimsy and lightweight. I wasn&#x27;t expecting professional dentures, but I was hoping they might be a little better quality. I doubt they are going to fit either..</li>
    <li> These teeth suck the over bite that I have is redicuice and the thermal gel comes out of the teeth don&#x27;t ease it money</li>
    <li> I never had to write a disappointing review but this product was a waste of money. I followed directions carefully. When I took out of hot water after 1 minute times as directed and gently to mold two teeth cracked instantly. Geez. I threw in trash. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> Lol definitely a joke. you would probably have to reconstruct the entire thing. HAHAHA</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT LOVE THE CONVENIENCE OF IT A MUST TRY FOR THAT LOOK YOU WANT IN A FLASH !! !!</li>
    <li> Just had to shave/file down the lip in back. They&#x27;re probably best for people missing a couple front teeth. Other than that, you just have to be patient and work on them to your own fit and liking. If you do have to file down or file off that lip, polygrip would work best. Really good product and worth the money. The beads are GREAT if you just need to fill in a missing tooth or two. Temp tooth uses the same beads but for too much money. You can buy the beads separately from this shipper/maker. Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product I was not sure how they would look but after fitting them I was very pleased!! I am missing two front teeth on either side of my front two and was always embarrased to smile. After purchasing them I could not stop smiling. I do not know why they are called a toy because they worked well for hiding my ugly smile. I do recommend purchasing these teeth if you can not afford the Imako teeth. They did break right in the middle a couple of times but was easily fixed with super glue. Like I said, these are perfect if you need to smile again and can not afford something more expensive.</li>
    <li> this item is lucky to get one star! they came to me broken in half! so im trying another brand.</li>
    <li> broke in one week, waste of money.  Looks okay when wearing but very fragil materisl.  I will think teicevto buy again</li>
    <li> Great item thank you so much</li>
    <li> the only way that this will fit properly is if you have NO TOP TEETH. Just keep that in mind before you order this. If you are all gums then they may look pretty decent. That is all I have to say.</li>
    <li> First of all, the ad falsely leads you to believe it is the ACTUAL Secure Smile product, it is not. Second, the beads clumped together and stuck to the cup. Finally, the fit is horrible, and after paying for expedited shipping, it was still late arriving.</li>
    <li> this is the biggest waste of $16 ive ever spent it is so useless it sticks out of your mouth like a mouthpiece and looks extremely artificial and is very thick and you cant even speak correctly with these on im not sure why anyone would write a positive review about this</li>
    <li> Me personally I researched this product for almost a year. I looked through all the reviews, watched all the youtubevideos, and I honestly should have known better. I have a few small dental problems and was just trying to enhance my smile. I purchased the secure smile last week, my package arrived on time and looked great, what I pictured. Step1 of the fitting process has you to place the teeth in hot water to make the teeth mold the shape of your orginal teeth, Once I put the teeth in I noticed how large they were. They stuck out so far, and extended my lip in a very unnatural looking way. But having did my reasearch I knew there would be a filing process needed. Determined to finish the process I went on to step2 which is the fitting beads, they were a pain but worked as advertised. I waited 10-15 for the plastic to dry. It did make the exact mold of my teeth however when I went to place the teeth back in, the plastic wouldnt hold the secure smile, the teeth fell out but the plastic stayed stuck to my teeth. I tried to repeat the process 5 times and each time it got worse I even tried keeping the molding plastic in my mouth til it harden (WHICH WAS A BAD IDEA).. The platic once again became stuck to my teeth, but this time it was very hard to remove. I tried filing the teeth, which what to use, and how to file is not in the instructions(I had to look up online).. I filed and filed for over 2 hrs, each time I stopped I repeated the fitting process and each time it got worse, finally the teeth on the left side started to split. I then placed the fitting plastic in the crack and tried to fit again, the plastic filled the crack however, after all of the filing my lip was still stuck out, I couldnt talk, and the teeth were way to big and unrealisic. I finally decided to GIVE UP! If you have any questions about the teeth before you order please email me at ladyricantoo@yahoo.com I will be happy to answer any questions.By the way I dont think the size has anything to dowith it,I ordered the sml-med. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
    <li> This product is a little bit hard, to my grandma didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I rated it a 1 star because Item does not work as advertized, I do nor recommend this item to anyone if some need something like this I would recommend buying a better brand.</li>
    <li> Was broken in half when. Received. one star</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dissapointed in the product.</li>
    <li> Going  to a wedding.....wanted to cover the gap in my mouth.  I&#x27;m so disappointed about the color of the teeth that I&#x27;ve received. On their website the teeth are white; even on their color scale, number 8 looks white. Well the teeth that I received are beige...what the hell. These teeth are way darker than my nature teeth. I would not recommend this company to anyone.  I did not open my package but yet they want to charge restocking fee for their false advertisement of their product. I wish I would have checked the reviews before purchasing. There are so many negative reviews.  Lawsuit?</li>
    <li> They broke and didn&#x27;t fit. The thermal beads didn&#x27;t melt and they looked like horse teeth. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried every which way to get these to fit. They look pretty descent but the design sucks, needs more attention to the design.</li>
    <li> This item was not what I expected and I will be returning it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I put them in hot water. Waste of money. Wish I could give it no stars</li>
    <li> Teeth look awful would like to return but they have a no return policy</li>
    <li> Fits good until I can get my chipped tooth fixed. Had to file it down quite a bit because it is pretty thick. The gloss doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like but its ok.</li>
    <li> The teeth color was terrible&lt;br /&gt;I looked like I smoked two packs a day&lt;br /&gt;I thought they&#x27;d be whiter&lt;br /&gt;Why not?</li>
    <li> one size does not fit most , you have to have a really big mouth to fit them in and it doesnt look anything like it does on the picture</li>
    <li> So sorry that I made this move. They were nothing like I expected.They probably sit in the junk drawrer forever</li>
    <li> I had to order imako instead.  Too big, and very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend.I was very disappointed, looked too wierd.</li>
    <li> ok...I bought these as a temp fix till real work to my teeth was fixed...I will tell you...this product is what says it is...follow directions and will work as stated...they are nice and get the results you need...I enjoyed being told by people it was so nice to see my wonderful smile again...yes I recommend them for sure...but as I stated...follow directions enclosed!</li>
    <li> they came broke. and to small.and greyn in color . using for costume for Hollywood look, but thease are more for a scary look</li>
    <li> They would&#x27;ve been nice if they weren&#x27;t broken when they came in.</li>
    <li> too hard and hurt my mouth. was expecting something useful not Halloween costume quality. would not recommend cosmetic use. thank you</li>
    <li> Great product, very helpful for making smiles, and making happiness! Product arrived very fast, and just in time for our occasion. The product itself works great, and is just what we needed, and will continue needing.We will be back buying more for sure! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product does not serve any purpose, one could use this in a dummy or puppet  or art, but that is not the reason for this product so it is obsolete and junk. These are very small and would fit a toddler, but could not be given to a toddler or a child as a toy because they are VERY flimsy and narrow so a child could swallow these and CHOKE. I advise you not to waste your money on these and look else where and do not give to any child!</li>
    <li> These teeth just does not fit the mouth right. They make you look buck tooth. The teeth look ok while not in you mouth. But I just could not get them to work for me.</li>
    <li> First they came broken then i tried glueing them once that was fixed they were way to big and looked very fake what a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Awesome smile repair!  So grateful that I found these.  I had to go for over 6 months without being comfortable in public.  I have no money to purchase expensive dentures and had high hopes that these would change my life......and they have done exactly that.  I use them in my upper gum and even tho I have NO teeth at all they are secure in my mouth even without adhesive.  I had ordered the adhesive at the same time and will use it if I feel the need.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try them.  They look expensive when I smile.  Even better looking than the high priced dentures that a friend just got.  No one would even guess that I have no teeth and I&#x27;m feeling so good I&#x27;m wearing some makeup again!</li>
    <li> Got these when I chipped a bunch of teeth - spent days trying to make them fit using others tips.  Eventually followed a reviewers instructions on how to use InstaMorph on making temporary teeth and creating a complete arch tooth cover - which everyone thought I had gotten capped or bonded teeth.  And it only took me a few tries to use it - read the instamorph thermoplastic reviews for temporary tooth replacement.</li>
    <li> It did not fit. the pearls that were used to help them fit did not, there was nothing to help them cling on</li>
    <li> The teeth look realistic enough, but do not look good in your mouth. They hang too low and look goofy. They probably are made for people who have no teeth at all. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> its worth a try. i ordered monday afternoon, received them thursday morning. it works for some and not others. you MUST alter it to make it work for you. its not gonna fit u straight out the package. it comes very thick, so you have no choice but to want to file it. you do need to put some work into getting it to fit your mouth. it will give you an overbite. how much of an overbite depends on how much you file it down and customize it to your mouth. i bought fixodent and i didnt like the mess it left behind. i used the white beads that came with it and i prefer it because you can snap it in and out with no mess. i used a fingernail filer to file. using a small dremel is best though. the instructions say it only takes 5mins to prepare them. but thats only if it did actually fit your mouth, custom made, straight out the package. but since theyre not customized and you have to do it yourself, it may take anywhere from 20mins to hours before you can comfortably wear them. it took me 3hrs in total. it was about $13 when i bought them, so i didnt spend a whole lot so i didnt have my expectations so high. overall for $13 its worth buying. i wouldnt spend much more for these. if youre absolutely desperate its ok. when i close my mouth, it gives a hump thats not there when i don&#x27;t have them in. i have a little lisp when i talk. but ive only had them for a week now. i havent tried eating with them yet. they look realistic. they are about 2 shades lighter than my own teeth. theyre not ABSOLUTELY horrible and a complete waist of money like everyone says. i say give them a try. but be prepared to do a lot of filing. i hope i didnt forget anything. i just wanted to do a more detailed review of my experience. hope this helped someone.</li>
    <li> I love it and I&#x27;ll be ordering more. If you have more please hold three upper and three lower sets for me, thanks</li>
    <li> I decided there not what i was looking for but you get what you pay for , with that being said you decide</li>
    <li> They look real enough. The shelf on the back kept me from having decent fit, so I had to cut/sand it off. They also stuck out a little so sanding them to be thinner helped. There weren&#x27;t enough thermal beads to get a good impression &amp; &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; on my teeth. Suggestion is to buy extra thermal beads when purchasing this product. Overall, I would purchase again, I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to do so many modifications.</li>
    <li> First of all, these are not a toy. They are however, the absolute WORST \\&quot;teeth cover\\&quot; product I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing. They are so hard even after warming them, and there is no way on earth to have these in your mouth and be able smile, let alone talk or eat. I had high hopes for these, but were a huge disappointment.:-(</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.I was gonna get the snap on veneers for almost$2,000 until I discovered this great unit. Comfortable and they look great n real on me. I Will recommend it 100% to any1 who&#x27;s looking to purchase expensive veneers, just dont forget to buy dental adhesive:)Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> These are horrible they don&#x27;t fit at all. They deform the mouth and thermal beads don&#x27;t stick at to actual plate. So you can&#x27;t get a clean fit. Go with Imako they at least look real and can be fitted</li>
    <li> unless you are dressing up as a donkey...don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;They are not hallowed out to fit over your teeth (only the gum part is) therefore you end up with teeth over teeth, with the gum covering your own teeth. They looked rediculous!!!! And no matter how much fixadent or pellets you add, will not keep them in your mouth !!!!</li>
    <li> got her so fast and at a great price you guys are awesome!!!! i will def buy more you can bet on that!!</li>
    <li> The worse product EVER ordered online. I want credit ASAP for this purchase. Followed the instructions to a T and the product doesn&#x27;t work the way its described on the website and on the package. I need to know how and when I can expect a credit back. Terrible product and it shouldn&#x27;t be sold by Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy them waist of money mine snapped in half when I tried to put it in my mouth &amp; the teeth are like big things that look plastic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with it and the service that they gave me. I got it on time exactly what they said. Now for those people who don&#x27;t have teeths in front, I recommend this awesome teeth to you guys ;)</li>
    <li> It doesnt work as they said it will be</li>
    <li> The fitting beads didn&#x27;t work, made me look like a beaver, dont buy this</li>
    <li> awful  Total waste of money</li>
    <li> I chose it because it was affordable, had good reviews and when I saw it was decently natural colored for teeth I thought I would get it. not to mention free shipping at the time I got it. Not sure if that applies now but I would recommend it. Great fit if you mold the balls that shape the mold the right way on your teeth.</li>
    <li> This product does not work....they do not give&lt;br /&gt;Beads to secure it and it does not form the way&lt;br /&gt;They say it does....this is hardly even good&lt;br /&gt;Enough to be a toy....they should send all who purchase more&lt;br /&gt;Beads then maybe it might be worth 5$ shipped</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good substitute while I have working completed on my mouth.  Did not want to walk around with missing teeth, but they did not fit even when you readjust them.  Too much work for me. would not recommend</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product! Fitting was very easy. Unlike the Imako (which I think is horrible and was a total waste of my money) the Secure Smile is made from dental acrylic, so you must first heat the teeth and form to the curve of your own teeth, then apply the melted thermoplastic and do the final fit. Water MUST be heated just to the point of boing or you will not get proper melt and adhesion. Once fitted these teeth look great! Far more realistic than the Imako. Definitely much more attention to detail tooth shape and gum color, most likely because they were actually designed by a dentist. The acrylic doesn&#x27;t stain like the soft Imako material, and even thought you&#x27;re not really supposed to, I have eaten with the Secure Smile in place when a client asked me to lunch. I would never even consider it with the Imako. It is upsetting to see this product listed as a toy. I think the Secure Smile teeth are a serious product that can change your life, while the Imako definitely looks like a toy.</li>
    <li> These teeth aren&#x27;t toys.  They are a perfect alternative for a nice looking smile for people who have teeth problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These teeth are wonderful!  Very easy to use and fit.  You will have to spend a little bit of time working with them to get the perfect fit for your own mouth, but when you get it right you will know it by the feel.  The teeth and thermal beads are easily reheated over and over till you get the perfect fit with no problems at all.  Make sure the water is hot enough.  Follow the easy instructions and you should be very happy with these, especially if you have teeth problems.  The more you wear them the more comfortable they become.  It&#x27;s just getting use to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth and mouth are quite small so I had to actually file and sand these teeth down a bit to get a comfortable fit for myself.  That was very easy to do with a couple of artist files and 400 grit sandpaper.  You could probably use a fingernail file too.  I made them a bit thinner also to get a perfect comfortable fit for my mouth.  Just be careful not to get them too thin.  They are made of dental acrylic material which is very easy to work with if you do need to adjust them.  Filing worked best for me.  Just make sure that you only file and sand on the back of them and NEVER touch the front of these teeth as the front is perfect looking for real teeth and gums.  Once the front is scratched that will remain forever.  So be very careful.  I&#x27;m sure that it is not recommended to alter these teeth but I just wanted to say that it can be done if you need to... just be patient and very careful.  Make small adjustments at a time.  If you want to have a perfect smile again it will be well worth it.  Happy smiling to all who try.  I am so thrilled to be able to smile again.</li>
    <li> Thank you for prompt shipment!!! However the product was an epic fail for me :-(</li>
    <li> Threw mine in the garbage!!! They make your teeth look bucked! They don&#x27;t stay in and they don&#x27;t fit right even after following directions very carefully. Made for someone with no front teeth at all if you have any front teeth this set will make them stick out especially after you add beads and or the adhesive in the tube..tried both!  What a rip off!  Perhaps if you have a really large mouth and bigger lips but my lips couldn&#x27;t go over these teeth properly and they should mention that but they don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have an overbite or bucked teeth so what&#x27;s the reason? These companies should be ashamed! They make their money off of one time buyers!!! No one will be a repeat customer don&#x27;t believe their reviews they are hired to do those reviews!! Names are always the same and or they say the same generic lines!!!</li>
    <li> they looked like it was play teeth and did not fit and would not form to my mouth like it was suposed to...</li>
    <li> I love these teeth so much! I use them for taking pictures. I have very crooked, pushed back ugly teeth and when I smile, I look terrible. When I put these on and smile, I feel so beautiful. It gave me loads of confidence when I looked back at the pictures I had taken of myself because I look and feel attractive. 5 stars for me.</li>
    <li> These are joke teeth I get that but they simply are too much trouble getting them to fit right .that being said I&#x27;m not willing to put 2 hours into a joke.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY&lt;br /&gt;THEY DONT WORK LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD&lt;br /&gt;IM VERY UPSET WITH THIS&lt;br /&gt;I WASTED MY MONEY CUZ IT DOES NOT WORK LIKE IT SAYS IT DOES&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A JOKE THIS COMPANY IS</li>
    <li> Doesnt look remotely real and doesnt mold well to teeth. Broke in half after a few attempts to mold it. Biggest waste of money ever.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions, and sure enough  they fit. Took a look in the mirror and saw something that I haven&#x27;t seen in years. My smile. I could use alittle more of the thermal bead material, but they fit well enough.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the teeth were broken when I receive them, I was able to superglue them back together only to have them brake in another place so I&#x27;m not real happy with the product</li>
    <li> The product that showed up was not like the picture.  Plus it didn&#x27;t work....it wouldn&#x27;t work over my teeth like it suggested that it would....i was not happy with the product</li>
    <li> Got it for someone n when they put it on they look bad..personaly i didn&#x27;t like the way it looked. But its not a bad product</li>
    <li> I love them. I have had to replace them a few times because they did break but I use them everyday. I also bought 30 to 60 dollar ones from other site and they where the very same product !!!I have no front and use the Mold as well as Denture Bonding Cream and , Doing this they fit perfect. Of course I can not eat with them but if you take some time to work the mold just right and use the bonding cream they look great.</li>
    <li> have not try then yet will be trying then on this week in thank for asking that is very inportant to me.</li>
    <li> I got these a few months back and I was super excited, but when they came in I was in total let down. They did NOT work, they looked like fake teeth, something someone would wear on Halloween. I cried afterwards, as of now that was my last hope of being able to smile. I wouldn&#x27;t waist my money on theses.</li>
    <li> ok so i was so excited thinking that i can finally hide my two front teeth with this beautiful new false teeth. omg! the negative reviews were right on! i got it in the mail. i followed all the directions i even but the ridge underneath with a nailclipper because the ridge makes the teeth sit way to far out and no i do not have an over bite my teeth are perfectly straight and aligned. so even with that, i could not close my mouth! its cheap for a reason! so once i clipped the ridge, it still made me look as if i had the worst over bite in the world! the width is not wide enough to make them look natural AT ALL. I AM ABOUT TO ORDER THE IMAKO TEETH. ALTHOUGH THE TEXTURE OF THE TEETH IS NOT AS REALISTIC LOOKING  AS SECURE SMILE, ITS THINNER!!!! WHICH MEANS ON MASSIVE HORSE OVER BITE! SECURE SMILE ONLY WORKS FOR PPL WITH NO TOP TEETH. IF YOU HAVE TEETH, BUY IMAKO!!</li>
    <li> The product was not  what I thought was  very displeased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an actually real person who purchased this item so you can trust my review. There is no way can you file it down to look real without a professional tool, it is a gag item only for jokes. There are some reviews on here that state what a great alternative this is but they are paid to give reviews and are not trust worthy. It&#x27;s a horrible way to make sales. I would not recommend this item but only to a clown.</li>
    <li> These would not soften in hot water using the directions and I have worked with a different brand previously that worked fine. When these were soaked in the hot water and done just as the directions said, when attempted to adjust to size, they shattered.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! These may look real and better than others but they are not worth it. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> They are not at all the color of teeth, they are a dingy gray color.</li>
    <li> Made me look like a goofball</li>
    <li> when done properly....great product:D</li>
    <li> this might work if your missing all your teeth or if your teeth are perfectly straight and even</li>
    <li> Way to small,  broke almost immediately</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to see my mom to smile again,I recommended this product easy to use and make me happy because of my mom smile.Thanks guys</li>
    <li> teeth are yellow and big!!!Yeah they are good for Halloween.Save some money and go to dentist.I recently lost my flipper i have one missing tooth.I dont have money now to see dentist. i tough i will try the secure smile God that was BIG mistake !!So please read all bad reviews first.Secure Smile best for Halloween!!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! Product broke immediately. Ended up throwing it in the garbage! This is not the same teeth from &amp;#34;SecureSmile&amp;#34; so don&#x27;t be misled like I was by the title of this product. Absolutely NOT a secure smile. It&#x27;s a crappy &amp;#34;instant smile&amp;#34; made by Billy Bob and it gives you buck teeth. A total joke and a total waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in my mouth. Waste my money</li>
    <li> Well was not pleased 3 pair was broken in half when I received them</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with product because its an imitation of actual Dentures and does not serve the purpose of eating</li>
    <li> Good quality for the money...</li>
    <li> beads dident melt so I could form it never got to use them. can I get more beads so I could use them or do I half buy a hole set again</li>
    <li> A good friend of mine recently had to have all of her top teeth pulled, a situation I can&#x27;t even imagine being in. She was extremely depressed and embarrassed to even speak with her family, let alone leave the house. Her dentist had told her it would be about 4 weeks before she would have her dentures, but as it turns out its going to be more like 2-3 months. She was to the point that she was going to skip her own birthday party rather than face people without her teeth. I ordered these knowing full well that they are not made for someone who has no teeth, but I thought I might be able to modify them to make them work and I was right. Here is what I did. I ordered an extra packet of the thermal beads, and when everything arrived I put the teeth in hot water for about a minute and then had her put them in and mold them to her mouth shape. At this point I had to file them down a great deal which was time consuming but once they were filed down they fit much better. Then I heated all of the thermal beads and made them into a worm shape and put them on the back. She put them in her mouth and used her tongue to create a plate along the roof of her mouth. After they had sat for a while and completely cooled, I used a denture reliner kit on the plate, which she then put in her mouth and let that mold. That made them fit much better and much more comfortable. She has now worn them for numerous hours, and even drank hot coffee without any issues. She has been using seabond wafers cut down to size and they have kept them in very well. All that being said, please be aware that you could not even consider eating in these, they are not actually dentures. I can see how on someone with teeth, the fake gum line would not come up high enough and could look odd. All in all though, for under 20 dollars total they helped to make a friend feel better and that is well worth it.</li>
    <li> garbage tiny waste of money!!!!!</li>
    <li> They were a joke... they broke in half at first attempt to use. I was suppose to purchase from securesmile.com&lt;br /&gt;She is suppose to send back... she probably doesn&#x27;t want to pay shipping or postage to do so.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product gets bad reviews from people who arent willing to put time and effort into making it work. It definitely takes a little patience. My husband spent a long time molding it and using a dremmel to file it down until it was perfect for me. We followed the instructions and it snaps into place well. For someone like me who has always had crooked teeth, it was super nice to give a wide open mouthed smile for our family pictures. I felt fabulous. So dont give up on it just because its hard, take the time and make it work for you.</li>
    <li> The plastic used is not flexible enough, even after heating properly. Won&#x27;t fit. Teeth look like horse teeth. Other brand much better than this one.</li>
    <li> No complaints with this purchase.  They are just what they claim to be.  I just couldn&#x27;t make them work for me, and that&#x27;s ok considering the very fair price.</li>
    <li> Though this is just a novelty toy, it looks like a legitimate set of teeth. Makes me smile just thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t recommended to any1, it looks ridiculous both upper and lower I just wasted my money on this one, not worth bying</li>
    <li> After sanding off the shelf, and sanding down the gums a bit, I love the secure smile! However, it does create a bit of an over bite.</li>
    <li> Per their FAQ: &amp;#34;Can I use the teeth to eat and drink? Although the Secure Smile is for cosmetic purposes, over 85% of our customers report eating and drinking daily with the teeth in. They understand the shell is fragile and treat it with care.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the first page of the booklet states &amp;#34;Although it is NOT recommended you eat with the device in.....&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is false advertising</li>
    <li> This thing is awful! The teeth did not look natural at all and stuck out so far. During the fitting process they snapped in half. Total waste of money! Luckily I was able to return the broken product for a full refund.</li>
    <li> worst purchase ever made...worthless... a piece of crap! Can I get my money back? Do not even bother ... save your money &amp; get to the dentist</li>
    <li> I purchased the lower set of teeth and adhesive for 49.99.I tried everything the directions said to follow.I called the help line also.They stuck out so far in my mouth.Even with filing down maybe the uppers have a better fit and look.But the bottom set no matter what look ridiculous.So I understood if the teeth pkg were opened there would be a 15 dollar charge.So I called about returning them.I got the address where to return the teeth and adhesive.She told me don&#x27;t  bother sending the adhesive because it was of no use to them.But the used teeth are???So finally after a month.Yesterday I received  the email they were refunding me 24.99.They charged 10.00 for the adhesive which is no use to me either.I called and they said I have to pay because it was opened.I said I had to the bottoms won&#x27;t  work without it.I was being charged 10.00 regardless.I am disgusted with the whole experience.From start till now.Think twice about this especially  with the bottom teeth.A bad bad choice</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations at all..</li>
    <li> Suited the purpose.  LOl not for eating</li>
    <li> Waste of money feel like Halloween teeth</li>
    <li> I looked over the reviews carefully before deciding to purchase this product. There are some nasty reviews, but they seemed to be about people buying the wrong size, or from a different seller than I did.&lt;br /&gt; My order arrived in just a couple of days, and... I can smile again! Yes, they take some work, no I don&#x27;t look like a horse. Even people who have known me for years don&#x27;t know, except for noticing &amp;#34;something brighter about my face&amp;#34;. I had terrible migraines for years that always made me throw up, which made my teeth very brittle. I tried fixing them, but the compound the dentist used never stayed on more than a month. Finally it got so bad I just covered my smile and when I laughed- for years. My dentist wanted me to take out a loan for several thousand dollars to fix them, and I thought dentures were my only option.&lt;br /&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t consider these a permanent option as you cannot eat with them in, and I&#x27;m getting press on veneers in a couple of months. However, I have been grinning for days since these arrived, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who covers their smile. Just be sure to order the right size! My head size is average, and the one size fits most worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have no upper teeth so I ordered these  to try them out and they worked out better than I thought.  So it might work for others with no upper teeth as well. You&#x27;ll have to use some Fixodent to hold them on your gums and keep trying to get a comfortable fit.  Not for eating but a very pretty smile if you have no teeth!</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  I&#x27;ve paid as much as $40 for them over the years. So happy to find them at such a great price.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. Did not fit properly &amp; broke easily. WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> yes I could do 0 stars I would. These are totally useless. Even for Halloween. Never never never buy these. You have been warned. Do not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> This theeth are amzing.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; on these fake teeth makes it very difficult to fit them so that they fit well.</li>
    <li> This was not worth it at all. Sent it back the day after I received it.</li>
    <li> The teeth are very discolored and small, nothing close to my real teeth! I bought them to use while having my bridge repaired,</li>
    <li> They look real. I have to say that. But, too real. They don&#x27;t fit well at all. They cause the upper lip to protrude. Good for a laugh but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> this item has a think piece on the back that has to be filed down. if it is not filed away it cannot be used.  i ordered two of these and they are garbage. they broke when trying to file that think piece off the back.  i have ordered this item in the past from another vendor and it did not have this piece on the back and the fitting was easy.  these two pair i received were defective and they are now garbage.</li>
    <li> Do not mistake these for the \\&quot; secure smile\\&quot; as seen on TV as I did put it this way lesson learned.arrived apparently cracked and broke while looking at it after taking it out of package. was told to return it for refund but not worth the cost of gas to do so. I hate giving poor revues but this one deserves it! Don&#x27;t waste the money</li>
    <li> Followed the directions to the letter. The beads melt into a gooy sunbstance that you have to mold into the tray. Then you set it around the existing teeth. Then you&#x27;re supposed to let it cool. One problem, they don&#x27;t stay up on the existing teeth. I would like a refund. This product sucks and to think I payed for overnight shipping.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the products did not meet expectations . They did not fit , fitting was possible using the instructions . After trying to use them any how they would not stay in my mouth .</li>
    <li> So i couldn&#x27;t wait till my order came.... i got the top and bottom teeth.  No matter what i do, imagine that... it doesn&#x27;t work. I boiled the water even and the teeth do not mold to yours. And excatley what is the Thermal fitting beads doing? Other than pissing me off. All i want is to smile in public again! After reading all the comments, i was so excited.  All the bogus replys on here.</li>
    <li> Wast of money....must of been a joke for Halloween or something... please don&#x27;t waste your money...This is some kind of toy and couldn&#x27;t possibly be used as any kind of partial</li>
    <li> Awful.  Gives terrible overbite and looks ridiculous. Definitely for Halloween only.</li>
    <li> It broke before I even received it.</li>
    <li> save your money they don&#x27;t even work sort of.</li>
    <li> DO NOT FIT RIGHT,HORSE TEETH, NOT FOR REAL DENTISTRY,COMIC PROP TEETH,DO NOT BUY TO REALLY REPLACE REAL MISSING TEETH.DONT BE FOOLED</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all. I am very disappointed. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Horrible!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The ridge is too small to allow the teeth to adhere to your own teeth.  And you can&#x27;t get a refund either.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. I bought two and they both broke getting them out of the package. They are worthless.</li>
    <li> This product is not even good enough to be a &amp;#34; novelty joke&amp;#34;. I spent a couple hours trying to modify, adjust, conform all to no avail. Waste of money and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanessa</li>
    <li> great product very sturdy work well with my dental problems no im not ashamed to smile even ok to eat some thing with</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this is called a toy. It feels and looks like it was made for my mouth and teeth. With just a small bit of moderation, I got back the smile I had 25 years ago.  I really don&#x27;t believe expensive caps or veneers could look any better. The greatest benefit of all, it took years off the appearance of my face. I can barely see the lines above my lips anymore.  I can&#x27;t believe I only paid 15.00 for something that has changed my appearance and confidence this much. I bought the small to medium teeth, so I can&#x27;t commit about the large size.</li>
    <li> I have never before had a pretty smile. Now I do. I&#x27;m so happy! everyone I know has commented on how nice my smile is, and now I feel so much more confident in myself. This isn&#x27;t just a &amp;#34;novelty&amp;#34; denture, it&#x27;s a major confidence booster.</li>
    <li> If you are purchasing this product for dental cosmetic issues, then don&#x27;t bother! This is a toy! Save your money and seek professional help!</li>
    <li> With the way this product is made the teeth sit low against your own teeth and give a very unnatural appearance. They&#x27;re definitely not what we were hoping for and are actually yellower than natural teeth would be. Given the price and the reviews I read, I would not recommend these to anyone who wants to use them day to day for any other purpose than a toy or gag.</li>
    <li> Okay so I am going to give you guys an honest unbiased opinion. Firstly, i am a early twenty aged male. My dental situation is not severe at all. I&#x27;ve never had a a cavity and my teeth are not discolored, fortunately. I only have a considerable gap between by two front teeth. The rest of my teeth are straight, bottom row entirely straight and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i have been pondering on getting orthodontic work for several years but i did not want to really spend the money. I&#x27;m a college student. The money i receive, i use for school and living expenses. So i decided to look around for products similar to veneers. I found snap on smile, which required a dentist visit. I figured, if I&#x27;m going to visit a dentist i may as well be visiting for braces. Then i stumbled upon secure smile. The website seemed legit with the success stories..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, i do not know what product these individuals were using or how much they were paid off to participate in this scam. I say scam because this is exactly what it is. Needless to say, i ordered this item. I was so excited, i purchased it and paid for one day shipping. This total to be about 35 dollars. I paid more for shipping than the actual product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i received this item, i was really disappointed when i opened the package. I knew straight away it would not work for me.The teeth didn&#x27;t look bad, it was the size. It was not enough to cover a mouth realistically. Maybe if you were going to use these to take a photo. I could not close my mouth properly with these in. If i wore them, people would be more alert to the odd size of them than if i didn&#x27;t wear them. It was just awful. I attempted like 10 times to make them fit until the teeth kind of ripped. I just threw the crap away. It was a total waste of money. Do not buy this. I am not some extreme case or negative person who is trying to deter you from achieving a dream smile. I&#x27;m actually a very happy, employed, soon to be college grad. I&#x27;m tryingto save your wallet. It will not work for you. believe me, if it worked i would be ordering another pair and telling you a success story right now. Leaving this review does not help or hurt my bank accounts at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this catastrophe, i went ahead and scheduled an appointment at a local dentist. Without insurance, i paid 107 dollars to get my teeth cleaned in preparation for braces or veneers. This did not include getting my teeth x-rayed. That would have been an additional  45 dollars. Which was not expensive, i just didn&#x27;t see the need for it, just for a cleaning. If you schedule a cleaning and you don&#x27;t have insurance, please ask about the price and if x-rays are optional. I was told my teeth were in perfect condition, just to floss more. Tomorrow, literally two days after my walk-in cleaning appointment, i have a free consultation at a local orthodontist to assess my teeth to see what amount of work i will require/payment options. Following this appointment, i have another dental appointment a few hours later at the place who cleaned my teeth. It is a consultation to consider getting my teeth bonded to correct my gap. I have read up and i&#x27;ve found that bondings can be 100-200 per tooth, or more depending on severity. Possibly less depending on the dentist. This can be done in one visit and is not a strenuous process. I am determined to get my teeth fixed, the proper way. I would rather spend my savings, or save more to get a smile that makes me comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a well off person, i work two part time jobs while being a full time business major at a major university. i have normal expenses, as my parents do not send me much money. I honestly think it will pay off more in the long run to just save your money and try to get these things fixed through a proper dentist. Your teeth will look better and you will feel better about spending your money on a good/expected outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I know how depressing it gets sometimes seeingyour friends and others with perfect smiles that they were born with. Everything happens for a reason. You can fix this. Just take the time to research and find what works best for you financially and in general. Once you get started, i promise you it is easier than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that by writing this review, i am helping at least one person. These reviews can be very misleading. I know how hurtful negative reviews can be when you are trying to find a good product. One positive among a million reviews will make you feel like there is hope. Please take my review into consideration.</li>
    <li> These are a waste of money take my word for it</li>
    <li> The instant teeth were too large. It does not fit the entire teeth. What will make this product better is to ensure that it will fit over the entire teeth and the fit is snug enough to eat with. It is a good concept and should be explored a little more.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I needed this to wear in between dental procedures so I can look presentable. I followed all the directions step by step and yet it still made me look like I had Mr. Ed gums and teeth. I tried to fit it six times and still it was too bulky. After several tries I just gave up and said there goes money down the drain.</li>
    <li> I bought the Imako teeth last year and they were horrible.  They weren&#x27;t like teeth at all.  They were this flat thing that you were supposed to stick to your natural teeth.  I threw them out.  I just bought Insta-Dent upper denture for $95.00.  It is like a real set of dentures.  Buy the insta-dent instead and you&#x27;ll be much happier.  Upper sells for $95.00 and Lower sells for $95.00 and whole set is $168.00.  Go to their website insta-dent.com.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Although you can&#x27;t chew with insta-dent, they say some people have done it with gentle chewing.</li>
    <li> I do not think you could use these for real dentures.  They did look very good but if you have decent teeth these will not fit over them.  I cut one tooth out and used it to cover it up temporally.  It worked well for that.</li>
    <li> Broke inside the cup of hot water, waste of money! don&#x27;t get it!</li>
    <li> size didn&#x27;t fit and to much problem about returning it. never again i&#x27;m find</li>
    <li> Met expectations...Definitely didn&#x27;t exceed them, have purchased this product previously and have been satisfied with the adequate results...good luck. ...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money i have the imako brand but i had read a comment about how real alistic. And yes they look that whay in box but impossible to fit cuz there way to thick try sanding it down with sand paper. But was a complete waste of time cuz in less u have all day and want to give your self arthritis then dont waste your money  i ended up haveing to go back on here and order another imako. Which i should have just done to begin with</li>
    <li> I got them today. I am not happy with them at all. Hope I get my money back. They are way to big for my mouth.</li>
    <li> I love my secure smile teeth. It just takes time to work with the molding to get them just right . For the people that said they didnt like them its because they are inpatient. It does take time you have to work with them. once you get it right you will love them</li>
    <li> it not what you think is. It looks very cheap. I guess you get what you paid for on this. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> i had a small that had broke 2 weeks after i had it but i had brought a medium it fits well also i do no use that plastic stuff that they send with it it could crack the holes and break the item in half use thermo grip very good and no lisp while you are talking .. no slip grip</li>
    <li> I bought the REAL Secure Smile for my husband from the REAL Site for my husband.  His front tooth came out and we have no dental insurance.  The REaL Secure smile came- and he LOvED IT!  But it wore down and cracked in half after a months worth of daily Use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled Secure Smile and saw that it was sld here on Amazon for much cheaper.  It is advertised as Secure Smle.....it looks similar....but it is not!  This product has a ridge on the inside bottom, secure smile does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is false advertising and a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible!! Don&#x27;t stay in for anything and look like giant horse teeth. Can&#x27;t even smile without them falling out. My hubby and kids laughed so hard at me with these in!  Do not buy!! They falsely advertise these as secure smile but they are not the actual secure smile. I will be ordering off secure smiles website most definitely. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> horrible Horrible purchase,,such a waste of money!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These were just as expected and worked great for the project. Will be used again.</li>
    <li> They would have looked good, but are too fragile.  They were broken in the package and I tried to repair, but wasn&#x27;t successful.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t reorder because they seem unreliable.</li>
    <li> If you like toys? Buy this.</li>
    <li> To bulky for my mouth, I&#x27;m a girl so if you need one get a very small one, it came in early but I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t even waste your money they came broken. rip off</li>
    <li> Nice product that help your mouth look better until you can get to the dentist.</li>
    <li> These teeth were everything they said they would be very happy with them you would never know that they are not real</li>
    <li> If anyone is buying these because they have bad teeth, remember there is a reason they call these particular teeth a toy. I put them in and they looked like horse teeth. I recommend Imako teeth .</li>
    <li> this is a toy.. the teeth look like buck / short/gummy teeth for fun and jokes. That wasn&#x27;t the description. Secure smile is not a funny joke type thing. people purchase them to help their esteem problems along with the look of their smile.. shame on you.... seller.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected. They don&#x27;t fit like I thought they would Need to try and work with them again</li>
    <li> Previous reviews will lead you to believe that they are the perfect fit. I had some trouble with the molding beads and then when I use them, they look competly stupid. Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This review will sound like a funny compliment. I bought this set of upper teeth to be used as part of a Hallowe&#x27;en costume. I wanted to look like I was wearing a set of very obvious false teeth, but no one even noticed them because they don&#x27;t look bad at all! They were comfortable to wear and fit well over my actual teeth. They didn&#x27;t change the shape of my mouth very much. I could drink liquids while wearing them but I didn&#x27;t think it would be good to try eating anything. In the end, they looked too good and too natural to suit my purpose, so I have to give them 5 stars for being such a great and inexpensive product for people who want these teeth to look their best.</li>
    <li> too rigid and doesn&#x27;t fit. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Was not anything like &amp;#34;Secure Smile&amp;#34; which is what it is made to look like.</li>
    <li> They fit like horse teeth.  Couldn&#x27;t use them at all.  Big waste of money.  They might work better for someone who has no teeth.</li>
    <li> We got 2 pair and they are perfect just for that boost of confidence the only down fall about these are the beads that we ordered did not hold these in to good so we got some fixodent and they are great!  Saved us 1500$</li>
    <li> The item was not what I expected and is still in the original wrapper. I purchased this to use to cover missing teeth in order to attend a very important event, however, I could never get those little beads to get soft in order to use the product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste time on this denture.  It is cheaply made and looks false.  Then again, what else could be expected from a product costing so little money!!!</li>
    <li> First of all I want to say this product is the best inexpensive and passable alternative to expensive dental procedures I have found, and you will be able to talk normaly and eat. I eat Pizza, tacos, chicken, hamburgers and most meats with the teeth in my mouth. The dentist will charge you about $1500.00 to make you a set of snap-on-teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad news..the beads included with the product suck and will not work...don&#x27;t bother. Purchase Instamorph beads and use those instead...yeah extra money but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to fitting the teeth is paitence. Get the teeth fitted to your mouth, and you can reheat and re-fit over and over until you get a good fit. Melt the Instamorph in hot water and apply the the back of the teeth and then fit in your mouth. The instruction say use an exacto knife to trim the beads once formed...don&#x27;t bother..won&#x27;t work even on the suck beads they send wih the teeth. The key is to keep remelting and removing the Instamorph until you get enough coverage to hold the teeth and look and speak naturaly...I can whistle with my teeth in...try that with the others. I will tell you it will take a bit of practice to learn to speak naturaly again as you have something extra in your mouth..and the less Instamorph you can use the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use common sense when eating...biting an apple may break them...bitting an apple slice won&#x27;t once you get the teeth right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also removed the Instamorph from the teeth and used a non-toxic glue to increase the holding strength of the Instamorph to the back of teeth. I won&#x27;t recommend a glue for you to use or that you to glue the Instamorph to the teeth but if you do USE COMMON SENSE AND READ THE GLUE BOTTLE!!! DO NOT PUT ANYTHING TOXIC IN YOUR MOUTH FOR ANY REASON!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly don&#x27;t buy the denture adhesive they sell...it&#x27;s super polygrip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my teeth for over a year and it took me several tries to get the teeth just right. Even today after eating something a little too hard I can still dip them in hot water for a little adjustment and a denture cleaner and brushing will keep them looking good.</li>
    <li> Again...if you want to look like a horse...by all means get them....I could not even talk with them in my mouth...way to thick.</li>
    <li> Sorry didn&#x27;t want a halloween look wanted something to help w a missing tooth found temptooth after so a waste of money for me</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money.arrived broken in hafe and looked pretty bad. A friend really needs the denture. I going to fix them for him so there something to smile about.</li>
    <li> The idea of this product is great, however, the product is not good at all. There was a sort of &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; at the bottom of the teeth which I had to file down or else it was like having horse teeth in my mouth. I also used a dremel tool to make it even thinner. Just as I was drying it off (I was using little pressure and handling it very carefully) the product broke. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package,I found that they were broken right in the middle. Unsure if I could return them and the urgent need and no time to wait for replacement, I glued them back together and prayed they would get me through the wedding. Not sure if I would buy this particular brand again. I would probably upgrade to a sturdier brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this and ur was broken! Had a crack and I&#x27;m not getting any response from them when i try to send it back and it looked like it was used as it came outside the package wrapped in bubble wrap! Like I said it was cracked and I put it up to my mouth and there is no way in hell it would have fit or closed and I got the smallest ones! Way to lose 20</li>
    <li> Novelty teeth, they&#x27;re exactly that.</li>
    <li> Broken when they came in</li>
    <li> Blessings in Holy Sound-Yeshua !&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, they are actually more for a &#x27; quick-fix &#x27;, or....costume nite-out......than a real Denture replacement. @ least that&#x27;s &amp;#34; my opinion &amp;#34;....&lt;br /&gt;Namaste,&lt;br /&gt;Omody</li>
    <li> It is a good product to have for a temporary fix.</li>
    <li> I bought it as I gag gift</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. The product doesn&#x27;t fit well and the teeth make you look cartoony .my family laughed. Because they really look silly . The product should be thinner in order to fit properly .. there has to be  a better solution than wasting money on this product</li>
    <li> I ordered them and was broken and I fixed and didn&#x27;t fit  in my mouth not good</li>
    <li> Looking for costume horse teeth?  You found the right product.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth do not become all that pliable after heating.&lt;br /&gt;The thickness of teeth makes them protrude, looking like horse teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how other reviewers say you can file them down since they are almost glass like, even after heating.  What the photos posted by another user don&#x27;t show is how the teeth protrude out, since the photos are taken straight on.</li>
    <li> Broke after 20 minutes of wearing them. Not impressed. The teeth are to big.</li>
    <li> They fit good and wear well. It took about 7 tries to get the fit the way I like it. They are excellent.</li>
    <li> These are for gags and not a true fix</li>
    <li> Interesting ! Nice temporary facsimile .</li>
    <li> could not get them on properly too small</li>
    <li> Size medium is huge and bulky and I look like a horse with buck teeth and could never get it to mold or fit to my gum line.  Failure.</li>
    <li> Ok, so we have all read the reviews right?  Here is mine.. A few years ago, I was playing airsoft with some friends and I was shot up close in my face, resulting it some mangled chunks of teeth left behind.. I have no insurance to get my teeth pulled, but my father makes actual dentures. I was feeling so down about myself that I ended up isolating myself from EVERYONE... No smiles, no talking etc.. I was reading reviews for over a month about these various cosmetic veneers and thought.. Why the heck not!?  The way I saw it, I didnt care if they looked like false teeth, or even bad false teeth, as long as they were teeth, and not mangled bad and broken teeth like I have..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my new Secure Smile teeth yesterday and immediately went to the bathroom with a cup of HOT water, a dremel and my super polygrip,lol.. I opened my package and was amazed! Being that I grew up seeing dentures I felt these look like the real deal \\&quot;other than the fact they go over your teeth\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first dremeled off the troth like I read others doing, and shaped them from the hot water.. Yeah,I ended up with extruding large teeth.. But its a start!! I thinned the veneer with the dremel untill I felt it was thin enough to take another look.. I LOVED IT! Holy smokes! Haha.. I instantly felt good again.. I got out the Super Polygrip, and put too much on the Secure Smile veneer and yuck! It oozed onto my upper lip,lol.. So I cleaned them up, and applied a much less amount! Yep, turned out great! I was able to smile again with confidence. I surprised the kids and they agree, I have a pretty smile once again. The ole lady seemed to like them, and I posted pics on my Facebook! I got soooo many compliments! One buddy said I look totally different, and I replied with Thank you, that was the plan,lol.. I was able to sleep with them in lastnight, but needed to clean them up and re apply more Polygrip.. I just finished eating a soft taco for lunch and all was good, yet I wouldnt suggest doing that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Secure Smile, for giving me my smile AND MY LIFE!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just a regular guy, and I posted a pic in the gallery.. My name is David Stevens, and I approve this message!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to go to the store and smile at whoever,lol..  Just take your time, and keep at it, if your in need for a great smile again, this is a great choice! I&#x27;m getting more for back ups, just in case..</li>
    <li> Order dentures for my friend and she hated it. She tried to mold them according to the instruction but it made her look like she had an overbite. The teeth came on time and package very well, but would recommend because molding it was hard for her and she doesn&#x27;t wear them at all.... Very complex to fit the form of your mouth.....</li>
    <li> I ordered thinking it would help cover up my ugly smile however it made my smile uglier. I looked like a horse! I think this was made for people with no front top teeth as it isn&#x27;t big enough to fit over your own teeth. It doesn&#x27;t go all the way up to the gums and the space in between the fake teeth and the gum like part of it isn&#x27;t wide enough to wrap around your real teeth. I even tried to file it down as others had mentioned but it isn&#x27;t very easy to do without filing the teeth and its hard to get the ridge all the way off as your fingers run out of room to hold it as you near the bottom. Also, my fingers were getting filed by my file because there&#x27;s not much room to wrk with. I was very hopeful this would work for me like some others claimed it did for them. I&#x27;m someone with all my front top teeth but have a hole in between my two front top teeth. I really wanted to at least cover this hole. Now I&#x27;m in search for something that I might be able to shape and mold just over the two teeth. Kind of like a cap for these teeth. Anyone else ever find something like that? If so please email me at mariahbabii@hotmail</li>

    <li> Awful to cover missing teeth.</li>
    <li> I had a dilemma, I&#x27;ve been seeing a dentist to get my teeth fixed, each visit is about $900 - $1500, needless to say the visits are spaced quite a ways out so I can save enough money between each because I don&#x27;t have insurance. I lost one of my front teeth when I got broken and can&#x27;t get a flipper till my front teeth are fixed. I also have photos that need to be taken very soon and don&#x27;t want a gaping hole in my smile so I thought I would try this temporary solution.  (Also I do not participate in any affiliate or rewards programs, this is my honest opinion and my own personal experience)&lt;br /&gt;These are the only &amp;#34;false&amp;#34; teeth I have bought so I can&#x27;t compare them to others. But I will share what little I know about them so far. When these came in I tried using them &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34;. They just didn&#x27;t work for me the way they were. There is a &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; just behind the teeth part that is supposed to fit below your own teeth. This &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; make the teeth stick out way too far and sit way to low so that if you were to smile more than a grin you would see the top of the gumline. I have a pretty broad smile though so that could just be me. Also even though these teeth are quite thin they are just too thick, again for me, they made my top lip stick out a bit too much and made me talk funny, and no I didn&#x27;t have the fitting putty touching anything but the very edge of my teeth.  I think the thickness is a bit necessary for the detail, they look pretty realistic as far as a $12 set of teeth can.  I saw in one of the comments about these teeth that someone had ground the shelf off.  I did just that with a Dremel tool and a good bit, being very careful. I also sanded down the back side of the teeth so that they are much thinner, being careful not to make them too thin, don&#x27;t want to grind a hole in them. Now once this is done, there are no longer any &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; on the back side for the &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; to stick into to hold the teeth to your own and the fitting &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t stick to these without that. So I put a single strip of Poligrip Strips across the back to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; them to the front of my teeth. The teeth stayed in place all day, although i did have to adjust them twice after I tried eating with them in. you can&#x27;t bite into anything with these in like this but you can put food into your mouth and chew with your back teeth. Once these are ground thin so you can push them up farther they look great. I asked several people if they could tell because no one said anything and they were surprised I didn&#x27;t have dental work done. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you have the time, tools, and patience to make them work. All in all it took me less time to alter them than a dental visit. At least I can smile again until I do get that next $1500 appointment.fitting &amp;#34;putty&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t stick to these without that.

    <li> The product cracked the first day of trying to fit them, I saw no warnings that they would be that fragile,&lt;br /&gt;I have just simply lost money as there are no returns.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> OK I don&#x27;t hv dental insurance &amp; I hv some rotten teeth in the front &amp; its very embarrassing..I was using Inamorata but they are not worth the money u pay for a piece of plastic &amp; they stain very easily..so I said to myself I gotta try something else..I was reluctant because of some of the videos &amp; reviews but they didn&#x27;t cost a lot so I said what the heck..I got them &amp; I shaved the down..what I did was put a butter knife on the stove &amp; let it heat &amp; started shaving away..I got them thin then I put the beads just in the middle where I have a gap &amp; that holds them in place perfectly..  but u hv to be careful because they are porcelain &amp; easy to break..but a little glue &amp; like magic they we&#x27;re fixed ..I love them..they do make my mouth poof out a little but its a small price to pay for a beautiful smile ..I do eat &amp; drink with the on..drink from a straw &amp; eat soft foods.. hope this is helpful</li>
    <li> These things do not work like they say. I tried for hours to get them right and couldnt. They look like something you would wear at Halloween. I understand they are just for cosmetic purposes but these things are a joke. Sorry that I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have used these &#x27;types&#x27; of teeth covers for a year and a half now and I have to say;&lt;br /&gt;If you just pull them out of the package and try to fit them, it most likely won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I have needed to use my Dremel to sand off the ridge, drill two anchor holes for the plastic to fill (on left and right sides) and etch several small indentations on the back (more grip for the plastic to adhere to.)&lt;br /&gt;They can be very hard to fit, even after all of that, but a good bit of patiance, a good mirror and I get a decent fit.</li>
    <li> I hated them.  They looked like &amp;#34;Doggie dentures&amp;#34; and were made for the mouth of a 5 year old.  Awful !</li>
    <li> These things are terrible I bought these thinking they were like the ones from secure smile and they&#x27;re not. I filed down to dang near the white part and they still look like horse teeth. Dang it.</li>
    <li> This teeth are great for a had Halloween costume for someone with buck teeth.</li>
    <li> WHEN I FIRST GOT THE ITEM I ALREADY NEW HOW TO SET THEM AND FIT THEM. DUE TO WATCHING OVER A HUNDRED VIDEOS OF IT.&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I WENT TO MOLD IT TO MY TEETH AND GUMS. I COULDNT GET IT TO FIT RIGHT THEN THE BEADS WOULD NOT HOLD THE IN THE HOLES ON THE BOTTOM.... I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED AND STILL CANNOT GET IT TO FIT OR HOLD. THEN IT MAKES THE TOP OF MY MOUTH STICK OUT FARTHER THAN MY BOTTOM JAW SO I LOOK STUPID. IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT GETTING I WOULD NOT GET THEM THEY ARE NOT GOOD IN ANYWAY. THEY ARE NOT THAT EASY TO FIT TO YOUR MOUTH. I WOULD GIVE THE PRODUCT 0/5...</li>
    <li> saw it wasn&#x27;t right for my dentures  didn&#x27;t even open it</li>
    <li> I think I would have liked it better had I got the right size. I measured as the instructions on Amazon said to, but I got a size smaller than I needed. I&#x27;m going to the Secure Smile site and pay the 40 bucks for a panel without the ridge at the bottom. I don&#x27;t mind paying more for it to get the help I need. I&#x27;m a diabetic and the disease causes bone loss. Teeth get lost in there somewhere, which makes eating a tad difficult. Try the product. It might work for you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all they didn&#x27;t fit they were really uncomfortable even after I grinned cut and did just about anything possible I regret waisting my money on this product.</li>
    <li> THESE THINGS SUCK! SUCK! SUCK!  And anyone who says they can EAT with them is either a LIAR or they are only eating SOUP BROTH.  There is no way you can EAT with these damn things...they will not even stay attached to your existing teeth; they fall out as soon as you open your mouth and you DO look like a HORSE!  All I had to do was WHINNY and everyone would have thought for sure that I was a HORSE!  What a waste of money....my broken teeth look better than this cheap piece of S***!  I HATE THEM!  And I DID try over and over and over again to melt the white stuff and to heat up the teeth; nothing worked.  So now I can give these to my dentist as a JOKE.</li>
    <li> Had front teeth pulled and have been using this until gums heal enough for a partial.  I got the medium ones. Beads didn&#x27;t work well for me so I clipped off alot behind the teeth and used a nail grinder to make them thinner.  Be sure not to grind the front.  Put some fixodent strips on them and secured them to the teeth I had left.  Took me a few days to learn how to talk but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with the shape and color of the teeth.  You can NOT eat with them but drinking is easy.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than secure smile as they have a bridge across the bottom where the others do not.  Will definitely do business again with them</li>
    <li> The only thing you could do is smile for a pictue. To talk is out of the question. See the dentistyou have no alternative. You can,t fool anyone only yourself.</li>
    <li> It is a good idea; but there are 3 serious problems: 1.They are too thick and cause a bad lisp.  2.There is insufficient molding compound to completly &#x27;bed&#x27; your teeth into it. and 3, nothing sticks, so the molding/bedding compound comes off of the false teeth and your teeth and everything falls out.  They need to go back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I worked in dentistry for 30 years, yet no matter how I followed the directions completely,  or tried to use my own variations, this product did not work. It did not fit over my own very straight healthy teeth. It was way too small, and did not have enough of the little gels balls to make a ledge in order to hold it in.  They do not give enough sizing info in order to pick a size. It would never hold, on anyone, if they slightly pursed their lips, it would fall out. It was a good experiment, but I do not advise anyone else try it.Atip to the company...maybe supply more of the gell things instead of that tiny packet, and just maybe someone might get some temporary use out of this. They do look good though.  I think the name should be changed from SECURE SMILE to insecure smile!</li>
    <li> Cosmetic false teeth .Are what they say they are.&lt;br /&gt;Will be good for halloween. It would also be good for someone who didn&#x27;t have any teeth and couldn&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist for professional ones.they look real</li>
    <li> The teeth wouldn&#x27;t mold to my mouth--no matter what I did. Don&#x27;t buy this product-- from anyone or company. They don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Made the mistake of trying something new.  These are horrible.  There is a ledge on the back side that your teeth rest on which makes this product protrude.  My speech was even affected.  Unfortunately, I cant afford dental work so I&#x27;m stuck using this type of product.  I will go back to Imako.  What a waste of money I dont have.  Amazon neds a zero rating star.</li>
    <li> I like this because they look like the real thing and help my smile. However, unless you get Fixodent to hold them, they do not stay. They really need a pallet for the roof of the mouth to fit right, or something on the inside that could adjust to fit to stay. And even with Fixodent, they want to slide while you&#x27;re talking.&lt;br /&gt;The warm water that you place them in to help mold to your mouth is a good thing; however, if you push too much they break in which superglue will fix.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they&#x27;re a good item for the price and a temporary fix. But a real hassle on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Non issues whatsoever, VERY fast delivery</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have enough teeth left to hold these on, and if I did they still wouldn&#x27;t fit right. Depends on your tooth issues and the shape of your mouth. Worth a try for someone with only a few missing teeth in the right places.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone you can file them so they fit correctly be prepared for compliments galore....I feel like i was given back my life thank you so much</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would. Wasn&#x27;t what I thought I had purchased.  Will not purchase something like this again.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t fit around my teeth. And, they hurt,  can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good invention but it&#x27;s really better in smaller size. Because I put these on and I look like a horse. I can&#x27;t close my mouth normally.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and soaked the teeth in hot water as per the instruction, but they broke in half when I went to shape them. As I was inspecting the break I noticed that they were to small anyway. This was a complete waste of effort. It inspired me to see a dentist ASAP!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get these to fit, no matter what I did.  Ended up in the trash.  Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> Because the teeth didnt fit at all. But nice looking teeth. Just didnt fit me and was not very happy about it</li>
    <li> Waste of money to bulky!!!</li>
    <li> they broke right away no good.very disappointed put them in the water pulled them out when to put and they broke</li>
    <li> The worst product ever!!! Please save your money... first of all the product looks like horse teeth. my wife pass out laughing when  had them in my mouth.. However, i found a solution, Since I was only missing a front tooth. I manage to cut the teeth in half...Amazing after a good file and  Re shaping it actually work... Even my wife said it looks a lot better.. But,It shouldn&#x27;t take me breaking in half a product to make it work...</li>
    <li> They were cheap, and was not like the imagine shown.  Yes they are compared to a toy and they could pass for a toy.  They were not worth the money, you ge what you pay for</li>
    <li> its great I just need a large size if possible asap  I thought the size I received was good but need slightly bigger size (large )</li>
    <li> I used the product several times. My teeth are great, but discolored and the front ones are skewed. I just wanted a change. People compliment my natural teeth, but I am my worst critic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for taking pics, which I do a lot. It is by NO means the be all end all to your dental situation and the price alone should be an indicator. It is absurd, silly and dumb to have great expectations from this product when it is priced at a mere fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the price you would pay a dental professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the product. It works and it is fun. Again, just not a permafix.</li>
    <li> This was great im happy I got them had to get use to them an talking with them..kind of makes me have a overbite overall they look good easy to fit in my mouth gave me my smile back!!</li>
    <li> They were a little bulky ,but all and all they look like your own teeth</li>
    <li> Junk returned them and made an appointment with a real dentist</li>
    <li> Will order more of this one</li>
    <li> these are ok but they do not conform like the ad says and do not have a good back side to hold firmly in place.</li>
    <li> I did not like it!! After letting it sit in the water to soften up, it still broke!! Didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> They were broken when I recieved them and they are not at all what they are advertised to be. It doesn&#x27;t even appear that one would be able to speak with these in... Not satisfied at all and I WILL be returning them!!!</li>
    <li> i was expecting something a little bit more serious but instead got this, stay away from it if you want the real thing</li>
    <li> Not what I thought they were going to be, bought them on someone&#x27;s recomendation, bad move. Too bulky, too hard to fit. The part of the product which is the gum material, although very life like looking, is too thick and I am not sure how to thin it down. In the add it mentioned that this might be the case  for females, but said there were instructions on how to solve this, there was not. I&#x27;m not totally finished trying to make them work for my situtation, just frustrated.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star if I had a choice.  Horrible product even if used as a novelty! Please do not buy this and waste your money!</li>
    <li> Easier said then done an the gums come down to low I think but time may tell just because I have problems does not mean someone else won&#x27;t love this product :)</li>
    <li> Too expensive and very fragile.</li>
    <li> these worked great for my niece</li>
    <li> The plastic used is not flexible enough, even after heating properly. Won&#x27;t fit. Teeth look like horse teeth. Other brand much better than this one.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Honestly, these were a waste of my money. They were not what I was expecting AT ALL. They look like horse when you put them in. Let&#x27;s just say they ended up in my trash.</li>
    <li> I like the product because it works well for what I&#x27;m looking for on a temporary basis.  I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I trashed it the day I got it. A complete and total waste of money. Clown teeth is was they looked like. I looked like an idiot with them in. Stay clear of this product! !!!!!!!#</li>
    <li> These things are a joke.  They don&#x27;t fit right. They make you look extremely bucked toothed.  The color is way off.  If you are looking for joke teeth, then buy these.  If you want a temporary fix to make you look good until you can afford to have your teeth fixed don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Save your money for real dentures!!!!  More for Halloween type stuff. Even if your desperate for instant temporary teeth.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Got the size med wasnt given an option for size. I look like i have buck teeth, they feel bulky and don&#x27;t look natural at all. Maybe i will try the smaller size, but more than likely will pay more and go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> First of all, they came broken. Once I glued them back together, I then had to file them down so much to the point of actually making a different pair of teeth. I had to us an industrial filer to even file them down with less work. If you want a cheap smile go with Secure Smile it&#x27;s less work and at least they come to you whole.</li>
    <li> I had to do my own modifying to these but they work great! I took a tool an sanded the lip off, then I got some powder that makes false teeth sick. I heated the beads an mixed them with the powder, placed the beads on the inside of the teeth an molded them to fit in my mouth. Take them in an out for a hour because they will harden in your mouth an will be hard to get out. Soon as it was a perfect fit I super glue the beads in place on the teeth. This has allowed me to look so much better an no one knows they are not my teeth. I had to work at it but it paid off. They will definitely do the trick until I have enough saved to get dentures! Work with the product, or else they will end up in the trash for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend of mine with a missing front tooth. He cut a tooth out to fit his missing one. He said it boosts his confidence when he&#x27;s out in public.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM CANNOT BE USED BY ANYBODY AT ALLL; CANNOT BE USED AS A COSTUME ITEM AND NOT AS ANY SERIOUS TOOTH ITEM; WASTE OF MONEY TOTALLY WASTED MONEY</li>
    <li> The product is very small.  It would be helpful to have an adult size and better info before purchasing to understand how it will fit.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s up to you but no the gum part is thick and come out to fare take chance if you missing alot in front of mouth i &#x27;m just missing side teeth.</li>
    <li> They look like horse teeth they don&#x27;t fit at all.It is was waste of money go to the denist if you can.This is like something kids would play with.I will never do that again.I was really disappointed.I could have saved that money.</li>
    <li> It broke trying to make them look more real. I know they do work for some people and i bought them to see if they would work for me and nope not for me!</li>
    <li> impossible to fit. bought for halloween costume for sibling and wwere ultimately worthless</li>
    <li> great for the joke we play on a person who don&#x27;t  like coming over to my house to dinner ,put them in his glass of tea .</li>
    <li> Easy to use and fits perfecty! Now I can smile again and take selfies!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and fits great.</li>
    <li> It would be OK if mouth was huge but it is not.  just wasn&#x27;t worth the money spent sorry such a low rating</li>
    <li> They are like joke teeth look like Halloween  sort of like the wax teeth you&#x27;d get at the corner candy store</li>
    <li> Last time they came cracked. This time fine.</li>
    <li> Looking good... feel fine😁</li>
    <li> Unable to do anything with product. I feel that a product with that much advertising should be able to at least fit.</li>
    <li> Ordered for a temporary fix, will work fine till I get to dentist to get tooth fixed and back to normal. Thanks for the help.</li>
    <li> I am quite disappointed.  The teeth look very natural in the package, but when I tried to fit them into my mouth, they truly look like a joke.  They fit too far away from the teeth and take so much work to fit properly.  I&#x27;ve been working with them for about a week and I give up.  They are so thick that they don&#x27;t soften enough to hug the teeth and the &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; attached to the teeth is useless and needs to be filed down completely.</li>
    <li> Received but, couldn&#x27;t use the impression fitting beads were not in the package with teeth. But, I would recommend them to any one anytime</li>
    <li> Went straight in the trash</li>
    <li> I could not get the teeth to fit securely in my mouth. I love it but the beads would not allow me to fit them in my mouth. They would not stay in.</li>
    <li> The teeth were easy to mold to fit, and the thermal beads were easy to work with (works better with boiling or near boiling water). Yes, they&#x27;re thick, so it gives you a bit of an overbite and a lisp, in my case anyway, though that could be because I bought the wrong size. I read some reviews where people sanded them down, so I might try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why people are having a hard time with them. The instructions are very straight forward and easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shipping was very fast, and I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
    <li> For what they cost, I should have expected low quality, but I&#x27;d like to warn other potential buyers. The teeth are too big, and not as flexible as they should be after submerging in hot water. The teeth will cause your upper lip to stick out in an un-natural, horse-like way. In short--they suck. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I would never buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> When you put this thing on, you will going to look like a freakin horse! I am tellin you that you will gonna look ugly when you wear this I swear!</li>
    <li> Love it now I can smile again lol going to see my husband soon iam excited about wearing it</li>
    <li> I knew when I was buying these they were going to be cheap but I was at least hoping I could use them to cover up my teeth for photos and maybe at times when I need to speak in public. There are a waste of money. Im not even going to waste my time reviewing them more than that. Please do not waste your money on these. They will not work for anyone.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken, and will never again buy anything from (billy bob teeth) EVER.....!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s junk. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money.</li>
    <li> It was cracked when received. The plastic is super hard. Wont stay in place. Major waste of money. Dont Buy!!!</li>
    <li> Love them this product is a good buy for any one who teeth are damage and can not afford veneers.  They are not exsensive and very easy to used this was a good purchase,</li>
    <li> this is going to make you laugh.  When i put these in my mouth i looked like a Donkey trying to smile.  I like it because it makes me look so funny that i completely loose it laughing.  My wife and I and one of her girlfriends who she was video talking with laughed harder than i can remember.  Anything that can make me laugh that hard I like.  There will be special occasions for this and I will probably buy another for backup.  Truly is a novelty ..... Way Kool !!!!!</li>
    <li> They poke your mouth out</li>
    <li> Very bulky, color was great but not worth it</li>
    <li> We were never able to use this product because the hot water sizing process never worked.  It was a waste of money from our perspective.</li>
    <li> I bought this product through the secure smile web site, and paid $70 for the teeth, extra molding beads and shipping, I wish I would have checked here first, my second set will be purchased through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do take a bit of patience, and it took me a little over 2 weeks to get the right fit, where I can use them, not have a speech impediment, and can take them out when needed. The best fit, is using as little of the beads as possible to get a secure fit, and not impede your speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for 3 months now, and have no issues with discoloration, no one even knows (besides my close friends) that I even have these in. They are awesome, and I love them, they gave me back my confidence to laugh and smile in social situations, after several of my front teeth were broken off at the gum due to my health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend these to anyone looking for a temporary fix to unsightly teeth issues. Although I cannot eat with them in, I have perfected the fit enough that I can discreetly slip them out, eat my meal and then go to the restroom to put them back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money.  the \\&quot;veneers\\&quot; offered by Imako are much better and only cost a little bit more.  Neither is perfect, but if you need to look better on a budget, the Imako product is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking they would be a temporary fix until I could afford dental work. I have 1 missing tooth in front. I have attempted to make these fit about 50 times. I have a small mouth and I bought small. I have heated the water to just below boiling...and they will NOT form to the curve of my teeth. They are too bulky. I sanded the shelf off and that didn&#x27;t help any either. I have sanded the back of the top gum looking area and that hasn&#x27;t helped. They simply are too bulky...they make my upper lip stick out way too far and I look ridiculous. I have spent way too many hours trying to make them fit. The thermal beads (fitting plastic) that come with the teeth....don&#x27;t stick to the teeth. The teeth will not stay in place with the thermal beads and when I take them back out the fitting plastic just falls right off the teeth. I used denture adhesive as well and that didn&#x27;t even make them stick. The teeth do look realistic however and I think people that have many missing teeth could make them work since there aren&#x27;t so many teeth to have to curve them around and with a lot of missing teeth the fake teeth wouldn&#x27;t make your upper lip stick out so far. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone that has most of their upper teeth. I think it is intended for those who have many missing teeth or even perhaps no teeth.</li>
    <li> These teeth work fairly well for me. I have a small mouth making it difficult to project an attractive smile. For me, these teeth fix that. They do produce an overbite though. It would be nice if they could bring that in somehow. Also, they break and stain easily and as a result I can only get about two months out of them. It&#x27;s harder to talk with these in but with practice I do ok. They look real and the color isn&#x27;t super white like it is in others.</li>
    <li> maybe if you have  big mouth these would work ok, but look like horse teeth to me. wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> these things are complete garbage and a waste of money.  I would not recommend wasting your money on this product!</li>
    <li> This was the most horrible experience I&#x27;ve had with cosmetic teeth. I was expecting something akin to Imako, but, this was not even close. I guess you get what you pay for. Didn&#x27;t pay much, not using at all. Trash bin is the only place for these. If you want a good cosmetic teeth, choose Imako.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several times and still have not been able to get these to fit right.  If I had no teeth at all, I&#x27;m sure it would be a decent product, but my remaining teeth make it almost impossible to fit these properly - unless you don&#x27;t mind looking like Bugs Bunnie.</li>
    <li> his device cannot fit in a human mouth, the little ledge provided does not provide any stability. When &#x27;softened&#x27; with warm water, there is no effect. I can&#x27;t afford any other solution, and i am missing a front tooth. I was hoping this would help me hide that fact so i could look for another job, and go to church. sadly, that is not to be.</li>
    <li> Was very dissappointed in this product. When I had them on, it looked like the commerical with the dogs wearing dentures. Was very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> instructions are difficult. product broke in half upon opening. had to superglue it. i will not purchase again, contact me to make this right</li>
    <li> I have started my process for veneers. Turn around time is 3-4 weeks. I bought this and imako product. The beads were a joke they don&#x27;t stick worth crap. The ridge that your teeth sit on top of make your smile \\&quot;long\\&quot; I drilled the ridge off with hubbys dremel and bought denture cream. You get what you pay for. They look really natural but still quite horshish.....Mr.ed.... But better than rotten teeth. Save up for your veneers or snap on smile. This hurts after a while but it works.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE, DO NOT FIT, HORSE TEETH!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!! COMPLETE SCAM.  ONLY WAY THESE HORRIBLE THINGS WOULD FIT IS IF YOU HAD THE MOUTH THE SIZE OF A HIPPO!!!!!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!! Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First:  they are too hard, they do not soften enough in the hot water to make it possible for a close fit. There is no way they would fit EVERYONE&#x27;s mouth, not possible.  If your mouth is large, maybe, they would fit somewhat.  Also, they are very thick and protrude considerably...hence the horse teeth look!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second:  There is a hard ridge going along the bottom of the prosthesis which is supposed to give you a secure fit under you own teeth, BUT, this causes a poor fit because you can&#x27;t get them higher in your mouth close to your own gums!!!!  As a result you look ridiculous and they subsequently stick out even more so and really really do look like HORSE teeth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third:  You would have to file them down some how...Seriously???? I ended up throwing them away...Complete waste of money and I am demanding my money be refunded from Amazon.  Just a very very misleading product and advertising!!!</li>
    <li> I expected a lot more than what I got. They did not fit, they stuck out so far it was unbelievable. I could barely close my mouth with them in. I pitched them in the garbage 30 minutes after recieving them. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I tried 5 times to get them to fit in my mouth and i could not get it to work. The teeth are Way too big to fit comfortably in your mouth without sticking your cheeks and lips out looking crazy and I bought the small teeth and i have a big mouth so I do not understand. I read lots of reviews and thought this could be a temporary fix for my cracked tooth until I have the money to get a Veneer but it is awful. awful awful. sorry but it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, very thankful to have , sometimes they break if I drop, but they inexpensive so easy to buy more,  the new ones I have seem more durable and haven&#x27;t broken</li>
