<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is such a cute makeup bag!!!! Which is a big deal for me. And without stuff in it it is very lightweight. It also has pockets to put your makeup products. The only problem I have with it is that it has some weird word all over it, but you cant really tell, but still. Hope this helped you!!</li>
    <li> This bag is just darling, I was very pleased with this bag! It is really good quality too! Love it!</li>
    <li> Very cute but way too small to be of use for travel toiletries.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for everything.</li>
    <li> The entire bag fell apart within days of buying it. The material used for this bag is cheap and easily breaks. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Happen to be a little smaller than I expected but i was still able to store all my make up inside. Love the design its a cute bag.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. I purchased this to hold my manicure items, but of course you can use it for anything. It seems sturdy enough and I really like the color and design. It would make a nice stocking stuffer type gift for anyone.</li>
    <li> Absolutely adorable and high quality - my wife loves it and crams it full of stuff!</li>
    <li> Perfect for all my nail polishes. They all fit perfect n now theres more space in my drawer. I also got it sooner than expected</li>
    <li> I gave it to my Mom. She loves it.  well worth the price. i loved the bright colors n bows! also arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s adorable and has plenty of room for all my stuff, however, the bow fell off the front like two days after I got it and the stitching for the divided pocket inside came undone as well... :/</li>
    <li> Not only can I fit all of makeup in this cute bag but it also has 4 pouches inside the lid for my brushes. The two pockets inside the bag hold my sponges and eye pencil sharpener. I can now keep all of my makeup and accessories in one fashionable bag that still fits in side my barrel bag purse. I would recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> Adorable cosmetic bag! But the quality isn&#x27;t worth the $10. I might just stuff it with tissue paper and display it on my makeup vanity. Won&#x27;t use this pouch because the mirror connected to it came off seconds after I opened the package. Again, love the design but not loving the quality at all.</li>
    <li> This is an adorable little cosmetics bag (I use mine to tote my nail polish around) that looks exactly like the picture. Item is well made from quality materials.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Just kinda small.</li>
    <li> I personally love this bag, its super cute and trendy. Especially because a lot of girls at my school are using these makeup bags as lunch boxes. It  is not a scam and it was delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> At first glance this bag looked really small, but when you open it up and start putting your makeup in it&#x27;s huge! It holds all my stuff so well! And it looks so cute too. Great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome it&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be . So i have plenty of room for more makeup lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. It holds every piece of my makeup that I need everyday! It even holds extra makeup that I rarely use! I would recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute small-medium size I thought It was bigger due to some reviews. I wanted a big bag but other than that it&#x27;s a really cute bag</li>
    <li> I selected this item because I needed a make up bag and it was available cheap due to the Amazon Add On program.  I was not disappointed.  It was very cute and the red is very vibrant.  It was very roomy inside and held a lot more than I thought. Happy with this purchase, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice little makeup bag, perfect for a tween.</li>
    <li> I love the bag just doesn&#x27;t fit everything. But I got it and passed it on to my sister she loved it. Shipping was awesome.</li>
    <li> Super stylish cosemetic bag, totally fashion forward and a must have for all ladies that are goth, classic chic,or modern . All your beauty needs in one place.</li>
    <li> My sister got this bag for me for my birthday a few months ago. I have been using it for holding nail polish which I know is not necessarily what it was meant for. It held up really well until a couple weeks ago. The handle broke. I don&#x27;t think it had anything to do with it being attached poorly so much as I just had to much weight in it. It was a good one!</li>
    <li> cute and holds all of my makeup!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s red, its a bag, it works.</li>
    <li> I loved this but it came ripped&lt;br /&gt;But its just for the meantime</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, &amp; on a Sunday! I love my new makeup bag. It&#x27;s cute &amp; there&#x27;s lots of room for plenty of products. I was waay overdue for a new bag, &amp; this was well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this bag for about a month now and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it. The zippers are difficult at times but don&#x27;t cause TOO much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a lot of moisturizers, face washes, etc., everything you need for a short trip should fit in this pouch. I can easily fit all of my brushes, several foundations, primers, eyeshadow pallets, eyeliners, and mascaras in this pouch and still have extra room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this cute little bag was a great deal.</li>
    <li> she loves it  thanks u so much. The red lil bag is perfect foe girls on the go who have to have fashion</li>
    <li> When I first got it, I thought it was small. I mainly use this when I travel and I can fit a MAC palette in there, some brushes, my clarisonic with a brush head, face wash, argan oil and a day cream. I try to simplify by routine when  I&#x27;m traveling but anyway it is really deep and can accommodate alot. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This item certainly exceeds all epections.  Service was fast.  In fact, I believe this item is better in person , than in the ad.  Would make a really nice gift.</li>
    <li> Came in excellent condition. My sister would love this.</li>
    <li> I liked this so much that I ordered another.  One is for my make-up and one is for my velcro rollers.</li>
    <li> 04/14 -- 5 stars -- I love this bag. I was worried it was going to be too small, but I was able to fit everything I wanted in it, plus more, plus I still have some space left. It&#x27;s just as adorable as pictured. I love all the pockets it has. I just got it today, so if something goes wrong with it, I&#x27;ll update my review, but as of right now, I see no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are just as they look on here and the package arrived when I was told it would. (Took about a week.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;08/14 -- 4 stars -- I do have one complaint now. The elastic that holds brushes or whatever you put in the pockets, is very loose and doesn&#x27;t hold anything in. I keep my (5 skinny) brushes in there and I have to carefully open the bag to keep them all from falling out.</li>
    <li> I love this item. It was just as described and arrived on time. It is big enough to hold all my cosmetic items without being too big and bulky. Fits in suitcase even with items in it for traveling, then folds flat when not in use. It even holds my round mirror that won&#x27;t fit into other containers I have had in the past. Would highly recommend it. Available in a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Adorable make-up bag. I might have to buy another one of these to travel with! Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Not only is the bag cute but it has plenty of storage space for my needs. I would even give as a gift. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I use this to hold my nail polish equipment. It has held up perfectly. No breaks or anything, though beware, it look EXACTLY like the picture does, even that little thread hanging.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I love the look of this bag; it is definitely my taste. I was a little off put by the size at first, but when I started filling the bag, I realized that it has a lot more space than I expected it to! When it&#x27;s empty, you can just flatten it back to the way it was packaged and store it away. As for durability, I have to say it seems pretty reliable, although my bag isn&#x27;t filled to the top and I don&#x27;t really carry it around. I also noticed on the inside that there were two pockets for extra makeup as well as four pockets and a strap for makeup brushes. The pockets for the brushes are a bit too spacious for thin ones, so I recommend putting multiple brushes in one pocket so they&#x27;ll be less likely to slide around or fall out. I also noticed a little mirror that hangs by a strap on the inside, which is nice but it&#x27;s too small to really look into. It would&#x27;ve also been nice if there was a picture of the inside of the bag shown before purchasing,  considering that the color scheme is red and black but the inside is pink. As for quality, there is a fold or two of fabric right on the zipper line (as I&#x27;ll call it), so I plan to carefully cut it off so I can zip the bag shut with no issue. Overall, the bag was worth getting and I adore it.</li>
    <li> It was ship fast, i love the product.</li>
    <li> An adorable little makeup bag with an unusual shape. Quality is ok, nothing outstanding. it&#x27;s on the small side, but I knew that when I bought it.</li>
    <li> I keep my little girl&#x27;s hair ties and bows in here and it works great for that. The lining is hot pink which I did not expect but was fine with it. Works good for just a small inexpensive cosmetic bag and the design is very cute. Love the red.</li>
    <li> Very cute - good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on a whelm not knowing it was perfect for me, not to mention red is my fav color so it&#x27;s the perfect fit. I used it for a weekend getaway and it held PLENTY of my items, I was totally surprised at just how much.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I got new makeup for Christmas so I had to get another makeup bag...That&#x27;s not a bad thing I guess. I saw this one and immediately thought ladybug and decided to order it. Something about it makes me think of summer. And it&#x27;s rather spacious so I might have to get some more new stuff. It&#x27;s a great travel makeup bag though. It fits neatly into my carr on and keeps my makeup from spilling etc.</li>
