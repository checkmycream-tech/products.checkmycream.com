      <li>was new to me..</li>
      <li>This body spray really smells like English Lavender.  </li>
      <li>the price was OK, but the container was very small</li>

<li> Not what I expected sounds odd, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> VERY slight lavender scent.</li>
<li> It is unfortunate one is not able to smell this before buying.  </li>
<li> This smells awful.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Not as lavendery as I was hoping but like it all the same.  It&#x27;s fragrance is rose-like.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I was very  desapointed with this purchase.  Smells like men&#x27;s cologne, not feminin at all</li>
    <li> The transaction was a good one. Fortunately, the seller listed the ingredients within the description which indicated that the scent would not be pure lavender so I was not expecting it to be. Nonetheless, it has plenty of lavender hints and is reminiscent of a walk through an herbal garden on a warm summer&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> Definitely liked but much would rather have an oil spray  also the old yardley shaving loation is no longer available</li>
    <li> It is unfortunate one is not able to smell this before buying.  I thought I would try something different.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  This smells awful.  Like a cross between antiseptic and a bathroom deodorizer.</li>
    <li> VERY slight lavender scent.</li>
    <li> My Yardley of London lavender body spray arrived on time, the scent is soft and clean,I am very satisfied both with the price and the product.</li>

    <li> Not what I expected sounds odd, but it wasn&#x27;t. It was better!</li>
    <li> Smelled great and a good price</li>
    <li> all I can smell is the butane &amp; propane - no lavender!  want to return this.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and just what I wanted</li>
    <li> It did not smell like English lavendar.</li>
    <li> Came as described. Gave it four stars only because the delivery wasn&#x27;t as promised,but after contacting the seller ,it was explained for the delay and delivery was speedy. The seller got back to me very quickly&#x27;</li>
    <li> Really nice but too small to last a long time.</li>
    <li> The scent is very nice, and is strong enough without being cloying. What I don&#x27;t like is that the spray comes out in a big blast. The directions say hold about 6&amp;#34; away but I find I need to hold it about 8&amp;#34; to 10&amp;#34; away, or I get the big blast! I probably would not buy another one but I do like the classic Yardley&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> The spray was OK..the price was OK, but the container was very small so I don&#x27;t think the price I paid was reasonable.</li>
    <li> was new to me..but it did not disappoint has a wonderful lavender fragrance not over powering..was delivered very fast..If you like lavender you will love this..</li>
    <li> Yardley is great lasting fragrance!</li>

    <li> This body spray really smells like English Lavender.  It is not too strong.  I really enjoy using it and get a lot of compliments on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> I must say, this lavender body spray is great. It can be used when exiting the shower, or even as a room air freshner. I find the lavender scent to be very nice. When I make the bed in the morning, I like to spray the top of the comforter with the lavender scent. The scent of lavender is so relaxing.</li>
