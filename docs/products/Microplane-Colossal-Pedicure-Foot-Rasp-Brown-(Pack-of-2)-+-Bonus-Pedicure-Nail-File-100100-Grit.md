<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I keep these in the shower to help get all of the dead skin off my feet.  I keep these in stock. They are very low priced and work, well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Inexpensible product. It works as expected.</li>
    <li> I have very rough feet and this is the best product I have ever bought for my feet! It&#x27;s a bit messy, but it grinds off thick calluses without cutting the skin and my feet look better than they have in a long time. Even bought one for my sister. AWESOME PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product does exactly what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> this product works much better than the $50 product that I purchased.</li>
    <li> Works great on my feet</li>
    <li> i have rough foot and several products i tried over the years. once i bought this all my foot issues are gone. sturdy and best foot rasp..trust me after using atleast 15  different brands i am telling this..</li>
    <li> Works great! Saved me lots of money at the nail salon!</li>
    <li> I am someone who treats myself to professional pedis from time to time! When I go to the salon, they soak my feet and then get all the dead skin off. I saw something similar to this when I went last time. I thought I would try and get all DIY! Well I have to say that I am glad I bought this. It does work, surprisingly. I was a little skeptical at first but it does work. READ the directions that comes with it. Don&#x27;t use when feet are wet as advised in the directions. I tried it when my feet were wet, like they do at the salon, but it didn&#x27;t work as well and my feet were slippery. Wait for your feet to be dry and file a small amount on a weekly/biweekly basis. I got overly excited the first time and went a little over board! I had patches of tenderness for a few days following usage. Lotion feet daily, use this as directed and your feet will be smooth and ready for sandal season:)</li>
    <li> Great product! Gets the job done in half the time as Ped Egg and other style foot tools that are small.  This is best for using on your heel.  It would not work so well on fine areas such as toes.</li>
    <li> I now have the smoothest feet!</li>
    <li> I had been looking a long time for one just like they use at the Beauty Salons for the spa pedicure. This was it or very close to it. It does exactly what it says it will and worked well on my feet and my husband&#x27;s. I used to think dry feet that scratch up the sheets and furniture was a normal lifelong family curse lol, until I had my first pedicure and realized how smooth they can actually be. So this is the perfect solution. I did his feet too and he said it was also relaxing, nevermind all the flakes of dry skin flying all over my arms; the things we do for love lol. Anyway, the pack says it works best to use while the feet are dry which I&#x27;ve done. But I prefer to do it on recently moisturized/damp feet fresh out the shower for less irritation.</li>
    <li> Works great once you realize you can use a good amount of pressure.  Remember to use on dry skin then do your pedi or lotion after.  I will use this from now on.</li>
    <li> Awesome is all I can say</li>
    <li> These foot rasps are well made.  They come in a set of 2 with a small white file. The skin is debrided from the feet as a very fine white powder. In the instructions one is warned not to go over and over and area too many times which could result in soreness of that area.  I did not heed this warning the first time I used the tool and ended up with a very sore left heel.  When I felt the soreness setting in I stopped but continued to use the tool on the rest of my foot and then my right but less aggressively.  I achieved the same overall removal of my calluses and dry skin in all areas but ended up with a sore left heel.  (I put Neosporin Plus on it and covered it with a large bandage which takes care of the pain and keeps it clean while it heals). This is a good tool if used as instructed.  I now put lotion on my feet to maintain the effect which is much improved from the dry, calloused feet I had before I used this tool.  This foot rasp is not recommended for people with diabetes.</li>
    <li> This thing rocks! My heals get ugly in the summer wearing sandals and such - this takes care of that quickly! I had used the PedEgg - it worked, but these are much better!</li>
    <li> It sure works... My feet are still paying the price...&lt;br /&gt;(I scraped too hard) 😭😭😭</li>
    <li> Before trying, or trying another, motorized gadget, you should know that this callus file is not like what you have bought and tried that you got in a department store or pharmacy. I took a chance that this would be better and it really did exceed my expectations. It is not just bigger and easier to hold, it cuts so much better there is no comparison. The cutting surface looks different and it cuts through the callus with ease and speed. I&#x27;m talking a really big difference! Truly makes a hard job easy and satisfying. Wish I discovered this years ago. No more footsy blues for me. ... Highly recommend, honest.</li>
    <li> My husband and daughter both love these.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought several and will buy again.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST foot files ever made! I&#x27;ve tried several products out there that say they work but don&#x27;t! Not these, they def. make the rough skin on your feet feel nice &amp; smooth! Be careful because if you use to much pressure all of your skin can come off! If you take it nice and easy with these files you will be amazed at how much better your feet will look and feel! These files are amazing for dry, rough skin &amp; cracked feet. I highly recommend these files!!!!!! I&#x27;d never buy another pumice stone again or other foot file for that matter!</li>
    <li> Believe the good reviews.  This works unbelievably well.  Don&#x27;t overdo or you&#x27;ll be sore!  The little file that also comes with it is great to tidy up tiny areas.  A product that delivers.  How refreshing.  Too bad our bodies keep creating the calluses.  This easily removes them, but they do return.  Maintenance and moisturizing is the key.  This is truly the best item I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, to battle the ugly thick calluses on my heels, etc.  My PedEgg is history.  No comparison.</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever bought for my calloused feet!</li>
    <li> My mom loved it and won&#x27;t quit taking off her shoes and showing her heels. I like that you don&#x27;t have to but replacements like the ped egg.</li>
    <li> Worked well just don&#x27;t get in the arches of foot</li>
    <li> I have severe calluses on my heels which crack, bleed and are extremely painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PedEgg type products are a lot of work and don&#x27;t do the job efficiently.  Razors can take off too much callus causing injury and bleeding.  This microplane is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 3 minutes to get rid of the calluses leaving my feet smooth and soft.  I then followed up with O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Healthy Foot Cream and apply it each morning when putting on my socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my feet stay soft and the calluses are slow to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a life changer!</li>
    <li> Works well, highly recommend. Easy to use....as far as the size, colossal it is!  Might be an overkill for anyone with petit feet.</li>
    <li> 2nd set i have bought for the wife she says they really do work and i can feel a different in how smooth her feet feel wheni mmassage them i would recommend</li>
    <li> This works really well.  Don&#x27;t use any pressure...just lightly rest it on the dead skin area of your heel, while your feet are dry, and pull/push it across the skin.  You&#x27;ll see flakes of dead, calloused skin come off with each pass.  I rest my foot on the toilet bowl so that the dead skin flakes fall into the water.  This makes clean-up a breeze!  Use once or twice a week until you callouses are gone, then use as needed for maintenance.  Using it prior to getting into the shower is a good regimin, and any remaining flakes will be washed off.  Remember: gentle swipes of this tool is all you need to get rid of the heel callouses.</li>
    <li> It works fine for scraping callouses.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful for getting calluses off my feet and keeping them away!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it advertises.</li>
    <li> NO WORDS, AWESOME, FANTASTIC, THE BOMB, MEGA BOMB, THE SHREDDER ON STEROID&#x27;S - BUT YET SO KIND TO YOUR FEET AT THE SAME TIME !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Make my feet feel like butter.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and brother for Christmas.  Their feet are really bad.  They both say they have baby soft feet now.  I can see a difference with my husband, but he has gone over board.  He does it too much and has made his feet raw...so please be careful.  These are the real deal.  At the salon, they use this when my feet are wet, however, my husband said he uses it, per the directions, on dry feet.  I didn&#x27;t get to see the directions because he tossed them, but I would suggest using it with wet fit like the pros.  Solid construction.  Will last a long time if used and cleaned properly. Great price for the set.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Need to soak your feet first.</li>
    <li> Excellent HD, works well on my feet. Metal Rasp is USA made, handle is made in Mexico I believe.</li>
    <li> Wow! It will remove all your dead skin from your feet in about 10 seconds. Best $10 grooming tool ever.</li>
    <li> Have you bought a pedegg? Or some other foot file? Those are worthless. These are amazing! Dishwasher safe and can be easily sanitized. I&#x27;ve had the hand held version from BB&amp;B for over 5 years and it is good as new. This design is easier to use though as the handle is less slippery.</li>
    <li> Why haven&#x27;t I heard of this sooner???? Amazing tool to get rid of dry skin in seconds.  It is recommended to use on dry skin.  Just don&#x27;t get carried away or you will take off too much.  If you have dry cracked feet, GET THIS!  It works!!  Your feet will be gorgeous in a matter of seconds!!!</li>
    <li> Easy and fast to use. Sturdy</li>
    <li> I wish they come up with super small size so that I can rub it through the neck of my toes.</li>
    <li> As my title suggests, I can now successfully avoid poorly ventilated nail salons which never buff my feet as much as they require. I now routinely gift these to busy mothers who never have a chance to deal with their feet. All share the same opinion: miracle foot file.</li>
    <li> This product actually superceded my expectation. My feet are very happy!</li>
    <li> Love these, they work great for the price.</li>
    <li> Much better than the PED eggs I had to keep buying every few months.  I have an issue with one foot that requires constant care and these are quite awesome and great!  Bought two.</li>
    <li> Great files! I have used many other items to smooth my feet and keep them soft. These really work and last long enough to make me happy. I think they are much better than the battery operated file type which I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Instead of the Asian lady speaking chinese to the other ladies and making me feel bad for having awesome calloused heels, i can do it at home by myself and save face.  Cheap materials but grate the crap outta the heel, go slow or you be walking on your achilles.</li>
    <li> I love these. Just as effective as you&#x27;d get in a professional salon and you don&#x27;t need to use the often contaminated foot baths.</li>
    <li> Just as expected from previous purchase, thanks!</li>
    <li> This file was excellent. I usually go to the nail salon to get my pedicure. The nail tech that normally does my pedicure moved away and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anyone to do as good a job. I tried this foot file and my feet are amazingly smooth. I didn&#x27;t need to soak them before I used it and didn&#x27;t use the chemical remover either.</li>
    <li> Bought this a year ago and works great!  Use it between pedicures!</li>
    <li> I love to be outside and I am always in my hiking/water sandals. As a result my heels were awful. Embarrassing. Pedicures are expensive where I live and the callouses always came back. I spent about 10 min working on my heels with the rasp and they are smooth!! I never thought I would see my heels that smooth again. I prefer using the rasp on dry feet and only go in one direction (a downward motion worked best for me). I had seen these rasp at the salon and they are the same. Totally worth the price. Gave one to a friend that will be thrilled with the results as well.</li>
    <li> One of the better scrubbers out there. I had very poor feet in terms of roughness. My feet were like velcro using certain sheet sets that how bad things were. After 2 weeks or so of using the product moderately I have smooth feet once again. Yes, you can be overly aggressive and actually hurt yourself. Take it slow and steady and they product will shape your feet the way you expect. Don&#x27;t try for smooth feet in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sets this apart is the size of the scrubber. Much larger than most store bought scrubbers and the size allows you to hit more of the foot in a shorter amount of time. Drawback is that the scrubber is not easily portable.</li>
    <li> Wow!  My husband and I jokingly refer to Amazon as my BFF because I get boxes multiple times per week. With that said, I rarely write reviews.....but I&#x27;ve got to tell ya!  This thing is amazing. I read reviews but had my doubts.  My heels started cracking a couple years ago when my shoe attire became flip flops most days of the week.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be scared by the &amp;#34;grater-like&amp;#34; appearance. It can be intimidating.  I used this yesterday when in the shower and was like &amp;#34;Meh, it&#x27;s okay.&amp;#34;  Then I used it tonight when my heels were dry, just sitting around.  The results with my feet dry were amazing and scarey.  The dead skin and callus sloughing off was plentiful.&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution....DO NOT GET OVER ZEALOUS!  Go over your heels and feet lightly. Do not use it until the skin is bright pink! Your feet will be sore. Light frequent use is better than a hacksaw and chisel overhaul.  These are very sharp, very effective and doesn&#x27;t take much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this...you will be impressed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Just like the salons use.  You will be impressed at how well this works. (wet or dry)  Be careful the first time you use this, it is easy to go overboard and take off too much skin to the point of pain :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sharp removes skin like nothing, Price is very affordable the only one thing that I don&#x27;t like doesn&#x27;t have cover so when you shave everything falls all over the place, beside that it&#x27;s little bid bullkie, difficult to store if you have limited space</li>
    <li> These things work great! Yes, they need to be used dry, but that fits my lifestyle just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are instructions cautioning against overuse, and I didn&#x27;t realize how easy it would be to go beyond the point of safety with these. After getting down to tender flesh 1 time, though, you&#x27;ll realize you don&#x27;t need to be too aggressive with these to obtain a great result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I didn&#x27;t realize before buying - and that I really like - is that these work in both directions. I was familiar with the Microplane rasp I use in my kitchen, and it only works in 1 direction. This is different, and perhaps that contributed to my initial overuse.</li>
    <li> Thank you for giving me soft feet again!</li>
    <li> Very happy! Easy to use, does an amazing job, even on my husband&#x27;s feet!!  Will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> ITEM DELIVERED ON TIME, WAS AS DESCRIBED. I LOVE MY ORDER...</li>
    <li> Amazing! Best brush I ever used. Took it out of the packaging and within 10 minutes (my feet were really bad! lol) my feet were smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very few times a year I go to get pedicures, they scrub my feet but never get all of it off because I dont go frequent enough for my feet to be smooth. Now, I went to get a pedicure, I bought this brush with me and had them use it and my feet look amazing!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that you dont have to soak your feet first. You use it anytime you want. Fast and effective. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TY</li>
    <li> Ok lets start off by saying that I couldn&#x27;t believe how nasty my feet were getting and being that I am 23 only I wanted to do something about it. Holy cow does this thing work on your feet. Whether you are old or young this thing is like getting a true personal pedicure in your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this the other day I thought some stuff might come off. Boy was I wrong. It was like raining men became raining callus. It was disgustingly beautiful. My feet are a bit sore now because I used it too much at once. It&#x27;s best to use for a couple minutes each day over time to make sure your feet don&#x27;t become sore but boy does this thing work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and did I mention that this was made in the good ole U.S.A. Imagine that.....we can make a callus remover for your feet here but yet look at how much we get from China. But anyways with the U.S.A. label on it, it really is of great quality. Good job Microplane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this to those who suffer from disgusting callus on your feet. But be warned. Don&#x27;t scrub too hard or your feet will turn into a lobster tail around the heel of your foot!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! So sturdy and strong and totally worth the money. The price is just right, I&#x27;ve paid the same price for similar items and they don&#x27;t last nearly as long and are cheap quality. These are not! I recommend them to everyone. Buy them!</li>
    <li> If you have been using a stone without getting the results you&#x27;re expecting, this might be the solution. It works great and very easily. It&#x27;s hard to overdo it, but possible, so need to be careful on that part</li>
    <li> These are the bomb!  Had been using the ped egg for years but found it difficult to get snug fitting replacement blades.  Be careful though, it works so well, you can easily overdo it.</li>
    <li> Best foot file ever!!  My sister in law let me use hers and I knew I had to have one.It makes my feet really smooth without much effort.I gave the second one to my friend and she&#x27;s hooked on it now.Every woman needs one! No more rough feet for me!</li>
    <li> Does not work don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> Works excellent for me. I wear steel toe boots 100% of the time while at work for 10-12 hours a night 6-7 days a week. Really smoothed my feet out. Good product, excellent buy.</li>
    <li> unbelievable product. so quick and easy!</li>
    <li> get trouble to clean it after using</li>
    <li> This foot rasp works wonders on keeping feet nice and soft without using a razor. Great for when your in between pedicures too. I used it on wet or dry feet without any problems at all and the rasp doesn&#x27;t get dull very easy. You will have lots of uses with this one.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. I have had to struggle with callus for a long time and now I have finally found something that really works and give great results. Highly recommend to anyone to just try for a week and see the results for yourself.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny  !!!</li>
    <li> BEST tool to remove those unsightly heel calluses.</li>
    <li> Got these for my husband&#x27;s dry, flaky, cracked, disgusting feet along with some foot cream.  First time he used it, he could not believe how soft his feet were. He was afraid at first to take off &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; the crud so took layers off over the course of a week. Now, his feet are soft, non-flaky and the heel cracks have disappeared with the use of this and the foot (crack heeling) cream</li>
    <li> Works like magic. Exactly like the professionals use in the salons. Must have!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to go to get a pedicure now. I have really dry skin and rough heels. This cleared everything up in 2 uses. Well worth the price and saved me tons of money from getting a pedicure. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I had tried so many products before this.  This product really is the bomb.  I use this to get the scales off, then I use the micro-pedi to smooth!</li>
    <li> This is the best callus remover ever. Don&#x27;t even get pedicures any more. They can&#x27;t even come close to the results I get, although they use the same thing. It&#x27;s just they don&#x27;t care like I do. But be very careful. Just take off a little at a time until you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I have used the pedegg and the razor in the past but this product puts them to shame. Go easy on the dry feet in the shower or you will have soreness. I do it in the shower because of all the sloughing of the skin. You have to get the hang of it first and then you would need to moisturize the feet afterwards and those old hooves turn into baby feet.</li>
    <li> Love them they work well and my feet are nice and smooth</li>
    <li> Fantastic tool to use for a foot pedicure and removal of callouses. This product is much more effective than the pumice stone.</li>
    <li> These work really great for frequently callused feet.  I would only buy them if your feet need LOTS of TLC</li>
    <li> These were just what I wanted.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> LIKE IT A LOT,WOULD ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use. I have used other similar products but the Micorplane rasp is superior. I would recommend this product for anyone with dry heels.</li>
    <li> My feet callus and these are great to remove dead skin from my heels.</li>
    <li> My heels suck this product is amaxing 10 years of trying everything now my feet are cured</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I have used microplane for many years.......unfortunately, I was born with this skin condition and it would take hours working on my feet and they still didn&#x27;t look that great.....On my birthday  years ago my daughter gave me this...My first thought it wouldn&#x27;t work, was I ever shocked, opened it and started using it....It only took 5 minutes and my feet looked wonderful, the microplane actually took all the dry skin off my feet....If you haven&#x27;t tried it just try it you will be so happy you did....</li>
    <li> Extraordinary rasp--so very glad I purchased  it.  It is so much better than the small hand-held version of foot file.  It&#x27;s a small product that makes life better!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried callus knives, and they were oh-so slow. I tried a fancy sanding machine (the Emjoi), and it was almost as slow, if a little less scary. Then, having had excellent luck with Microplane cheese graters, I decided to try what is essentially the same product on my feet. The Microplane was perhaps three times faster, a big win, or at least I thought so, right up until I tried using the Microplane just after taking a long shower: It cut through the callus like it was cutting through, um, cheese, removing material at 10 times the speed of the other two solutions. Because the skin was wet, the removed scrapings stayed right on the rasp, rather than dropping to the floor, making cleanup a breeze as well. Because each sweep of the rasp was so effortless, it made is easy to judge when just the right amount had been removed. Altogether, it changed a 20 minute nightmare into an under-two-minute almost fun activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought both the Colossal as well as one of the more feminine Microplane designs for my wife. We&#x27;ve both ended up using the Colossal. It&#x27;s easier to use and easier to clean.</li>
    <li> works great gets all that dry skin I like to use it dry!</li>
    <li> Never have I found a rasp that works so well.... a light touch is all you need..and your feet are back to soft ... you wont be sorry you got this one....</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It exceeded expectations and is so easy to use. Will recommend this product to everyone that I know.</li>
    <li> Great buy priced right. The rasp is the best pedicure tool I have ever used! Perfect for keeping your feet nice and smooth between your spa days. This is definitely worth five stars! The instructions include to use when feet are dry. But, just like at the spa, I fine using after you soak your feet provide the best results.</li>
    <li> Love these - works great!</li>
    <li> They work really well. My only complaint would be the grate doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the edge.</li>
    <li> Truly worthy of 5 stars for an impressive callous remover.  If you have thick callouses, this is the unit for you. This works so much better than the method I was using.  I was going to buy the motorized variety, until I found out the rotating cylinder is mineral based, like a grinding wheel.  I had thought the motorized units used a rotating rasp cylinder.  Reviews complained that application of pressure stopped such units from rotating.  I knew the motorized version would be insufficient as I WAS USING A DeWalt Orbital Palm Sander WITH LARGE GRIT SANDPAPER to remove my heavy callouses.  This still took a fair amount of time.  Also, when applying pressure and sanding for a while with the DeWalt, my heel could get painfully hot from the friction.  The Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp is just the right size.  The comfortable handle allows a good grip.  The beveled head allows easy control.  The actual rasp area allows nice long strokes.  Dimension:  Total Length 10.75&amp;#34;; Rasp head overall 5.5&amp;#34; x 2.75&amp;#34;, Rasp teeth area 4&amp;#34; x 1.63&amp;#34;.  The size makes it so much easier to use than the egg variety, which I gave up on in lieu of the Dewalt.  Now the Dewalt can get out of the bedroom and back to the garage.  I am glad I bought the 2 pack, which lowered the price per unit.  Now my wife and I can have our own units.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!  This is what my feet yearned for. I tend to grow skin quite quickly and my feet is just another area that needs exfoliating frequently. (This is so easy to use especially because I put a rope on the end for handling and hanging in my shower.) It removes the sole skin with ease and my feet are so much healthier.  I generally lather my feet with soap and then use this tool.  I like the fact that you get two because its nice to have one in the bath area and one in the shower so I don&#x27;t have a reason to forget to use it.  Yes, I use it just about every time I shower because this way I have NO more thick skin!!  If you have thick and fast growing skin, this is a must.</li>
    <li> Been using this for months.  Works very well...</li>
    <li> Great product. I routinely get a pedicure, but I needed something to keep my feet smooth in between my appointments. Enter the Microplane Foot Rasp. Yes, you do have to be careful with this product, but it does an excellent job. It simply removes calluses and rough skin with ease! This product is sturdy and built to last.</li>
    <li> I mostly wear sandals or go barefoot. My feet were probably the worst on the planet. Dried, cracked, sometimes bleeding. I purchased one of these and it worked great! It went missing and I was kind of relieved because I got tired of thoroughly cleaning/disinfecting more than normal because hubby and I were sharing. I ordered the two pack after weeks of hubby and I both complaining about missing the first one. Now we each have one and my feet are on the road to soft, smooth skin. Calluses are 90% gone in a day and I am very pleased with our purchase! I would NOT use this if you have an open wound on your feet (bleeding cracks) because it works really well and you could make it worse. I WILL buy this again!</li>
    <li> Really good taking those dead skin off your feet. Everyone love this product</li>
    <li> These are my second and third.  Used first one every few days for over a year.</li>
    <li> Works great ! Keeps my feet nice and dead skin free!</li>
    <li> Order shipped quickly,  definitely would order from again.  My Nail-Tech uses these when she does pedicures.  They&#x27;re not to tough on the feet like the razor!!</li>
    <li> Really works.  Who knew?</li>
    <li> Excellent for your feet, leaves it very soft and smooth, highly recommended</li>
    <li> I did not head the warning to take it easy seriously enough!  These things could file the bark off a tree and took care of my nasty cracked heels in short order.  But all it takes is one swipe too many and blood is drawn.  I&#x27;m still giving them 5 stars because they work fabulously, but you have to take it slow and it does not take as much time as you think to get rid of the yucky skin!</li>
    <li> The best thing ever for my feet!  You won&#x27;t go wrong, they last and much cheaper than the other items out there</li>
    <li> I wrote this review about the single one, but I needed to buy more to give these to my friends so their lives can also be made so much better: This product has changed my life! Living in California, I wear flip flops nearly every day. This has resulted in dry, calloused heels that cause fatigued and uncomfortable feet. I have tried pumice stones, lotions, other razor-type products, but have found this to be the best by far! My sister introduced me to it, and it changed her life as well! If you have tired, calloused, yucky heels, this is the product for you. (You won&#x27;t anymore!) You can use it on dry or soaked heels and it will be like you&#x27;ve just had a pedicure. I recommend doing it over a piece of paper or paper towel to collect the gross stuff that comes off.</li>
    <li> This is the best for those rough heel hands down</li>
    <li> This really worked well.  It has only been used once, but that one time has made such an improvement.</li>
    <li> My friends love using it</li>
    <li> I have what I like to call retail feet. This item is great and helped.</li>
    <li> I stand all day always have a build up of  dead skin .... works like a charm in removing everything .... no longer need the spa</li>
    <li> Wow, this foot file is FANTASTIC!!!!!! It is a nice big size to get the large areas of your feet. The file has nice curvature to get heels, bottom of ankles and sides of feet.  I sat in bed with a towel under my foot and buffed away. Every 3 or 4 buffs I tapped the file on the towel to remove the excess dried skin particles. Highly recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> Amazing...does the job quickly and much better than Pedegg.  In my excitement and amazement over this product, I over did it so my heels are sore and tender.  Go easy at first even if you think you can handle it and wait a few hours inbetween to see how your feet feel rather than attempting too much.  Works exactly as it described.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these.  Have been using for a year and what a difference there is.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that will take the caluses off my feet, love it.</li>
    <li> Got it for my hubby who has very dry skin. He never has suck soft feet before! Works for both of us!</li>
    <li> Next-best thing to a belt-sander.</li>
    <li> Does a great job removing that dry, cracked skin from my feet, combined with OPI pedicure foot file--results as good as a salon!</li>
    <li> Excellent device for my calloused feet!  I use it after my shower to remove rough skin.  Good quality, works great.  The rasp arrived quickly and in good condition.  I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Incredible. Works very very well.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Gets rid of your hard calluses and it makes your feet so smooth! My mom and I love it!! Will buy again if/when needed!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, so I knew to use it lightly.  Even the first time using it I could feel the difference.  My husband has very hard calluses that a doctor has to cut off.  (The balls of his feet are gone from working on concrete floors, all his working life.)  I work on his feet every week with battery powdered files but they are just not strong enough.  So I now have added these files, hoping to stop going to the doctor for help.</li>
    <li> great quality and did the job.</li>
</ol>
