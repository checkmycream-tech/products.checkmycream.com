      <li>great price great deal</li>
      <li>This product works great on my niece&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It did, however, became shiny and the frizziness was greatly reduced.  </li>
      <li>But this is a great product.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>i did not notice that it was doing anything great for my hair</li>
      <li>and I suspect it would do a really good job.  </li>
      <li>With some persistence, though, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>To bring out my curls I apply it after a shower right before bed, perfect bedhead in the am.</li>
      <li>Love this company!</li>
      <li>We will be buying more of this product and I would suggest it to others as well!</li>
      <li>That part was a disaster of my own making and in no way the product&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If something is in my hair, so close to my nose, I want it to smell nice.</li>
      <li>and so her hair stays nice looking.</li>
      <li>to be honest i will not use it anymore&lt;</li>
      <li>Although intended for children, I use it on my own \\&quot;adult\\&quot; hair.</li>
      <li>Kind of like glue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;i did try it on my hair more than once to be fair about it</li>
      <li>While it is called styling cr&amp;egrave;me, it is basically a kid&#x27;s version of styling mousse, and while it sets into place nicely it also washes out very easily.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall we are very pleased with this product and we will be looking for more of it rather than the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>scent is pleasant and just fine for either a boy or a girl.</li>
      <li>scent was pleasant to me, but not so fantastic that I wanted to snuffle my hair throughout the day.</li>
      <li>This has a very strong smell.</li>
      <li>She has very fine hair</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it felt more like a sticky lotion</li>
      <li>(it is more than just a coconut smell).  </li>
      <li>We had been using the moisturizer to manage their manes, but I&#x27;m finding this works a lot better.  </li>
      <li>The consistency and texture is ok.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find it elegant, texture-wise</li>
      <li>i love this hair product it holds my hair together well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s interesting is that Just For Me makes another hair milk that I like and use: the Curl Smoother.</li>
      <li>any better than anything else i have ever used&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product, but it needs to be used on thicker hair.</li>
      <li>It also brings out my curls better.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;ll be even better in the wintertime.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I like this product because, well, it is not for me, but I&#x27;m sure it works for someone else.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel safe using it on my hair</li>
      <li>the 5th time i tried it seems like my hair was doing ok with it</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>But this does work perfectly to make soft clean curls.</li>
      <li>It gave me nice texture and good shine, and tamed the hot-roller head that can sometimes happen when I use that particular styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am never buying any products made by Soft &amp; Beautiful again.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my hair, as well, but mostly just on the top to smooth out a ponytail.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a good substitute for the hairspray to give my very curly hair</li>
      <li>Easy to see in a cluster vanity.</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t working for the medium and fine hair in this house.</li>
      <li>This went on fine and did control the frizzies.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d use it at first on days when you&#x27;re not too worried about how the results look, rather than buying it and trying it immediately for a very important occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Luckily, the styling creme washes out quite easily.)  </li>
      <li>My first time using it and getting to like it more as I continue to use it.</li>
      <li>This leaves my hair feeling so good that  it brought it back to life.</li>
      <li>Although the smell is strong when first applied, it does go away after awhile.</li>
      <li>but it dissipates quickly.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft and most importantly it keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of sticky and does have a more chemical smell then the other just for me hair milk products</li>
      <li>My 3 year old daughter has very fine semi-curly hair.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s too easy for me to end up using too much of this, and</li>
      <li>BE AWARE!</li>
      <li>Washed my conditioning comb in HOT water but the stuff is stuck like glue to the comb!</li>
      <li>No matter how much you spread it around on your hands to allow for light application, it sticks to hair like glue.</li>
      <li>As a white mother of biracial girls, I&#x27;ll freely admit that the hair issue was (and sometimes still is) one of the more daunting aspects of parenting.  </li>
      <li>I would extrapolate that if you desire your curly hair to look more like mine (in its natural state) then you might like to try this product.  </li>
      <li>Initially it looked nice when I used it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So while it works decently, I&#x27;m not crazy about it, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be getting another bottle.</li>
      <li>It is best to start off with a very small amount, distribute it through the hair thoroughly, then use a tiny bit more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, it does leave my hair smelling good, and the product pretty much does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, despite high humidity in the area where we live.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good product for black hair and especially for children where a more natural look is appropriate</li>
      <li>Those with lots of curls desiring a little more life to them should be pleased.</li>
      <li>Great product for littler ones without all the harsh chemicals, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It is more for locs, braids and such.</li>
      <li>I wrongly thought the product was to \\&quot;perfect curls\\&quot; . . .</li>
      <li>THAT put me off, first thing.</li>
      <li>This is better suited for someone with coarse hair or dry/frizzy</li>
      <li>Used the CURL PERFECTER today for the first time after wash/conditioning with the</li>
      <li>My son uses it every time he washes his hair to make his bushy coarse hair into cute curls.</li>
      <li>liked using this product in my daughter&#x27;s very long and very curly hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of a chemical smell that was strong enough my husband refused to go into the bathroom after I used it.  </li>
      <li>both have really curly</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>I did not use much of the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m of mixed ethnicity from the Virgin Islands - light skinned, 3b and 3c</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy-to-curly, and I didn&#x27;t notice much enhancement of the curls.  </li>
      <li>I do wish it didn&#x27;t dispense so much product.</li>
      <li>very creamy and gets the job done</li>
      <li>really did not help our curls much at all</li>
      <li>I have thin curly hair and it makes my hair look and feel great.</li>
      <li>too much</li>
      <li>Well, I have straight oily hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to say that I like this product because, well, it is not for me, but I&#x27;m sure it works for someone else.  What on earth am I saying?  Well, I have straight oily hair.  I wrongly thought the product was to \\&quot;perfect curls\\&quot; . . . ha ha.  It does the opposite.  It makes frizzy dry hair straight and full bodied; however, it makes me look like Peewee Herman or Alfalfa of the Little Rascals. I would extrapolate that if you desire your curly hair to look more like mine (in its natural state) then you might like to try this product.  So I can not down this product in my review because it was my bad for choosing the wrong hair product for me.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re feeling pretty mixed about this product around our house. On the one hand, it goes into hair like sunscreen would--it has that same milky white thickness and slightly greasy feel to it, and it actually smells a bit like sunscreen, too. On the other hand, once it&#x27;s blended into wet hair (dry hair took forever and started to feel matted), it does an amazing job of providing hair with a glossy sheen that looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked using this product in my daughter&#x27;s very long and very curly hair. It made her hair shine and it gave us some control. It helped to eliminate some of the flyaways and prevented tangles. While it didn&#x27;t really enhance her curls, it did enhance the waves that come naturally to her hair. My daughter, on the other hand, was put off by the name and the scent (she said she didn&#x27;t want milk in her hair and she didn&#x27;t want to smell like the beach). Applying this to her dry hair was uncomfortable for us both (it doesn&#x27;t glide in smoothly, but has to be worked in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my hair, as well, but mostly just on the top to smooth out a ponytail. I, too, don&#x27;t care for the fact that it has to be worked in. However, once it&#x27;s in, it kept my hair hydrated and controlled. In our recent 110+ temperatures, I&#x27;ve also appreciated that this product does not feel heavy on my hair. I had to deal with the product only once in the morning and then could forget about it. It washed out as well as any other hair care product I use, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this on a daily basis because of that potential for buildup.</li>
    <li> This is a product meant, I believe, for those curly-heads on the far end of the natural hair spectrum.  Otherwise a user may find herself with a rather oily head of hair.  The scent here is lovely and yes, there is plenty of moisturizing going on, but it was too much for my what-I-thought-was-coarse hair, even when using a little (the dime-sized suggestion was too much).  Still, hair was softened, and it&#x27;s a condition that seems to last quite awhile.  For hair manageability, this is a supurb product that really works the hair into doing what you want it to do.  Those with lots of curls desiring a little more life to them should be pleased.</li>
    <li> Whoa! It smelled like a chemical explosion in the bathroom after using this product. I like scent, but this one went too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it does leave my hair smelling good, and the product pretty much does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, despite high humidity in the area where we live.</li>
    <li> I thought Just For Me Hair Milk Curl Perfecter would eliminate the frizz and leave perfect ringlets. All it seems to do is weigh down the hair and take out most of the curl, leaving just a bit wavy. It&#x27;s thick, like a lotion, and I&#x27;d guess it might work better on thicker hair that can take its weight. The plus side is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage the hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top of the container is one of those that you press on one side and the other side with the opening pops up. I continue to have trouble opening mine, like it&#x27;s not aligned correctly and the edge isn&#x27;t free to move up. I usually unscrew it and shake some out, but often too much comes out that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not a fan of the scent. I can&#x27;t put my finger on what it smells like, but it&#x27;s not pleasant to me. It contains floral extracts, and I do smell a little bit of that, but another scent overwhelms it. If something is in my hair, so close to my nose, I want it to smell nice. This product may work well for other types of hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do what I expected of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my daughter who is biracial. I am AA with 4b-z hair lol.It did not do anything for my head. It barely did anything for my daughter&#x27;s hair either. She has a finer texture than mine but it is still really coarse. It smoothed her hair some but would not last more than a few hours. Also dried our hair out. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> It seems to be the trend with the hair milk products is that they are focused on thicker/curlier/wavier hair, and seem to work for those hair types but are hit and miss with other hair types.  This unfortunately seems to be one of the miss on other hair types.  Thick creme, doesn&#x27;t need much, but leaves residue/shininess in hair and while it allows some styling, the downsides (shininess, residue, etc) outweigh it&#x27;s usefulness.</li>
    <li> This cream is rather thick, and has a slightly stick feel to it. I have to wash it off my hands after using. The scent is also a little bizarre: it&#x27;s not a bad smell, so much as not really a pretty smell. Kind of like glue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only need a little bit of this product to tame my frizzies, curls or hair ends...too much and it starts to make my hair look dull. The formulation does work for me, but it&#x27;s simply not the hair product I reach for when I need serum or control. I don&#x27;t find it elegant, texture-wise, it&#x27;s too easy for me to end up using too much of this, and I don&#x27;t like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s interesting is that Just For Me makes another hair milk that I like and use: the Curl Smoother. I&#x27;m sure different people will prefer one over the other. It&#x27;s worth experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have wavy, dark, Caucasian hair of average texture and thickness.</li>
    <li> This product has an extremely strong and unpleasant chemical smell that offended me, my husband, and my children.  I bought it to use on my 2 year old and I would not put something that smells like this on a dog.  It smells like something to be used in an autobody shop.  I don&#x27;t feel safe using it on my hair and I would never use it on a child&#x27;s hair.  I am never buying any products made by Soft &amp; Beautiful again.  Whoever approved this product for sale and marketed it for use on children should be fired.  I would give this product negative 10 stars.  For the reviewers posting about trying this product on their biracial kids hair-newsflash-this product is not typical of other black hair care products.  Find an African-American person and ask them what to buy instead. Please.</li>
    <li> When I requested this product from Vine, I thought that I was meant to be used to coax curl from curl-prone hair.  I misunderstood this product and of course failed to read the directions before I glopped on a dollop of this product that was way more than what the label prescribes for a little kid&#x27;s hair, onto my 22 month-old&#x27;s hair.  Oops.  She was an oily mess for days. That part was a disaster of my own making and in no way the product&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have really long red hair that tends to get dry, frizzy, and dull-looking sometimes, in certain hair styles, and I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try on me.  I put a good quarter&#x27;s worth in my hands and worked the product up from the ends, braided my hair back into two French braids, and flipped the un-braided ends up and into kind of a pouf, and the texture of this product kept my ends from looking dry and frazzled like they usually do.  I also used a smaller amount, and blew my hair out straight and used hot rollers and wore my hair down a couple days, with this product in it.  It gave me nice texture and good shine, and tamed the hot-roller head that can sometimes happen when I use that particular styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my idiocy at misunderstanding what this product is prevents me from speaking about how well it works in its intended usage, but I&#x27;m sort of thrilled with how it works for my off-label application, and I might even be hooked on it.  I think it&#x27;ll be even better in the wintertime.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Just For Me Hair Milk even though I&#x27;m a bit older than the intended users. It is very thick for a milk almost like diaper rash cream but disperses with surprising ease through hair. It loosened and shined my waves and is almost like a perfect marriage between the hold of a pomade and moisture of a gel. It  should be used only on thick, biracial or african hair in my estimation because it is too heavy for fine hair. It worked on my 2c hair, my sister&#x27;s 3a hair and her friends 3b hair. It leaves a sticky film on your hand which may make some people worry about product buildup but have no fear, it washes away with water alone. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This comes out like Elmer&#x27;s Glue and goes on your hair like it too. I&#x27;ve used it on my daughter who has curly flyaway hair. No matter how much you spread it around on your hands to allow for light application, it sticks to hair like glue. It is really tough to wash out and looks like the hair is stringy and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, but it needs to be used on thicker hair. Isn&#x27;t working for the medium and fine hair in this house. Easier to work through wet hair. Tried it on dry and had to shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hydrating and wish we could use it on our hair. Maybe will try again using some of the ideas that other reviewers have suggested. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I picked this up since it stated it could be applied to curly dry hair. I usually apply a bit of mousse to my hair, let it dry, and then if I am going out I with scrunch my hair upside down with some hairspray. I thought this would be a good substitute for the hairspray to give my very curly hair some body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this negative stars, I would. When I went to apply it, I put a little in my palm and rubbed it around and scrunched it in my hair (dry) upside down. It felt like glue! I looked in the mirror and my hair literally had white spots in it. I then tried to wash my hands; the product would not come off! I tried washing my hands for an hour; it was still suck on my hands! I had to drive and with the heat of summer, they stuck to the steering wheel. When I reached my destination, I tried washing my hands again and it was still on my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came home I pulled my hair back and it all stuck together. I did not use much of the product. I tried washing it the next morning and it was like wet glue when I got it wet. I ended up having to cut the ends of my hair since I could not get it combed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the worse product I have used on my hair. I would avoid it at all cost if you have very curly long hair.</li>
    <li> This has a scent that reminds me of a tropical drink  (it is more than just a coconut smell).  This is not for fine hair but rather thick curly locks. The product itself is thick but smooths out with ease.  I like the simple yet distinct packaging.  Easy to see in a cluster vanity.</li>
    <li> A little of this styling creme goes a long, long way.  When I initially tried it, I used way too much and ended up with hair that felt greasy and heavy.  (Luckily, the styling creme washes out quite easily.)  But after a few days, I had a better idea of how much to use, and I avoided using the product near the roots.  My hair is wavy-to-curly, and I didn&#x27;t notice much enhancement of the curls.  It did, however, became shiny and the frizziness was greatly reduced.  The product sometimes left dry hair feeling sticky, or would make wet hair stiff.  So while it works decently, I&#x27;m not crazy about it, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be getting another bottle.</li>
    <li> i love this hair product it holds my hair together well. It is not hard like gel it is soft, and it is not greasy!</li>
    <li> This product works great on my niece&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;This item is made by the Unilever company, a well known company who also makes Axe, and Suave products.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> The smoothing crème was so wonderful in this brand name that I wanted to try the styling crème as well.  I am a white girl with frizzy, dry, curly hair...it was too heavy.  It wasn&#x27;t as heavy as other crèmes I have tried though.  I suspect it would be a nice weight for ethnic hair, but everybody&#x27;s hair is different, unfortunately.  So expensive trying out all these different hair products to find the one, isn&#x27;t it?  So my verdict: for white hair-too heavy-try the smoothing crème in this same brand. I suspect black hair might find this to be about right as it is not so heavy and also has a styling feel to it.  It&#x27;s called a curl perfector and I suspect it would do a really good job.  Hope that helps somebody find a great product, or save some money.  These products have a delicious coconut scent which is so nice!  Love this company!</li>
    <li> This product is not for my head: curly/wavy, thick, and fine hair. It was too heavy, and though it moisturized the curls and reduced the frizz, it stayed damp until the next day--and felt oily on the ends. This is better suited for someone with coarse hair or dry/frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was pleasant to me, but not so fantastic that I wanted to snuffle my hair throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The Just For Me hair products are marketed to younger people with hair typical of those with black sub-Saharan African ancestry but for the most part, they work well for people of any age with other types of hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not really the case here.  Just for Me Hair Milk Hair Milk Curl Perfector is a very thick and oily hair styling cr&amp;egrave;me for thicker, curly to kinky hair, which has a different structure and keratin distribution than thinner, straight hair.  It is noticeably greasy and leaves a bit of a sheen. It has a rather strong scent compared to the other Just For Me hair products that I&#x27;ve tried but it dissipates quickly.  It is best to start off with a very small amount, distribute it through the hair thoroughly, then use a tiny bit more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for black hair and especially for children where a more natural look is appropriate but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for other types of hair.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a next-day hair product for my natural hair for the past six years ever since I grew out my natural hair.  This product says it&#x27;s for wet or dry hair, but when I used it on my dry hair it left my hair dull and dry.  Initially it looked nice when I used it but when my hair dried, it was dull and dry/itchy.  My search continues...</li>
    <li> Although intended for children, I use it on my own \\&quot;adult\\&quot; hair. This styling cream does wonders for my hair which is prone to frizzing in the summer humidity. I just add a small amount to my damp hair and style. To bring out my curls I apply it after a shower right before bed, perfect bedhead in the am. Thick and creamy, but does not leave my hair greasy like other products.</li>
    <li> This went on fine and did control the frizzies.  It does work best on hair that is thick - it will weigh down nearly any other hair and pull the curl right out.  But I have to admit that I just didn&#x27;t like the scent at all.  It&#x27;s sort of a chemical smell that was strong enough my husband refused to go into the bathroom after I used it.  I think this will be an either &#x27;love it&#x27; or &#x27;hate it&#x27; type of deal breaker.</li>
    <li> As a white mother of biracial girls, I&#x27;ll freely admit that the hair issue was (and sometimes still is) one of the more daunting aspects of parenting.  My daughters have the worst possible combination of my wavy, silky, crazy hair and my husband&#x27;s tight curls.  We&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Just For Me\\&quot; line of products from very early on and they have been lifesavers, but we hadn&#x27;t tried this particular styling cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of my daughters, particularly not the younger one, like having their hair styles, so we very often just keep their hair short and natural.  We had been using the moisturizer to manage their manes, but I&#x27;m finding this works a lot better.  First, it can be applied to dry or wet hair, so I don&#x27;t always need to wash or wet their hair first.  Second, it seems to take a much smaller amount of product to do the same job.  Third, it blends into the hair much better without leaving white streaks that are nearly impossible to work in.  And finally, it just feels much lighter and less oily, while still adding control and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we are very pleased with this product and we will be looking for more of it rather than the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My sister is mixed and she has a hard time with finding products that will work with her hair. The Just For Me Hair Milk Styling Creme takes care of her hair without leaving her hair looking greasy like so many other products tend to do. We will be buying more of this product and I would suggest it to others as well!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best product just for me has. This leaves my hair feeling so good that  it brought it back to life. Not a product to use everyday but it brings your hair back to life. It also brings out my curls better. Smells go a little bit greasy going on but will dry and not be as oily.Great for minority hair I have thin curly hair and it makes my hair look and feel great.</li>
    <li> This is a product that works, but you might need to go a few rounds before you feel like you have a handle on applying it. I&#x27;d use it at first on days when you&#x27;re not too worried about how the results look, rather than buying it and trying it immediately for a very important occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very creamy and gets the job done, it&#x27;s just that it isn&#x27;t that hard to go too heavy in one spot, and then it&#x27;s tough to smooth things out and make the overall result even. With some persistence, though, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter loves this.  While it is called styling cr&amp;egrave;me, it is basically a kid&#x27;s version of styling mousse, and while it sets into place nicely it also washes out very easily.  Great product for littler ones without all the harsh chemicals, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this instead of the curl smoother..It makes your hair really stiff...I guess it&#x27;s good if you like to have hard stiff hair you can&#x27;t run your fingers through</li>
    <li> I like this product. My first time using it and getting to like it more as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Ths product was not for me, It left the hair feeling very oily and messy even with a little bit of usage.</li>
    <li> BE AWARE! There are 2 vastly DIFFERENT products that have the SAME labeling BUT one is the CURL SMOOTHER and the other is the CURL PERFECTER. That out of the way, I tried them both. I&#x27;m of mixed ethnicity from the Virgin Islands - light skinned, 3b and 3c hair with waves at my scalp, thick dense curls mixed in with corkscrew curls. Recently been learning more about embracing my NATURAL hair thanks to a few excellent black haircare sites and have been sampling various products to learn what works or not. The CURL SMOOTHER? A bit too light for my thick resistant hair even when combined with the LEAVE IN/DETANGLING spray. Curls? Not so much. Now here&#x27;s where I flipped out: Used the CURL PERFECTER today for the first time after wash/conditioning with the Just For Me shampoo and the conditioner and DETANGLER. The PERFECTER smells, uhm, well like an industrial-type product; like a glue we use in carpentry. THAT put me off, first thing. Second was that it ADHERED to my hair LIKE glue and I tried to comb it through but resulted in panicking when I realized that the stuff was NOT letting my conditioning comb through. THIS IS NOT A CURL CREAM! It is more for locs, braids and such. Tried rinsing it out but it wouldn&#x27;t come out. Had to shampoo TWICE again to get it out and even then it left behind some residue. Washed my conditioning comb in HOT water but the stuff is stuck like glue to the comb! If you want curls the CURL SMOOTHER is what you may want. If you&#x27;re braiding, twisting, etc. the CURL PERFECTER may work. But be prepared to have to wash it out several times when untwisting or whathaveyou. I immediately went back to my Cantu Curl Moisturizer to save the day.</li>
    <li> This product is very thick and has a good hold. I use it when I want to slick my daughter&#x27;s hiar back for braids or pony tails so she doesn&#x27;t have all them flyaways and so her hair stays nice looking. She has very fine hair so it&#x27;s hard for it to keep that &#x27;wet&#x27; look and this does it. It&#x27;s kind of sticky and does have a more chemical smell then the other just for me hair milk products but after it goes on the chemical smell goes away and it smells like coconut which is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Tried this product on both my hair and dd&#x27;s hair&lt;br /&gt;we both have really curly/wavy hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neither one of us cared for this product&lt;br /&gt;it felt more like a sticky lotion&lt;br /&gt;and really did not help our curls much at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did try it on my hair more than once to be fair about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally the 5th time i tried it seems like my hair was doing ok with it&lt;br /&gt;at least that last time i never washed it out right away&lt;br /&gt;but to be honest i will not use it anymore&lt;br /&gt;because i did not notice that it was doing anything great for my hair&lt;br /&gt;nothing any better than anything else i have ever used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sorry this just did not work for either of our style of hair&lt;br /&gt;not something i would tell others to try</li>
    <li> This has a very strong smell. I&#x27;m not sure I like it. The consistency and texture is ok. The product is decent and works well, the smell is just off putting.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter has very fine semi-curly hair.  This product was much too heavy for her hair, even when used in a tiny amount.  Her hair is normally bouncy with long ringlet curls, but this made her hair look lank and it dulled her normal light blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that this product would work better on people with African, biracial, or thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I wear my hair naturaI and  tried a lot of products for my twist. Keeps my hair soft and most importantly it keeps my hair moisturized. My curl twist comes out  perfect every time. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot. A little dab will do ya. I have short hair and this product last me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> great price great deal</li>
    <li> I needed something for my daughter&#x27;s hair to hold down her edges. This product does the job; however, there is a terrible chemical smell. Although the smell is strong when first applied, it does go away after awhile. I&#x27;m debating on whether or not to finish the bottle or just throw it away. I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
    <li> happy with it on hair for kids</li>
    <li> This is great. My son uses it every time he washes his hair to make his bushy coarse hair into cute curls. It is a little to heavy to use without washing it out. It builds up and becomes sticky. But this does work perfectly to make soft clean curls. It doesn&#x27;t make a mess on clothes, hats, furniture or pillow cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and just fine for either a boy or a girl. I do wish it didn&#x27;t dispense so much product. It makes some waste. But this is a great product.</li>
