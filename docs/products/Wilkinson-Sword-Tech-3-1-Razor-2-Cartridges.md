      <li>These are as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>A favorite razor which was a great find.</li>
      <li>but there are no longer any refills available!</li>
      <li>I love this razor and blades.</li>
      <li>The prices and selection are great and it takes literally seconds to complete my transactions.</li>
      <li>I prefer the weight of the original handle, so stripping the blades off the cheap ones works.</li>
      <li>Without question the very best shave time after time as the blades seem to go longer than other blades even higher priced ones.  </li>
      <li>shaves very very close.</li>
      <li>months later: I continue to use the Wilkinson Sword system and am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Thanks will order again.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy unless you plan to buy the whole razor each time.</li>

      <li>at the high price and decided to take action!  </li>
      <li>This is far, far better than the more expensive Gillette Mach 3 blades.</li>
      <li>I must have looked for a new Tech 3 in 40+</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve shaved for 65 years and it&#x27;s clear to me that Gillette is ripping people off with sub-standard blades.</li>
      <li>I am new to Amazon Prime and now use it regularly for virtually all of my needs.</li>
      <li>I feel kind of bad about spending less money for a lot more packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
      <li>I,am very pleased,the blades are really sharp  the old craftsmen ship is still the same.</li>
      <li>Blades are 1and 1/2 times more expensive then my old Wilkerson two blade razor.</li>
      <li>Comfortable shave but not good in the detail department.</li>
      <li>, that took me far too long to act on!</li>

<li> I wanted to say they were hard to find, or unavailable at my local Walmart.</li>
<li> Poor shaves, can barely get two shaves per blade!  </li>
<li> The damn tech 3 sensitive blades can be twisted off and put on these handles.</li>
<li> stores over the past 24 months to no avail.</li>
<li> Hard to find now that Walmart stopped carting them.</li>
<li> Got tired of the escalating price of razor blades.</li>

    <li> A favorite razor which was a great find. Came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> My last name is Wilkinson which is the only reason I bought this. Its actually a very good razor. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Wilkinson from now on both on a pride and a quality standpoint.</li>
    <li> very good value.  works great. shaves very very close. would purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;works better than the other blades. woud recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I used wilkinson sword blades in the 60,s now that I found them again I,am very pleased,the blades are really sharp  the old craftsmen ship is still the same.</li>
    <li> as described, good product.  Amazing delivery!</li>
    <li> I wanted to say they were hard to find, or unavailable at my local Walmart. For those uninformed, this was a Walmart exclusive loss leader. After a month of the blades not being stocked I looked at the disposables. The damn tech 3 sensitive blades can be twisted off and put on these handles. Eight frickin&#x27; blades for six bucks, but you throw away an even bigger chunk of plastic. I feel kind of bad about spending less money for a lot more packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Sam&#x27;s Club has been selling 20 packs of the disposables at $20 for some time now. I prefer the weight of the original handle, so stripping the blades off the cheap ones works.</li>

    <li> Too bad more local stores sold the razor. I can get cartridges at Walmart, and they are lower costing than those other big name blades, but for me don&#x27;r do the job as well as Wilkinson.</li>
    <li> Comfortable shave but not good in the detail department.</li>
    <li> Without question the very best shave time after time as the blades seem to go longer than other blades even higher priced ones.  This product should have never been taken off retail shelves. Great value.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and great product. Received product really fast. Thanks will order again.</li>
    <li> Love the shave I get with these EXCELLENT razors. Why are they discontinued???</li>
    <li> The Wilkinson Sword Tech 3 is the best razor I have ever used. It delivers consistently better shaves than any other brand.</li>
    <li> This is far, far better than the more expensive Gillette Mach 3 blades. I&#x27;ve shaved for 65 years and it&#x27;s clear to me that Gillette is ripping people off with sub-standard blades. Why pay more for less? These are as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four months later: I continue to use the Wilkinson Sword system and am completely satisfied. The Gillette&#x27;s are a total rip-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even later: A refill last about 2 months. The Gillette Mach 3 refills last 2 weeks. I suspect I will be using this Wilkinson Sword system for the rest of my life. I&#x27;d be stupid not to.</li>
    <li> They are great! And so affordable compared to all the other brands. Hard to find now that Walmart stopped carting them.</li>
    <li> Got tired of the escalating price of razor blades. I have used Gillete blades for years but I finally&lt;br /&gt;balked at the high price and decided to take action!  I purchased a Wilkinson Sword Tech 3 for&lt;br /&gt;far less $$s, and the quality, endurance and results are the same if not better than Gillete. This&lt;br /&gt;was a no-brainer, that took me far too long to act on!</li>
    <li> Kind of flimsy and instructions were not very good. But they work.</li>
    <li> Finally Found! I love this razor and blades. I stocked up on blades during a sale 2 years ago and lost my final (of 3)&lt;br /&gt;Tech 3 razor shortly after. I must have looked for a new Tech 3 in 40+ stores over the past 24 months to no avail. I finally decided to check Amazon and there is was. I am new to Amazon Prime and now use it regularly for virtually all of my needs. The prices and selection are great and it takes literally seconds to complete my transactions. My discovery of Amazon has been a life changer!</li>
    <li> Great razor but there are no longer any refills available! Don&#x27;t buy unless you plan to buy the whole razor each time.</li>
    <li> Great blade, but try finding refills.</li>
