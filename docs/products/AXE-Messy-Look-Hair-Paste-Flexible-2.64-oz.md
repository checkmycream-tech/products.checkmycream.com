      <li>Much better alternative to gel.</li>

      <li>The stiffness is perfect compared to other products.</li>
      <li>Easy to style and easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>so far, axe whatever look is the best product i have tried so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Think I&#x27;ve covered it all, but I will update this review if I think of anything else relevant to say.</li>
      <li>Easy to use the right</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used SO MANY hair products in searching for something I really like.</li>
      <li>You can use a little or a lot, depending on the look you&#x27;re going for, and it still gives great</li>
      <li>Item was perfect, and it actually arrived a day before the expected time frame provided.</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>Great product overall, for best results, use on DRY hair not wet or slightly wet hair.</li>
      <li>I realize it&#x27;s somewhat of a super positive review, but that&#x27;s how reviews go,</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it I was really turned off because it felt super greasy</li>
      <li>If you like hair paste or glue with a \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look - you will likely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>At first nothing worked for me.</li>
      <li>Then I took more care of my hair and finally styles began to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a stiff putty, which is cool.</li>
      <li>I find with most other pomaded, gels, puttys and clays that they don&#x27;t last more than 3-4hours ...</li>
      <li>It holds strong, enough hours into the day I can re-style it with what&#x27;s already in and it will still hold.</li>
      <li>While the jar looks particularly large, as soon as you get it, you&#x27;ll realize you&#x27;ve been had.</li>
      <li>they start out working very well</li>
      <li>I realized I used way to much</li>
      <li>Very deceptive marketing.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s really picky about the products he will use, but he repurchases this time and time again.</li>
      <li>This product works ok, but I noticed you most likely need to have thick short hair on top.</li>
      <li>It was even more expensive in certain areas of amazon, however; this was an incredible deal compared to other stores and locations.  </li>
      <li>When I get the amount just right, my hair looks completely natural with nothing in it.</li>
      <li>This gives my hair a much better look than any other product I have found</li>
      <li>I had a small sample bottle of this particular paste, as I really liked it.</li>
      <li>With the axe messy look I find my hair stays put the entire day because it almost leaves it feeling greasy but in a good way that I know my hair isn&#x27;t going to move around.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products to style my hair, the last one being tigi bedhead.</li>
      <li>This is pretty much the only product my husband will use on his hair.</li>
      <li>Want a more messy and clumpy look?</li>
      <li>I go for the faux hawk look pretty regularly</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super windy out, I only need 10 seconds in front of a mirror to fix my hair by hand once I&#x27;m back indoors.</li>
      <li>This product was extremely old when sent to me.  </li>
      <li>While I am not bald, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick on top as the sides.</li>
      <li>I only took off 1 star for the price of the item being higher than at my local store</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super thick, so way too much can look greasy.</li>
      <li>(I have pretty short hair - 1 inch long).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obvious I have something in it because my hair sticks up when styled, but it looks natural.</li>
      <li>I personally like it as a female because I can still run my hands through his hair and not feel like my hands are getting sticky from product, and also because his hair is still soft and natural unlike with gel.</li>
      <li>It dries out quickly and loses effectiveness.</li>

<li> It dries out quickly and loses effectiveness.</li>
<li> black round past messy look smells great and cheaper and healthier</li>
<li> The problem I had with tigi bedhead was that it was hard to control exactly how much product I put in my hair and it was difficult to completely remove it, even after showering.</li>
<li> all the way to long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Also my hair is about 2inches on top and while it holds well, your unable to really mess with it, after the product works itself in.</li>
<li> its ok, a little difficult to rub in but it works.</li>
<li> (I apply the paste to my hair when its nearly dry).  </li>
<li> Whatever on DRY hair.</li>
<li> It can dry out a little in the container as you get towards the last of it.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just want a little extra control?</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve wasted lots of money trying out different products but nothing comes close to this one.</li>
<li> Not so stiff as regular hair gel.</li>
<li> I do recommend adding a few drop of water to your hands after you&#x27;ve rubbed the product between your hands if you hair is already dry.</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; inside was not only extremely hard, but looked like someone was poking at (and perhaps) used the paste inside.  </li>
<li> and my hair looks messy by the end of the day.</li>
<li> if you wanna keep ur hair dont use this crap dry up too fast and smells like banana come on try</li>
<li> Not so oily and slick as pomade like Slick Works or Tres Flores.</li>
<li> You can get your hair to look the way you want without making it shiny and hard</li>
<li> it loses it hold</li>
<li> Second day hair doesn&#x27;t look too bad either when using Whatever.</li>
<li> Not a good product</li>
<li> /&gt;Update: After using Axe Whatever for going on a year now, my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten \\&quot;tired of it\\&quot; like some products.</li>
<li> We either like something enoughto write it up, or we hate it enough to warn others..</li>
<li> So hard its impossible to emolsify</li>
<li> Not in a dirty way.</li>
<li> I find all their products smell bad.</li>
<li> I hate everything about axe.</li>
<li> and it smells horrible.</li>
<li> and this is the worst.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The paste to replace your existing products. Washes out of your hair so much better than others. My hairdresser was like your hair feels softer. I knew why...</li>
    <li> Item was received as advertised.. I only took off 1 star for the price of the item being higher than at my local store but I always forget to buy it so i made sure one night shopping online.. Product was as advertised and it great!</li>
    <li> The only hair product my husband will ever use.  He gives it 5 stars too.  Has a great smell and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I go for the faux hawk look pretty regularly and I don&#x27;t have very short hair so I need a product that isn&#x27;t hair cement but that will keep my 4-5 inch faux hawk flying. This is the best. I do recommend adding a few drop of water to your hands after you&#x27;ve rubbed the product between your hands if you hair is already dry. Also, you MUST keep the lid on it.  It dries out quickly and loses effectiveness. Great product.</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;m a very vain guy and I must look good. At first nothing worked for me. Gel sprays waxes. Then I took more care of my hair and finally styles began to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For short hair I&#x27;d use gatsby wax, but with longer hair this axe wax does the trick. Easy to style and easy to wash off. Great job</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the only product my husband will use on his hair. He&#x27;s really picky about the products he will use, but he repurchases this time and time again. I personally like it as a female because I can still run my hands through his hair and not feel like my hands are getting sticky from product, and also because his hair is still soft and natural unlike with gel.</li>
    <li> It holds strong, enough hours into the day I can re-style it with what&#x27;s already in and it will still hold.</li>
    <li> This product was extremely old when sent to me.  The &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; inside was not only extremely hard, but looked like someone was poking at (and perhaps) used the paste inside.  Avoid shopping from this seller and just go to a store and pick one up yourself</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I know its for men but it works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> So glad to have found Axe Whatever. This is some excellent hair product. You can use a little or a lot, depending on the look you&#x27;re going for, and it still gives great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just want a little extra control? Rub a bit on your fingertips (I use both hands), then just muss your hair a bit by running your fingers through it. You&#x27;re done. Want a more messy and clumpy look? Use a coin or a fingernail to get a larger amount of product out of the container. Rub it between the fingers you&#x27;re going to be styling with, and apply. Start at the roots and work up. It&#x27;s super thick, so way too much can look greasy. No need to overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used SO MANY hair products in searching for something I really like. Axe Whatever beats them all. Not so stiff as regular hair gel. Not so wispy and flyaway as spray gel or hairspray. Not so oily and slick as pomade like Slick Works or Tres Flores. Second day hair doesn&#x27;t look too bad either when using Whatever. It even works better for me than Waxworks from Paul Mitchell, at about a quarter of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s super windy out, I only need 10 seconds in front of a mirror to fix my hair by hand once I&#x27;m back indoors. The control is that good, and it remains pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice. Hint of coconut. Smells similar to Nexxus Humectress. It&#x27;s kind of a stiff putty, which is cool. Easy to use the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to have the added side effect of making my hair grow faster, and I&#x27;m not the only one to notice. Maybe it&#x27;s protecting my hair better, or it needed some ingredient this has. I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s healthy. I&#x27;d recommend this to just about anyone, male or female. It works great on anything longer than a buzz cut, all the way to long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think I&#x27;ve covered it all, but I will update this review if I think of anything else relevant to say. I realize it&#x27;s somewhat of a super positive review, but that&#x27;s how reviews go, right? We either like something enoughto write it up, or we hate it enough to warn others..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using Axe Whatever for going on a year now, my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten \\&quot;tired of it\\&quot; like some products. It&#x27;s still the best hair control stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: Well, they charge more for this stuff now. Which I don&#x27;t like. But I still buy it, because it&#x27;s the best. It can dry out a little in the container as you get towards the last of it. Put a drop or two of water in there, and it stays usable all the way to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use Axe Whatever on DRY hair. I&#x27;ve seen it said to try it on damp hair, and that doesn&#x27;t work well for me at all. Try it both ways, and see what works best for you.</li>
    <li> I had a small sample bottle of this particular paste, as I really liked it. The paste itself is very good. What offended me was the packaging. While the jar looks particularly large, as soon as you get it, you&#x27;ll realize you&#x27;ve been had. It weighs nothing, because their is a much much smaller inner jar within the outer jar. Very deceptive marketing.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:6a4af49ef99b14e39e47b44df520c422]] Paste was rock solid upon opening (see video). Sold by: Ohwholesaler&lt;br /&gt;Will update my review when I receive the product in the condition it probably should be in.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!  It will make you lose hair.</li>
    <li> its ok, a little difficult to rub in but it works.</li>
    <li> This product works ok, but I noticed you most likely need to have thick short hair on top. While I am not bald, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick on top as the sides. Also my hair is about 2inches on top and while it holds well, your unable to really mess with it, after the product works itself in.</li>
    <li> Much better alternative to gel. You can get your hair to look the way you want without making it shiny and hard</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this is my go to hair product. I hate everything about axe. I find all their products smell bad. I have to admit though that no one can touch their hair gels . I&#x27;ve wasted lots of money trying out different products but nothing comes close to this one. The first time I tried it I was really turned off because it felt super greasy and I didn&#x27;t use it for 2 weeks after that. I realized I used way to much and now it&#x27;s my favorite hair product . I find with most other pomaded, gels, puttys and clays that they don&#x27;t last more than 3-4hours ...they start out working very well but after running my fingers threw my hair and stuff it loses it hold and my hair looks messy by the end of the day. With the axe messy look I find my hair stays put the entire day because it almost leaves it feeling greasy but in a good way that I know my hair isn&#x27;t going to move around. Not in a dirty way. By far the best product. Must give it a try</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products to style my hair, the last one being tigi bedhead. so far, axe whatever look is the best product i have tried so far. It does not make your hair crusty like gel. When I get the amount just right, my hair looks completely natural with nothing in it. It&#x27;s obvious I have something in it because my hair sticks up when styled, but it looks natural. You can also restyle it whenever you want throughout the day. The stiffness is perfect compared to other products. It is very pliable and creates the perfect \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look. The problem I had with tigi bedhead was that it was hard to control exactly how much product I put in my hair and it was difficult to completely remove it, even after showering. the whatever paste has neither of these problems. I would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> I purchased a trial size of this stuff from a store a while back and hadn&#x27;t tried it until 2 months ago.  After using this hair product, I will never go to another type of gel or hair glue.  This gives my hair a much better look than any other product I have found (I apply the paste to my hair when its nearly dry).  My trial size was .5 ounces and lasted me around 2 weeks (I have pretty short hair - 1 inch long).  I was looking every where for this paste, however; it was extremely expensive in stores and on most website&#x27;s.  It was even more expensive in certain areas of amazon, however; this was an incredible deal compared to other stores and locations.  If you like hair paste or glue with a \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look - you will likely LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Item was perfect, and it actually arrived a day before the expected time frame provided. Great product overall, for best results, use on DRY hair not wet or slightly wet hair.</li>
    <li> Its too pricey and drys ur hair to point that it falls off!! Not a good product if you wanna keep ur hair dont use this crap dry up too fast and smells like banana come on try got to be black round past messy look smells great and cheaper and healthier</li>
    <li> good price and product</li>
    <li> So hard its impossible to emolsify and it smells horrible. I have tried so many claays and this is the worst.</li>
