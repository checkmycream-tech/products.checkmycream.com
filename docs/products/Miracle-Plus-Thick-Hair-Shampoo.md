<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was trying to decide for months whether to purchase this product. So many don&#x27;t do what they promise,but this shampoo lives up to advertising praise. It leaves hair soft and fuller as if you have more hair than you really do.This was my second bottle and I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly. I loved the way it changed the feel of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. It thickens my hair consistently.</li>
    <li> for my wife, she likes it.</li>
    <li> I have not used it long enough to see a lot of difference but so far I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cookie</li>
    <li> It looks like it is helping my friend so I&#x27;m trying it myself.  Does feel like my hair is a little thicker.  We both will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> After reading so many raving reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Well I was sadly disappointed.  First off, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open the cap. I pulled and then I twisted but it needs instructions to explain the right way of opening it. Needless to say, it broke upon one of my attempts to open it, thus rendering it extremely frustrating to use. And then it was even more frustrating when it did not work. I have thin blonde hair and needed just a little bit of volume, but alas. I still have thin blonde hair. I don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews, but this one needed to be done so others could be saved from purchasing the shampoo that will only give you disappointment.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is too runny and it dries the scalp and hair and made the fore head turn red and</li>
    <li> Did not make my hair even remotely thicker. Oh well...</li>
    <li> I cannot say for sure if the product really does reduce hair loss, but I seem to notice less hair on the drain after a hair wash with it. So I will go on using it and would have to say that, for me, it does seem to help.</li>
    <li> To many chemicals not enough to support hair growth. I basically didnt even finish using this product b/c it just didn&#x27;t look good when I opened it and it had color dye in it... who needs that?</li>
    <li> At first I was not excited at all in buying this product but I was wrong. After using this for a month or so I noticed that a lot of small hair are growing. And it did continue growing. I recommend this product for everyone who wants to try them.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, after running out of this product... it took about a month before I noticed my hair was thinner... I need to get more!</li>
    <li> I guess I set my hopes too high.  I like the shampoo but I didn&#x27;t see the results I was hoping for.  I guess my hair might be too thin to see the best results.  Oh well, I guess I now know that I need something stronger.....my physician.</li>
    <li> My mother in law just loved this product, because at her age her hair has become thinner and fly away. This produce has helped give fuller richer head of hair.</li>
    <li> Had bought this product from Publishers Clearing House (PCH) and when it came time to buy more I had a terrible time finding it.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally thought to look here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was beginning to get thin, due to some of the medicine I have to take [I am sure getting close to 60 years old has nothing to do with it!  ;-) ]  and having always had thick hair it was very hard on my ego.  I bought this shampoo from PCH on a whim and found I loved it.  I am not sure it helped with the growth, but I do know it made my hair thicker.  I began to get new growth and found I had a lot fewer split ends. Fewer split ends means less breakage ... so I suppose faster growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the reviews someone commented on this shampoo being thin or watery.  I found I had to be careful when pouring it into my hand.  A little bit does wonders!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working a litle, but not as well as I hoped for.</li>
    <li> use it everyday and it seems to help</li>
    <li> I tried this product some months ago and was AMAZED at the result. By the Second use my hair felt thicker and I saw new growth in bald areas. Today my hair is thicker and longer. This is really a miracle product. I recommended to my friend and she also is seeing great results. Am a believer. And best of all, ire MADE IN AMERICA !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome! My hair stopped falling so badly as it was before. I can tell for sure that there is much more volume in my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it all right, but the smell leaves much to be desired.</li>
    <li> Nothing is going to be a miracle, but for me, with very fine hair, this shampoo comes about as close as possible.</li>
    <li> This product works like it says it does! A wonderful testimony in today&#x60;s market when things that are supposed to perform miracles, but don&#x60;t!</li>
    <li> am very pleased with this shampoo - gives volume to my hair</li>
    <li> Clean smelling scent; nicely sudsy; gets hair clean and leaves it full bodied.</li>
    <li> My hair seemed to be thinning and looking sparse and lifeless. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I just used it regularly and then one day just noticed how much hair I seemed to have! I was delighted and ordered two more bottles! The effects just &amp;#34;snuck&amp;#34; up on me and I will continue to use this product.  I have even recommended it to my male friends since it is just shampoo--so give it a try and forget about watching for effects and then voila!!!.... Thicker appearing hair....what&#x27;s not to love!</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work for me. Haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth or any real benefits from using this. Disappointing especially since I bought this because of the reviews.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well.  You don&#x27;t need to use much at all because it lathers so much.  My hair looks great after using this.  I see a difference in my thin hair.  It looks and feels a little fuller.  I use the Volumizer after shampooing before I blow dry my hair !</li>
    <li> My  hair felt thicker immediately.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Wonder I f other reviews are from the people that manufacture it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and was delighted to find it in a large bottle and at a good price.  It makes such a difference with my fine hair and I highly recommend it to anyone with the same issues.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this is such a great product I felt I needed to let people know.I have always had thin hair and now that I am getting older I was starting to have areas that were really thinning out. I baught this shampoo in hopes that it would help the thinning areas. Not only did it help it has made my whole head thicker and more beautiful. I went to get my hair cut and the girl told me I have \\&quot;thick, healthy hair\\&quot; I have ordered my 2nd bottle and plan on using this shampoo for the rest of my life. It is awsome.</li>
    <li> I love this, and yes it works very well.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I have been using it now for a couple of weeks and feel it is already making a difference.</li>
    <li> I think it is working well.</li>
