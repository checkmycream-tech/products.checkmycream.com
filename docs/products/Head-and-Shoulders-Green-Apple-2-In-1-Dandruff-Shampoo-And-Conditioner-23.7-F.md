<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Ordering this was an accident but Ilove the fragrance and it definitely takes care of dry scalp issues. Also the conditioner helps but is not a substitute for added conditioner.</li>
    <li> Good quality and cheaper than I can get in stores</li>
    <li> This product smells like apples. I dont know what else to write, its great, its exactly what youmwould expect from ordering shampoo</li>
    <li> Until I cut my hair all off, I used this exclusively.  Great smell and seemed to do the job well.  I liked it.</li>
    <li> Smells Great and leaves me feeling fresh out of the shower.</li>
    <li> does not work for my dandruff problem.  I wash with it 2 times a day and the flakes return every time</li>
    <li> The scent of this shampoo makes your hair smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;Gives same great results you expect from H&amp;S and of course&lt;br /&gt;is a 2-in1 product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and the customer support line for Head &amp; Shoulders said their products were safe for color-treated hair. Worked great for me!</li>
    <li> I buy this type of shampoo with conditioner regularly for my 8 year old daughter. She&#x27;s just starting to use &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; shampoo, so she doesn&#x27;t have the concept of using two products yet. This is a perfect cure, here hair comes out smelling like apples and a little more conditioned than having her use just shampoo.</li>
    <li> Smells great all day. Left hair weird</li>
    <li> it burns, bad. My eyes swelled shut for 2 days. had lots of green gunk coming out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and how my hair feels &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Good stuff, smells nice. Good value for the size and price of the shampoo. Would recommend this to anyone looking to save a little bit on hair care.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dandruff and i was using the head &amp; shoulders intense formula but that seemed to burn too much, i think this is a nice balance but i usually have to wash my scalp twice during one shower which is fine. I really like the smell, it smells like shampoo and not like, well head and shoulders. The conditioner is lacking in its conditioning part but for me thats fine, if you feel the need to have your hair feeling silky you will have to have a seperate conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Smells nice and keeps the flakes off my shoulders and out of my head.  Hence the appropriate naming &amp;#34;Head and Shoulders&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My husbands has the worst hair ever. It is oily, coarse, and full( I mean OVERLOADED) with dandruff. Of course being in the military and not being able to take a shower for days doesn&#x27;t help but still I have never understood how his could be that bad. Anyway I can say after trying a few other products on his hair this seems to work the best. At first we didn&#x27;t think it worked but after multiple uses. We can see the huge improvement. He was washing his hair everyday and still had dandruff. Now he can wash it every other day and be dandruff free.</li>
    <li> lathers well -feels good on scalp as i have itchy spots - gives me much needed relief from itch but I have no dandruff thank God&lt;br /&gt;price is good too</li>
    <li> My husband has an itchy scalp and dandruff but I hate using dandruff shampoo. This is a great compromise. It smells pretty good and don&#x27;t mind it. Happy husbands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had constant dandruff. It wasn&#x27;t crazy, but usually a day after I washed my hair, I would always get the urge to scratch the front of my hairline. There, dandruff would just fall and fall and I&#x27;d scratch and scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo though, I haven&#x27;t even scratched it once. It&#x27;s really amazing how effectively it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using H&amp;S for a long time and I&#x27;m very happy with it. The entire purchase experience was great.</li>
    <li> Like the smell of new green apple and product works well too. Subscribe and save definitely helps save money. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially on my face and scalp. I have a difficult time finding products that both soothe my scalp and make my hair lay nice. I&#x27;ve resorted to using Prell for a long period of time because it was the only thing that didn&#x27;t cause my hair to be greasy, but the hairstylist always commented that I should not be using such a harsh shampoo. I cannot use moisturizing or hydrating shampoo/conditioner because they cause my scalp to break out. I have baby fine hair (and a lot of it!) that is wavy and it can be very frizzy if not kept right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to Walmart to get more Prell but I spotted this shampoo/conditioner on the shelf and I decided to open it to see what it smelled like. I have used H&amp;S in the past -- Ocean Lift and the Intensive Formula. I like the Ocean Lift but the Intensive formula made my hair brassy. I LOVED the smell of this stuff! It smells just like Granny Smith apples. I put the Prell back on the shelf and purchased the new shampoo/conditioner. I used it that night and immediately felt a difference in the way my scalp felt and the appearance of my hair. It leaves my scalp feeling clean and soothed for a long period of time. I have no flakes or breakouts which is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is wet my hair and then rub about a quarter sized amount of the 2-in-1 on my hair and scalp, using my fingertips to get down to the roots.  I let the lather sit on my head for a few minutes while I bathe and then use a wide-toothed comb to remove the tangles.  I rinse with cool water to give it a shine.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to use 2 separate products.</li>
    <li> It gets my hair clean and rinses out very well. At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure of the apple smell but it calms down and just smells fresh.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I wanted to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. Try it for yourself and see what you think.</li>
    <li> I can not think of going back to any other shampoo.. his product is simply what I am going to buy for the rest of my life! Thank you head and shoulder!</li>
    <li> Very effective at eliminated dandruff (immediately upon first use, which was quite surprising to me). Doesn&#x27;t muck up my hair or anything. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I don&#x27;t really know what to say beyond that it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and I&#x27;ve noticed no negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions on the back say \\&quot;For external use only\\&quot;, so I&#x27;ve not tried drinking it, but when used as shampoo, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, love, love, love, subscribe and save.  I have become addicted to finding deals. Jjust wish there was a referral program because I have turned all my friends on to it too!</li>
    <li> I use shampoo once every two days, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about dandruff as long as I use head and shoulders. Plus, the smell is awesome.</li>
    <li> It smells nice. But, it doesn&#x27;t lather very much so it takes a lot of product to go through all of my hair (I have a lot of hair, but even relative to how much product  use for other shampoos). Also it does nothing for my frizziness and untamed fluffiness.</li>
    <li> I heard they use palm oil in this product. Nice to know my shampoo is killing the earth. I am not sure if I will support this product any more..</li>
    <li> Good value and I love being able to get a mild shampoo for light flakiness of scap. My favorite part is that it has a tangy and appealing apple scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s s shampoo with a good smell and it last for quite some time. The same as store bought. Not the best one out there but it&#x27;s good bang for buck.</li>
    <li> Before this I had been using T-gel or generic versions of T-gel and I had fresh clean hair with no dandruff while using them, but they come in a rather small bottle and can be a bit pricey. So I wanted to try something a bit cheaper, and got tricked by the Head &amp; Shoulders &amp;#34;improved scalp health guaranteed&amp;#34; claim. My clean dandruff-free hair and scalp started getting flakes in less than a week with this shampoo, but still I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it, so I continued using it, it&#x27;s been about a month and a half now, the dandruff keeps getting worse and my hair just feels icky. This does not work as well as T-gel, not even close, if you have real dandruff issues then skip this stuff and spring for T-gel or a T-gel generic version. If you don&#x27;t have dandruff or only have very minor dandruff then this may work for you, if you want to take the risk.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works great. I got the Apple and it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I have dropped the bottle so hard so many times.  It is hard to hold on to in the shower especially if your hands are a little soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a heavy bottle.  The flip cap is very large but the hole is tiny, so, there is a big mess all over the top you have to clean off to close it or it drys hard and has to be scraped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again unless it is repackaged.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY TOO EXPENSIVE VS SUPERMARKET</li>
    <li> Feels so good on my scalp and the green apple scent smells nice. Really helps with dandruff! I&#x27;m ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a major dandruff problem, but that is not required to enjoy this shampoo/conditioner combo. Apple Green and Original are my favorite scents. I have been using this product for years; it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like some shampoos and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like some other conditioners. My hair and scalp feels great after a shower; my hair literally feels lighters, clean and smells amazing. I have tried other dandruff shampoos and they smell gross, medicine like, not this stuff. Only this i wish they would change is the cap that is flimsy and usually breaks if you drop it and lands cap end first.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this. It&#x27;s been a solid buy for me. I mean...it&#x27;s shampoo; not much more I can say.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the ordinary H&amp;S shampoo. Haven&#x27;t found it to be any different from the standard one, except for the smell, which is not bad, but not great either. Then again, smell is a matter of personal choice. Go ahead, buy it.</li>
    <li> I rarely get dandruff but I recently noticed that it was starting to develop.  Head &amp; Shoulders is a good brand and the product received good customer reviews so I figured I would try it and I am very pleased with the results.  The product worked very well, I think my scalp is a lot healthier, and there is no more dandruff, so I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It helped clear my dandruff.  My hair likes to frizz and this has tamed it.  May weigh down too much for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo with conditioner. It cleanses your hair and scalp with a fresh green-apple fragrance.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders has never disappointed me because it does the best job over other leading brands. It feels good whenever I apply to my hair.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Just re-ordered another.</li>
    <li> Even right after I use it while washing my hair, I still can see dandruff when I look at my hair in the mirror.. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping.</li>
    <li> I never have heard or seen this scent it must be new but wow what a scent it produces.  Very clean and nice smell.  thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells so good and it works great! I use to use that selsun blue but it doesnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I developed dandruff recently so I went to the store and picked up the green apple scented Head and Shoulders. I loved the scent, but after the second wash my hair was extremely greasy and felt like it had a film on it! I have never in my life had greasy hair. I know it was this shampoo that caused it because I switched over to a different brand and it cleared straight up. It also did not clear up any flakes for me. I gave this product to my boyfriend since I didn&#x27;t want it and it also made his hair greasier. Not sure if it is just the green apple formula, but based on my experience I would not recommend Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> same quality as those bought in Walmart, but it is more convenient (don&#x27;t have to wait in lines) and price is cheaper (which I always believe) for online purchase. will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Dandruff anyone?  Not after using this great shampooo, and it smells good.  I was a little worried about it delivering with all of shampoo on the outside of the bottle, but the packaging was great.</li>
    <li> I bought this since my old head &amp; shoulders is used up.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a decent scent.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter reached driving age not to long ago and one of the requirements for her license was for her to successfully change a flat tire on her own. I gave her a quick visual of where the equ⋯⋯</li>
    <li> why it work because help to clean your scalp and you need oil in your hair not dry all the time because will lose more hair keep clean,oil in your hair eat healthy and stop your Stress and have fun in your life and exercise</li>
    <li> It does wipe off my dandruff. Good value, best price and smells good. I love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> It made my scalp itch disappear instantly!</li>
    <li> good!! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah ah ahah ha ha ha ha h a</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell yummy it works on keeping the flakes away. My hair tends to be on the dry side but this actually has enough conditioner in it to help it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years and have never had any issues. Best shampoo conditioner combo around and smells good too.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo, it smells good and does the job! With his shorter hair, he likes a 2 in 1 product.  We subscribe to this shampoo, so I hope it keeps coming!</li>
    <li> Hade A Small Prablem The Shempu Cover Brake Down In Very Short Time But It Was A Good Price And Good Item</li>
    <li> I always use head and shouders products, it never dispointed me. I like the smell  and make me feel frensh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for ages, can&#x27;t even remember when! If you have oily scalp, this will be great for you. I don&#x27;t see any dandruff or flakes as prior experienced I had after using different shampoos, Besides Amazon&#x27;s competitive price, free shipping, you can&#x27;t go no wrong. It works great for me!</li>
    <li> Have always used Head and Shoulders branded shampoo but was yet to try this particular scent.  Very crisp and invigorating smell, which does last throughout the day.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it in the slightest.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using head and shoulders for as long as I can remember -- since I was around maybe 11? I never had dandruff issues since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local Costco only stocked the regular blue one -- I think it&#x27;s almond oil scented? Well whatever that was, I got really tired of the smell and even stopped using it. I would use it about once a week just to keep dandruff away and use other shampoos for regular wash. However, Costco got this green apple one and WOW does it smell great! I always use small amounts because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d run out and costco won&#x27;t have it anymore, but now that I see it on Amazon, I can use it regularly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy for sure.</li>
    <li> i use this product for a few weeks,found it was what i expected,but smells good.As for the conditioner,may be a little use.</li>
    <li> Bought this and other items to ship to my daughter in Hawaii.  She is attending college over there and she needed groceries. Amazon gave me the flexibility to ship all these groceries for free and right to her dorm.  What would have taken her 5-8 trips on the bus to get, it took only a few days to receive it all.  Thank you Amazon for your great selection on groceries.  Time saver.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this stuff for years. Whenever he ties something else he always notices a difference and does back to this. And I love the crisp, fresh smell. Also very cheap with subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> As a woman with long hair, I &amp;#34;shouldn&#x27;t&amp;#34; wash my hair daily or it will dry right out, but you have to use this daily for good dandruff control.  On the upside, I don&#x27;t think you can find a dandruff shampoo that smells better than this one.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Nice fruit smell that isn&#x27;t sickly sweet.</li>
    <li> So I have had really bad dry scalp issues I wouldn&#x27;t call it dandruf but it was close. So I went and bought some of this at Walmart went home and used it and 1 hour later my dry scalp was gone I&#x27;m not exaggerating at this product is great and I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Gets rid of dandruff...but the product by itself is really bad for hair.</li>
    <li> i can not tell you it is not a good shampoo  because head and shoulders is teh best shampoo i ever had, but coming from the clssic clean shampoo of head and shampoo to this i could tell you that the classic clean has a much better smell because this green apple LEAVES A SWEET TASTE NOT A FRESH ONE and this is not a comfertable smell to go around the whole day with.  i know that their is poeple that do like it BUT IF YOU HAVE THIS THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THIS GREEN APPLE HAS A SSWEET SMELL AND YOU DON&#x27;T LIKE THIS TYPE OF SMELL YOU SHOULD NOT TOUCH IT!!! IT IS HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> I had dandruff for years.  I tried everything, I mean everything.  Decided to go to the dermatologist a couple of years ago.  Prescription products did not work either....Finally I decided to try the cheapest product in the store, Head and Shoulders.... This worked! Finally!!! I can&#x27;t say how thrilled I am to find something that brings my confidence back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time ever writing a review.  Try this if you suffer from dandruff.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t help with my dandruff :( but maybe I just have a different kind, I will try other stuff as I have more of a seasonal type.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I bought some because it was on a great sale, not because I especially needed it, but tried it all the same. Smell is pleasantly fruity. Didn&#x27;t have dandruff so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works on that, but it did clean well and leave my hair very soft and shiny, more so than much more expensive products do. I was pleasantly surprised how nice it came out, and it&#x27;s now part of my regular rotation. I do have very dry and frizz-prone hair, and it came out much tamer than normal, even without using a separate conditioner. Yes, I know it is 2 in 1 but with my hair, that followed by conditioner has always been a must.</li>
    <li> For some reason this product makes my hair static like. When I use it my hair looks as if I rubbed a balloon against it. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my mild dandruff.</li>
    <li> I use this normally but have now started to use it less and starting to think about new products. It works just fine but I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it is starting to dry my hair out too much. So using just a conditioner on multiple showers during a day.</li>
    <li> I like this Head and Shoulders combo shampoo and conditioner but it does not live up to the promotional HYPE stated on the product page. &amp;#34;Beautiful hair has never smelled this good! Bring those locks to the orchard and feel an air of confidence with the sweet scent of green apple&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how the price of Head and Shoulders varies- This large 23.7 ounce size was a great deal and gets my hair clean and eliminates tangles. After my hair is dry there is no odor and in fact the &amp;#34;Green Apple&amp;#34; smell is pleasant but hardly noticeable while shampooing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest and say I have naturally oily hair. I got sick and spent a few days in bed w an upper respitory infection and did not feel like standing much less showering. Hey, I&#x27;m honest. My hair naturally looks oily the next day but imagine a few days of not showering?! Yea that what happened. I dont know if not showering aided in a few flakes but one use made my hair &amp; scalp look really good. Smells decent too.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo/conditioner.  The green apple smells wonderful.  For those of us that have to use anti-dandruff shampoos, it&#x27;s a wonderful departure from the usual chemical-type smell that sometimes goes along with these.  I use it every day and plan to do so for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Getting my son to use dandruff shampoo has been a lifelong struggle because of the smell. He uses this every day now and it smells great. He isn&#x27;t embarrassed to use it and go to school, and for a teenager, smell means a lot. He has brutally dry skin, and it does a fair job of helping with the actual dandruff. The best controlling shampoos smell too awful to get him to use. This is our compromise.</li>
    <li> great scent and works great.  just used two days and my scalp is happy~!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very happy i like this products for ever this is the olny shampoo clean my hair and shine like the sun</li>
    <li> Like a regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> great, it did worked. it is amazing, I tried different brand, not work as good as this brand.  stick on it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff problems but I use the 2 in 1 shampoo &amp; conditioner because it smells so good and moisturizes my scalp. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Smells great, keeps my scalp nice and flake free. Love that it is &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; now so that I don&#x27;t even have to think about it, just comes to the door step!</li>
    <li> It smells sooo good and it does what is says. It is head and shoulders after all. It really got rid of my dandruff. And it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I have had a horrible dandruff problem for about 10 years before using this shampoo. After using it for a week or two, the dandruff stopped and hasn&#x27;t been back since, even though I am no longer using it regularly many months later. Also smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using head and shoulders for as long as I can remember -- since I was around maybe 11? I never had dandruff issues since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local Costco only stocked the regular blue one -- I think it&#x27;s almond oil scented? Well whatever that was, I got really tired of the smell and even stopped using it. I would use it about once a week just to keep dandruff away and use other shampoos for regular wash. However, Costco got this green apple one and WOW does it smell great! I always use small amounts because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d run out and costco won&#x27;t have it anymore, but now that I see it on Amazon, I can use it regularly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy for sure.</li>
    <li> This shampoo plus conditioner product was what I expected.  It had a pleasing scent and cleaned my hair and left it manageable.  It seemed to rinse clean without any difficulty and felt nice on my scalp.  My advise is, just follow the instructions on the bottle for best results.</li>
    <li> The product is like any other head and shoulders 2 in 1 dandruff control shampoo and conditioner, but what distinguishes it is the green apple smell. I love it! Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
