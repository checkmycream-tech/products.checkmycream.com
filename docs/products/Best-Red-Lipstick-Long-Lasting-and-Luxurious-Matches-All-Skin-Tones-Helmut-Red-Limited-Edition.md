      <li>The PERFECT Red!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>This lipstick is the PERFECT shade of red!</li>
      <li>Beautiful Red Lipstick.</li>
      <li>A great red.</li>
      <li>It is a nice shade of red that works for me.</li>
      <li>because as a business owner there are certain times you can apply rouge without sending a message of...&amp;#34;Look at me&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>I smeared a little on my finger tips and it looks pretty good.</li>
      <li>Very creamy going on.  </li>
      <li>Computer monitors can be calibrated differently, so it might look different to people, but I liked the color.</li>
      <li>Just a show stopping true red.</li>
      <li>Makes teeth look super white! ❤</li>
      <li>Most reds are too overwhelming for me, but this one is dramatic, yet not so much that I would only wear it at night.</li>
      <li>Now I opened the tube and it&#x27;s worth the price value,the smell is typical of what you may whiff when you apply this tube.</li>
      <li>This more of a coral red , Not a true red !  waste of money .</li>
      <li>I prefer the deadly RED&#x27;s as I call them when I&#x27;m traveling for business or social settings.</li>

<li> And long lasting</li>
<li> I have been a fan of RED lipstick since I was a little girl back in the days of when ladies wore pantyhose.</li>
<li> Lasts a long time without smudging and cracking!!</li>
<li> Am dark haired and light/medium skin that&#x27;s got an olive tone.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little drying.  </li>
<li> Pardon me for hiding my age but lipstick shades aren&#x27;t solely age related unless it&#x27;s shocking &amp;#34;Black,Blue or Orange&amp;#34; that maybe intended to attract a 14yr old to 25yr old who&#x27;s fond of rebelling towards the establishment.</li>
<li> Just be very careful not to wipe it on WHITE shirts,blouses and dresses because I noticed that this shade may stay on and  require soap ,cold water to remove.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a little drying.  I&#x27;m wondering if I should stay away from tube lipsticks and stick with glosses.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is the PERFECT shade of red! Absolutely gorgeous color and goes on so smoothly! Feels great on the lips!</li>
    <li> This was described as the color works for every skin tone.  It didn&#x27;t with mine</li>

I haven&#x27;t worn this lip rouge as of yet ...because as a business owner there are certain times you can apply rouge without sending a message of...&amp;#34;Look at me&amp;#34;!

    <li> thanks, great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Pro Makeup Artist of 14 yrs. Love this lipstick! This red will work on ANY skin tone! The pigment is long lasting &amp; I feel like the texture of the lipstick is plush &amp; velvety. Not glossy...not matte. Maybe use a touch of lip balm before hand as prep &amp; blot off excess. Just a show stopping true red. Makes teeth look super white! ❤️</li>
    <li> Love this color! Very creamy going on.  Most reds are too overwhelming for me, but this one is dramatic, yet not so much that I would only wear it at night.</li>

    <li> This more of a coral red , Not a true red !  waste of money . They also allow you 1 day to return it ... It&#x27;s in the make-up grave yard  !!!  Boo !</li>
    <li> Nah! The color looks like orangy!!</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing. And long lasting</li>
