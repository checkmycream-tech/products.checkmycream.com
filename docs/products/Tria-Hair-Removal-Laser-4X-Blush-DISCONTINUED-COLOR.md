      <li>I love love love my Tria!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchase: I bought from the manufacturer website because it came with free cooling cream.  I am hoping it will take care of my ~20 dark chin hairs.  Cooling cream was lame and I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Day: There are 5 power settings (correlated with pulse time), and I started with 1.  Power level 1 wasn&#x27;t detectable on my face and power level 4 I could start to feel, level 5 was just fine on my face.  Then I tried it on my very coarse leg hair and it was tolerable on level 5, but after a few pulses I had to turn it down to 3.  Just as if someone pinched you, it was OK the first time, but stop already.  Much easier than I imagined however I&#x27;ll wait to see how it works on a smaller area before I put in the time for the larger areas.  There is a guide that tells you how long it takes for each area of the body, 30 min for upper or lower leg, 5 min for underarm, 2 min for upper lip, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Week: It is so easy to zap my random chin hairs, I have decided to do my left underarm too(leave my right to compare), I have very thick underarm hair.  The instruction booklet says to use 100 pulses per side (there is a pulse counter).  Level 5 was unbearable because there is such a high concentration of hair.  So I tried level 3, but is just bearable, but my eyes did tear up.  It was tricky to determine exactly where to put the laser every time, because there isn&#x27;t really a way to keep track of where you have done before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later: There is no lasting pain or any marks from the previous treatment. I am so excited, that I do my left underarm again.  After treating it the same way I vow to ice the area before the next treatment to hopefully numb it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later:&lt;br /&gt;CHIN HAIRS: Every time I notice a chin hair growing above the skin, I use an electric razor (husband&#x27;s) to shave it then zap it.  Very easy.  Haven&#x27;t tweazed since I got the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;UNDERARM: Icing the underarm is the way to go, very little pain.  However it is fussy and takes extra time.  I did about 4 treatments on my right underarm and noticed a real difference (thinner, easier to shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later:&lt;br /&gt;CHIN HAIRS: I&#x27;ve done maybe about 10 treatments on my chin, ranging from 3 days apart to 1.5wks apart. MY CHIN HAIRS ARE GONE!  OK, there is one think blonde one left, but I don&#x27;t care about that one.  I have not plucked, shaved, or Tria-ed in two weeks and there is nothing!  $500 was totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;UNDERARM: I declared the experiment a success, but I got busy and never bothered to do it again.  Now the difference is not noticeable anymore.  They say the same thing in the instruction manual, that after 3 weeks you will see a difference, but if you stop there it will go back to the same way again.</li>
    <li> This product just simply does not work. I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and bikini zone for 2 months 1 time per week and occasionally 2 times a week to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any areas. It has not lessened the amount of hair, it has not slowed the growth of hair, and it has not help with ingrown hairs. It seems to actually stimulate the hair to grow faster. I have light skin with dark hair which is what you need for the best outcome with this product. I do not believe any of the positive reviews here. I&#x27;m disgusted that I will not receive a full refund once its returned. Its been a complete waste of time and money. Your time and money will be better spent with professional laser removal,  it just costs more, but better to spend money on something that works than throw it down the drain with a Sham of a product.</li>
    <li> LOOKS LIKE IT&#x27;S STARTING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE I&#x27;VE BEEN USING ABOUT 5 WEEKS, IT DOES STING, BUT IT&#x27;S TOLERABLE</li>
    <li> I need more time to see if this is going to work, trying to locate some good numbing cream first, as it does cause a little pain</li>
    <li> This does not work,worst part is I bought from Amazon, so when I called Tria they tell me that&lt;br /&gt;it can take a few months to see results and I need to deal with Amazon&#x27;s return policy, so I can not return it and am stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is smaller than a dime it takes for ever to treat even a small area. If there is any good news to be had..... do not worry about burning your self,  at the highest setting it&#x27;s just  Luke warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish that I bought direct from TRia at least I could return this worthless product.</li>
    <li> just started using it 2 weeks ago so it is too soon to tell how well it works, time will tell.</li>
    <li> I had professional laser removal done on my \\&quot;happy trail\\&quot; and about a month after my last treatment I was still getting coarse, ingrown hairs. Rather than going back to the med spa, I figured it would be cheeper to get the Tria to do touchups and I can use it on other areas of my body as well.  After the first treatment with the Tria, the ingrown hairs were reduced drastically. By my 4th treatment you can hardly even see hair at all. Defiantly worth the money in my case.</li>
    <li> Need to activate the process of preparing non-existent in the catalog&lt;br /&gt;Battery implemented quickly&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any change&lt;br /&gt;Only loss of money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;بحاجة لتفعيل وعملية إعداد غير موجودة في الكتالوج&lt;br /&gt;البطارية تنفذ بسرعة&lt;br /&gt;لم اشاهد أي تغيير&lt;br /&gt;خسارة للنقود فقط</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it only works small areas at a time.</li>
    <li> I totally used it seven times, and I found that the speed of hair growth slower than before. It&#x27;s really works.</li>
    <li> I had to return it because I did not see any difference in a month. I was using level 2 because at 3, the pain was unbearable. Maybe I should have waited more but I guess I am a little impatient. So it does not work for me. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I used the Tria laser exactly as prescribed, and did the pre-test with no side effects. When I used it \\&quot;for real\\&quot; on my upper lip, I ended up with a very large burn on my upper lip - a 1/2 inch oval of skin was entirely burned off and I have an unsightly open sore that will take time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use the product at the highest level tolerable. I foolishly used level 5 and could tolerate the pain, but after about 7 beeps noticed the burn. I finished the other side of my upper lip on level 3 with no incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to take a chance with this product after my burn heals, and will go back to waxing or go for a professional laser treatment.</li>
    <li> These products are a scam, the results are very disappointing - makes some hair growth worst - and the battery stops lasting for very long way before you can make any progress at all. Save your money for professional treatments. This is a scam - it&#x27;s obvious by it having a limited battery life that this is a scam, if you don&#x27;t follow unrealistic instructions exactly the battery runs out and you wasted your money - SCAM!!! I did every two weeks my bikini and it&#x27;s worst - some finer hairs have grown coarser now. They should replace your battery until you&#x27;re done, otherwise it&#x27;s a SCAM!!! Achtung! Beware! SCAM!</li>
    <li> I just got my Tria 4x and beginning to use it.. I&#x27;m having issues with using it on my face.  It just won&#x27;t work.  I put it to my face, no sound.  I put it on my arm and it works just fine.  I&#x27;m fairly light skinned, with dark hair so I am not sure what&#x27;s wrong.  I&#x27;ve tried pulling my skin taught so it connects, no go.  I&#x27;m getting very frustrated.  Any tips for how to use it on your chin and lip area?</li>
    <li> Hello everyone,  I received my Tria a month ago and have used it 3 1/2 weeks now.  No more hair growing from my upper lip and my chin.. That is the first area I have worked on.  So I can definetly say it works. And now I am very happy.  I was scared it didnt because I shaved and once you shave hair grows thicker.  But I don&#x27;t shave it anymore I use a single blade and remove the hair and its way smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you TRIA..</li>
    <li> The Tria definitely works, but after purchasing it in Aug. 2013, I can say it works best on smaller areas. Because of the small laser head, larger areas take a good deal of time and patience and leave more room for you to miss areas/hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it to use on my arms/underarms and bikini line, but also ended up using it on a few smaller areas (around my hairline on my neck, for example) and those spots are completely hair-free now. When I purchased the Tria 4x in blush, it was only $450 - I&#x27;ve paid close to that for a package of 6 professional sessions on two small areas that STILL left me with hair. The Tria was a no-brainer for me because even if I can still treat small spots effectively, it&#x27;s less expensive and more effective and convenient than paying for pro treatments.</li>
    <li> You would be better off to go spend the money on real laser treatments.  I have been using this since June and hardly any hair has fallen out, this is a waste of time and money, I am so disappointed in the claims made for this product.  Do not fall prey to this trap.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday. She loves it. She asked me to do her \\&quot; bikini area\\&quot;, so naturally you can imagine how that situation looks. So I guess with the close quarters it gets everybody \\&quot;happy\\&quot; and well leads to sex every time ! Thanks Tria!</li>
    <li> Save your money and use it for a laser hair removal groupon from a specialist who can use stronger lasers. You will think Tria works because your hair will stop growing for a couple of weeks, but a couple of months later the hair is back. Tria does damage to the hair cuticle but doesn&#x27;t destroy it so it will come back. It may have worked on my upper lip hair however, since it seems to have significantly reduced.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and gave this Tria  a chance. The packaging is first class and the product is very well made. I have not used it long enough yet but so far so good. It appears to be working. I will amend this review  after more uses and time.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product enough to tell if its really working or not but the hair is gone for now and looks promising. Perhaps the hair is gone and is working or perhaps I have to wait longer. Assuming it is gone, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I am hopeing over time i will be able to get better results. I have tried underarms, feet mustash and bikini line for four consecutive Sundays with not much change. Didn&#x27;t want to start on legs if I wasn&#x27;t going to get the results I needed.</li>
    <li> I would NOT recommend ordering this from Amazon and I order many, many items from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tria&#x27;s return policy allows for a 90-day satisfaction guarantee return - UNLESS the item is purchased from Amazon. Tria claims that though it says it&#x27;s sold by \\&quot;Tria Beauty\\&quot; they cannot allow returns to Tria if you purchase the item through Amazon. Amazon only provides a 30-day return period. Very unhappy about this.</li>
    <li> This was worth every penny, it really does  what it says it does. Just using it for about three weeks now and I&#x27;m already seeing the growth starting to decline, better then paying a Dermatologist to do the job, he would have charged me much more and it would have included multiple visits and a lot more expensive.</li>
    <li> It is good but painfull,&lt;br /&gt;Need more than 6 treatment,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m noticing a difference after two weeks.  It&#x27;s a great idea and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve just got small areas to do.  I&#x27;ve done it once a week just to be sure I don&#x27;t miss any growth cycles.  After the second treatment, the pain is tolerable enough that I can use it at the highest setting anywhere.  And no, I haven&#x27;t horribly burned myself **anywhere**.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it right, you may end up with what looks like hundreds of ingrown hairs that don&#x27;t go away in a few hours.  You&#x27;re literally burning the hair out of its roots, so it&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;The first few times, it hurts like Hell.  A rubberband snap isn&#x27;t accurate - more like a cigarette burn every time.  Especially around your navel.  It literally feels like a cigarette burn, but the pain goes away within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why a small circle?  Really?  Why not a small square or heck, a large square?  The tip is the size of a cigarette&#x27;s tip and you have to overlap each treatment by 40%-50%, so it isn&#x27;t fast.  And that&#x27;s a lot of burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But an hour of pain and tediousness a few times a month for a few months is worth never having to shave again.</li>
    <li> Ordered tria from the manufacturer website. I week after, there Inam using the machine. It hurts, but is is bearable.&lt;br /&gt;Some spots are difficult o reach, specially is skin is thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impossible to use on the back of your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after one week I got an error message. Had to return the item for replacement. Note that once you call it takes 10 calendar days to get a return prepaid label and once your item is on the way, then they will release the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my machine 5 weeks ago, but only have been able o use it one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the new machine will last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just do not have any tolerance for pain or if my device was defective but even on level 1, it hurt, ALOT!  The bikini area was the most painful.  Also, the surface area of the laser is soo small that if you wanted to do an area larger than say your upper lip, it would take you forever.  Although the professional treatments do cost alot, their lasers are larger and the pain is bearable since someone else is doing it to you.  I have returned my device, I&#x27;m hoping that I get a full refund.  If not, I will try to sell on ebay.</li>
    <li> It is not clear in the advertising that this will not work on blonde or light hair.  My hair is a mix of hair colors with a lot of gray now coming in.  I wish that I would have known this fact before I ordered this because I probably would not have done so.</li>
    <li> If you do have the patience to use it as instructed , on  a weekly basis it does work slowly, week by week, so i guess it is worth the money over the expensive salon hair removal procedures.  Personally i returned it within the 90 days because i didn&#x27;t think i was seeing any results, even though i was using it even twice a week sometimes, but a little while after i returned it i started noticing that i actually had considerably less hair and the remaining hair was thinning . I used it mostly for the bikini area.I would complain about the actual laser head size, I wish it was larger so it wouldn&#x27;t take soooo long , but I am still considering getting a new one, or maybe even try a different brand.</li>
    <li> This product works great and the results have been terrific.  I was really surprised and worried that I would pay the money and not be satisfied but just the opposite happened.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this.  I thought for the amount of money it may work, but read a lot of reviews about it not working well.  I am very happy to say It Really Works!!!  I have PCOS and the facial hair has gotten pretty bad the last few years to the point where i was shaving/plucking 2-3 times a day and I still had that dark shadow of the hair always being there on my chin and upper lip.  The first 3 weeks I used the Tria 2 times a week,after that once a week.  At first i saw a slight change maybe 15-20% of hair gone and then it seemed to stop working about the 3rd week. But I think what I was seeing was the hairs being pushed out, because week 4 was about 80% of the hair gone!  I can even go 2 days with no shaving/plucking!!! And NO shadow,the hair is just gone!  I was very amazed!  Does it hurt...YES!  The first 4-5 times it was VERY painful.  I think because I had more hair.  I could only tolerate a 3 and even then my eyes would water from the pain.  Then I could go to a 4 and now about a month I can go a 5.  Still hurts a bit,but now I would say out of a 1-10 maybe a 6 for pain.  I have medium/dark brown hair and my hairs on my chin/upper lip were also dark brown and my skin tone is pretty light.  At first I could only tolerate about 45 pulses and now I can do 100. It&#x27;s very quick and easy to do,takes less then 10 minutes. You can not pluck/tweeze in between while you are using it.  If you do you will pull the hair root out and the Tria can not kill it off so it will just re-grow.  This was hard for me. BUT, you can shave.  Hope this can help someone. I would definitely recommend it!  I have tried every bleach,wax etc. that is out there and nothing came close to this.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I&#x27;ve tried one of these devices - but Tria really works.  It&#x27; s a bit pricey, but  worth it.  I would recommend it to anyone with dark hair.</li>
    <li> okay for the upper lip but it will take a long time to get to every spot.  Hopeless for any larger areas unless you have incredible patience.</li>
    <li> I was pretty hesitant about purchasing this but am glad I did.  It is slow, mostly because I can&#x27;t put it on full strength. I can definitely see it is working, though, and I&#x27;m willing to put in the time.  I am dark haired and have medium skin.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and did 5 treatments 1 week apart on my bikini area and lower legs. I used level 5 except for some parts of the bikini area where it was just too painful, and in those places I used level 4. The initial result was not really what I expected - the hairs did not actually fall out, but just sat in the follicle not attached to anything. I could take them out of the follicle with tweezers (they just came out, no resistance, as I said they seemed to be cut off from the growing part of the follicle). Annoying to have to take each little hair out, but whatever. I would say maybe 75% of the hairs in the bikini region had come out after 5 treatments, less on the legs. Unfortunately, everything grew back a couple months later. I would say the result is similar to waxing - the hair goes away for awhile but then grows back. I also got a bunch of ingrown hairs, also similar to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin and very dark hair, so I should be a good candidate for this treatment. On the other hand, my hair is much thicker and darker than most women due to PCOS, so maybe it&#x27;s just too much for a home laser. I&#x27;m going to try a cycle of treatments again in the hope that the first cycle weakened the follicles and I&#x27;ll get better results next time. I&#x27;ll post an update after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the discomfort - as I said, I tried to use setting 5. In most areas it was a little uncomfortable but tolerable. In some areas the laser pulse felt really hot, like it was burning the skin. It doesn&#x27;t actually burn the skin, but that was the sensation. In those places I turned the setting down to 4 and it was ok. The discomfort for me was mostly this burning sensation, but occasionally I would be going along fine and suddenly one pulse would feel like someone was sticking a hot needle into my skin. I would say I have a pretty high pain tolerance, at least when it comes to hair removal. It is tolerable for me, but I think you have to really, really want thathair gone.</li>
    <li> It is necessary to continue and to keep it . Otherwise there is no point of it</li>
    <li> It really works, I can see such a difference in the hair growth already.  I have used it on my upperlip, underarms, legs and bikini line.  It is so worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little slow and wish you could use it while is is plugged in for longer treatment time but besides that it is amazing how well it works if you are consistant with the treatments every two weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought the original product.  They have a sensor you have to use to \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the system.  Originally this system cost a lot more money.  Today I called Tria Beauty to obtain a new sensor the product is 4 years old and they told me sorry we don&#x27;t make that anymore.  So with a unlocking device they will lock you out of using your system is 4 probably less years.  So if you purchase one be ready to spend the money again if you want to continue using the product.</li>
    <li> Based on 5 months of usage here is my feedback.  Yes it works.  Some areas you have to go over many many times before you see results, but they do happen.  Pros:  having a hand held, wireless device is really nice and helpful for those hard to reach spots.  Also you can take it into different rooms.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and easy to use.  Cons:  After about a minute or two of usage the internal fan comes on, and it is not quiet.  This fan also comes on and off while it&#x27;s charging, again kinda loud.  I always made sure my roommate wasn&#x27;t around before using this.  The area it treats is small, so if your looking to do first time large areas like legs, your looking at a lot of work.  The battery needs to be recharged after about 30 minutes of continual usage.  Thankfully I bought this just for touch up.  Anyhow, hope that helps.</li>
    <li> I RARELY ever write reviews but reviews were crucial influencing factors in my purchase of the Tria so to help everyone else who is trying to decide here is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start I was super skeptical about this product but I was desperate for permanent hair removal.  I have tried everything - waxing, shaving, VEET etc...  I have very pale skin and very dark hair.  When I shave my legs too often my skin gets highly irritated and I get painful and unsightly razor burn and when the hair starts growing back in it is painful and itchy.  I don&#x27;t wear shorts because my legs are either covered in hair or a multitude of angry red bumps.  It took me 2 weeks to decide to take the plunge and I read any and all reviews I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally broke down and decided to try Tria.  The first couple of three times I used it I saw no difference and I was REALLY discouraged and thought I had just wasted a ton of money.  However I decided to not give up (many reviews encourage you saying that you need to be patient).  I keep going and now a month and a half after my first treatment  (doing 1 treatment a week a total of 6 treatments so far)  I am seeing SERIOUS IMPROVEMENT!  IT REALLY WORKS!!  You just NEED TO BE PATIENT!  It isn&#x27;t going to happen overnight (we are so used to waxing and shaving having immediate results).  I have used it on my underarms, belly, bikini, thighs, and legs.  For once I want to wear shorts!  I have so much more confidence about my body and wearing skirts, shorts, and bikinis.  Also the more I use it the less irritation I get when the hair grows back in after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain factor - I was a little nervous about this part.  It is painful on level 5 in areas with delicate skin like your underarms and bikini line.  You can grit and bear it or bump it a little lower,  4 is not bad, 3 I can barely feel anything.  On the legs, thighs, and belly where the skin is thicker I could use level 5 and felt only mild discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are on the fence, you have tried everything else to get rid of hair, and you fit the Tria guidelines (make sure your skin and hair are compatible).  Take the plunge.  IT IS WORTH IT!!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a costly item, but compared to getting laser hair removal treatments for all the areas I am treating, this is a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;This is a time consuming process and the higher level you use to treat, the better the result. However, going in for professional treatments would be way more time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;I am not commenting on the quality of this device as I have seen many reviewers having problems. I have had mine for 6 months and it continues to work; their is some little rattle in it which is not right.&lt;br /&gt;This is the answer I was looking for and would repurchase if it fails, or look for a similar device.</li>
    <li> I ordered tria beauty laser 4X from tria beauty website. I charged it and tried to activate. Unable to activate it. It won&#x27;t even turn off. Called customer service and they said there is a problem with it and asked me to return it paying the postage. The device is beeping for every few minutes for the past 3 days. Getting a device that won&#x27;t even turn off is very frustrating. I&#x27;m very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Hello dear,&lt;br /&gt;I received my order, it is very good like what i want and i like it. I&#x27;ll buy more thing form you in the future.&lt;br /&gt;thank you for help my.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards</li>
    <li> In my experience of the product he really good and deserves 5 ​​stars</li>
    <li> I used it on my legs at a #5 setting. I was amazed that a week later only a few spots where I missed had hair. I could only try the #3 setting for my face and will need to do repeat sessions. (...Unless I get tougher!) It is hard to wait 2 weeks between treatments. The thought of finally being hair free is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I thought I should post my own review since I did extensive research before investing in the Tria 4x. I&#x27;m of Italian descent, with very dark hair. My skin tone is not pale or fair, but more \\&quot;olive\\&quot;, especially after a summer outside. (In this regard, I don&#x27;t meet the ideal Tria hair/skin combination standards, but I still have seen excellent results quickly.) I have thick, coarse hair and often get ingrown hair from shaving. I&#x27;ve tried it all: shaving, waxing, depilatories, plucking and professional laser hair removal at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. I saw the best results from the professional laser on my bikini line, but it cost $200/visit and it was very difficult for me to make it to their office regularly (I work and have a small child.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, about 5 weeks ago I invested in the Tria and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. After 4 weekly treatments, I am already seeing dramatically reduced hair regrowth on all areas where I&#x27;ve lasered (underarms, face/chin and bikini line.) I have been doing it for about an hour at weekly intervals and will continue for the full 12 weeks recommended by Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of my pros and cons for this product (way more pros than cons, if you ask me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1.) Dramatically cheaper than professional laser treatments. I bought the Tria for $449 from the Tria website and it has already paid for itself. By now, I would have spent $800 for 4 treatments at my dermatologist&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;2.) IT WORKS. Persistence and patience is key, but you will see results if you continue the treatments regularly.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Less painful than a bikini wax- it&#x27;s really not that bad! Not great, but not excruciating. The \\&quot;snapping rubber band\\&quot; analogy is accurate, and some places don&#x27;t really hurt much at all.&lt;br /&gt;4.) No ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;5.) No appointments needed, no driving to the dermatologist&#x27;s and having the laser technician position you awkwardly so she can reach those \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places - do it on your own schedule with complete privacy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1.) It does hurt, especially in certain sensitive spots. I&#x27;ve found the underarms most painful, even more than the bikini line. It does not hurt more than waxing, and it hurts about the same as the professional laser. I&#x27;ve been using at the 4 setting (out of 5) and haven&#x27;t bumped it to the full 5 since my results have been excellent. It hurts less on freshly shaved areas, so shave before lasering as they recommend. Any stray hairs will be more painful when lasered.&lt;br /&gt;2.) It&#x27;s time consuming due to the very small laser head. I wish they made a much bigger laser. This, to me, is the biggest drawback of the Tria. But it&#x27;s worth the time and effort!&lt;br /&gt;3.) Battery life is just OK- I can use it for about 40 minutes (about 300 pulses) before I need to recharge. This is enough to get all the areas I&#x27;m focusing on before the battery runs out.&lt;br /&gt;4.) Some areas are hard to reach (bikini line) so it can be awkward, but you&#x27;ll manage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly, highly recommend this product. It would receive 5 stars if I could cover more area with each session.complete privacy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1.) It does hurt, especially in certain sensitive spots.

    <li> It does what it says it does. Remember to overlap for best results. I wish I would have done this years ago.</li>
    <li> Totally effective. Used it for 3 months and unwanted hair was gone.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 weeks and notice a remarkable difference.  The process is not without pain but well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product for a face</li>
    <li> I use this thing every week and it looks like it works for most of my hairs, but everyone is different so dont&#x27; expect miracles. I had professional laser work done on my face at one point and it lasted for a few years, but then it comes back. still, good to have on hand. better than plucking!</li>
    <li> Bought to my wife as a gift and was one of the best gifts ever.&lt;br /&gt;Laser removal is the only method that works, but it is expensive. After some full sessions of professional laser, this device is the recommended tool to maintain all regions free of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it for first or large dense areas. For these, it&#x27;s better to use professional sessions, as the laser will be stronger and wider.&lt;br /&gt;She uses in the maximum level. Although she says that it&#x27;s kind of painfull, it depends of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The full charge is enough for a full leg, so no problem here.</li>
    <li> Hair grows in 5 cycles so it can take up to 6months to see permanent results Worked great for me. Just remember not to pluck the hairs after using the laser defeats the purpose!</li>
    <li> I ordered the item new and charged it for a week and it still won&#x27;t turn on. I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out. They must have battery problems..?</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00B0S7KUY Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X - Blush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had professional laser hair removal on my face and chin and it worked very well for over six years.  Then the hair started coming back.  I researched and despite the questionable reviews I decided to give Tria 4X a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it may have worked.  I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With professional laser hair removal it removes ALL the visible hair during treatment.  So you walk out of the appointment clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with the Tria 4x.  It does not remove the viable hair.  So you either need to shave or trim or whatever until the treatment works and the hair is removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I spoke with Tria customer service they stated that they were aware of this and that is why they recommend you treat weekly with Tria as apposed to every four weeks with professional laser treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tria is NOT strong enough to removed the visible hair during treatment.  This for me was a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known this I would not have purchased the Tria 4X in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would pass this on to others who may have similar concerns.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical when I purchased my Tria 4X, but felt comfortable with the 90 day warranty. It&#x27;s been slightly over one month since I started using it, and the results are already extremely noticeable. I have used it on the highest setting right from the start. It&#x27;s really not painful at all except on the underarms where it stings, but is tolerable. After one month I have large areas of complete hair loss on my legs, and what looks like total hair loss on my underarms. The head on the machine is small, and it requires some time, but the results are well worth the time it takes. Also, it gives around 600 pulses and then needs a 2 hour charge, but after 600 pulses, I&#x27;m ready for a 2 hour break anyway. I purchased this item directly from Tria, and had a question, and their customer service is excellent. The machine arrives beautifully packed, and looks very well made. It is extremely simple to use. I highly recommend the Tria.</li>
    <li> PLEASE pay no attention to people who whine and complain about how this doesn&#x27;t work. IT DOES!! .... *if* used correctly! I have been using it for almost 3 months now, and I am amazed at the results:&lt;br /&gt;After the 3rd treatment, I noticed the hair in the area I was treating was about 1/3 gone, and now after almost 3 months, the hair is more than half gone. AND, what does grow back in is finer, thinner, and grows much more slowly than it did before. I can now go 3 or 4 days without shaving my armpits, and it still looks like I just shaved that morning, or *maybe* the day before. With summer coming up, that&#x27;s great!!! I am completely satisfied with this product and it&#x27;s effectiveness! I have only had to charge it 3x so far, and am not even to 2,000 pulses yet, so I feel confident that I will be able to completely treat every area of my body that I wish to remove/thin out hair from LONG before it runs out of charges or pulses, given the amount they say it is capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would recommend though, is keep immaculate records of each treatment. How many pulses were used, how long it took you, and how often you charge it. That way, if anything should happen - say you get a defective item that stops working at 35,000 pulses instead of the 90,000 they advertise, you have proof. Not saying I think that would happen, but... you never know ;) Also, it is important to keep the lens clean, especially if you use the cooling gel (which is great also, definitely worth the $$ to use in conjunction). The gel will build up on the surface of the lens, so make sure to clean it well after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel this was completely worth the $$, and compared to other products, FAR superior to any other commercially available home-use laser hair removal device.</li>
    <li> I have used this quite a few times. Especially trying to get rid of the hair on my upper lip. I have done this at least 10 times. I feel a sting when I do it on the highest setting. Which does hurt a bit. But the hair continues to grow back. It def seems to know the coarser the hair the more it stings but it just isn&#x27;t getting rid of it. I do feel I have done it ample times that&#x27;s why I waited to leave my feed back. So disappointed I wasted so much money. Def would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It works. Easy to use, care for and clean. Thought I would try it and see for myself and was impressed.</li>
    <li> I have registered the product but can not figure out how to use  it.  Appears to be well built and looks simple if I can get it set up.</li>
    <li> While pricey, it is way cheaper than salon treatments.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and it actually works. Have much finer, lighter hair in treated areas.</li>
    <li> We bought this a few weeks ago and my wife has been using it regularly and has already seen the effects.  It works just as advertised. We&#x27;ve had no problem with the battery as others have suggested. It easily lasts long enough. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I am very light skinned with lucky black hair on my legs and under arms but I have light Brown hair on my head. So of course im very excited to try this. first off I cant tell if it works as I only did it 3 times so far. Soooo let me say it really hurts, I did my legs on 3 because it says the stronger the level the better the results. I kept twitching and saying owww when I did it, my underarms I did on 4 because I really want my hair gone fast, and I had sweat on my face from the pain, and it did turn red and hurt the rest of the night, and last let me tell yiu my bikini area :(  I dont know what they mean by a rubber band snap, because it is worse and then when it gets hot its even worse!!! Of course I will keep suffering because I cant afford professional laser treatments,  but beware the pain is so bad my mom or my sister wont do it!!! Im not sure, you could have better luck, and if you do im jealous. I hope its worth it in the end!!! Also I have to say the head of the laser is so tiny and having to remember the spots you just went over is a pain, I wish it was bigger. And last the battery life is short like everyone else says,  I can do my bikini and under arms in one charge and only the bottom of each leg in another. So its good but its not!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 5/23/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so heres my update almost 90 days later, using it faithfully every week at level 5.... it seemed like it worked really well at first, my underarms had only the light colored hair left my bikini area (which I had to use ice every time I used it down there) was almost bikini ready and then maybe almost 2 months in the hairs were coming back and my legs  was the worst. Its like after it kills the hair my skin is too thick for the hairs to come thru and I have sooooo many ingrown hairs that it was just to painful to use the lase anymore. So despite the long hours I put into it the end results were just not worth $450.00 :(  so I decided to return it. As my , legs look bad because allthe little black dots on my fair skin im sure maybe after like a year you would get the results we all long for, smooth baby skin  &gt;_&lt;&lt;br /&gt; Ok well sorry I didnt have better results so I could of gave better feedback but thats what it did for me!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve being using it for a year and I still have hair coming out! Not happy at all after I paid so much for this product!</li>
    <li> Used multiple times for about a year. Hair still grows back</li>
    <li> I purchased this machine from QVC originally and am returning it. It takes forever to work and is very painful.  It also is  heavy and bulky and difficult to maneuver.  I would rather spend the money to get professional laser treatments from a qualified technician in a good facility than to keep paying for this machine on Easy Pay at QVC, so back it goes.  I am sorry it did not work as I had high hopes for it.  The discomfort, however, is intolerable, at least for me, and while I have seen some improvements in facial hair on the chin and upper lip, they are not noticeable enough for me to continue using this device, especially in light of how uncomfortable it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Tria Laser 4X as directed every week for three weeks now and am seeing patches of skin where the hair isn&#x27;t growing back anymore. I&#x27;m impressed with the results so far and its been very easy to use.  I&#x27;ve never considered laser hair removal because of the cost so I&#x27;m glad that the Tria is working so well and was affordable (well, compared to the doctor visits).  I would recommend this product to anyone who is over waxing and shaving.</li>
    <li> I have worked with this device and seen it be effective so I&#x27;ll put down 4 stars (not perfect; some people find the effective power levels too painful). Just writing here because I&#x27;m alarmed that the Amazon page is suggesting (\\&quot;Frequently bought with...\\&quot;) that you buy red color laser glasses or goggles with the Tria. Please know that such glasses most likely do nothing for you. Tria uses a near-infrared (IR) laser with 808 nm wavelength. The light actually is visible as a dull red color just due to the sheer intensity. Because of a tip diffuser, there is no external laser \\&quot;beam\\&quot; as such, and Tria is FDA-approved as safe for home use without goggles, so long as the tip is kept away from your eyes. You can buy red-orange glasses (intended to block blue or green lasers) if you really want, but they are not designed for IR lasers and they probably won&#x27;t do much.  If you do want IR laser eye protection, then get goggles that block IR laser wavelengths.</li>
    <li> I am approaching month 3 and 70% of the hair is gone. It is well worth the money instead of the $$$ you would spend to do laser hair removal professionally. You must be consistent and use levels 4 &amp; 5. I can&#x27;t imagine the lower levels doing anything. Use it weekly. Others mentioned using an ice pack and that helps areas that are sensitive. It has a nice ergonomic design that makes it easy to hold. One charge is enough for all of my intended areas and I don&#x27;t mind recharging it. It takes a lot more dedication and attention to detail than getting it done professionally but that minor inconvenience is well worth the money you save. Also, my friends who got professional laser hair removal report mild sunburns after pro treatments and the Tria is not that strong. This must mean that you need to use it more often for a longer time period but again, that is worth the money you save and the wonderful convenience of doing it in the privacy of your home and on your own schedule. It is just as effective at pro treatments, it just takes more treatments over a longer period.</li>
    <li> You need patience ...and a high tolerance of pain in the beginning! I had to start at the lowest level for the first two weeks because I could NOT tolerate the pain, which is a sting/burn/intense pinch!! And I thought I could tolerate pain (I have mid-size tattoos on my back at the most boniest parts, so I thought hair removal would be a piece of cake! Boy was I in for a rude awakening)!! I purchased the TRIA mainly for my upper lip, underarms, and legs. I&#x27;ve used it weekly on my legs (knees and below) and sparingly on my underarms since purchasing it in mid-January (it&#x27;s been approx 10 weeks now). I definitely notice the hair on my legs growing at a MUCH slower pace than when I shaved it. BUT I&#x27;m only up to the fourth level (out of five levels) and am feeling a little pain. Maybe next week I&#x27;ll try it at the fifth level :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at the third level on my underarms but admit I don&#x27;t use it weekly. I do, however, notice less hair growth in that area though. I TRIED to use it in my bikini area and I can&#x27;t even tolerate it on the first level!! I don&#x27;t understand how women can tolerate the pain in this area...I zapped it twice and then never attempted to go near that area again :( .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I have seen a difference in slow hair growth over time. I hope by June I&#x27;ll be &#x27;hairless&#x27; on my lower legs. I&#x27;ve read other reviewers who also experienced pain and others suggested to try numbing the area with ice (dry area before zapping) or numb it with numbing cream. I&#x27;ll have to look into these suggestions and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this worked great for me. I have fair skin and darker hair. I followed the instructions exactly and now I have less hair than I did 6 weeks ago! My hair came back in much finer and sparse. I will keep using this as over time I can see it being more effective. I have used this on legs, underarms, and bikini. I saw the most results with my legs, the bikini area is a bit more sensitive so I couldn&#x27;t have the strength up as high and I think that is a factor. The battery doesn&#x27;t last that long, especially after doing a leg, but it does charge back up fairly quickly. I have to say I love this because it is SO much cheaper than the laser hair removal sessions I did at my dermatologist, and it&#x27;s does work!</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this product  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  After one treatment, I can feel a real difference.  I look forward to when the shaving stops completely.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I gave this a low reading, not because of the item, but because I can not figure this out.  I always thought I was smart, but&lt;br /&gt;I do not now.  The first thing I did was over did the amount and scared myself.  Second, I put it away!  At the cost of $500 if&lt;br /&gt;I remember correctly, I lost out.  Does anyone have any suggestions.  I do not think this is the problem of the item.</li>
    <li> I bought the Tria 4x from the official Tria website. I had serious bikini burn bumps that spread all the way through my inner thighs. Also, the hair grew back the next day after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for about 6 weeks now and already my bumps are gone, completely! Also, I only have to shave my bikini area once a week. I use the Tria 4x one time a week and it is quick and awesome! I was skeptikal because it costs so much but, it is honestly worth is if you have sensitive bikini areas.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Product was in great condition &amp; received it earlier than expected. I haven&#x27;t truly used it as well as I should so can&#x27;t give a good response on how well it works. I have researched &amp; have found another one that I may purchase that&#x27;s suppose to work alot better. I will see.</li>
    <li> The product says to not use in the gential area. Has anyone used it there? I&#x27;m wanting to use this product instead of continuing to get brazillian waxing. But, if it absolutely can not be used in this area, I don&#x27;t want to bother. Thank you!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for days, decided the TRIA 4x laser was worth a try, and I&#x27;m VERY HAPPY with the results so far.  I have been using for 3 months now and am amazed that it is actually doing what it claims to do, I&#x27;m close to hair free already on the area I&#x27;m treating! AND ingrown hairs gone!! I have been doing one area at a time as to not overwhelm myself and always do a level 5 for faster results. My advice is to stick with it because it takes time! It is NOT painless and some areas hurt more than others, Icing the area before use helps though. I would recommend to anyone! After looking into laser hair removal, This is less than the cost one treatment area would have been plus the convenience of home. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I can&#x27;t wait to start another area. You can even do easy pay monthly payments. : )</li>
    <li> I was hesitate to spend this much on a hair removal item. I have been going to electrolysis appointments for almost 4 years for some black facial/neck hairs. I have been using this product for five weeks and have noticed a signicifant improvement!  While I have finer, lighter hair growth now, I don&#x27;t have the embarrasing and course black hairs.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Will have to wait for the results in three months.  Hopefully this will be the end to laser hair removal places.</li>
    <li> I am just not sure on this.  It does hurt on my upper lip.  And I only have a few dark hairs here and there, being it only works on dark hair kind of expensive for that.</li>
    <li> Great Results from the Tria!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting the Tria for awhile now, but since they came out with the 4Xmodel, I finally decided to make the investment.&lt;br /&gt;It has been well worth the money, I&#x27;ve used it a few times on my underarms and see the hair isn&#x27;t growing back.  My skin is smooth and I don&#x27;t have the black stubbles from shaving.  It&#x27;s truly amazing and I am going to continue using it and hopefully someday soon, I willnever have to shave my underarms again.  Tria has been a lifesaver and worth my investment.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the Tria.</li>
    <li> It is too heavy.  You need to recharge the battery in the middle of doing one leg, so it takes hours to complete two legs. After spending so much time and money ($450), it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have NO hair loss in any area I used it on.  And since I missed the 90 day guarantee, Tria won&#x27;t refund my money.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this thing and absolutely loves it. She&#x27;s seeing significant results and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I decided that I would give it a go. I was a little hesitant after reading reviews. Either people were giving it a 4 or a 1. I have very dark hair and pretty light skin in the winter time so I thought it would be the perfect time to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main area I am focused on is my underarm area. Since I have such dark/thick/coarse hair, sometimes it almost seemed pointless to shave. It left a 5o&#x27; clock shadow if you will. It looked like I shaved two days prior. It leaves me self conscious and irritated. It didn&#x27;t matter what kind of razor I purchased. Waxing is just a pain in the butt. My hair grows back so fast it was just pointless to go through the pain and money of waxing only for it to last just a few days. I have never had professional laser hair removal before I can only imagine what people go through paying so much money painfully, literally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Calming Gel along with the Tria Laser. To be perfectly honest, the gel doesn&#x27;t have any effect on me. My mom swears it works better using the gel but I disagree. (She&#x27;s a lot tougher than me though!) The first time I used Tria, I knew it was going to hurt, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting this! Some people describe it as a rubber band snap. But I don&#x27;t have a very high pain tolerance. To me it feels like a poke from a needle or safety pin. The pain doesn&#x27;t last long, a few seconds at the most but knowing it&#x27;s going to happen again is dreadful. My underarm hair is so thick I could only use a level 2 without ibuprofen. So I would take 2 an hour before treating, once a week, and I was sometimes able to use a level 3. A level 3 really stings for me. Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t seeing very good results. Maybe my hair was growing slower but not a huge difference. I am incredibly inpatient and wanted results now! Summer is just around the corner! The instructions state you won&#x27;t see results for 3-6 months but like I said I wanted faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after I purchased I read reviews. Someone had suggested going over the same spot 3-5 times for faster results. They also said try to use the laser a few hours after shaving so it will clearly read all the hair follicles. Another suggested applying numbing cream an hour before use to help with the pain. Someone also said they ice the area before use. So I&#x27;ve been icing and going over 3 times or so and I&#x27;m able to do a level 4 on my armpits. I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m seeing results! Instead of treating once every two weeks, I treat every other day or so. If I have the time, I will treat any time I feel hair stubble. One time I didn&#x27;t treat for almost a week and noticed little circle patches of hair that just weren&#x27;t growing back like other areas. It looked kind of silly but I was so happy to know that it is working and that I need to grow over certain spots more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely have to be committed to this laser for the best results. Make it your best friend. I wasn&#x27;t commited at first and was dreading the treatment every time. But at that time I wasn&#x27;t seeing results. Now that I take ibuprofen and ice it I can use a higher level and I am making progress. It&#x27;s motivating and I am happy to do it. I strongly advise using the highest level you can stand for best results. It&#x27;s definitely easier said than done. I put ice cubes in a sandwich bag and apply to one spot until it almost hurts and laser that area. It&#x27;s a little time consuming but I&#x27;d rather be on a level 4 or 5 versus a 2 or 3. I am tempted to start on my upper lip but I&#x27;m hesisant about shaving there. **The higher the level the better results**  What I love about this is it&#x27;s done in the privacy of your own home. Anytime, anywhere. I work grave yard shift and pretty much sleep all day long. I doubt there&#x27;s a professional laser hair removal treatment open 24 hours a day. I recently started using Greencaine numbing gel. I put on a thick layer and saran wrap for an hour before I start to laser. It doesn&#x27;t completely take away the pain but it certainly does help. It&#x27;s a little pricey for such a small tube so if you don&#x27;t want to spend anymore money I recommend using ice cubes or a frozen bottle of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I gave it a 4 because like everyone else says, the head is smaller than the size of a dime and it makes it harder to treat larger areas. Right now I am only treating underarms but eventually I&#x27;d like to start on my legs. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long but since I am only treating my underarms I can get through both sides without having to recharge before I&#x27;m finished. The machine itself is a bit heavy and will make it hard to treat hard to reach areas as your arm will get tired after a while. But, nothing is perfect. It&#x27;s not going to please everyone, but I highly recommend this product. Fortunately I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it dying after 10 pulses or 10 minutes (knock on wood). I hope my review was helpful! Best of luck to everyone!</li>
    <li> I like the Tria Hair Removal Laser but I still haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine if it actually works well.</li>
    <li> I have used this as directed and have seen a major improvement. For thicker areas of hair it takes a couple extra weeks. But no more ingrown hairs in the sensitive areas like the bikini line because the hair is gone. Wish I would have had this years ago.</li>
    <li> In theory this could work. But I actually find it very ineffective. I have used it every other day on select areas and found no reduction. I&#x27;ve seen department stores selling cheaper products, like 1/4 the price here. I see no reason why they would work more or less. The Tria is the elite brand name, but I&#x27;m not seeing elite results. I&#x27;ve had this for two years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and i started to lose some hair and there are areas that have no hair</li>
    <li> this product meets all what I expected from!&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, clear instructions, comfortable, quick results, but it would be much better if battery would stay more!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tria on my underarms and bikini area for 7 weeks now and definitely see less hair but definitely not hairless.  I would say about 50% reduction in hair so far.  I have read that it is hard to be completely hair-free but I will update later.  It does take a long time which is why I haven&#x27;t done my legs yet.  Also, it is definitely painful but does become less painful overtime since you have less hair - it hurts the most where the hair is the thickest (I started on setting 4 and now use setting 5).  So far I&#x27;m happy with the results since I can definitely see reduction in hair and I can shave less.  I have light skin and dark hair so I&#x27;m a good candidate for the Tria.</li>
    <li> I have battled with hair on my face for years. I have shaved, bleached and removed with diplatories.  I even went through about  10 laser sessions when they first came out. I spent over 2,000 on lasers at that time.  I was skeptical when I first bought this, but hopeful that I would finally find a solution to embarassing facial hair.  I&#x27;ve had 5 sessions now. The results are amazing. The reduction of hair on my face is about 75%.  I don&#x27;t worry as much about shaving and plucking constantly.  If the results continue i would expect no hair. WOW For  those of us who have had to endure hair on our face this is a miracle.  I would not recommend the product for large areas. The treated area is very small. It is perfect for the face and touch ups.If you want to do a leg it&#x27;s 600 zaps just for one upper leg. That would be 2,400 zaps for the legs to treat once. Yikes.  I use it on level 3. It&#x27;s not that painful. It feels like a rubber band snap. You can go lower, but I read it isn&#x27;t as effective. Would I buy it again? Definitely, I am so pleased with the results on my face. By the way i have medium skin and light brown hair.&lt;br /&gt; *****I wanted to add something based on a question. It is not difficult to activate. You call the number and it takes one minute.  Each time you use it, you have to unlock the laser by matching your skin to the red light on the bottom. Some people mistakenly think it isn&#x27;t working when they just have to unlock it. It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to learn the basics.  I am not very good with technical things. Like programming my VCR LOL, and I found it easy.  I continue to see amazing results.  I&#x27;ve done 6 sessions now.</li>
    <li> I love this Tria. It&#x27;s almost worth the price to do your own lasering at home, being comfortable. The high setting does hurt depending on the area but you can do it over small areas, over time. It definitely works, just with a little time and mild pain.</li>
    <li> Easy to use works great. If you have a stray hair just grab it and zap. No worrying about making appointments or driving over just to wait your turn.  Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> I hesitated to make the purchase since it is a little pricey but finally gave in and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve had spa treatment hair removal and this feels exactly the same in intensity.  Most people don&#x27;t realize that even laser hair removal requires a twice yearly &amp;#34;tune-up&amp;#34; to keep you hair free after your treatment is completed.  At 300 dollars an hour (approx) the cost racks up quickly.  I&#x27;ve had the Tria for about 3 months and have done my legs, underarms and upper lip so far.  A great purchase if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the tria on my underarms and bikini area once a week for about 8 weeks now.  Never expected it to work as well as it has.  Underarm hair is gone, and looks like bikini area will only need a few more treatments.  Just started using it on my lower legs.  Amazing product!</li>
    <li> UPDATED June 23: 3 months in, and I&#x27;ve been using weekly on underarms and bikini line (and a bit less consistently on lower legs).  My bikini line is probably 60-70% hair-free and what&#x27;s left is very light in color and texture.  Underarms are probably 50%, but the hair is growing much slower.  I only shave them once a week now. Hopeful that I&#x27;ll get continued improvement there...  Legs, even with inconsistent use, are responding very well (probably 25% of hair left).  I mentioned my results to a friend who underwent professional treatment, and she suggested that the underarm hair is denser and more coarse than other areas, hence the slower improvement.  I&#x27;ll try to update in a few more months; hope this is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product at the beginning of March after a lot of research regarding whether to purchase the Silk&#x27;n, Tria, or bite the bullet and go with professional laser.  I&#x27;m 6 treatments in on my underarms and 4 in on my bikini line, and it&#x27;s making a huge difference on my underarms and some difference on my bikini line.  I&#x27;m down to shaving every 4-5 days and probably 50-60% hair loss (entire patches are gone, whereas some areas look mostly unaffected).  No word on whether it will be permanent, but Tria is absolutely having an effect.  I didn&#x27;t notice any results at all until completion of the 4th treatment.  Consistency is key.  The biggest bonus so far is less ingrown hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the bad news: it HURTS in the beginning. I&#x27;ve been self-waxing my bikini line for years and have a pretty high pain tolerance, and the first few sessions brought tears to my eyes and required me to take breaks every few minutes.  For the first session, I used the system on setting 3 on bikini and 4 on underarms.  I have very pale skin and medium to dark brown hair, and at level 5 the best I can compare it to is a hot match being set on the skin. I can handle that on one or two spots, but not 75 per arm!  It does improve over time as you lose hair andit lightens up.  I used it on level 5 this morning and the pain was negligible. A very close shave before use helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some temporary redness on the skin after use, but no swelling or lingering pain.  The burn from the laser only lasts 1-2 seconds and then it&#x27;s fine. The redness went away in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update this in 4-5 months with more comprehensive results, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this device , and actually I really feel regret because of it. I tried to use it and since day one the key power is not working probably whenever I press on it it gives me a blue color then it goes blank again , I tried to read the instructions but I found what goes with me is a miss and then I watched a video and also it shows that the device is not working in a prober way , I tried to give a feedback , and they wrote that they will reply within 12 hours and till now no answers back to me.. I tried to explain manytimes to the agent here in our country about my problem but also didn’t give me any reaction and he said that its not my problem any more I gave u the device and am not responsable  for the return or the warranty!! This is a miss and I really hate it..am sorry for writing this but I feel like paying money around $450 without any benefits or even a service</li>
    <li> I love love love my Tria! So worth the money.. Will tell you that it works best on dark hair and fair skin.</li>
    <li> I have been researching this product extensively for a while and have just spoken to Tria Beauty (the manufacturer) on the phone and here&#x27;s what they said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the weight of this new model is exactly the same as the 3rd gen model (about 5 lb), which is about 1 lb lighter than the first generation.&lt;br /&gt;2) battery lasts only 30-35 min on maximum power (same as 3rd gen) - so that should be enough to do an area the size of bikini or underarms or one lower leg in one session. 1st gen had capacity for only 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3) Each unit is specifically built to have only 400 charges - after that is &#x27;self destructs&#x27; in that it completely stops working (and the company does not sell replacement batteries). The company says this &#x27;lifespan&#x27; should be more than enough to treat one person completely, but not to treat multiple people. This sounds pretty nasty from a customer perspective; but then again we don&#x27;t really have much choice as far as a reputable Diode Laser hair removal (not just laser-like) technology for the home.&lt;br /&gt;4) The company offers 90 days money back but ONLY if you buy directly from their website (when buying from Amazon&#x27;s Tria Beauty you only get 30 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I changed my relationship with my Tria following a two-year break from my first devoted treatments. I have the first model. (I had to buy a replacement about a year after the first was knocked from our second-floor deck railing, but it went largely unused when I suddenly became a full-time caregiver two years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial approach (year one) was to get every hair immediately (which would overhwelm me and make me think it was impossible), wait a few weeks or more, then start over. I did this three or four times that year. My hair growth was greatly reduced and slowed, and regrowth was finer by about half (at least half the bulk of one hair than before). This was pretty incredible. But I really hated every minute of treatment and dreaded doing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there&#x27;s a much more effective way to get the most from a Tria. Like exercise equipment, you have to use it, regardless of what model you have. If I had repeated that process several more times (I treated many areas of my body and some stubborn facial hairs) that first year, I expect I would have had even better results--but I had Tria burnout (but NO burns, just occasional redness. But don&#x27;t have oil on your skin when you use it--I believe that&#x27;s called \\&quot;cooking\\&quot;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found a better way this time around: Use it frequently, and keep the sessions short. Make friends with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently (two years after those first treatments), I started feeling course stubble in areas I had treated. I sort of freaked out over this and charged up the Tria. I felt discouraged already, so I decided on this plan: add just 10 minutes of Tria-ing to my schedule every day, or every other day. (I tell myself things like, some people have to wear a prosthesis or go through other complicated medical treatments every day, and compared to that this is NO BIG DEAL. I shoot it at random places--at whatever level the given area can take (I used the highest--not as bad as a bee sting-- when at allpossible; the pain greatly decreases the more you use it, and maybe depending on the site)--where it bothers me the most (the dark, course hairs first). I might end up doing more while I&#x27;m at it. If I&#x27;m on a roll, I&#x27;ll keep it up until the charge is gone (but I resist this, because then it takes too much time and I&#x27;ll want to avoid it again, and I rarely have that much time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only about a week, I am pleasantly surprised/relieved that it&#x27;s getting back under control, and the regrowth is already much slower and finer. (The zapped hairs are just being tugged out when I shave, so that&#x27;s easier, too). I can already skip a day shaving. By the way, I&#x27;m someone with enough body hair that it&#x27;s been an obsession most of my life, and I no longer qualify as \\&quot;young.\\&quot; I would ordinarily (without Tria) shave daily. I had electrolysis on my face years ago (which was in fact permanent, with mild regrowth here and there. I now Tria the ones that aren&#x27;t white--but point it away from my eyes. The Tria company says not to do this. I have seen laser shades online [but some people say they&#x27;re worthless.]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finding that I now actually look forward to it, motivated by the results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like any other chore. I had to incorporate it in my schedule to keep things from getting out of hand. I can now actually tell what ones I&#x27;ve zapped before (in the later stages of the growth cycle) and just keep zapping them--several times). I&#x27;ll do this until the Tria&#x27;s zapped out or nothing grows back (and retreat any regrowth occasionally as needed). I expect I&#x27;ll have longer-lasting results (because even though the sessions are short, the cumulative effects will win out) and that I&#x27;ll have retreated individual hairs enough that many won&#x27;t ever reappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they do, I&#x27;ll buy another Tria--capitalism at its finest. But it&#x27;s ridiculously cheaper than professional hair removal of any kind, I fit it into my schedule, create my own \\&quot;atmosphere,\\&quot; and it&#x27;s private.I also believe the pain is worse when someone is inflicting it on you. It&#x27;s just a natural perception. (This proved true when I had my partner help my with some hard-to-reach areas; I&#x27;m more stoic when I use it on myself. Even so, this helper method can be fun, btw, with the right partner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If possible, listen to great music while you&#x27;re Tria-ing. Take your (legal, over-the-counter, prescription, etc.) substance of choice--but I don&#x27;t find that necessary. Come up with great ideas. Whatever you can to associate it with pleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Progress, not perfection. Tria will prevail, if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have done only THREE treatments so far with my Tria 4x, and notice a SIGNIFICANT difference already!! I could not be happier. I was a little worried, but I had done my research and had ultimately decided on the Tria after reading other reviews. I can honestly say I am 90% hair-free on my bikini line, and about 50% hair-free on my legs. And what does grow back is so fine that you would barely notice it. I still have quite a few more treatments to go, and will update after I have done the recommended six treatments. I use it on the highest setting every time, which tends to be painful in certain areas, so I just apply ice to numb those areas. I am extremely satisfied thus far with the Tria 4x.</li>
    <li> I just started the treatment. I have lightly tan skin, but not too dark to qualify. My hair is black. I have had professional laser done for 2 years and it did work with consistency, but it does take time, as these lasers are only effective when the hair is in its growth stage. This is why it takes many treatments.. We have billions of follicles all in different stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this to touch up the left over black hairs that were not permanently removed from professional treatments. (purchased a series at the time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found at level 5 the pain was significantly less than the professional laser. If you treat the same area a few times in a row, it may feel like a stronger zap, but seriously the pain is nothing. I may have a high pain tolerance or maybe since I do spend time in the sun, my skin is not as sensitive. In more sensitive areas, it is something you might want to quickly clench for. :-) I suspect a large area like arms or legs, can be tolerated with Tylenol prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It some lighter areas of my skin, it appears that some of the dark hairs were burned off, but this isn&#x27;t the norm and shouldn&#x27;t be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am doing a personal test to see if it really is better to shave, than to have some of the hair showing just out of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will focus on the same follicles every week, to see what happens. Keep you all updated.</li>
    <li> Only issue is how small of an area it covers for each beep. Other than that I have gotten great results.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I ever ordered.  This really works!! I have tried just about every product for hair removal and this is the only one I found that truly does the job.  Expensive but worth every penny.  Inexpensive when you consider the cost of going for professional hair removal. Professional results at home.  It does sting a little but when I consider each sting as one hair gone it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I would not hesitate to highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried many devices over the years, including the expensive spa treatments and well as plastic surgeons treatments via laser.  I have used bleaches, and the infamous NONO.  All have failed.  I have olive skin and dark hair.  I didnt expect much but thought I would spend the 450 dollars and just see.  To my surprise it works beautifully!  After just one treatment the hair did not grow back!  I still use 1X weekly but I no longer have to use tweezers daily!  I do not believe there is ONE product for everyone, but this is the product for me!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this almost three months and love it. Legs, under arms and bikini line are all nearly hair free. On levels, I went from 3 to 5 on legs, 2 To 4 under arms and 2 to 3 on bikini line. Higher numbers work better. I am 49 and am looking forward to not shaving the rest of my life, &amp; hopefully not slipping in the shower while teetering on one foot and dying young :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son is using it on his unibrow.  I gave one to my daughter for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Tria and Amazon read this. The packaging is ridiculous. There are about 8 levels of packaging like nesting dolls. It is very well designed, but overkill. I already bought it, the fancy packaging makes me feel like I could have paid a lot less if you had shipped it in Amazon&#x27;s hassle free packaging. Plus, with environmental concerns, you could market it as  a feature to not kill an entire tree on each laser.</li>
