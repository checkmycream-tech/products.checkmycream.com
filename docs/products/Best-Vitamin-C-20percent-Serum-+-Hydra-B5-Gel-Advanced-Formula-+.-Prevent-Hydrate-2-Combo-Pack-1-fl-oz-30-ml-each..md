      <li>and my skin has never been better.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my skin looks and feels after using these products.  </li>
      <li>Use better with needle rooler to get better results.</li>
      <li>but it makes my skin feel very good when I use it and does seem to improve texture pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Also love the Hydra Gel - great daily moisturizer with hyaluronic acid.</li>
      <li>I have seen a huge improvement in my skin..</li>
      <li>I am 32 and my skin is so even and bright and soft.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and is the closest I tried that comes close to skinceutals I would buy this product in the future.</li>

      <li>Great daily combo.</li>
      <li>Vitamin C 20% Serum Advanced Formula 20% Vitamin C, 0.5% Ferulic and Hydra B5 Gel</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am one pleased customer and would recommend these products and really, this brand to anyone who is looking to better their skin care regimen.</li>
      <li>LOL) Due to my skincare needs I buy this combo and the Resurfacing Serum which I use at night with my B5 Serum.</li>
      <li>Great Vitamin C serum, comparable to similar, much higher-priced ones in the market.</li>
      <li>thats because its clearing the free radicals from your face so you can look pretty and young :)</li>
      <li>They are worth every penny I spend on them.</li>
      <li>I apply this in the AM before my day cream and my skin is soft, hydrated and feels so much better.</li>
      <li>As a loyal SkinCeuticals fan, I was apprehensive at first to purchase this two pack of Vitamin C 20% serum and Hydra B5 Gel, offered from Cosmetic Skin Solutions.</li>
      <li>And since the bottles are glass bottles (which is the major factor as well, since everyone knows glass is better for storing rather than plastic )</li>
      <li>I was really never 100% happy and was always buying smth new to add to my \\&quot;sick\\&quot; collection.</li>
      <li>I have always had dry skin and this product is an amazing supplement to moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Overall a great value, and we have purchased several times thru this retailer on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Thank you Cosmetic Skin Solutions, you have done what Skinceuticals did, but for a much cheaper price!</li>
      <li>I also noticed it smells a bit funny compared to what I&#x27;m used to</li>
      <li>Do you online research even outside the Amazon, and you will be pleased with what people are saying and blogging about.</li>
      <li>2 years ago I have discovered (due to my own research)</li>
      <li>Out of pure discretion, this product is for my wife.  </li>
      <li>These are very soothing</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even use that for that very reason.</li>
      <li>but it goes on and is sticky until it dries really well.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s helped the appearance of my skin so much.</li>
      <li>The service was fast and reliable.  </li>
      <li>, I can really tell it on my skin it gets shinier</li>
      <li>I am very thankful to CSS for these products, and for the compliments that I get for my &amp;#34;young looking and smooth&amp;#34; skin.</li>
      <li>You know, the one that does exactly like it says, and maybe even a little bit more?</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Recommend highly and buying the 2 together is a money saver.</li>
      <li>She swears by it as a good topical application, and is as good if not better than a certain name brand out there that is 3 times as expensive.  </li>
      <li>The summer is probably an important time to use it too, due to it&#x27;s built in sun protection and free-radical defense.</li>
      <li>I will give it another go once it isn&#x27;t as hot outside.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old</li>
      <li>I came across this brand and decided to give it a try, particularly because of the low cost.</li>
      <li>After further research, I discovered that it should not have any smell, and should be clear in color.  </li>
      <li>the Vitamin C does sting a little at first but</li>
      <li>I have very dry &amp; sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These products are great quality and perform exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin C helps with discoloration. Skin seems replenished, freshened and rested,</li>
    <li> Out of pure discretion, this product is for my wife.  She swears by it as a good topical application, and is as good if not better than a certain name brand out there that is 3 times as expensive.  Overall a great value, and we have purchased several times thru this retailer on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have seen a huge improvement in my skin..</li>
    <li> I am going to start out and say I have been searching for a very long time to find, \\&quot;The Product!\\&quot; You know, the one that does exactly like it says, and maybe even a little bit more? Here it is!!! For me it is the BEST! Thank you Cosmetic Skin Solutions, you have done what Skinceuticals did, but for a much cheaper price! I am sold forever on this! Please....Do not ever discontinue!! The most amazing serums:) So if you are skeptical of the waters, \\&quot;DO DIVE IN!!\\&quot; lol I have seen a noticable difference from a few days!!! Makes my skin look and feel so Wonderful! Can not say enough about this product! You have nothing to lose if you are searching for a serum that WORKS!!! For me, it is and always will be, \\&quot;Great Stuff!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I can not tell if it will make a difference long term yet or not cause I have only been using for a month but it makes my skin feel very good when I use it and does seem to improve texture pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> My skin is cooked by the Arizona Sun and dehydrated also. I have great hopes in three products including those two.But this climate I live in is harsh and yet not one product alone can help. So a combination of this and that helps. Always finishing my care schedule with a sunscreen cream.</li>
    <li> All I can tell you about myself is that I am skincare junkie...or used to be!...I never stayed with one skincare product bc I was really never 100% happy and was always buying smth new to add to my \\&quot;sick\\&quot; collection. So I could never say that I was a devoted customer to any skincare line. Up until 2 years ago I have discovered (due to my own research) Cosmetic Skincare solutions, and I have been their devoted customer since.And now all my girlfriends and their girlfriends use it and love it. One of my friends (who is a hair salon owner) gave all her good clients these miracle products for Christmas this year (she buys this combo as well and panics when her supply is getting low,LOL) Due to my skincare needs I buy this combo and the Resurfacing Serum which I use at night with my B5 Serum. These products truly are amazing. I am 32 and my skin is so even and bright and soft. Before I have found this company I thought of getting hyloronic acid injections and now I am so satisfied how my skin looks ,I dont think about needles in my face. And you can not not like the price. Do you online research even outside the Amazon, and you will be pleased with what people are saying and blogging about. And BTW, their customer service is THE BEST customer service on planet Earth, they ship so fast and free.And since the bottles are glass bottles (which is the major factor as well, since everyone knows glass is better for storing rather than plastic ) they are packed so carefully, in 2 years I have never received a broken or damaged bottles.</li>
    <li> Great products...The combination of Vitamin C 20% Serum Advanced Formula 20% Vitamin C, 0.5% Ferulic and Hydra B5 Gel Advanced Formula Moisture-enhancing gel, work excellent together. I have been using this combination over 6 months and started noticing results after 4-6 weeks. My skin texture was improved and my skin felt tighter (firmer). I have over 50 skin and tried many products to get the results I&#x27;m getting, this combination works for me. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> As a loyal SkinCeuticals fan, I was apprehensive at first to purchase this two pack of Vitamin C 20% serum and Hydra B5 Gel, offered from Cosmetic Skin Solutions. I am obsessed with the SkinCeuticals products, but the price is the only down fall. I came across this brand and decided to give it a try, particularly because of the low cost. I ordered the 2 pack and just two days later, it arrived and I have to say, I am as happy as I can be with the products! They are identical to the SkinCeuticals products, but perhaps, one ingredient has been changed in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydra B5 Gel- I have always had dry skin and this product is an amazing supplement to moisturizer.I apply this in the AM before my day cream and my skin is soft, hydrated and feels so much better. It can be applied alone, as well, as it is very efficient on it&#x27;s own. The serum is versatile enough to apply at night or in the morning. B5 is an anti-inflammatory, so if you have redness or your skin is cracking, this will help heal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C 20% Serum-this product is identical to the SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum, which is USD153.00, but the Cosmetic Skin Solutions product is USD39.95! This serum is unbelievable, the Vitamin C component protects skin from the sun rays (UVA/UVB radiation).  It improves elasticity of skin by enhancing the production of collagen.  Helps diminish hyperpigmentation, erythma, and skin redness. The Vitamin E helps enhance the performance of your SPF and essentially, helps to protect your skin from the harmful rays of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am one pleased customer and would recommend these products and really, this brand to anyone who is looking to better their skin care regimen. I swear by these products and will be a loyal fan to Cosmetic Skin Solutions!!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels after using these products.  Recommend highly and buying the 2 together is a money saver.</li>
    <li> when they say, the best stuff ... they mean it. and it&#x27;s affordable. what more can you really ask for in an awesome skin care regimen. I&#x27;m 23 years old and it&#x27;s helped the appearance of my skin so much. the Vitamin C does sting a little at first but thats because its clearing the free radicals from your face so you can look pretty and young :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, i think it works great, I can really tell it on my skin it gets shinier</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year now and my skin has never been better.  I&#x27;ve always suffered from extremely dry skin and these products have done wonders for the condition of my skin.  These products are a must have in my daily skin regimen.</li>
    <li> Use both of it together can help recover dry skin and dark spots look lighter  than usual . thank you</li>
    <li> Both of these are great product, for the quality and price.  The service was fast and reliable.  I will buy again from Cosmetic Skin solutions.</li>
    <li> I use hyaluronic acid serums in place of moisturizer. This one works well and hydrates my skin. I have oily skin that is acne prone and it fights the dryness caused by my acne products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to rate the Vit. C serum as I don&#x27;t use it as much, probably because it makes my face a bit shiny and I don&#x27;t want to wear too many products during the day in the summer. The summer is probably an important time to use it too, due to it&#x27;s built in sun protection and free-radical defense. I already use toner, serum and sunscreen. I also noticed it smells a bit funny compared to what I&#x27;m used to but I think that is because it has the ferulic acid in it. I will give it another go once it isn&#x27;t as hot outside.</li>
    <li> These products are great quality and perform exactly as described.I love this product, i think it works great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use several of the products from Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  I order these items and also the eye serum, but I didn&#x27;t need to replace that yet.  I prefer to order several items because they run out at the same time, and I use them together.  I am very thankful to CSS for these products, and for the compliments that I get for my &amp;#34;young looking and smooth&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see any improvement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about a month now.  I feel like the Vitamin C it evened out my skin tone...but it goes on and is sticky until it dries really well.  The vitamin B5 felt even worse. I don&#x27;t even use that for that very reason.</li>
    <li> this keeps my skin smooth, hydrated, and glowing! i love it. Thank you for making excellent skincare products</li>
    <li> love!!! IN JUST ONE WEEK I SAW THE EFFECT</li>
    <li> Very good products.  I have very dry &amp; sensitive skin.  I use them every morning &amp; sometimes at night. (I use a night moisturizer usually).  I notice a brighter complexion.  I have been using these two together for at least 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin C serum, comparable to similar, much higher-priced ones in the market. Have used for several years now. Also love the Hydra Gel - great daily moisturizer with hyaluronic acid. Great daily combo. Get lots of complements on my complexion.</li>
    <li> cant beat for the price!!! I used is clinincal and still like their active serum better than anything I have foudn with this company but for the price you cannot go wrong with these products.</li>
    <li> Chose this rating as I feel this is a quality product.  These are very soothing and I believe they are making a difference in not only the texture of my skin, but also the appearance.  Feels wonderful when applied.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin care line and I have been using it for about a year.  The products always arrive quickly and perfectly packaged.</li>
    <li> I love both of these products and order them time and time again. They are worth every penny I spend on them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and is the closest I tried that comes close to skinceutals I would buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C has a nasty odor to it.  After further research, I discovered that it should not have any smell, and should be clear in color.  I do not suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I love them and recomend everybody. My skin looks healthier . Use better with needle rooler to get better results.</li>
</ol>
