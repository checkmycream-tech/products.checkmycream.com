    <li> My wife has used this for years and swears by it.</li>
    <li> Does wonders! Great product and competitve price</li>
    <li> very very good will continue to use</li>
    <li> Have purchased before. Have not gotten the same results.</li>
    <li> It appears to have slowed or stopped my hair loss, as my stylist says that my hair is thicker than it was. I don&#x27;t have my &amp;#34;widows peak&amp;#34; back, but I&#x27;m not seeing more receding hair line.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with results</li>
