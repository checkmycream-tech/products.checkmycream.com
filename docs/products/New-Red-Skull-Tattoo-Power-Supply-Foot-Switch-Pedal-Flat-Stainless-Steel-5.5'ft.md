      <li>It looks nice but so flat dat sometimes foot slides off.</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy with this footswitch, unlike my past pedals where you step on them to turn them on or off this pedal works off of pressure, it won&#x27;t run if u raise your foot off of it.</li>
      <li>This pedal is VERY nice, solid, and bigger than we thought it would be!!</li>
      <li>this product is exactly what i was looking for</li>
      <li>Since the first day it arrive at my house</li>
      <li>Not only the most awsome looking pedal I ever saw.</li>

      <li>Very sensetive.</li>
      <li>not to mention i received it really fast.</li>
      <li>it such quality for so cheap</li>
      <li>But very functional.</li>

      <li>Its so easy to use won&#x27;t use any other pedel thank u</li>
      <li>I have thrown away numerous pedals because the wire would develope a short and it was not an easy fix.</li>
      <li>It does say NEW.</li>
      <li>but since I fixed it it has been a work horse</li>
      <li>ordered a new red skull pedal</li>
      <li>When I use other pedals its irratiating to have to step on it off and on off and on, I highly recommend this footswitch to anybody and everybody!!</li>
      <li>apparently they did not have this product I stock and choose to ship it</li>

<li> This is the second one I have bought not because one failed but</li>
<li> I would not recommend using this pedal for anything other than practicing on fake skin.  </li>
<li> Minimum effort to press its has a consistant flow and tough as nails.</li>

They said they would help or vide me a partial refund but haven&#x27;t heard back from then since communication skills I give neutral rating holiday week I know gets hectic but I do hope to here from them soon and I also hope this helps other shoppers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift my for brother-in-law. I am hoping that it works. I was impressed with how quickly I received it. *Here comes the BUT....* BUT when I took it out of the package I noticed scratches all over the skull. The color was the same as the pic. I was just disappointed when I saw all the scratches all over it. It does say NEW.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product .I ordered a new red skull pedal and they sent me a used black pedal . The leads to the pedal are very loose and come off easily.</li>
    <li> This foot pedal is a piece of junk. It has a short in it. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I give this item top rating! This is the second one I have bought not because one failed but because I husband gave the first one away to his nephew! Even though. He loved it!  Its so easy to use won&#x27;t use any other pedel thank u</li>
    <li> please don&#x27;t do it  to your self ! I  got it  for my fiance  birthday n  they sent  the wrong color  and take awhile to write  back</li>
    <li> this product is exactly what i was looking for i would recommend it to any body what an awesome product</li>
    <li> i got this for a gift for my husband, he loves the design and the quality. def a great purchase</li>
    <li> My son has a shop and i thought it was cute so i bought it.  Works fine, but the plastic eyes had to be re-glued.</li>
    <li> i ordered this pedal as a spare for my fiancee and so far he has yet to use it so ill reply to what i think later.</li>
    <li> The peddle works great and looks great but it came with a light that doesn&#x27;t work. Shipped fast an for was inexpensive so all in all a good deal.</li>
    <li> got this as a surprise for my brother...it&#x27;s supposed to light up..but does&#x27;nt...works ok he says..but won&#x27;t last long,novelty item</li>
    <li> Since the first day it arrive at my house I plug it into my power supplier, it have not work since day one. It was putting a little power out for a sec, than just stop working.&lt;br /&gt; one of the cords was unplug off the pedal</li>
    <li> So far good it came with a missing eyes but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet post wen I do but looks great and received it pretty fast</li>
    <li> This is perfect! A switch that is pressure activated and has the capability of replacing the wires!!! I love it! I have thrown away numerous pedals because the wire would develope a short and it was not an easy fix. THIS IS FINALLY WHAT I NEED!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this product.  The red &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; fell out of the eyes and nose as soon as I picked the pedal up out of the box.  While this was not a complete deal breaker, the pedal itself was not usable.  I used it one time for five minutes and the pedal itself stuck consistently while the connection seemed to go in and out.  I would not say this product is at all safe to use while tattooing.  I would not recommend using this pedal for anything other than practicing on fake skin.  Upgrade before tattooing real skin.</li>
    <li> Happy with the foot switch and the quality of the product. Good service. Will use them again</li>
    <li> Works great.  One of the eye jewels/pieces has already come off but otherwise no complaints</li>
    <li> Very sensetive. Right now I am not having any kind of problems with wires or connections.&lt;br /&gt;Works 100% better than any conventional pedal. I love it and it is a better pedal than the one I had received with my tat kit.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for any beginner or professional.&lt;br /&gt;as for the ordering , it was received in a very short time and it was in perfect shape and it was the one I had ordered</li>
    <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had was the clamp broke but since I fixed it it has been a work horse</li>
    <li> I got 2 one for me and a friend both were well made look really cool and work excellent Worth every penny if I needed more I&#x27;d buy these every time</li>
    <li> Yea it works, but the red plastic lens of the eyes and stuff come off and some of it wasnt even in the box. LOL. He was literally a one eyed bandit.</li>
    <li> Its nice for the what you pay. one of the eye lences came off soon as we unwrapped took it out the box.</li>
    <li> Until when u open the package and everything start to fall off the foot pedal u might well just get a regular silver one the design is all gone</li>
    <li> fast shipping great job would buy again a !!!!</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this footswitch, unlike my past pedals where you step on them to turn them on or off this pedal works off of pressure, it won&#x27;t run if u raise your foot off of it. That&#x27;s important to me because I like to keep my foot on it during my work.

    <li> Haveing my cake and eating it too. Not only the most awsome looking pedal I ever saw. But very functional. Minimum effort to press its has a consistant flow and tough as nails. Great quick shipping</li>
