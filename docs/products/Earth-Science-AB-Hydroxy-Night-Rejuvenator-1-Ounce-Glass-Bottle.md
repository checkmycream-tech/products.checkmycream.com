      <li>I love it ! ! ! !</li>
      <li>Excellent for renewing skin tone and complexion.</li>
      <li>This product works great with my night time routine!</li>
      <li>I used to use a Neutrogena moisturizer with Alpha Hydroxy that was perfect and of course they stopped making it.</li>
      <li>Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Night Rejuvenator has been the best night cream that I have found in over 15 years.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT VALUE.  </li>
      <li>Happy to have found a product that helps with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After the product was featured on Dr. Oz--mostly because of the great value--the price was jacked up to over $12 a bottle.  </li>

      <li>use it to reduce and improve wrinkles each night and&lt;br /&gt;have been happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>Great night moisterizer</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell great but skin feels good after application.</li>
      <li>In my many years of using every face product under the sun I&#x27;ve discovered what that works best for my skin are products with Hydroxy acids in them.</li>

      <li>I bought this after seeing it on Dr. Oz, and it really is good stuff.</li>
      <li>I loved this brand for their all-natural ingredients and cruelty-free production; had used their creamy cleanser and 15 SPF moisturizer, so I thought I&#x27;d try their night cream as well.</li>
      <li>If this doesn&#x27;t bother you, however, it does work fairly well</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, great product!!</li>

      <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin and it has a very strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>I take very good care of my skin and am very particular what goes on my face  and body.</li>
      <li>Great texture light and spreads easily nourishing skin for nighttime.</li>
      <li>I am 52 and my skin looks great, this product makes my pores much tighter and almost disappear!  </li>
      <li>The next best thing was another moisturizer they make which has Retinol.</li>
      <li>Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Day and Night are two among of many in the list.  </li>
      <li>Fell in love with the night cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep using this and will probably indulge in some more of their line!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Night Rejuvenator cream after seeing it advertised on a renouned&lt;br /&gt;Dr. show, and I can truthfully say this works, this product arrived as espected.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the product is OK.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I just know that I LOVE it</li>
      <li>More benefits over time.  </li>

      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing its job :)</li>
      <li>I use many products by Earth Science</li>
      <li>Why pay more?</li>
      <li>an acid product that&#x27;s strong enough to work, but also has excellent moisturizing properties</li>
      <li>Unfortunately many natural products just aren&#x27;t as good as the nonnatural kind.</li>
      <li>When I first bought it, it seemed like it was a good value.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll see in this product that the ingredients that make the difference are listed first, so you&#x27;re getting lots of the good stuff...</li>
      <li>Great shipper and I love the product this far.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always been very happy with every single one of them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m into natural skincare &amp; happy that there&#x27;s a AHA product for face.</li>
      <li>I do not think it feels greasy or has any strong smell to it as some others have reviewed.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed:</li>
      <li>Is it a huge difference?</li>
      <li>Exfoliate lightly though, don&#x27;t irritate your face and then apply this immediately afterward or it WILL burn.</li>
      <li>Also, from my years of using this type of product I can say it&#x27;s better absorbed on exfoliated skin.</li>

      <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
      <li>I started using a tiny bit, and then putting moisturizer on afterwards (at night) or STRONG sunscreen (in the day, which you need when using A-H), and it&#x27;s all good now.  </li>
      <li>Excellent all natural facial product.  </li>
      <li>They make my skin clean, well hydrated, and glowing.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t read anything special about the L&#x27;Oreal product I just decided to try it.</li>
      <li>and i thought the price was just right!</li>
      <li>I am using it in the mornings only and feel it is a good part of my skin care routine at this point</li>
      <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have used many strong products over the years since college and lived in sunny Florida.  </li>
      <li>It was also delivered quickly and no problems.</li>
      <li>It is adequate.  </li>
      <li>Most of their products have a nice herby smell or no smell at all; this one smells like plastics or some other chemical.</li>
      <li>have used Earth Science since 1998 and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of keeping my skin younger looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to find it her for a lot less.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not too much of a smell, and I enjoy the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of parfumes in it.</li>
      <li>Rarely have I had a problem with chemical sun-hypersensitivity.  </li>
      <li>I use this at night and follow it with L&#x27;Oreal Golden Balm.  </li>
      <li>Willing to deal with a little stinging for great results.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes, absorbs right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I could not tell any difference right away but after continued use I like the way it feels and how it goes on.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin very soft and I have noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines on my face.</li>
      <li>Typically I use this product first, then add a coat of good moisturizer over it.  </li>
      <li>My wife went back to Revlon&#x27;s Eterna 27 night cream because it seems to do a better job.  </li>
      <li>I used three pumps initially and that was one pump too many, two pumps is plenty.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
      <li>I bought it because it is cruelty free and has natural ingredients, but I won&#x27;t get it again,</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, and it really helps!</li>
      <li>Works pretty well on acne</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t stretch it out to cover the entire area, so I end up pumping two more times.</li>
      <li>I do have some fine lines, but I&#x27;m the type of guy that likes to take care of my skin before there&#x27;s a major issues</li>
      <li>It is as good a product as a more expensive one.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I love it ! ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;I have used Earth Science since 1998 and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of keeping my skin younger looking.</li>
    <li> Wrote a review of this product on the Earth Science&#x27;s website giving it 3-stars, but as all comments are moderated, it never showed up.  All the reviews on their site are 5-stars as of April 21, 2015.  That tells me something about the company&#x27;s practices and why I am less likely to buy from them.  Anyway, the product is OK.  Stings a bit going on. Slight greasy feel does not bother me.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have used many strong products over the years since college and lived in sunny Florida.  Rarely have I had a problem with chemical sun-hypersensitivity.  Normally, I can use a 10% Benzoyl Peroxide solution during the day, and a 10% A/B product at night without any problems.  Still, this product made me break-out like few other products before.  Red, inflamed bumps would appear 2 to 3 days after using it.  It was a reaction reminiscent to one I had using Alba&#x27;s Hawaiian Facial Mask.  They have in common an algae extract (Chlorella Vulgaris or Algin).  I can only assume since algae is listed a highly comedogenic and irritating factor (see acne.org&#x27;s bad list or any other cosmetics database), that that must be the culprit.  If you&#x27;re having similar problems, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> my skin is smoother and it feels soft.  I am using it in the mornings only and feel it is a good part of my skin care routine at this point - I am heading to double nickles so when you find&lt;br /&gt;something that actually does what it says it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well on acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into natural skincare &amp; happy that there&#x27;s a AHA product for face. Doesn&#x27;t smell great but skin feels good after application. I&#x27;ve pretty sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t sting...just very slight tingle. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using everyday as my skin feels it after a straight 2 days night application. Have not tired it long enough to see the real results of this but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing its job :)</li>
    <li> This night cream makes my skin really soft and smooth, althought it stings.  Willing to deal with a little stinging for great results.</li>
    <li> I like it, but not heavy enough to call &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; cream.  I use it in the morning and at night.  I would prefer a bit heavier cream since my skin is dry.</li>
    <li> use it every night, the skin looks moist and radiant.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 3 weeks or so.  I am 37 and I have noticed that it does make my laugh lines a little less visible.  I do not think it feels greasy or has any strong smell to it as some others have reviewed.</li>
    <li> it is a product that is too soon to review,as time goes by i&#x27;ll get back to U,this is a product that flew off the shelves becuz of being on Dr. Oz,so far the 2 other products he gave a stamp of approval has not done a thing &#x27;for me&#x27;</li>
    <li> The smell was very off-putting. I&#x27;m not sure I can even describe it. Most of their products have a nice herby smell or no smell at all; this one smells like plastics or some other chemical. I have reasonably sensitive skin and had high hopes because their facewash and toner work really well for me. Unfortunately this made me very greasy even just using a tiny bit at night time and caused breakouts. Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and it really helps! It is all natural, doesn&#x27;t have any parabens and def. makes a difference!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great product!!</li>
    <li> Good price. Great texture light and spreads easily nourishing skin for nighttime. No product will ever turn back time but this one definitely slows the process.</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural facial product.  Delievered on time as promised.</li>
    <li> This product WORKS. I noticed a positive difference in my skin after one night.  More benefits over time.  More youthful color in my skin...smoother...clearer.  The lotion is not greasy; sinks right in.  Typically I use this product first, then add a coat of good moisturizer over it.  Read the label. Ingredients listed first are in the greatest concentrations. You&#x27;ll see in this product that the ingredients that make the difference are listed first, so you&#x27;re getting lots of the good stuff...the glycolic acid, vitamins, etc... In other words, you don&#x27;t see mineral oil and other unknown crap listed up front. It&#x27;s an affordable way to get the same kinds of benefits you receive from Treretinoin/Retin A.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the chemical odor of this product, which is not extremely strong but enough to be really unpleasant if you are sensitive to odors. I bought it because it is cruelty free and has natural ingredients, but I won&#x27;t get it again, Unfortunately many natural products just aren&#x27;t as good as the nonnatural kind. The most effective alpha beta hydroxy product I&#x27;ve ever used is Dr. Dennis Gross SkinCare daily face peel, which uses moistened pads instead of a cream, but they are expensive (cheaper on e-Bay).</li>
    <li> Love this product.! It was recommended by Dr. Oz. and It is to soon to see results but the product is not oily.</li>
    <li> Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Night Rejuvenator has been the best night cream that I have found in over 15 years. A little goes a long ways. I have always taken care of my skin including the use of a natural sun screen, but have sought a really effective A/B Hydroxy to give my skin a more even tone. All ladies listen up, IT WORKS!!!! Ordering from Amazon saved me quiet a bit of money too! Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Saw this product on the Dr Oz show...great product and super affordable! A must try! My face is glowing! Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife went back to Revlon&#x27;s Eterna 27 night cream because it seems to do a better job.  She&#x27;s 70 and looks 55!!</li>
    <li> what a difference in my face clearer and brighter i mix this with my other creams n big change in my face</li>
    <li> I developed some kind of allergy to the products that I used for a long time.  My dermatologist gave me a list of products that I can only use and choose from. Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Day and Night are two among of many in the list.  I have used them for few months and love them.  They make my skin clean, well hydrated, and glowing.</li>
    <li> In my many years of using every face product under the sun I&#x27;ve discovered what that works best for my skin are products with Hydroxy acids in them. I used to use a Neutrogena moisturizer with Alpha Hydroxy that was perfect and of course they stopped making it. The next best thing was another moisturizer they make which has Retinol. I was also buying a plain AHA product which had no moisturizer, it was just alpha hydroxy gel. I&#x27;ve used that for years under whatever moisturizer I had at the time and it works but I found it made my skin feel too tight. So this time when I ran out of the Neutrogena I decided to see if there was anything else I might try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note here, I have dull, very dry skin due to Hypothyroidism and regular (non-acid) moisturizers never seem to penetrate enough, they just sit on top of my skin despite frequent exfoliating. Products I&#x27;ve tried with various acid-type ingredients, alpha and beta hydroxy, glycolic acid, etc seem to actually penetrate, softens dramatically and gives me a sheen and glow that makes my skin look and feel healthy again. So that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from as far as my skin needs, if that helps anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this not entirely sure if it was a moisturizing product or purely an acid treatment, but I was hoping it would be both. I am thrilled, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed: an acid product that&#x27;s strong enough to work, but also has excellent moisturizing properties so it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight. I *think* it might be that they use hyaluronic acid along with the A &amp; B hydroxy acids, but I&#x27;m not sure. It could also be the various plant extracts or all of the above, who knows. I just know that I LOVE it and it gives me the effects I&#x27;ve been spending years combining various products trying to get. As far as burning/stinging, it doesn&#x27;t sting for me but I&#x27;m not very sensitive and I&#x27;ve been using acid products for years. If you have sensitive skin it would likely sting and I would suggest anyone try it only every few days at first to see if you are sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as some reviewers said, I suppose it would feel that way on some skin types. My dry skin soaks it up like a sponge, but if your skin isn&#x27;t dry or is otherwise very healthy it might feel greasy, in which case you probably don&#x27;t need this type of product. That&#x27;s just a guess of course. I did read one review complaining it was greasy and the reviewer said she used TEN PUMPS. That&#x27;s insane and anything would feel greasy if you slather ten pumps of it on your face. I used three pumps initially and that was one pump too many, two pumps is plenty. Also, from my years of using this type of product I can say it&#x27;s better absorbed on exfoliated skin. Exfoliate lightly though, don&#x27;t irritate your face and then apply this immediately afterward or it WILL burn. Some reviewers also mentioned a strange scent, but I don&#x27;t notice any scent at all, which is great because I hate scented facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints with this whatsoever, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Oh, and MOST importantly: Earth Science doesn&#x27;t test any of their products on animals, so you can feel good and do good buying their products. I&#x27;m a big fan of Earth Science.at first to see if you are sensitive to it.

    <li> I have very sensitive skin, but have had no problems using this product. I love the way my skin looks after using this. I usually apply before bed and my skin looks and feels nice the next morning. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I loved this brand for their all-natural ingredients and cruelty-free production; had used their creamy cleanser and 15 SPF moisturizer, so I thought I&#x27;d try their night cream as well. I see a noticeable difference in my skin after 4 days of use: it&#x27;s firmer, the pigment is more even (I have scarring around my chin and mouth from past break-out problems), and my skin just feels clear and healthy.  I used a little too much the first time around :-o so my skin was itching/burning a bit, but I did some research and found that because alpha hydroxy uses multiple types of acid, you only need a tiny bit on your skin each night. There&#x27;s also an adjustment period of 1 week for your skin to get used to it. I started using a tiny bit, and then putting moisturizer on afterwards (at night) or STRONG sunscreen (in the day, which you need when using A-H), and it&#x27;s all good now.  I&#x27;m excited to keep using this and will probably indulge in some more of their line!</li>
    <li> I saw this as recommended by some of the guest doctors on Dr Oz as one of the secret products that beats the products that cost $100s of dollars. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and have reordered several times. It moisturizes, absorbs right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff really nourishes your skin to keep it fresh.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it on Dr. Oz, and it really is good stuff. I don&#x27;t feel greasy in the morning, like I do with other creams. It&#x27;s light and not over drying-I live in a dry climate and I have dry skin, so sometimes products containing Alpha Hydroxy ruins my skin and makes it chafe. This cream doesn&#x27;t do that at all. I&#x27;ve noticed when I wake up my pores are smaller and I have a slight glow. You only need a couple of pumps, so it lasts a while. I would recommend this product. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
    <li> It seems to improve my skin somewhat.  When I first bought it, it seemed like it was a good value.  However, the price has been steadily increasing, maybe because it was shown on an episode of Dr. Oz.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am on my second jar.  I am 65 and I have noticed a difference in my skin tone since using it.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on an article I read. Happy I did. I just ordered two more. I use this at night and follow it with L&#x27;Oreal Golden Balm.  I haven&#x27;t read anything special about the L&#x27;Oreal product I just decided to try it. I am 50 years old and my skin actually looked a lot nicer after two weeks of use. Fine wrinkles diminished and surprisingly, deep wrinkles appeared to fill in or plump up. This combination of skin products has done a much better job for me than more expensive ones that make big promises. The two bottles I received were the same product but in different packaging, one package was a little beat up. This leads me to believe I was sent one old bottle that had been sitting on a shelf for a long time and one new one after the manufacturer updated its packaging. Will know shortly if one is &#x27;&#x27;expired&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I can really see a difference on the skin on my face and neck over a few months of using this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now. My skin is tighter and smoother, so I will say that I believe the product does what it says. Is it a huge difference? No, not really, but I do notice it. Now, I will say this: I&#x27;m only 28. I do have some fine lines, but I&#x27;m the type of guy that likes to take care of my skin before there&#x27;s a major issues and it&#x27;s too late. Like I said, I have noticed a difference. I wash my face, apply a toner, and then apply about ten pumps to my face and neck every night right before bed. I don&#x27;t notice any tingling usually (I think I might have once or twice ever so lightly) but I absolutly hate the feeling it leaves on my face right before I&#x27;m going to lay down on my pillow. I&#x27;ve tried using less (not that ten pumps really amounts to much) but I can&#x27;t stretch it out to cover the entire area, so I end up pumping two more times. So, I just start with ten and leave it at that. There&#x27;s not too much of a smell, and I enjoy the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of parfumes in it. My only complaint, which sadly is a deal breaker for me, is that it&#x27;s a little greasy. For me, it&#x27;s such a horrable feeling to go to bed with this greasy film on my face. I can just picture it getting on my pillow and sheets. If this doesn&#x27;t bother you, however, it does work fairly well and I think you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Great shipper and I love the product this far. People already complimenting my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Night Rejuvenator cream after seeing it advertised on a renouned&lt;br /&gt;Dr. show, and I can truthfully say this works, this product arrived as espected. I plan to re-order..[[ASIN:B002C7487U Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Night Rejuvenator, 1-Ounce Glass Bottle]]</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for a little over $5 per 1 oz. bottle several months ago.  It is adequate.  After the product was featured on Dr. Oz--mostly because of the great value--the price was jacked up to over $12 a bottle.  Greed is too ugly for skin cream.</li>
    <li> Since I play golf, I need all the rejuvenation I can get.  This product worked on my rough &amp; wrinkled skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I found it at Whole Foods years ago, after an esthetician told me I should be using a product with Beta Hydroxy acids, for my minor acne issues. It was $18 which was a lot cheaper than her fancy brands she told me about. Then it went down to $16, then back up, and up again... It&#x27;s like $22 buck retail now. I&#x27;m happy to find it her for a lot less. It should be noted that on this particular item, then send the old packaging. Orange color motif. Its&#x27;s probably overstocks after they changed the image. But seems like the formula hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
    <li> This one does not dry my skin like others and seems to help skin texture.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel moisturized and so soft.  I am 52 and my skin looks great, this product makes my pores much tighter and almost disappear!  Skin is much firmer too.  I don&#x27;t think for this price I have ever found another product as good as this.  I have put it on auto ship with amazon so I will not have to go without it.</li>
    <li> This product works great with my night time routine! I feel it tingle and i notice a difference.....thank you!  I bought it again because i liked it so much and i thought the price was just right!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A FAVORITE OF MY WIFE.  SHE HAS ME USING IT AND I CAN TELL YOU, THAT FOR THE PRICE THIS IS A GREAT VALUE.  DOES AS PROMISED.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for the price you can&#x27;t beat it! Keeps my acne in line and keeps my skin shining</li>
    <li> Really like the effect on my face and how it regenerates skin cells and seems so far to help skin look younger.</li>
    <li> Smooths my skin and even helps with the discoloration. I definitely would recommend this to others. This is my 2nd time purchasing it and I still love it.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this again.  It is as good a product as a more expensive one.  Why pay more?</li>
    <li> I use many products by Earth Science and I&#x27;ve always been very happy with every single one of them. Except this one. This cream doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin and it has a very strong chemical smell. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with the night cream. I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in the feel of my skin and my complexion</li>
    <li> Great night moisterizer</li>
    <li> This product delivers its promises when used at night.  Read the directions ladies and you will look younger due to filling in the  lines and therefore feel better about yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase from this company again because of a high quality product and timely delivery..</li>
    <li> I could not tell any difference right away but after continued use I like the way it feels and how it goes on. It is not greasy or staining.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly disappointed in this product. The only thing it did for me was to make my skin feel dry. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Wish I could say this product was helpful in some way, but I used the entire bottle&lt;br /&gt;and still saw no change in my skin.  Have already moved on to another product.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders, I&#x27;ve bought other expensive products and never noticed any difference in my skin. This actually works, my face is softer, smoother and more even toned. I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent for renewing skin tone and complexion. I put it on at night, wake up with really radiant looking skin.</li>
    <li> I swear by this lotion. It makes my skin very soft and I have noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines on my face. I will continue to get this. It was also delivered quickly and no problems.</li>
    <li> After using this product twice my skin seems to be smoother.  I take very good care of my skin and am very particular what goes on my face  and body. I did a dry area on my neck which is now gone &amp; extremely soft.  Yes would recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Happy to have found a product that helps with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to reduce and improve wrinkles each night and&lt;br /&gt;have been happy with the results.  It is not a miracle cream....&lt;br /&gt;still looking for that one, but it does help reduce wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;This is a refill order by the way.</li>
