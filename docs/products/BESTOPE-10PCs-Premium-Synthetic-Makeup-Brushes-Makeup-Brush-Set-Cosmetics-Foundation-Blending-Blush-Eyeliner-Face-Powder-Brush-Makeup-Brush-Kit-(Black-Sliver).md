      <li>Some people have claimed they smell upon arrival, ok, Dah!</li>
      <li>These brushes are absolutely  amazing for the price, I did have one brush with a bit of shedding</li>
      <li>Amazing, and a must buy for the price.</li>
      <li>but these brushes are amazing.</li>
      <li>I like the bristles, they feel really nice on my face.  </li>
      <li>The eye ones are especially soft and perfect for blending!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an affordable kit, with VERY acceptable quality, this is the best choice.</li>
      <li>The rounded slanted brush is nice to blend out blush.</li>
      <li>Really enjoying all the brushes in the set.</li>
      <li>I love the densely packed bristles.</li>
      <li>(And I haven&#x27;t found anything for the rounded top</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>but I love them.</li>
      <li>I am beyond pleased with them</li>
      <li>The flat slant top is wonderful at blending out bronzer!!</li>
      <li>The reviews were pretty good</li>
      <li>a quick wash in warm water and baby shampoo can&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>; BESTOPE is obviously a cheap chinese brand but is outstanding quality for the price, making them the best on the cheap group.</li>
      <li>They work as good as my Real Techniques</li>
      <li>but it was not bad at all!</li>
      <li>and it was as good as new</li>
      <li>it works fine.</li>
      <li>I like to buy from BESTOPE as I trust their service and am loyal to them as my brush supplier!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not mad at them. :)</li>
      <li>Okay, onto the good stuff: the big brushes.</li>
      <li>So far, so good...</li>
      <li>The flat top is good for concealer.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>I really think these are just as good as the high end brand name brushes.</li>
      <li>I love this so much.</li>
      <li>This can be remedied with super glue</li>
      <li>However, after the very first wash all the tops came apart from the brush handles.</li>
      <li>My favorite face kabuki brushes so far, and these are great for anyone who wants to add a variety brushes to their to collection, like me, or if you are starting off with makeup</li>
      <li>While they look almost identical, these brushes are super super soft and the Sigma brushes are a billion times more dense.</li>
      <li>brushes are all very soft and sturdy :)</li>
      <li>Great brushes at an even better price, the only con to these is they have a strong permanent marker smell but a few washes gets rid of that.  </li>
      <li>But for the price it&#x27;s worth purchasing again.</li>
      <li>The actually brush quality is nice</li>
      <li>just received these brushes in the mail, came in right on time</li>
      <li>The price is right.</li>
      <li>The flat top kabuki is nice to blend out foundation and pick up any extra product</li>
      <li>Very very soft and the eye brushes do a fantastic job of blending.</li>
      <li>These were super soft and I was excited to receive them at first.</li>
      <li>They are pretty dense.</li>
      <li>After the first use the brushes fall apart.</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t ever use anything I buy without washing first</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>they really blow me away with how super soft they are.</li>
      <li>Although the brushes are very soft and felt sturdy, one of the smaller ones top came apart.</li>
      <li>So you can&#x27;t really be too disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought these brushes with high hopes!</li>
      <li>Also, they are very sturdy and I have had ZERO fibers falling out.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Thanks BESTOPE</li>
      <li>because i really like them.</li>
      <li>and they are very dense</li>
      <li>Bristles are very soft and work well..they did have a packaging odor but a quick wash fixed that... One of them broke when I dropped it on the floor after having them for 2 weeks...</li>
      <li>round top little brushes are nice to go over your eyeshadow if you are a perfectionist and really want to blend seamlessly</li>
      <li>Decent brushes on a budget.</li>
      <li>Why spend an arm and a leg for high end brushes?</li>
      <li>but I compared the big ones to the Sigma F80 (flat top kabuki), F86 (the pointy brush), and the round top slanted brush (forgot them name).</li>
      <li>I got hella brushes for a low price, so for what I paid, these brushes were worth it.</li>
      <li>but you shouldn&#x27;t have to do that with a brand new product.</li>
      <li>they have a new plasticy smell like they&#x27;ve been sitting in the packaging for a while</li>
      <li>Plus, the are ridiculously soft.</li>
      <li>I have been using them for almost two months now, and I have had no trouble.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the little brushes!</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth to get it.&lt;br /&gt;fast delivering, last longer, very soft, easy to use, I just obsessed with this brushes.</li>
      <li>I feel like it could have been trimmed and cut better because there were a few brush hair sticking up taller than the rest which made that brush specifically feel like its rough on the face..</li>
      <li>I barely use it, but I&#x27;m just using the metal part with the bristles</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews and many people stated that these fell apart and they hated them</li>
      <li>These are super soft and less than half the cost of one sigma brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Read my other reviews on these Bestrope brushes.  I trust this company and there isn&#x27;t a better makeup brush on the market!  I must have bought over 30? of these for clients now, and have 7 sets myself as I wash my makeup brushes daily.  Some people have claimed they smell upon arrival, ok, Dah! they are synthetic and have been sterilized.  Just wash them in Dawn/Oxy, they can even soak since it won&#x27;t harm the synthetic bristle and I wouldn&#x27;t ever use anything I buy without washing first, that&#x27;s just common sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see BESTOPE have other colors like other suppliers.  Please!!!! I like to buy from BESTOPE as I trust their service and am loyal to them as my brush supplier!  Thanks BESTOPE</li>
    <li> Really great brushes for the price!:)</li>
    <li> just received these brushes in the mail, came in right on time and I&#x27;m happy about that. I was scared to get these at first because a few of the other reviews were a little negative but these brushes are amazing. I really think these are just as good as the high end brand name brushes. they have a new plasticy smell like they&#x27;ve been sitting in the packaging for a while but I can look past that because of the quality of these. they really blow me away with how super soft they are. and they are very dense, I haven&#x27;t used them on me yet, but I can already tell they are good just by feeling them!! I&#x27;m so happy I bought these!</li>
    <li> Good buy and I like them.</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes with high hopes! The reviews were pretty good so I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;1. The price is right. So you can&#x27;t really be too disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;2. I really enjoy the little brushes! They are pretty dense. I like to use the little pointy one for highlighting the inner tear duct and the little round top one for highlighting the brow bone. The flat top is good for concealer.&lt;br /&gt;3. Okay, onto the good stuff: the big brushes. All 10 of these brushes are supposed to be dupes for the Sigma 10 essential kit or whatever it&#x27;s called. I don&#x27;t have the little brushes to compare them to but I compared the big ones to the Sigma F80 (flat top kabuki), F86 (the pointy brush), and the round top slanted brush (forgot them name). While they look almost identical, these brushes are super super soft and the Sigma brushes are a billion times more dense. Unfortunately, this does impact the product application in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this leads me to point #4&lt;br /&gt;4. These brushes are great to blend makeup out!!! (not apply. just blend) So not a total regret for buying. The flat top kabuki is nice to blend out foundation and pick up any extra product so you don&#x27;t look cakey. The flat slant top is wonderful at blending out bronzer!! The pointy top is perfect for me to set my undereye concealer with translucent powder. The rounded slanted brush is nice to blend out blush. (And I haven&#x27;t found anything for the rounded top but maybe I&#x27;ll use it for applying primer or something.)&lt;br /&gt;the round top little brushes are nice to go over your eyeshadow if you are a perfectionist and really want to blend seamlessly but like i said...not the best for eyeshadow application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. I&#x27;m not mad at them. :)</li>
    <li> This is a perfect dupe for the 12 pc gold set from BH Cosmetics... Bristles are very soft and work well..they did have a packaging odor but a quick wash fixed that... One of them broke when I dropped it on the floor after having them for 2 weeks...no biggie though I used my E6000 glue and it was as good as new</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. These were super soft and I was excited to receive them at first. However, after the very first wash all the tops came apart from the brush handles. This can be remedied with super glue but you shouldn&#x27;t have to do that with a brand new product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Love the pointed face brush!!  a few amount of bristles fall off but not to severe.  definitely worth the buy!!!! brushes are all very soft and sturdy :)</li>
    <li> Brushes are good quality, no shedding. I use them every day(:</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!! I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews and many people stated that these fell apart and they hated them but I love them. I have been using them for almost two months now, and I have had no trouble. My favorite face kabuki brushes so far, and these are great for anyone who wants to add a variety brushes to their to collection, like me, or if you are starting off with makeup and you want some affordable brushes, these are it. They did have a slight smell to them, like they have been sitting in a warehouse but it is not unbearable. Once I washed them, the smell went away. Their was no shedding either. The only bad thing is the tapered pointed face kabuki brush.. I feel like it could have been trimmed and cut better because there were a few brush hair sticking up taller than the rest which made that brush specifically feel like its rough on the face.. It is something that you can deal with, plus it blends out my concealer under my eye perfectly so I can look past that! If you just want some affordable brushes to add to your collection or you are starting off with makeup give these a try. I did a review on my youtube channel. Link is below:    [...]</li>
    <li> There is a lot of brush kit on the Inet, I mean, A LOT. Chinese coping chinese coping some brand. Is very difficult to pick one, all looks almost the same on picture, but when it arrives you see the super bad quality. This &amp;quot;brand&amp;quot; BESTOPE is obviously a cheap chinese brand but is outstanding quality for the price, making them the best on the cheap group. I stopped buying the chineses unbranded (normally pink), there was a lottery the quality. If you are looking for an affordable kit, with VERY acceptable quality, this is the best choice.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t say enough about these brushes. Amazing, and a must buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I never write a review for anything. But I had to let you guys know about this.&lt;br /&gt;This is a bomb. I love this so much. It is definitely worth to get it.&lt;br /&gt;fast delivering, last longer, very soft, easy to use, I just obsessed with this brushes.</li>
    <li> 3 of the brushes are broken!</li>
    <li> Love them. They work as good as my Real Techniques</li>
    <li> I love the densely packed bristles. Plus, the are ridiculously soft. This set is great for foundation and contour application.</li>
    <li> love these brushes! The eye ones are especially soft and perfect for blending! Would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> So far, so good... They seem like they&#x27;re really good quality brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely  amazing for the price, I did have one brush with a bit of shedding but it was not bad at all! I would definatley recommend  these brushes for beginners and make up lovers on a budget! I will 100% be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> The actually brush quality is nice but I had to superglue the tips back on for some. Definitely wash before use. Decent brushes on a budget. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great brushes at an even better price, the only con to these is they have a strong permanent marker smell but a few washes gets rid of that.  These are super soft and less than half the cost of one sigma brush. I am beyond pleased with them</li>
    <li> I like the bristles, they feel really nice on my face.  Not sure on the quality of the brushes themselves kuz I&#x27;ve had one break on me already n I barely use it, but I&#x27;m just using the metal part with the bristles n it works fine. I got hella brushes for a low price, so for what I paid, these brushes were worth it.</li>
    <li> Why spend an arm and a leg for high end brushes? These brushes are the best ever! They did arrive smelling a bit strange, but that&#x27;s nothing a quick wash in warm water and baby shampoo can&#x27;t fix. Also, they are very sturdy and I have had ZERO fibers falling out. These are a must have for anyone who does makeup.</li>
    <li> Although the brushes are very soft and felt sturdy, one of the smaller ones top came apart. I&#x27;m not very happy about that because i really like them. I haven&#x27;t yet used all of them so I&#x27;m hoping that none of the others do the same. But for the price it&#x27;s worth purchasing again. Thank you</li>
    <li> Really enjoying all the brushes in the set. Very very soft and the eye brushes do a fantastic job of blending.</li>
    <li> After the first use the brushes fall apart. Not meant for long term use or if you&#x27;re constantly using them on clients.</li>
