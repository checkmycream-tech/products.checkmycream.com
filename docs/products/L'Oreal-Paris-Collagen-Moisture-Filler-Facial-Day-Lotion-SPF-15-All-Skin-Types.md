      <li>Based on the day/night cream, I would have to guess this is a great product if your skin does well with combinations.</li>

      <li>I love the results and the size of the container is just perfect.</li>
      <li>I just loved it.</li>

      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Nice texture, smooth and pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I bought it because I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Day/Night Cream and thought this might be good for summer use.  </li>
      <li>The skin became smooth, silky, shine(in  a good way).</li>
      <li>/&gt; all over my body, from the top of my neck to and including, the bottom of my feet every morning immediately after my shower.  </li>
      <li>and I love most everything about it.</li>
      <li>I did buy a spatula that fits into the bottle which I haven&#x27;t received yet, but I am hoping this will solve my problem until Loreal figures out a way to repackage MY FAVORITE LOTION.</li>
      <li>The night cream is better</li>
      <li>smells nice, light and not oily.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have to remove top to get the lotion...</li>
      <li>this is better and</li>
      <li>Many stores no longer carry this.</li>
      <li>But it looks like I&#x27;ll be able to pry the lid off and get the rest out.</li>
      <li>Comes with its own scrubber, which is more skin friendly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy the product again , but from a drug store where I can easily return it if there is a problem.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent moisturizer, my skin looks smother and pores are less noticeable</li>

      <li>It does work well with make up, lets my foundation go on smooth.</li>
      <li>Have noticed great changes with daily use!</li>
      <li>love this lotion--hate the pump  rarely works</li>
      <li>I wish it was more than 15 SPF, but it seems that if you go higher in sun protection, you have to accept a heavier feel.</li>
      <li>It is so light and airy and has such a pleasant fresh scent that it&#x27;s a joy to use daily!!</li>
      <li>Absolutely a product worth having!</li>
      <li>It is very fragrant, but what I don&#x27;t like is that I can taste this lotion if I lick my lips after putting it on, yuck!</li>
      <li>My skin looks a lot better, no tiny lines on face anymore.</li>
      <li>#34;the label area,&amp;#34; on my upper back, with good results.  </li>
      <li>product is good, but there is very little in the container.</li>
      <li>I was born with with beautiful skin and, after washing my face with Basis soap and water every morning, I apply a thin &#x27;coat&#x27; of L&#x27;Oreal</li>
      <li>The pump works fine, though I generally don&#x27;t like pumps, because they leave so much product in the bottle.</li>
      <li>and this works very well to keep it hydrated all day.</li>
      <li>No amount to pressing, shaking, turning, or twisting, gentle or forceful,  entices the product out.  </li>
      <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well, as noted by others.</li>
      <li>Very few nice moisturizers are 3 oz.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light in texture and provides a good base for my foundation.</li>
      <li>To unclog you have to use a needle to clear it.</li>
      <li>and I still look young for my age.</li>
      <li>Gotta start using that early on.</li>
      <li>much of which is left in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>While I do like this lotion, the pump has broken more than once, to the point where nothing comes out</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
      <li>I used to have dry skin and now my skin is soft all over.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>The pump quits working half way through the life of the product and you might as well throw the whole thing away if you have taken the bottle on an airplane, the pump mechanism simply doesn&#x27;t work after that.</li>

<li> Pump doesn&#x27;t work, so it was a waste of money.</li>
<li> The pump gave out after a few uses</li>
<li> It is much less expensive than the facial moisturizers I use that encourage you to use them on those body parts, and seem to do the trick, i.le., reduce wrinkles and keep the areas moisturized.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also hard to get to the bottom and even use it all, as the opening is so small and the lotion is fairly thick (compared to other face day lotions like neutragena)</li>
<li> Unfortunately,  I neglected to check if this product had the SPF before I purchased it.</li>
<li> Not an  expensive way to start preventing wrinkles and minimize the ones that have snuck up on you!</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s impossible to review the lotion.  </li>
<li> It is the packaging that is HORRIBLE.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife loves this.  We subscribed to it because the pricing was great and my wife likes to use it religiously.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well, as noted by others. It is very fragrant, but what I don&#x27;t like is that I can taste this lotion if I lick my lips after putting it on, yuck! I never noticed that with other facial lotions. It does work well with make up, lets my foundation go on smooth. A big plus is it doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin oilier. I probably won&#x27;t be buying this again though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years and I love most everything about it. It goes on great and it has a very pleasant smell. My one MAJOR complaint has nothing to do with the product itself. It is the packaging that is HORRIBLE. The pump quits working half way through the life of the product and you might as well throw the whole thing away if you have taken the bottle on an airplane, the pump mechanism simply doesn&#x27;t work after that. I did buy a spatula that fits into the bottle which I haven&#x27;t received yet, but I am hoping this will solve my problem until Loreal figures out a way to repackage MY FAVORITE LOTION.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. It works well as a light weight moisturizer. Amazon is now the only source I can find the product as my local stores have stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is so light and airy and has such a pleasant fresh scent that it&#x27;s a joy to use daily!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and have a difficult time finding a product that will actually help. This one seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> Bottle doesn&#x27;t work so I have to remove top to get the lotion...product itself is great.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  Use this on my neck, throat, decolletage, and, what I call &amp;#34;the label area,&amp;#34; on my upper back, with good results.  It is much less expensive than the facial moisturizers I use that encourage you to use them on those body parts, and seem to do the trick, i.le., reduce wrinkles and keep the areas moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer, my skin looks smother and pores are less noticeable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s making my skin feel so soft, don&#x27;t notice any dramatic change</li>
    <li> I love this product. I made a big different on the look of my skin. My skin is softer and tight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome! After one week we can see the difference! The skin became smooth, silky, shine(in  a good way). I just loved it.</li>
    <li> Not the best but ok.. The night cream is better</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer under my makeup. It&#x27;s light in texture and provides a good base for my foundation. The scent is light and pleasant. I&#x27;m not sure what a &amp;#34;collagen moisture filler&amp;#34; lotion is supposed to do, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any different than a plain old moisturizer. I wish it was more than 15 SPF, but it seems that if you go higher in sun protection, you have to accept a heavier feel. The pump works fine, though I generally don&#x27;t like pumps, because they leave so much product in the bottle. But it looks like I&#x27;ll be able to pry the lid off and get the rest out.</li>
    <li> The pump gave out after a few uses</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  My skin looks a lot better, no tiny lines on face anymore. I&#x27;m 61 and thankful I found this product.  It&#x27;s also cheaper on line! I&#x27;m also using their 360 facial cleanser. Comes with its own scrubber, which is more skin friendly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a product worth having! Excellent description, perfect value, great for a variety of reasons! Have noticed great changes with daily use!</li>
    <li> What a difference in my skin Fab!!!</li>
    <li> smells nice, light and not oily. I have very sensitive, dry skin and this works very well to keep it hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> Good cream I switched from aveeno cuz it gave me pimples this is better and plus it&#x27;s got collagen Gotta start using that early on.</li>
    <li> Very good product from L&#x27;Oreal, as always. I love the results and the size of the container is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product! I wear it every day plus it has sunscreen in it to protect my face from sun damage.</li>
    <li> Many stores no longer carry this. Happy I can still find it.</li>
    <li> While I do like this lotion, the pump has broken more than once, to the point where nothing comes out and I have to break it open to even use it.  It&#x27;s also hard to get to the bottom and even use it all, as the opening is so small and the lotion is fairly thick (compared to other face day lotions like neutragena) I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I was born with with beautiful skin and, after washing my face with Basis soap and water every morning, I apply a thin &#x27;coat&#x27; of L&#x27;Oreal&lt;br /&gt;Paris Collagen Moisture Filler before a small amount of other makeup.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  I might mention that I also apply body lotion&lt;br /&gt; all over my body, from the top of my neck to and including, the bottom of my feet every morning immediately after my shower.  I used to have dry skin and now my skin is soft all over.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you,L&#x27;Oreal, and thank you, Amazon, for carrying this product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Barbara E. Bear, M.D.</li>
    <li> Greasy feeling leaves your face shining like an oil slick!&lt;br /&gt;It burns my skin when I get in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> love this lotion--hate the pump  rarely works</li>
    <li> Pump doesn&#x27;t work, so it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion a lot but it is only 2oz, which for the price is really small. I have to reorder every month if I want to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Not any anti ageing miracles here, but if you need a great moisturizer, this fits the bill.  Makes your skin feel softer.  One of the few that moisturizes my dry skin without breaking me out.  Will buy again for that reason.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Day/Night Cream and thought this might be good for summer use.  Unfortunately,  I neglected to check if this product had the SPF before I purchased it. My skin does not do well with combination SPF/moisturizers.  Based on the day/night cream, I would have to guess this is a great product if your skin does well with combinations.</li>
    <li> The mechanism doesn&#x27;t allow the product to be released so it&#x27;s impossible to review the lotion.  No amount to pressing, shaking, turning, or twisting, gentle or forceful,  entices the product out.  It smells good though!</li>
    <li> I use this daily and I still look young for my age.</li>
    <li> Great product quality and service.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, smooth and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> The applicator spout clogs up after every 4 - 5 days. To unclog you have to use a needle to clear it.</li>
    <li> Very few nice moisturizers are 3 oz. or less and then you loose them at security, this one works well and fits well in a carry on.</li>
    <li> product is good, but there is very little in the container. It may be that the pump doesn&#x27;t work, what&#x27;s in there doesn&#x27;t come out. I won&#x27;t come out. I&#x27;d buy the product again , but from a drug store where I can easily return it if there is a problem.</li>
    <li> This face cream goes on evenly and non greasy. Not an  expensive way to start preventing wrinkles and minimize the ones that have snuck up on you!</li>
    <li> There have been several comments about the applicator pump and its malfunction.  I agree this is a big problem.  The product is a 5 star lotion but I should not have to pry off the pump to access the lotion...much of which is left in the bottle.  I hope to find this lotion in a different dispenser.</li>
