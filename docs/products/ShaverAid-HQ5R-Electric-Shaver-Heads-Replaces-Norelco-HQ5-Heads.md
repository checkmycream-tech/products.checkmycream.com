      <li>These blades fit perfectly!</li>
      <li>heads arrived very timely and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>but these are just as good and a lot more affordable.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to get replacement heads for my 13 year old  shaver! :</li>
      <li>Items arrived very expediently and in great shape.</li>
      <li>The heads seem to cut OK</li>
      <li>They fit the electric razor correctly (no surprise), and they do give a good clean shave.</li>
      <li>For the price you get a great replacement for the high priced Norelco shaver heads.</li>
      <li>BUT, they are certainly good enough, giving me a clean shave at a great savings.</li>
      <li>The heads were a perfect fit and working well initially.  </li>
      <li>So far these work great.</li>
      <li>Good to find an alternative source at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>just what I needed - work fine</li>
      <li>- they are working fine</li>
      <li>replacement heads fit well.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I believe these covers are for looks instead of adding any functionality to the product.</li>
      <li>I saved a significant amount of money in this transaction (estimated @ $30</li>
      <li>my original worn out Norelco blades.  </li>
      <li>Very sharp an good blades!</li>
      <li>cuts really quickly.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t had a shave this good in a long time.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately the new cutters worked nicely in the old heads</li>
      <li>They are very inexpensive and work just fine.</li>
      <li>Blades are not as sharp as the original set that lasted 10 years!!!</li>
      <li>Certainly cuts closer than the original ones by Phillips.  </li>
      <li>I am ready to go!</li>
      <li>Ordering through Amazon was much easier than searching through stores!  </li>
      <li>At first I did not think they were doing anything</li>
      <li>Another thing that happened is one of the glued on aluminum logo discs fell off one of the cutter cages the first time I used the shaver.  </li>
      <li>I forgot who exactly the shipper was I believe Amazon , but they could have just as easily sent it to me that wa,y as my friend did, perhaps even easier an saved me the HASSLE of coordinating and paying him back for the&amp;#34;re-shipping&amp;#34;.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Keeping my old razor limping along and wished these weren&#x27;t available so it would force me to buy a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Are the replacement heads the same as the original heads?</li>
      <li>Easy to replace and do a good job cutting.  </li>
      <li>Will always buy this particular replacement.</li>
      <li>I highly recommends this if your shaver is.</li>
      <li>They do cut well, but I don &#x27;t think the noise is a normal thing.  </li>
      <li>Live and learn,I guess.</li>
      <li>I guess after 15 years with this shaver its time for a new one.</li>
      <li>I had inherited my uncles Norelco razor of the 70&#x27;s and with these new blades</li>
      <li>I then ordered a new holder spring assy and installed that with the new cutter heads.</li>
      <li>I purchased these new heads for my razor.  </li>
      <li>My old blades were about 10 years old, and I was ready to buy a new one, when I stumbled upon these blades.</li>
      <li>Seems like the original stay sharp longer.</li>
      <li>However, the price of those has now been jacked up to an absolutely INSANE $70 per set, so I decided to try a compatible non-Norelco replacement, and these were available for a very good price (about an 85% savings over the Norelco branded heads).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking that I should have purchased genuine Norelco parts rather than opting to save a few dollars on the aftermarket ones.</li>
      <li>Smoother shave than the old ones.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, you may want to pass on these.  </li>
      <li>I can sometimes find a complete razor on sale for the price of replacement heads.</li>
      <li>When I took them out to clean, noticed the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; part of the lift-and-cut was missing - just the blade part</li>
      <li>[each blade normally has 2 pieces of metal, this one only had one of them].  </li>
      <li>Took me too long to figure out, past the point of being able to return.</li>
      <li>First time that I purchased replacement heads other than Norelco.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a old shaver and it probably needed heads ten years ago.  </li>
      <li>When I installed the new cutter heads the cages spun with the internal cutter knives so it would not cut properly.</li>
      <li>Echoing one of the earlier reviews (which I wish I had read before ordering), when I installed the new cutter heads the cages spun with the internal cutter knives.</li>
      <li>only disappointment was, I live in Hawaii, the &amp;#34;free-shipping&#x27; would have been nice, but they wouldn&#x27;t ship to Hawaii</li>
      <li>These shaver heads are easy to change, are very sharp, and will renew your dull shaver to cut like new.</li>
      <li>: The new cutters are NOT working as expected.</li>
      <li>I used my old blades so long that I forgot what it was like to have new blades that are sharp.</li>
      <li>quite* on a par with the actual Norelco product: when I&#x27;ve let my beard get too long, there is some uncomfortable tugging as the whiskers get caught, and the sound made by the razor is a little different, so I don&#x27;t think these are spinning quite as smoothly as the Norelco-made blades.</li>
      <li>I decided a new razor was in order and would keep the other with these blades as a travel spare.</li>

    <li> Does not cut as well as OEM blades.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, work great.  I was worried when Norelco quit making these but these are just as good and a lot more affordable.</li>
    <li> When I installed the new cutter heads the cages spun with the internal cutter knives so it would not cut properly. I then ordered a new holder spring assy and installed that with the new cutter heads. That eliminated the cage spin problem but the heads are very rough and noisy. They do cut well, but I don &#x27;t think the noise is a normal thing.  The shaver never was noisy before, so I am not really pleased with the outcome.

    <li> &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; ShaverAid HQ5R heads no better than my original worn out Norelco blades.  Waste of my money.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had inherited my uncles Norelco razor of the 70&#x27;s and with these new blades I am ready to go!</li>
    <li> These were Norelco knock-offs.  I started using them and got a lot of razor burn [don&#x27;t usually].  When I took them out to clean, noticed the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; part of the lift-and-cut was missing - just the blade part [each blade normally has 2 pieces of metal, this one only had one of them].  Took me too long to figure out, past the point of being able to return.</li>
    <li> So far these work great. No issues with the razor being noisy like other reviews. cuts really quickly. don&#x27;t bother looking at the Norelco brand, which is way overpriced.</li>
    <li> Wrong heads! These HQ5R heads do NOT fit my Norelco shaver(: I need to send them back. Let me know how.</li>
    <li> I did not have any issues like some of the other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34;. I found this item to be great and works well. I used my old blades so long that I forgot what it was like to have new blades that are sharp.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to get replacement heads for my 13 year old  shaver! :-)&lt;br /&gt;Glad to see that they where still available!&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment was, I live in Hawaii, the &amp;#34;free-shipping&#x27; would have been nice, but they wouldn&#x27;t ship to Hawaii -OR- a P.O. Box which is the case with me.......bummer, :-( so I had to pay to have a friend freight forward them to me, and there was NO problem coming in a lightweight Priority-mail bubble pack.&lt;br /&gt;  I forgot who exactly the shipper was I believe Amazon , but they could have just as easily sent it to me that wa,y as my friend did, perhaps even easier an saved me the HASSLE of coordinating and paying him back for the&amp;#34;re-shipping&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;  Regets, Steve Mooney P,O, Box Ocean View, Hawaii 96737</li>
    <li> All good. - they are working fine</li>
    <li> First time that I purchased replacement heads other than Norelco.  I can tell the difference, but for $11 (v. $74 for Norelco brand) I&#x27;ll adjust!</li>
    <li> My shaver&#x27;s heads were no longer working properly and left a lot of stubble.  These replacement heads work great and I haven&#x27;t had a shave this good in a long time.  I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> My old blades were about 10 years old, and I was ready to buy a new one, when I stumbled upon these blades. They are very inexpensive and work just fine. Great investment. saved me lots of money.</li>
    <li> Finding replacement heads for Norelco razors locally has become difficult. Good to find an alternative source at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Received this today. Immediately found that two of the cutters would not rotate in the heads, even when sitting on the table. When I installed them the motor jammed.Fortunately the new cutters worked nicely in the old heads and I will use them that way for the time being. These are not Norelco brand. Won&#x27;t be buying from Goodman again.&lt;br /&gt;Update: The new cutters are NOT working as expected. Will use my backup shaver until I decide on a replacement.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a old shaver and it probably needed heads ten years ago.  They seem to work.</li>
    <li> I bought two sets.  For 10.00 each.  Does the job.  Certainly cuts closer than the original ones by Phillips.  Good value for the money.  would buy again</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement blades!</li>
    <li> These shaver heads are easy to change, are very sharp, and will renew your dull shaver to cut like new.</li>
    <li> Echoing one of the earlier reviews (which I wish I had read before ordering), when I installed the new cutter heads the cages spun with the internal cutter knives. The heads seem to cut OK but it is noisy, and never was before.  I also did not realize, when I bought this, that it was not the actual Norelco heads.  I would not buy this item again, and will likely order actual Norelco heads to insert now.</li>
    <li> just what I needed - work fine</li>
    <li> Great product at a fair price !</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price.  This is my third set purchased over the years.  Will always buy this particular replacement.</li>
    <li> I purchased these new heads for my razor.  At first I did not think they were doing anything but realzied they were so sharp, I could not feel them.  After a few weeks I noticed I did not get as close of a shave as I used to and the blades squealed like metal against metal.  I decided a new razor was in order and would keep the other with these blades as a travel spare.</li>
    <li> On several previous occasions, I&#x27;d bought actual Philips-Norelco HQ5 replacement heads for my electric razor. However, the price of those has now been jacked up to an absolutely INSANE $70 per set, so I decided to try a compatible non-Norelco replacement, and these were available for a very good price (about an 85% savings over the Norelco branded heads). They fit the electric razor correctly (no surprise), and they do give a good clean shave. I don&#x27;t think they are *quite* on a par with the actual Norelco product: when I&#x27;ve let my beard get too long, there is some uncomfortable tugging as the whiskers get caught, and the sound made by the razor is a little different, so I don&#x27;t think these are spinning quite as smoothly as the Norelco-made blades. BUT, they are certainly good enough, giving me a clean shave at a great savings.</li>
    <li> very nice replacement</li>
    <li> Work fine, but why are things like this so expensive!!! I can sometimes find a complete razor on sale for the price of replacement heads.</li>
    <li> replacement heads fit well. I did not like the sharpness of the blades. I guess after 15 years with this shaver its time for a new one.</li>
    <li> Keeping my old razor limping along and wished these weren&#x27;t available so it would force me to buy a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;But they work and delivery was good.</li>
    <li> Does not stay sharp very long. Are the replacement heads the same as the original heads? Seems like the original stay sharp longer.</li>
    <li> These blades fit perfectly! Very sharp an good blades!</li>
    <li> pour le prix ,ca vaut la peine de s en procurer  tres bien,,,tout etait a l interieur et les pieces etaient toutes neuves</li>
    <li> While these heads work, the center cover came off on two. Of the three shaving heads, two came off within hours of installing them on the shaver. Fortunately, I believe these covers are for looks instead of adding any functionality to the product.</li>
    <li> Blades are not as sharp as the original set that lasted 10 years!!!</li>
    <li> The heads were a perfect fit and working well initially.  Since they have only just begun their use, it is not possible to comment on long term reliabiliyuy.  I saved a significant amount of money in this transaction (estimated @ $30 saved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads arrived very timely and in perfect condition. I would rcommend these heads and suppliers if asked.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would complain about these,  For the price you get a great replacement for the high priced Norelco shaver heads.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable value. Works perfectly. I highly recommends this if your shaver is. Dull. Smoother shave than the old ones.</li>
    <li> Work just like they&#x27;re supposed to.  Easy to replace and do a good job cutting.  Just hoping they last as long as the last ones did.</li>
