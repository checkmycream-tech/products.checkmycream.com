      <li>I&#x27;m doing my best to keep myself and my familia toxic free.</li>
      <li>maybe I just need surgery and be done with it, instead of spending all this money on those kind of products.</li>
      <li>The cool sensation feels good, but that&#x27;s about it....</li>
      <li>My favorite detail about this product</li>
      <li>more botox.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>but they feel really refreshing</li>
      <li>sure to follow the instructions to achieve full effects!</li>
      <li>These natural collagen under eye and eyelid patches are great.</li>
      <li>Shame on the liars who post this product is so great since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>

      <li>I got a refreshing feeling and greatly reduced the black circles under my eyes!</li>
      <li>But most products don&#x27;t work, so it is not realistic that so many people had so much success.</li>
      <li>And no matter how stressed I am at at work, my dace still looks fresh.</li>
      <li>However with the right eye creams then apply the patch at night helps the moisture penetrate and prevent movement wrinkles while sleeping.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t work and they gave me a rash the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>It felt like my skin was burning after I first took them off.</li>
      <li>It really helps rejuvenates the skin under my eyes.</li>

      <li>Being a natural plant collagen is a huge plus since she doesn&#x27;t have to worry so much about the possible effects.</li>
      <li>though is that it is made from 100% natural ingredients!</li>
      <li>Not sure I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
      <li>this product is not all natural.</li>
      <li>since this stuff is going on my skin it truly needs to be ALL natural.  </li>
      <li>After using the whole box, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different about the puffiness under my eyes...</li>
      <li>I had high hopes based on other reviews, but was a little leery to place these patches on my face when the labels were poorly translated with many many typos.  </li>
      <li>This really helped my wife with her wrinkle and dark spots problems.</li>
      <li>For the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve been placing these on my face for at least a half hour, often more, and see no results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Looking for any benefits, from this product, you will be disappointed... I miss the ones you could buy at any drugstore, at least they were cooling to the under eye area, &amp; made your eyes feel refreshed, NOT THIS !, ugh</li>
    <li> The cool sensation feels good, but that&#x27;s about it....After using the whole box, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different about the puffiness under my eyes...maybe I just need surgery and be done with it, instead of spending all this money on those kind of products.</li>
    <li> After using a patch under my eyes for two consecutive nights my facial skin became very red and dry.  It was very&lt;br /&gt;uncomfortable so I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
    <li> They arrived from China and the packaging was different than what was displayed on Amazon. The instructions/info on the back was in english but a very poor translation, leading me to believe that the product was thrown together; NOT something I would rub on my face. I asked for a refund and was given one along with a $15 credit. So, I would say DO NOT purchase this.</li>
    <li> I always use products on myself before it goes to the spa.  I have tough skin and it broke me out in a rash.</li>
    <li> I broke out in a rash like a skin irritation and I put a medicated cream and it went away.  Tried it again and same thing.  It may be me.</li>
    <li> After reading the obvious bogus 5star reviews, I read the 1star reviews and thank you ladies .... this product is not all natural. it contains sodium polvacrylate and parabens !!!! THESE ARE TOXIC TO THE SKIN!!!! Shame on the liars who post this product is so great since it&#x27;s all natural. Why would anyone put poison on their face? Moreover, why would some greedy seller LIE, try to poison someone else, all in the name of making a buck????!!! Hopefully, Amazon will pull this product soon.  I will be filing a complaint to them ASAP!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product,works very well ,will recommend to my clients and friend, I used different masks for eyes but this one the best</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use these patches. They don&#x27;t work and they gave me a rash the first time I used it. My under eyes felt like they were on fire. The feeling did not go away for a week.</li>
    <li> These natural collagen under eye and eyelid patches are great. They are very effective. In just a matter of 3 weeks, my eye bags have been visibly reduced, and the skin under my eyes looks younger and wrinkle free. I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes based on other reviews, but was a little leery to place these patches on my face when the labels were poorly translated with many many typos.  But, tried anyway.  For the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve been placing these on my face for at least a half hour, often more, and see no results.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this product. When you have a bad sleep and the next morning you wake up with those ugly bads under your eyes, this is the product to relieve the bags.</li>
    <li> This really helped my wife with her wrinkle and dark spots problems. Being a natural plant collagen is a huge plus since she doesn&#x27;t have to worry so much about the possible effects. It also has moisturizers in it too!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to follow the instructions to achieve full effects!</li>
    <li> ive reviewed these already&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are eye mazing and cannot be replaced by any thing else&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use these and the SMoothie wrinkle stips here, that HAVE REMOVED 2 deep forehead wrinkles after 2x use for 5 mos.&lt;br /&gt;No more botox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMOOTHIE WRINKLE stips are sold here too and the 2 together are all you need, imo.</li>
    <li> This product left the skin under my eyes red for 3 days. It felt like my skin was burning after I first took them off.</li>
    <li> I like it and you can use them often</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong but I just don&#x27;t think these do anything to help my bags or dark circles but they feel really refreshing so I&#x27;ll use up what I have. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> the Collagen Patches do not work it seemed that it made the dark Circle even worse.I would not recomment this product to other People even that it may work for them .</li>
    <li> There is no miracle in this patch. However with the right eye creams then apply the patch at night helps the moisture penetrate and prevent movement wrinkles while sleeping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while and they really help to reduce the lines and puffiness under the eyes. I put them on for about 30-45 minutes before applying make up.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I look into the mirror and I look like I have a black eye and no matter how much makeup I apply, it still shows. So I decided to give this gel a try and I loved it! I got a refreshing feeling and greatly reduced the black circles under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reading reviews to see which product to try and just wanted to point out that these sound like they were written by marketers, not actual customers.</li>
    <li> I really need this in my beauty kit.  I feel that my beauty routine is incomplete if I am unable to use a set of this natural collagen eye patch in a day.  It really helps rejuvenates the skin under my eyes. And no matter how stressed I am at at work, my dace still looks fresh. It also soothes my eyes as they really get tired from facing the computer all day.  My favorite detail about this product though is that it is made from 100% natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> My wife noticed a difference within about three days. Some of the reviews state results sooner. But this was my wife&#x27;s experience. She noticed a reduction in wrinkles and dark circles under her eyes. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> The reviews are posted every few days, probably by the same person.  Someone in marketing or sales for this product trying to pad the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried the product, so I can&#x27;t comment on if it does reduce dark circles.  But most products don&#x27;t work, so it is not realistic that so many people had so much success.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m doing my best to keep myself and my familia toxic free. I read on the package it also contains &amp;#34;sodium polvacrylate&amp;#34; , another toxin. since this stuff is going on my skin it truly needs to be ALL natural.  Just bummed I have to go through the return process! Lame.</li>
