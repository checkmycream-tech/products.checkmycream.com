### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>excellent products that perform as advertised - a rarity these days!</li>
      <li>For that reason I think this kit could be the best choice for those tweens or teens who don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
      <li>My complexion isn&#x27;t perfect (doubt that it ever will be)</li>
      <li>She has issues with ADHD, but she remembers to use this product, which might be the best endorsement I can give.</li>
      <li>Might not be the best for dryer skin, though.</li>
      <li>The scent for all three products is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>It gave my skin a beautiful matte finish and helped keep the greasies away all day.  </li>
      <li>She is happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>It helps keep your skin from looking oily &amp; is great as a primer for makeup.  </li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>It was painless for this parent--my daughter has happily been using this treatment every day without prompting or pushing.  </li>
      <li>I do believe it&#x27;s the combination of salicylic acid and niacinamide ingredients that keeps my skin looking great.</li>
      <li>The spot zinger worked great.  </li>
      <li>It greatly reduces redness and just makes the skin appear a lot smoother.</li>
      <li>All in all, a great three in one product.</li>
      <li>is very effective.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful acne system that is much more gentler on your skin than Proactiv, and leaves your skin  looking healthy and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>The scrub and the spot treatment both have 2% salicylic acid and over time, they did a good job clearing any blemishes and keeping my skin looking clear.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it smells really good all three products.</li>
      <li>The scrub does a good job in regard to cleansing oily skin and the spottifier treats the immediate problem by drawing out and dissolving the irritant.</li>
      <li>My suggestion would be to purchase a good toner to go with this kit.</li>
      <li>This is a good working kit.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The face wash has a nice exfoliating feel to it and smells great.</li>
      <li>what makes one acne product more attractive or effective to the consumer?  </li>
      <li>That allows me to skip this step most days per week!  </li>
      <li>OK, after you scrub your face with the Acne Hater, you can use the Spot Zinger!</li>
      <li>I am in love!  </li>
      <li>At the sink it took a lot more time.&lt;br /&gt;After finishing, the scent remained and was pleasant, and my face had a cooling</li>
      <li>The product smells very nice and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>The products smell amazing &amp; don&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>daughter is still getting used to having to wash her face twice a day and sometimes skips, and as you would expect, we&#x27;re finding that that is the biggest factor in how effective these kits are.</li>
      <li>You get your warm water going, and massage it all over your face and neck.</li>
      <li>I liked the feel of the scrub.  </li>
      <li>My wife has used the spot acne treatment which has proven effective, zapping a zip overnight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The value of this kit cannot truly be understated as it&#x27;s relatively fair in pricing and grand on results.  </li>
      <li>product has all these attributes and is effective.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I got so many compliments on my skin when I used the mattifier under my makeup that I would buy this just for the mattifier.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 2% salicylic acid, which is suitable for a lot of people.</li>
      <li>I find spot-treatments are most effective if you catch a zit in the making - before it&#x27;s had a chance to come to head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It smells fairly nice and not terribly medicinal.</li>
      <li>More than anything else in the kit (there are tons of products like the scrub and salicylic acid cream)</li>
      <li>My favorite item out of this kit would be the cleanser.</li>
      <li>We just need to find something that will work better for her skin type.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give more of a review, but it just did not work for our needs.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>Used under the BB cream, it allows me to get the sunscreen benefits of the BB without the overly greasy feel that most sunscreens leave on my skin.</li>
      <li>I love using this:</li>
      <li>I have to put more makeup to cover my acne and to control my oily skin.</li>
      <li>Swirled Mattifier is my favorite product out of the three.  </li>
      <li>I love this system.</li>
      <li>In addition to being pleased with its effectiveness, she loves the scent and the way the lotion feels on her face.</li>
      <li>I used the Olay Fresh Effects kit and had fairly good results.  </li>
      <li>Got it fast &amp; works great.</li>
      <li>My favorite part is the exfoliant in the cleanser.</li>
      <li>Or simply trying the Benzac system (which is, honestly, so impressive!!)</li>
      <li>have very oily skin and the mattifier works great to take the shine away and keep it away for hours.  </li>
      <li>with most acne kits, it is a hit or miss.  </li>
      <li>I love how the mattifier shrinks my pores and reduces the redness of my pimples.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite refreshing and eye-opening.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, I was pleased (and they were too) with the minty-citrus fragrance that is in all 3 of the products.  </li>
      <li>I would guess that it is mostly about packaging.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even say for sure if the product cleared it up, or if my face just cleared up on</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>face wash wasn&#x27;t appealing with it being a scrub</li>
      <li>and my face is already 50% better.  </li>
      <li>The clean is really quite an excellent clean without being too abrasive.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The two percent salicylic might be a bit too strong for some, but it works great for those with really oily skin.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to work up into a light lather and then wash off in warm water.</li>
      <li>My favourite product of the 3 is the deep scrub because of the very pleasant and not overpowering scent, the ease of use and removal, and the way my skin tingled when it was done.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m sure many of you can relate to the fun times this is leading to!)  </li>
      <li>By assembling three products that worked in tandem was really a brilliant but obvious idea.</li>
      <li>but most importantly does the job.</li>
      <li>The folks at Olay have stayed away from light pinks, too many flowers, and perfumy sents, as they do want to bring some guys into the equation.</li>
      <li>Dream come true!</li>
      <li>From the lotion perspective it went on easily and didn&#x27;t make me feel like I was caked in product.</li>
      <li>The easy steps are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>(In fact, I would strongly encourage you to begin with that system.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is a nice second step that leaves your skin feeling &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; (in a good way).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong</li>
      <li>but this seems a lot more natural and good for the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>May be too strong for my face.</li>
      <li>Ultimately I think this is a very good product that is effective but yet gentle on the face.</li>
      <li>The packaging doesn&#x27;t impact the function of the product, but it&#x27;s important to note that you will not have an easy time removing them from the box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to clean the skin very well, but (like most foaming cleansers, honestly) I wouldn’t rely on it to remove my makeup.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this under makeup as my foundation goes on super smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for young and old skin alike.  </li>
      <li>(just getting in the habit of washing your face a couple of times a day can make a huge difference).</li>
      <li>This product is gentle yet effective, affordable and smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>Though we both believe when she uses the Olay Fresh Effects product twice a day without skipping, this kit works better than the others.</li>
      <li>bottom line is that this is a great deal especially at the Amazon price.  </li>
      <li>I will say that my skin remained smooth and the product was not oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>and my bf mentioned how smooth my skin looked.</li>
      <li>We will be replacing this when the free sample I was given runs out.  </li>
      <li>I still have problems with breakouts and oily skin, even at my advanced age of 37.  </li>
      <li>it just wasn&#x27;t as fast or effective.</li>
      <li>I was really impressed with this fast acting treatment.</li>
      <li>She liked the scrub and said it really got her face clean.  </li>
      <li>I used it mostly around my cheeks and chin, and it cleared up some mild bumps and splotchiness really quickly, when nothing else had.  </li>
      <li>My 16-year-old didn&#x27;t notice much difference in her skin, but then again her skin is always pretty good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells fairly nice and not terribly medicinal. It cleanses pretty well without being exceptionally harsh, and it generally seems to get the job done okay. The medication dose is not as high as I&#x27;ve seen in other products, which may be bad for people who need something really strong and good for people who easily get their skin burned or irritated. The little tube of stronger medicine that you&#x27;re supposed to put on actual broken out areas is pretty small, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll actually last 30 days if you&#x27;re badly broken out. I guess ideally the system will settle your skin down enough over time that you shouldn&#x27;t have to use that part of the product too much.</li>
    <li> This is a good working kit.  The scent for all three products is absolutely wonderful.  It&#x27;s a clean, fresh citrus scent.  It&#x27;s not too strong and I think males as well as females would find the scent nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub works well to clean my face.  My skin feels soft and smooth after I use it.  The scrub and the spot treatment both have 2% salicylic acid and over time, they did a good job clearing any blemishes and keeping my skin looking clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and the mattifier works great to take the shine away and keep it away for hours.  I really dislike my face looking shiny, so I really love the mattifier.  I have a good friend with dry skin and occasional blemishes.  I had her try out the mattifier and she hated it.  She said it made her skin feel old and dry.  So, something to think about if your skin is on the dry side.  She likes her skin shiny!  The exact opposite of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good kit for me, with oily skin.  Might not be the best for dryer skin, though.</li>
    <li> This acne creme work really well for about two weeks and minimized the appearance of my acne scars but then actually intensified my blemishes. YMMV. I have very sensitive skin that usually gets used to specify cremes very quickly and then I need to change it up.</li>
    <li> We picked up this kit for our 11 year old daughter who is going through puberty and dealing with breaking out for the first time. (I&#x27;m sure many of you can relate to the fun times this is leading to!)  This is the third kit we&#x27;ve tested, and in my opinion most kits are similar in their use of salicylic acid.  For our daughter, the results with the three kits have been fairly similar, which is to say that they are reasonably effective.  Full disclosure - I&#x27;m not sure that any product on the market can keep up with teen acne without causing irreparable damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter is still getting used to having to wash her face twice a day and sometimes skips, and as you would expect, we&#x27;re finding that that is the biggest factor in how effective these kits are. Though we both believe when she uses the Olay Fresh Effects product twice a day without skipping, this kit works better than the others. The main benefit we see is that our daughter does not experience the over-drying effects of some other reviewers, which could easily be attributed to the fact that herskin may just be oilier than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One difference with this kit that our daughter likes is the mattifier. She is not yet wearing makeup, and the mattifier gives her skin a non-shiny appearance that she couldn&#x27;t otherwise get without wearing makeup. For that reason I think this kit could be the best choice for those tweens or teens who don&#x27;t wear makeup. We also like the 3-step process because it&#x27;s helpful for establishing a routine and it&#x27;s helping her learn about her skin and how to care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that I&#x27;m learning that I can buy the products (2% salicylic acid cleanser, mattifier, toner, etc.) individually in larger sized bottles for the same price.</li>
    <li> Step 1: Cleanse Acne Hater Deep Scrub -  A little goes a long way and I could feel the cleanser exfoliating while it lathers, but it&#x27;s not too harsh like some scrubs. I really like the citrus scent, as it&#x27;s not overpowering. A little on the messy side, I preferred using it in the shower so I didn&#x27;t splash water all over my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Treat Spot Zinger - Used as a spot treatment for problem areas, I didn&#x27;t experience any dryness or tingling like I&#x27;ve gotten from other treatments. Not sure if this quickened healing, but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Mattify Swirled Mattifier - Still not 100% sure what the purpose of this was, but I used it before applying my makeup instead of my normal moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve never used Proactiv, I can&#x27;t compare the two. This didn&#x27;t aggravate my skin and my face seemed calmer than usual after using this for several days, so think I might continue using. Once the mattifier runs out, doubt that I&#x27;ll replace it but do like the first two steps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for alternative methods to help my daughter with her acne. We decided to try this and what we found is that it is NOT good for sensitive skin. My daughter&#x27;s skin dried out after the first use and it didn&#x27;t seem to clear up any of her acne. Now I understand that products like this don&#x27;t always work for everyone. so we aren&#x27;t upset by it. We just need to find something that will work better for her skin type. I wish I could give more of a review, but it just did not work for our needs.</li>
    <li> I like it and the 3 step system is very effective. My daughter used it for a month and had a visible improvement. The product did work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have any issues with salicylic acid, you may have a reaction to this product as it has a 2% salicylic acid level which is what kills the acne bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the Deep Scrub was also quite nice, a fruit and mint mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter ended up not using the Mattifier product, she said it felt too heavy on her face (but she is a young teen). This product might have been better on an older teen or 20+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging cute, clearly designed to appeal to the under 25 crowd</li>
    <li> I love this system. It smells great but most importantly does the job. My skin feels so clean and smooth after, never dried out. My favorite part is the exfoliant in the cleanser. My face looks clear and its tone more even.</li>
    <li> Dream come true! I&#x27;ve struggled with hormonal acne for years and everything else I&#x27;ve tried (including dermatologist prescribed formulas) either made my sensitive skin breakout even more or, dried it out to the point of peeling. This product is gentle yet effective, affordable and smells fantastic. PLEASE do not discontinue this item!</li>
    <li> I still have problems with breakouts and oily skin, even at my advanced age of 37.  I typically use Oil of Olay Regenerist face wash, but it wasn&#x27;t helping with my breakouts.  I decided to try this out and see what a difference it would make (if any) in my chin/jaw line breakouts.  Personally, I liked this skin care regimen, but I didn&#x27;t see overnight results; in fact, it took about a week for me to see results (which is usually how long my break outs last, so I can&#x27;t even say for sure if the product cleared it up, or if my face just cleared up on it&#x27;s own.  I have been using these products regularly, and while it hasn&#x27;t completely stopped my face from breaking out, it has reduced the amount of bumps and redness to a very small number.  I have not had my son (who has acne issues) try this yet, but I may order him a set to try out.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I saw this kit and figured why not.  I needed some face wash anyways!  I haven&#x27;t even been using it a week yet and my face is already 50% better.  Within a couple days I noticed an extreme difference.  The redness has gone down a lot and my face is starting to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash wasn&#x27;t appealing with it being a scrub but I figured I needed to try it.  It isn&#x27;t harsh like a lot of scrubs &amp; foams up nicely.  It has a different smell but I think it&#x27;s the natural ingredient mixed together.  This starts the process washing away impurities &amp; exfoliating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spot treatment I have been using in mass amounts.  It just leaves the medicine on longer.  It helps exfoliate the skin around the pimple allowing it to dry out &amp; helps dislodge clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the moisturizing cream which is also a mattifier.  It helps keep your skin from looking oily &amp; is great as a primer for makeup.  It also helps reduce the look of pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together I&#x27;m amazed at this product because nothing else has worked like this for me.  Benzoyl Peroxide treatments end up bleaching all my clothes &amp; the moisturizers clog my pores even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this it&#x27;s best to start out slow until your skin adjusts.  Like the directions say, it will cause dryness at first if you use it too often.  I went all out &amp; have only had a dry patch under my lip in the chin crease.</li>
    <li> Not clearing up the acne at all.  I am disappointed in this product.  My daughter&#x27;s face is still breaking out and looks horrible.  I will be dumping this and going to another well known product.</li>
    <li> I thought the system worked well to cleanse the face and reduce the look of pores and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash has a nice exfoliating feel to it and smells great. You can really feel a lot of grit in it so it feels like it is doing a good job removing dead skin. It has salicylate acid in it which has always worked well for me. The touch up 2nd tube, which also has salicylic acid didn&#x27;t create any problems for me and seemed to help clean up my pores and some small thick skin spots. The final mattifier also seemed to reduce the look of pores and redness on and along side my nose area.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my teen daughter, who recently experienced her first real breakout.  She said she noticed a big improvement after using the Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin 1-2-3 Acne Kit for a week.  She liked the scrub and said it really got her face clean.  She particularly liked the Mattify, which she said left her skin smooth and even-toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  One negative:  I thought the price was a bit high, especially since the tubes are small.</li>
    <li> My teen daughters have been using this for almost a month. My 16-year-old didn&#x27;t notice much difference in her skin, but then again her skin is always pretty good. My 13-year-old said that initially her skin breakouts got much worse but then cleared up and her skin has been looking very nice ever since. She is happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this fast acting treatment. This acne kit is far better then anything I have ever used! The zit zinger is my favorite because it really kills any active acne in just a day! kit! I love how the mattifier shrinks my pores and reduces the redness of my pimples. People have really noticed my skin getting better. Totally recommend it especially for teenagers.</li>
    <li> excellent products that perform as advertised - a rarity these days!</li>
    <li> Initially this was too harsh for me. After the second use it was much better and left my skin very smooth. I began mixing it with my clean n clear pore cleanser and my bf mentioned how smooth my skin looked. I like this product and it makes my pores seem smaller and my face definitely feels smoother. However I am AA with combo skin and this did nothing for my complexion.</li>
    <li> My lady has a naturally red hue in her skin and is always battling outbreaks on her face, prompting me to let her try the Olay 1-2-3 Acne Solutions and, after a month of use, am proud to report that the kit has shown considerable positive results that have motivated my lady to pay for additional refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We followed the instructions to the latter and noticed a reduction in current acne breakouts just outside of 24 hours.  Within a week, all acne was gone and her reddish hue was beginning to  dissipate.  Just inside a month, all reddish hues were gone and we haven&#x27;t seen any hints of acne for weeks.  The stuff clearly works and it is amplified by the face wash that helps get rid of all dead skin on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of this kit cannot truly be understated as it&#x27;s relatively fair in pricing and grand on results.  A must have for anyone of any age seeking to bring acne and skin discoloration under control.</li>
    <li> When considered individually, each product would earn a considerably different star rating. So, I am going to give you the run-down on how each would size-up separately.  I would give the &amp;#34;deep scrub&amp;#34; four-stars. While it does seems to cleanse well, the odor is a little off-putting.  As for the the &amp;#34;spot zinger&amp;#34; (the silly name does not inspire confidence), I have seen better results with the new Benzac Intensive Spot Treatment (that product is just amazing!). I guess I would rate this at three-stars.  And, the &amp;#34;swirled mattifier&amp;#34; ... oh my. Talk about a one-star product! It is heavy and wildly unpleasant. Having tried the Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator recently, I can only HIGHLY suggest that. (In fact, I would strongly encourage you to begin with that system. It is a little more expensive, but you are going to lose money here when you toss this mattifier).  Knowing that the mattifier is not usable,  I am not comfortable in recommending this kit. I would suggest trying the scrub and &amp;#34;zinger&amp;#34; separately (if possible). Or simply trying the Benzac system (which is, honestly, so impressive!!)</li>
    <li> Got it fast &amp; works great.</li>
    <li> i returned this item because i just did not really need it right now but i have used the products once before. i like that they make pores look smaller. my facial pores are very large and very visible. using these products made my facial skin look and feel smoother and pore size was less visible. i recommend it to women who have large pores and want product to decrease pore visibility.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have an on-going issue with acne but I do have outbreaks fairly regularly.  They are small but annoying and can take a bit to go away.  I used the Olay Fresh Effects kit and had fairly good results.  I did find that the Acne Hater Deep Scrub was a little harsh for my skin.  I ended up mixing it with water and using it very sparingly and with extremely light pressure.  I imagine it depends on how sensitive your skin is to scrubs.  I really liked Spot Zinger (who thinks of these crazy names?) for treating actual pimples and some of the larger blackheads that I have (oddly enough on my back rather than my face.)  It did well and I didn&#x27;t have subject my whole face to the treatment.  Finally, I had mixed results with Swirled Mattifier.  It did take the shine away but didn&#x27;t seem to do much with the red.  Of course, I also have broken capillaries around one side of my nose, so I have a lot of redness that is not associated with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a good job, but was a little harsh on my skin at times.  I recommend it if you don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I actually prefer this over Proactiv because if does not dry my face out at all!  I&#x27;ve suffered from blackheads since my teen years and FINALLY am getting rid of them!!  I am in love!  My breakout during my menstrual cycle was one pimple!! In the last, it was 5 or more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 40 (not saying by how much over) and am still getting pimples! Ack! I thought those years were behind me but, alas, they&#x27;re not. When I saw this item from Olay, I thought, &amp;#34;Maybe it&#x27;s for women over 40?&amp;#34; so I decided to pick it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wash that scrubs the oil and dirt from your face - it&#x27;s called Acne Hater Deep Scrub! Sounds like something you&#x27;d see on TV on Saturday night, doesn&#x27;t it? OK, after you scrub your face with the Acne Hater, you can use the Spot Zinger! It&#x27;s for those annoying zits that stand out and announce themselves to the world. Finally, there is the Swirled Mattifier. Well, I have to admit, I like sprinkles, sparkles and swirls. This Mattifier (who came up with that one?) is used for your entire face in order to reduce redness and shrink your pores.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Acne Hater Deep Scrub. It smells fresh and clean and feels really nice as I scrub my face; the Spot Zinger has come in handy because I have one or two of those annoying zits that like to say HELLO to anyone I meet. Then, the Swirled Mattifier. I love using this: I want to see the swirls! But it mixes on your face and you don&#x27;t get to be swirled.....bummer!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this trio of acne destroyers. My 15-year old told me the other day that my skin looked gray and that was because I forgot to swirl my face. My complexion isn&#x27;t perfect (doubt that it ever will be) but I can tell that my face is cleaner and that the acne destroyers are working.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to women over 40...or basically to all women.</li>
    <li> The Olay Fresh Effect Clear Skin 1-2-3 Acne Solution System kit seems to be rather effective, not just at keeping acne under control, but also helping to limit the visibility of the break-outs. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s anything that can hit someone&#x27;s self-esteem so suddenly as a bad bout of acne. I had a fairly severe case of it when I was younger, and there just weren&#x27;t a whole lot of options back then (tinted benzoyl peroxide was about it). My stepson&#x27;s case isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as all that, but it can be noticeable and I know he struggles with. Despite the fact that this is an Olay product, he&#x27;s been using it now for a few weeks and it&#x27;s been working for him. I was initially concerned that he might be sensitive to the salicylic acid (2%) in the Acne Hater scrub and the Spot Zinger (my wife is sensitive enough to it that I try to avoid buying any face wash that has it), but he hasn&#x27;t had any issue with it. It does seem to dry his face a bit, but that&#x27;s just kind of the nature of the beast when it comes to acne control products. Despite that, I would say the scrub and spot treatment have had a noticeably positive effect on his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the biggest surprise here is the mattifier. It might not be the kind of product marketed toward us guys, but as far as the appearance goes, it makes a huge difference. As the name suggests, it basically cuts down on any kind of shiny appearance the skin might have from excess oiliness. It greatly reduces redness and just makes the skin appear a lot smoother. More than anything else in the kit (there are tons of products like the scrub and salicylic acid cream), this is probably the one that stands out as something different that makes a pretty big difference quickly. It&#x27;s basically used as kind of a foundation (that&#x27;s how I used that tinted benzoyl peroxide back in the day...but this seems a lot more natural and good for the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this seems like a pretty good set for anyone battling acne, regardless of their age or gender (as long as they&#x27;re not sensitive to salicylic acid). Everything works as advertised and having the three products together like this also seems pretty helpful for younger people to get into a good routine (just getting in the habit of washing your face a couple of times a day can make a huge difference).dless of their age or gender (as long as they&#x27;re not sensitive to salicylic acid).

    <li> The cleanser has a delightful light citrus mint scent and the microbeads are small enough as not to irritate your face. The moisturizer is a nice second step that leaves your skin feeling &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; (in a good way). My wife has used the spot acne treatment which has proven effective, zapping a zip overnight. All in all, a great three in one product.</li>
    <li> With 2 teenage boys (always wearing helmets for different sports) in our house we are always looking for different products to combat their acne.  We&#x27;ve tried several different products but nothing that is a 3-step process like this Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Kit.  My boys aren&#x27;t typically too picky about fragrances... except if it clearly smells like something their younger sister would wear.  So, I was pleased (and they were too) with the minty-citrus fragrance that is in all 3 of the products.  It&#x27;s quite refreshing and eye-opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sometimes tough to get boys to do anything more then shower, put deodorant on and brush their teeth.  I was a bit nervous about now asking them to add 3 more steps to their daily routine.  After seeing some results in their skin, they&#x27;re both on board with this process.  The easy steps are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1. wash face with the Acne Hater Deep Scrub&lt;br /&gt;2. apply the Spot Zinger which helps fight existing acne and ward off anything new&lt;br /&gt;3. apply the Swirled Mattifier which reduces redness and shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boys don&#x27;t have bad acne and we&#x27;re happy with this product because they haven&#x27;t experienced any drying effects from the 2% salicylic acid.  If you have bad acne you may want to consult a dermatologist for a stronger product.</li>
    <li> What you get:&lt;br /&gt;3 products in one package: Acne deep scrub, Spot/Blemish control, and a &amp;#34;Mattifier&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The deep scrub is meant for daily cleansing for your entire face / neck; the spot zinger is to put specifically on a blemish; the mattifier is a lotion-like product designed to minimize visible pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the packaging - it&#x27;s not frustration-free.&lt;br /&gt;Each of the containers inside the box is attached and held in place by a 1&amp;#34;x1&amp;#34; sticky piece of foam. The products are difficult to remove from the box and get away from the stick foam, and in the case of the mattifier container I was left with foam still stuck to the bottom of the product when I finally got it out of the box. I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve ever seen product packaging this unfriendly. The packaging doesn&#x27;t impact the function of the product, but it&#x27;s important to note that you will not have an easy time removing them from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1 - Acne Hater Deep Scrub&lt;br /&gt;This is a greenish gel product that smells sort of like fruit cocktail with mint. You get your warm water going, and massage it all over your face and neck. I&#x27;ve done this both in the shower and at the sink. The product smells very nice and goes on easily. The abrasives in the gel are just the right texture so as to provide the scrubbing power, but not feel like you&#x27;re scratching your face. It was easy to work up into a light lather and then wash off in warm water. My preference is to do this in the shower so that I can completely wash it off my face. At the sink it took a lot more time.&lt;br /&gt;After finishing, the scent remained and was pleasant, and my face had a cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 2 - Spot Zinger&lt;br /&gt;This is a white thick cream in a small tube that you put directly onto blemishes. It&#x27;s go salicylic acid just like every other acne or pimple treatment out there. It goes on clean and massages in without an oily residue. In terms of product performance I always compare these things to Burt&#x27;s Bees Blemish Stick, which is a product that I have a constant stock of because it&#x27;s just that darn good. Burt&#x27;s Bees will get rid of a blemish is less than 24-hours in most cases. This product does seem to work well but took a little longer to clear up a spot I had on my face as compared to my preferred product. It didn&#x27;t fail...it just wasn&#x27;t as fast or effective. It didn&#x27;t have a negative smell - but I guess smelled like many other acne creams on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 3 - Swirled Mattifier&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never heard this term before. Basically what it&#x27;s supposed to do is reduce redness and pores so that your skin looks smoother and shiny and whatever the heck mattifier really means. My nose has some visible pores so that&#x27;s where I started. This is a pump bottle with a thick white cream that is the consistency of a typical face / skin lotion. It went on smoothly (and it&#x27;s recommended you use it directly after using the cleaner and spot zinger - thus the 1-2-3 system). I didn&#x27;t notice an immediate decrease in my pores but I guess they were a bit less visible. It wasn&#x27;t significant enough for me to say there was immediate effectiveness. I will say that my skin remained smooth and the product was not oily or greasy. From the lotion perspective it went on easily and didn&#x27;t make me feel like I was caked in product. That&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say this is a solid product line. My favourite product of the 3 is the deep scrub because of the very pleasant and not overpowering scent, the ease of use and removal, and the way my skin tingled when it was done. In terms of the blemish fighting components - they work...but so do most other acne products on the market so I&#x27;m not sure how to differentiate those from the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that as a &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; these work well together in a 1-2-3 format. You can do it in less than five minutes and be on your way without anyone knowing that you have a bunch of product on your face. High marks for staying non-greasy and non-oily, and for the light scent that actually seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give these products a solid 4 stars (but the packaging gets a fail).h marks for staying non-greasy and non-oily, and for the light scent that actually seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give these products a solid 4 stars (but the packaging gets a fail).</li>
    <li> I’ve tried a couple of “acne control systems” in the past with not much luck.  But since I’m a huge fan of the Fresh Effects line by Olay, I decided to go ahead and give this kit a shot.  I folded the kit into my regular skin care routine, along with my PanOxyl Foaming Cleanser in the morning and Fresh Effects Dew Over skin cream at night. I know from past experience that using only salicylic acid products doesn’t work for me, and because I know that even my oily skin needs a moisture boost at night to keep it looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the purposes of full disclosure, my complete routine is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PanOxyl benzoyl peroxide foaming cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Swirled Mattifier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merle Norman Cleansing Cream (to remove makeup)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Swirled Mattifier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before bed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Acne Hater Deep Scrub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Spot Zinger everywhere I have spots/bumps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Fresh Effects Dew Over moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let’s look at each product in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Swirled Mattifier is my favorite product out of the three.  It’s a slightly green-tinted moisturizer for oily skin that helps reduce oil, reduce the appearance of large pores, and conceal redness.  I absolutely love this under makeup as my foundation goes on super smooth.  But it’s also great on its own or under the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream (which is a little too heavy for my skin without it).  On its own, it helps even out my skin tone and keeps shine at bay, without leaving my skin feeling tight or dry.  Used under the BB cream, it allows me to get the sunscreen benefits of the BB without the overly greasy feel that most sunscreens leave on my skin. It also leaves the skin with a cool, tingly feeling. I will most certainly buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Acne Hater Deep Scrub is a foaming cleanser with scrubbing beads.  I like that itprovides gentle daily exfoliation while I cleanse.  That allows me to skip this step most days per week!  It seems to clean the skin very well, but (like most foaming cleansers, honestly) I wouldn’t rely on it to remove my makeup. Using it once per day didn’t dry my face out or leave it flakey like some acne cleansers. I would certainly consider buying it again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spot Zinger treatment worked better than I expected.  I used it mostly around my cheeks and chin, and it cleared up some mild bumps and splotchiness really quickly, when nothing else had.  I also started smoothing over my nose, where I tend to get black heads.  It didn’t eliminate them, but they do seem to be less noticeable. For the last couple of days, I’ve started applying it to the little blackheads on my forehead; no improvement yet, but we’ll see. Using it just once per day didn’t cause too much dryness or flakiness for me.  I would also consider buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a great deal especially at the Amazon price.  If salicylic acid is already your treatment of choice, or if you’d like to incorporate it into your current acne control regimen, this is a great way to try all three of these products without breaking the bank even if you only end up permanently adding only one or two to your regular routine.</li>
    <li> May be too strong for my face.</li>
    <li> Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin 1-2-3 Acne Solution System works well as a treatment for mild to moderate acne.  It is a combination of a cleanser, spot treater, and mattifier (reduces shine) that do actually work to control acne.  Whether this works better than Proactiv (or any other over the counter acne treatment) as noted on the package is difficult to say, but my daughter was satisfied with this product over a three week trial and enjoyed using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the counter acne treatments--whether they are Proactiv, Clearasil, or a store brand usually use one of two active ingredients to fight acne: salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Olay Fresh Effects uses 2% salicylic acid and Proactiv uses a combination of 2% salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.  These ingredients work in mild to moderate acne and probably work for most teens and adults.  But the two basic ingredients are the same in most commercial anti-acne formulations and in this way it&#x27;s hard to say that the Olay product is really any different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Note: If you need something stronger, you generally have to see a dermatologist.  This will get you in the realm of antibiotic treatments (things like minocycline and doxycycline),  aldactone, and even prescription birth control pills (for teenage girls and women to help regulate the cycle and control hormonal swings that can worsen acne).  For severe cases, Accutane (isotrentoin) and photodynamic therapies can be used.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what makes one acne product more attractive or effective to the consumer?  I would guess that it is mostly about packaging.  The Olay product is definitely aimed at teenage girls: it has higher end packaging, images on the tubes that pop, and a fresh citrusy sent.  The folks at Olay have stayed away from light pinks, too many flowers, and perfumy sents, as they do want to bring some guys into the equation. But the packaging smacks of the fun, slightly-higher-end, makeup packaging that will likely appeal to more girls than guys.  This product looks more like a high-end skin product than it does like medicine, and this goes a long way to improve daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, fun packaging is actually quite a good thing if it motivates a teen to actually use the product.  The reason a lot of acne products fail is that kids tend to use them only when they are having a breakout.  The fact the product involves a series of daily steps--a cleanser, a spot treatment, and a mattifier--makes the product into an acne fighting system--which increased the appeal for my daughter and made her more fastidious in using the product--and if you use any acne product regularly it will work.  Having a &#x27;system&#x27; actually improved daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the products have the same, pleasant, citrusy sent.  The cleanser is the beaded-exfoliant variety.  The small beads are only very slightly abrasive but smooth enough to prevent scratching the skin from over use or too much pressure.  The clean is really quite an excellent clean without being too abrasive.  The main ingredient here is 2% salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spot treatment allows for targeted placement.  Unlike some other products (I&#x27;m thinking classic Clearasil) the odor is pleasant, which likely improves compliance.  Once again the main ingredient is 2% salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mattifier, is the last step and is supposed to reduce the look of oiliness.  The clear package with the corkscrew swirl of product with a greenish stripe gives it the look of a high end skin product. It does this, but unlike astringent wipes (think classic Sea Breeze acne wipes of old) it reduces oiliness but is not too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system, as it were, probably makes the difference here.  The key to acne is often daily skin cleansing with a mild cleanser, a product that will reduce breakouts (e.g. salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide for most over the counter products, and a finisher/moisturizer to prevent overly dry skin and improve appearance.  The other important factor, of course, is the base of the products--the vehicle that delivers the active ingredients.  Olay has been in the skin care business long enough and delivers a product that is not harsh on the skin and that my daughter enjoyed using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has all these attributes and is effective.  However, it would be hard to say as to whether this product works any better than Proactiv (or any other forumulation).  Proactiv does use two ingredients, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, but there is nothing that assures that using two ingredients instead of one will actually make it a better product.  The fact is, you could save a lot of money buying a drugstore brand cleanser, spot treater, and mattifier and get the same active ingredients.  Sadly, it is hard to know whether the vehicle and inactive ingredients will be gentle enough on the skin. Even worse, without the packaging and they system, the store brand treatments may not be as exciting to use.  And acne treatments that stay in the medicine chest untouched never actually work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important note: there has been a lot of news recently on the environmental impact of exfoliating microbeads.  I imagine the ones in this cleanser are of the plastic variety.  These beads go down the drain and end up being swallowed by a variety of fish and other marine life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I give this one the thumbs up.  It was painless for this parent--my daughter has happily been using this treatment every day without prompting or pushing.  Her skin is definitely clearer and she is much happier for that.  However, it is possible that if she had more severe acne this might not have worked as well.  Recommended for mild acne.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at walmart I&#x27;ve been using clean and clear for a long time it used to tame my acne but not anymore and i keep breaking out especially with my oily skin. So I decided to use the olay fresh effects acne treatment, it smells really good all three products. After a month of using it instead clearing my acne and reducing my oiliness I&#x27;m starting to breakout more than usual and my oiliness it increased. I have to put more makeup to cover my acne and to control my oily skin. So now i have to search a new acne treatment but this was the worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved every single thing I&#x27;ve bought from Olay. I&#x27;m a long time user of proactive, and I can say this kit is comparable to Proactive. My suggestion would be to purchase a good toner to go with this kit. My favorite item out of this kit would be the cleanser. It&#x27;s exfoliating, but not too abrasive.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan. I am used to more natural products. This has coloring. After using this for about I week I actually had more break outs and skin issues.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;swirled mattifier&amp;#34; (step three), an ever-so-slightly green tinged primer/moisturizer, alone makes this system worth the money.  It gave my skin a beautiful matte finish and helped keep the greasies away all day.  Honestly, I got so many compliments on my skin when I used the mattifier under my makeup that I would buy this just for the mattifier.  It worked well and is so much less slimy than other under-makeup primers I&#x27;ve tried.  Caveat -- I am fairly fair-skinned, and when I first applied the mattifier, it left my skin looking a tad pale and chalky.  But with a little powder on top, I was good to go.  I can&#x27;t imagine that the mattifier would work as well on tawny or chocolatey skin tones, but I can&#x27;t exactly test it to find out.  To me, the mattifier did not feel particularly &amp;#34;moisturizing,&amp;#34; but I imagine it might on oilier skin.  I think the mattifier might be more appealing to older acne and rosacea sufferers than to young tweens and teens in the same predicament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the deep scrub and spot zinger, I&#x27;m sure they work just fine, like similar products containing 2% salicylic acid.  I liked the feel of the scrub.  It was not too abrasive or drying, it did not burn or sting, and it left my skin feeling super clean and the tiniest bit tingly.  Likewise, no objections to the spot treatment, which comes with an applicator with a very narrow tip (think super glue) which really lets you pinpoint where you want to apply it.  As for the purported citrus mint scent -- hmmm -- it&#x27;s no Yankee Candle.  To me, it had the slightest medicinal scent, though it was completely inoffensive.</li>
    <li> No, no, no.  This dries out the skin within a week, burns, and leaves the spots looking worse, not better.</li>
    <li> I feel so torn about this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it presents itself as a complete system for fighting acne but it truly isn&#x27;t - particularly if you have more than just the occasional zit, you will not want to use a scrub at all. For the rest of us, it can be extremely damaging and drying to your skin to use a scrub daily. At most you should only use any scrub once or twice a week, and for those with acne you shouldn&#x27;t use a scrub at all - so why is this product even here? Olay should&#x27;ve included a gentle cleanser instead; acne-prone skin is often sensitive and needs to be treated very gently until it heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the citrus and mint Olay advertises in the ingredients. Both of those can irritate skin and make it worse. In particular, citrus tends to give skin a highly sought-after &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; but this effect is temporary; at worst citrus can make the skin more photo-sensitive which means hyperpigmentation (sun spots) - and that is permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the zinger. It&#x27;s 2% salicylic acid, which is suitable for a lot of people. It&#x27;s a spot-treatment creme so it&#x27;s not actually necessary to have, but most people I know who get at least the occasional zit like to carry a spot-treatment product of some kind. I find spot-treatments are most effective if you catch a zit in the making - before it&#x27;s had a chance to come to head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the mattifier, but I confess that after the first time using it, I didn&#x27;t use it as my primary moisturizer but instead as a primer after my moisturizer. I don&#x27;t notice any effect on my redness going down, even when I did try it as my primary moisturizer the first time. However, it does keep my face from looking shiny. I&#x27;m not super oily though, just around the nose and chin, so YMMV. It&#x27;s not heavy and it goes on and sinks in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As individual products I think they&#x27;re fine. But as a kit, especially one marketed as a simple and complete 3-step kit to getting rid of acne, the product choice is terrible. To recap: the scrub should not be used daily and should never be used on acne-prone skin; the zinger is nice but is completely optional; and the mattifier is better as a make-up primer than as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, because I hate ending on that note: if I were designing a 3-step acne kit, it would include a gentle cleanser similar to Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, a gentle toner that has no alcohol in it, and a no-frills, basic moisturizer like CereVe. (It is so important for acne-prone people to use moisturizer consistently so their skin doesn&#x27;t go into overdrive producing oil!) In general while your skin is inflamed, the simpler the routine, the better.</li>
    <li> My very stubborn &amp; sensitive skin adores this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks &amp; although I still have some pimples my skin is more even, hydrated, &amp; looks 80% more clear! The products smell amazing &amp; don&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin. I will def be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and after a couple of days of using it I noticed a difference with my acne. Before using this product I had terrible breakouts. It seemed as if I had a new pimple everday. Once I started using this product my face cleared and I had no breakouts. I stopped the product for about 5 days and noticed the breakouts again. Ultimately I think this is a very good product that is effective but yet gentle on the face.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful acne system that is much more gentler on your skin than Proactiv, and leaves your skin  looking healthy and beautiful.  I even tried the newer Proactiv+ that is WAY more expensive than the original, and is no better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv did clear up my skin, but it always looked dry and unhealthy.  What&#x27;s the point of having clear skin that looks unhealthy?  Olay also keeps me clear, but leaves my skin healthy looking.  No  more dryness, irritation or weird rashes that would sometimes show up from the dryness.  I highly recommend this system  and will never stop using it (and I&#x27;m no youngster!).  It&#x27;s perfect for young and old skin alike.  I do believe it&#x27;s the combination of salicylic acid and niacinamide ingredients that keeps my skin looking great. And if you&#x27;re not aware of niacinamide, just google niacinamide+skin...this ingredient is a super effective, gentle, anti-aging ingredient that also helps acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay has a winner with this one.  Much cheaper than Proactiv and other expensive systems and works SO much better.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a three step package deal that is supposed to be on the attack for acne and blackheads, two nagging skin issues for young people who generally prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully my kid was home for Spring Break and became my test puppy. The 1-2-3 punch (and steps) to knock out the skin issue includes a 1) facial scrub, 2) a spottifier (a step to apply a cosmetic acid to the skin which essentially draws out the reason for the irritation/breakout), and 3) a product designed to lessen the redness and irritated appearance of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The odor from this product is neutral. It is not highly scented. If anything you might call it antiseptic when applied to step 2. This package appears to work when used in tandem and it should work because it is pretty much what I did when I was a kid. The scrub does a good job in regard to cleansing oily skin and the spottifier treats the immediate problem by drawing out and dissolving the irritant. As for the final phaseI think it is somewhat akin to a toner which invigorates skin and cuts down on oils that sit on the skin&#x27;s surface.&lt;br /&gt;As applied, my kid&#x27;s &#x27;problem&#x27; disipated quickly and was zapped completely in under four days. By assembling three products that worked in tandem was really a brilliant but obvious idea. It was effective but gentler than the old Stridex pads I used that left my skin looking dry and fried. The general quality of the treatment left skin looking good.&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t know what Proactiv  promises or what it delivers, I can only comment on this package. I thought this was a smart package that worked without a lot crazy steps and delivered fast results. Four stars for this one.</li>
    <li> This was used by my wife who still gets break outs. We used it for about three weeks. The cleanser gave a good wash, but after,  it did give a tight, seemingly drying effect just a minute after using.  The spot zinger worked great.  She used it on very specific areas on the her T-Zone and it controlled further break outs.  She used the mattifier on her T-Zone as well, and it did give it a less shiny look and worked great under her foundation and even on days when she just uses face powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two percent salicylic might be a bit too strong for some, but it works great for those with really oily skin.  She has stopped using the cleanser, but has continued to use the spot zinger, specially on her chin, which is her problem area.  The mattifier she still uses under her make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most acne kits, it is a hit or miss.  It&#x27;s a different experience for each individual and the only way to find out is to actually use it.  It is usually suggested to give facial skin products at least three months to see it if it works for you. Due to time constraints in giving a review, we were able to use this product for three weeks.</li>
    <li> My teenaged daughter loves this product. She noticed improvement with her mild to moderate acne within a week. In addition to being pleased with its effectiveness, she loves the scent and the way the lotion feels on her face. She has issues with ADHD, but she remembers to use this product, which might be the best endorsement I can give. We will be replacing this when the free sample I was given runs out.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
