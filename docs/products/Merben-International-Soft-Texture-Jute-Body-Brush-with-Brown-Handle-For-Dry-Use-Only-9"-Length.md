      <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference to be honest.</li>
      <li>so the benefit of dry skin-brushing is still to be experienced.</li>
      <li>I read so many positive reviews, that my skin type and immune system may be playing a part in my body&#x27;s response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I have been hunting for a nice soft body / skin brush.</li>
      <li>Bristles are soft and nice.  </li>
      <li>This is an EXCELLENT brush for daily, routine DRY skin brushing.</li>
      <li>I have to wonder how healthy it was to breathe in that fine \\&quot;dust\\&quot;, so I did my body brushing on the patio, in the open</li>

      <li>but after a few times of using it, you think it feels pretty good.</li>
      <li>At any rate exfoliating is a necessary beauty job and this makes it easy for me.</li>
      <li>Dry brushing for a couple of minutes, then showering and applying my favorite body cream, my skin looks better than before I discovered dry brushing.</li>
      <li>I love this brush for dry brushing...</li>
      <li>Saw this on Bethany and thought it would be a great way to get dead skin off prior to showering.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a person who is fit and works out regularly.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really soft and easy to use, makes dry brushing sensitive areas like my face and neck easy.</li>
      <li>The others feel like they are scratching my skin with stainless steel bristles.  </li>
      <li>Very invigorating for my morning routine and has really worked on some problem areas.</li>
      <li>Therefore I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
      <li>Using this brush after exercising is quite nice and invigorating, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the running or</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Now note: my skin is silky soft and not callous at all, so really there was really not much dead skin to shed.  </li>
      <li>I found it to be quite soft compared to other body brushes and it was gentle, but it did not fail to do the job.</li>
      <li>I am petite, and sensitive to things, my skin sensitivities included.  </li>
      <li>Using this brush has made my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Brushing your skin with this brush makes you feel alive and tingly.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin so soft.</li>
      <li>The only thing that would improve it is that the handle is covered in very prickly twine.</li>
      <li>The rating is not due to the quality of the product, but the lack of caution to the consumer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush is not uncomfortable on my skin, and my skin is hyper-sensitive, due to illness.</li>
      <li>I do hang it near my shower to try and remember to use it right before I shower everyday.</li>
      <li>I developed bruising upper and lower legs.  </li>
      <li>However, it feels the same as when I rub a shower pouf to lather myself with body wash,  not sure why it is better dry.  </li>
      <li>Not too soft - not too hard, just right.</li>
      <li>I read about dry brushing and wanted to try it,  I got this brush because it said it is soft.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this brush for dry brushing... It never makes my skin red or irritated and does a great job exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday but at least 3-4 times a day. I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference to be honest. I heard it is great for you so will continue to use it- maybe in 15 yrs I will see these amazing results.....</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft and nice.  Take a while to dry when washed.  Use on my chest, neck and face.  Spotted a similar looking brush in bed bath &amp; beyond that had scratchy, lower quality bristles.  Glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I try to use this brush every time, before I shower. Dry brushing for a couple of minutes, then showering and applying my favorite body cream, my skin looks better than before I discovered dry brushing. The brush is not uncomfortable on my skin, and my skin is hyper-sensitive, due to illness. I was afraid it would aggravate my skin, but I only see improvement. I would reccomend this to my friends.  I&#x27;ve been using this method for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I read about dry brushing and wanted to try it,  I got this brush because it said it is soft.  The others feel like they are scratching my skin with stainless steel bristles.  when I remember, I brush my body before showering.  However, it feels the same as when I rub a shower pouf to lather myself with body wash,  not sure why it is better dry.  However, it does feel nice, so I will keep doing it.  The only thing is I&#x27;m not sure how sanitary it is since we can&#x27;t wash the brush,  does it accumulate dead skin cells?  And if i leave it in the bathroom while I shower I&#x27;m worried that is will get moist and moldy.  A pain to leave the bathroom naked after brushing  and put in another room though.</li>
    <li> I use this as often as I can remember, a few times a week? I bought this so I could massage the cellulite away. Using this brush after exercising is quite nice and invigorating, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the running or the brushing that&#x27;s making my legs look better. Let&#x27;s just say both? At any rate exfoliating is a necessary beauty job and this makes it easy for me.</li>
    <li> I have fragile skin but I am a brushing fan. This brush is great. The only thing that would improve it is that the handle is covered in very prickly twine. I had to use duct tape over mine so I could hold it. If the handle was a wee bit longer, I could reach every part of my back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really soft and easy to use, makes dry brushing sensitive areas like my face and neck easy. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Using this brush has made my skin so soft. Very invigorating for my morning routine and has really worked on some problem areas. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft. I really like it.  The handle makes it very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with these brushes! They do everything they say they will and more. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have been hunting for a nice soft body / skin brush. After trying a few, some of which felt like wire brushes on my skin this was the ticket. Not too soft - not too hard, just right. Looks like it&#x27;s going to last a long time too, so even though it&#x27;s one of the pricier brushes I&#x27;ve checked out it&#x27;s still a good deal.</li>
    <li> thank you so much for a quick delivery.  They are awesome , meaning I ordered 2</li>
    <li> This is an EXCELLENT brush for daily, routine DRY skin brushing. Brushing your skin with this brush makes you feel alive and tingly. I love it, and am considering buying a second just to have on hand, maybe another as a gift.</li>
    <li> The rating is not due to the quality of the product, but the lack of caution to the consumer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product is nice.  One thing that I noted was that it sheds as you move fingers across it, and the dust disperses to the air.  I have to wonder how healthy it was to breathe in that fine \\&quot;dust\\&quot;, so I did my body brushing on the patio, in the open breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second:  This is not for every skin type.  I am assuming the experience I am about to post, is one side of the fence.  I read so many positive reviews, that my skin type and immune system may be playing a part in my body&#x27;s response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5 of Body Brushing:  I began to develop what looked like raised goose bumps, but itchy.  Now note: my skin is silky soft and not callous at all, so really there was really not much dead skin to shed.  I am petite, and sensitive to things, my skin sensitivities included.  Keep that in mind as I tell you what happened next.  I developed bruising upper and lower legs.  Then that became achy, and felt flushed with fever.  This seemed to have stimulated my immune system in a negative way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I countered by stopping immediately, but not before a sinus reaction.  I doubled up on my liquids (water and fresh vegetable juicing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been feeling lousy now for over a week and its first beginning to let up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a person who is fit and works out regularly.  To be laid up like this is a bit much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful with body brushing... Take it extremely slow.  I did mine once a day for 5 days, resulting in the above!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. Its the best dry brush i have ever used. Its not to rough or to soft. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good started brush for your first time trying dry brushing. I notice a big difference in my skin&#x27;s softness when I can remember to use this. Its a little rough at first but after a few times of using it, you think it feels pretty good. Especially on my hamstrings and on the heels of my feet. I do hang it near my shower to try and remember to use it right before I shower everyday.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister and she just loves it.  Told me to give it five stars for this review.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what it is presented to be.  I found it to be quite soft compared to other body brushes and it was gentle, but it did not fail to do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I&#x27;ve discovered that it can&#x27;t be washed or cleaned, so it will have to thrown away at some point.  Therefore I don&#x27;t use it very often. so the benefit of dry skin-brushing is still to be experienced.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Bethany and thought it would be a great way to get dead skin off prior to showering. Also bought another as a gift and put them in a spa package. Easy to use. Don&#x27;t ever wet though it will ruin them</li>
    <li> Just a bunch of hype.</li>
    <li> This body brush is AmAzInG. I recommend it. I got this one because it was cheapest out of the two (the other one can be used wet or dry) and I&#x27;ve really liked it. It leaves your skin so soft. No complaints here!</li>
