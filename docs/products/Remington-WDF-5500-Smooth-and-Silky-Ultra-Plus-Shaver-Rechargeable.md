      <li>She is very happy with it, so who am I to complain?</li>

      <li>and I loved it!</li>
      <li>Works good, no problems yet!</li>
      <li>But now this model does, beautifully.</li>
      <li>than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s been 5 days, the shaver works great on my legs, tried it once on my underarms and did yet some cuts/abrasions</li>
      <li>my wife used it and complain about not to be a great for shaving frecuently, if you understan how women are, please let me know I am just typing</li>

      <li>The razor itself works great.  </li>
      <li>, this is a great razor.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Happily satisfied!!</li>
      <li>Very nice and efficient shaver.</li>
      <li>must add that a perfectionist might not be happy with this shaver as the result is not as good when compared to a razor but</li>
      <li>/&gt;The compact stand and the storage kit look attractive and the battery also holds good.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to follow the directions for use, and you will have excellent results.</li>
      <li>Also I have used it when my legs were not swollen and it was just as good.</li>
      <li>but because I have had this shaver before, I knew it was a good one.  </li>
      <li>A good buy.</li>
      <li>The 6000 is a vastly superior model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver.</li>
      <li>I just take my shower real quick, put on some shorts, and sit on the floor in the living room and shave my legs!  </li>
      <li>I love shaving while I&#x27;m hanging in the living room!</li>
      <li>Love this razor!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that, after more use, it will be as good as the 3500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
      <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really wonderful and easy to clean. :)</li>
      <li>I was able to get a nice close shave with no irritation, itching or a trip afterward to the dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I used warm water and shaving cream to be on the safe side.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>It did not hurt, pull, itch or cut my skin in any way and was very smooth</li>
      <li>However, it works fine with just warm water too-</li>
      <li>So far it is very good.</li>
      <li>what amazed me even more was that my legs were swollen when I used it</li>
      <li>As Remington recommends, I waited until I had used this razor dialy for 3 weeks to judge its performance---and then gave it the benefit of the doubt and added 3 weeks more.  </li>
      <li>This product takes care of all those issues for me and more.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product worth the price for the convenience it offers and the 2-year warranty makes it an attractive</li>
      <li>I feel more confortable with my daughter using this shaver too.  </li>
      <li>At this point Remington WDF-5500 was the choice that I gladly welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I love the end results.  </li>
      <li>I love this shaver -</li>
      <li>But that seems to be inherent in most electric razors.</li>
      <li>I like the convenience of being able to shave wherever and whenever I want - not just in the shower.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m not going to get nicked, that took many times of using before I fully trusted the level of close shave.  </li>
      <li>I just got this razor this week, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Just nice smooth skin.</li>
      <li>I was OK with that.  </li>
      <li>I have had the Remington WDF-5500 for five months, and have been pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try fitting the head of my 6000 onto the 5500 and see if that helps.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to purchase it over others.  </li>
      <li>I find that for me, it works better out of the shower than in.</li>
      <li>It fits nicely into your hand so its not uncomfortable to hold- very light weight too.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it was a very good buy</li>
      <li>Its wet-dry feature appealed to me the most as it gives me the freedom to relax in front of the TV as well as maintain smooth legs.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the shaver will be very useful for me when I travel as it features a worldwide voltage.</li>
      <li>The noise level was fine-</li>
      <li>I had charged it all night and it worked fine in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>No pain, smooth legs after</li>
      <li>Neither of these features are hugely important.  </li>
      <li>I like the travel pouch it came with, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>but found out it didn&#x27;t fit the 5500 model.  </li>
      <li>I prefer to just shave with a blade underarm since it is so easy and quick anyways.</li>
      <li>and I hit the button for the flip top head and the whole thing came off!  </li>
      <li>This razor worked ok for the first shave, but it was just chewing my hair off.  </li>
      <li>I have not tried it in the shower yet but dry it does a great job.</li>
      <li>Great in the shower or dry.  </li>
      <li>starters, I have to shave my legs in the shower (with special non-scented, hypoallergenic shaving cream...</li>
      <li>Overall I think a good value.</li>
      <li>The battery life seems to be fairly good; I awarded an extra star for that.</li>
      <li>I have returned it and now am waiting for a full refund.  </li>
      <li>excellent results, provided it lasts for at least the 2 year warranty period.</li>
      <li>With the Remington WDF-5500, it&#x27;s fast, easy, &amp; leaves my legs smooth w/o a scratch or razor burn.</li>
      <li>So I have been looking for a good shaver for a long time and decided on trying an electric one this time..</li>
      <li>It works really well, no cuts to worry about, and it cleans up easily.  </li>
      <li>but when I do I always have problems with the shaver (The regular kind)..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price when I consider what I will now save in shaving cream and replacement razor blades.</li>
      <li>well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but it seems to work great (as other reviews say as well) and for something with a 2 year warranty, you can&#x27;t really beat that...</li>
      <li>The plastic trim started to come off right away</li>
      <li>This is a great little shaver!  </li>
      <li>It took me about 10-15 minutes to totally shave it off (very easily and without any nicks or hair-pulling).  </li>
      <li>I love this new razor even more than the last and recoommend it highly.  </li>
      <li>but with a new baby I needed something that is easy fast and didn&#x27;t require me to be in the shower.</li>
      <li>I bought this product based on the only review available here,  and let me tell you, she was right!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve used that comes close to blade smoothness.  </li>
      <li>My mother bought this for me because she has seen me struggle with so many different ways to remove hair.</li>
      <li>I did get more cuts with this shaver than I have with a traditional razor, but that may have been because I had to go over some areas repeatedly to remove all the stubble/hair.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This my second of this design and it outperforms all others - including other Remington models I have tried.  Not great for underarms but I use a regular razor for that.  Great in the shower or dry.  Eliminates the ingrown hairs and irritation I get from disposable razors.</li>
    <li> So far it is very good. I have not tried it in the shower yet but dry it does a great job. Keeps a charge and last a while.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t cut my hair well at all--even under what the directions list as ideal condition.  It&#x27;s completely hopeless on knees, etc.      After two months of use, the rubber part at the base of the razor head began to shred itself.  I looked into the provisions of the warranty.  Note that while the razor does come with a two-year warranty, you need to 1. save your receipt, and 2. drive the razor to the nearest certified dealer.  For me, the nearest dealer was an hour away--and I&#x27;m certainly not in the middle of nowhere.    The battery life seems to be fairly good; I awarded an extra star for that.</li>
    <li> Very nice and efficient shaver. I had a Remington WDF-3500 before, but could not use it under my arms because of razor burns. This model has improved and I can use it everywhere.</li>
    <li> Works good, no problems yet!</li>
    <li> The razor itself works great.  But beware, when you try to order replacement screens and cutters, they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  Or if they do it is impossible to order.  I tried to order the replacement part twice.  The first time I ordered model #SP-360,  but found out it didn&#x27;t fit the 5500 model.  Sent it back but did not get refunded for the original shipping charge.  I then ordered #SP-132 replacement part and they sent the #SP-360 saying that replaces the SP-132.  Again I will not get reimbursed for the shipping charge.  I guess the WDF-5500 model is just too old a model to get replacement parts for.  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> This was not my first Remmington shaver, but after going through 3 Smooth and Silky Plus Shavers and a Smooth and Silky Ultra (none of which lasted longer than 6-7 months with normal everyday use), it will most likely be my last.  While I liked the shaver and it didn&#x27;t cause skin irritation like regular razors, I find it VERY irritating that I have to plunk down anywhere from $45-$60 every six months for a new one because the motor dies!  These are not disposable razors but they are produced to be such!</li>
    <li> I have been using my husbands electric razor on and off for years but was basically a manual razor type of gal.  My daughter was ready to start shaving and I didn&#x27;t like the idea of her using the traditional razors, so I decided to buy an electric razor to try on myself before letting her use it.  I love this shaver - it does take a bit longer to use than a razor but I love the end results.  Plus, the red rash I use to get under my arms is gone.  I like the convenience of being able to shave wherever and whenever I want - not just in the shower.  I feel more confortable with my daughter using this shaver too.  I&#x27;m about to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Despite its price, this was not a good replacement shaver for an older, noisy electric shaver.  While it performs well when shaving legs, BEWARE as it is very rough on underarms (as the enclosed product brochure warns.)  It will still be necessary to use two shavers.  Additionally, the shaver head foil broke after less than a year.  Back to using the old shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaver!  I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to purchase it over others.  I&#x27;m a stay-at-home mom with a 2 year old, so I don&#x27;t have time to stay in the shower to shave.  I just take my shower real quick, put on some shorts, and sit on the floor in the living room and shave my legs!  My son thinks it&#x27;s wonderful, too!  It works really well, no cuts to worry about, and it cleans up easily.  I find that for me, it works better out of the shower than in.</li>
    <li> Juggling between two jobs, spending time in the shower with a razor or a visit to the spa for waxing, was just impossible.  At this point Remington WDF-5500 was the choice that I gladly welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fantastic product, comfortable to hold, and glides effortlessly giving me a close shave - minus cuts and bruises. Its wet-dry feature appealed to me the most as it gives me the freedom to relax in front of the TV as well as maintain smooth legs.  It is easy to use &amp; clean and I am pleased with its performance, especially in the hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that a perfectionist might not be happy with this shaver as the result is not as good when compared to a razor but for me it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact stand and the storage kit look attractive and the battery also holds good.  I&#x27;m sure the shaver will be very useful for me when I travel as it features a worldwide voltage. It is a great product worth the price for the convenience it offers and the 2-year warranty makes it an attractive buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having experienced the comfort of Remington WDF-5500, now I find it hard to say if I will ever go back to normal razor / waxing sessions.</li>
    <li> I can see from other reviews that I am not alone when it comes to bumps, itching and irritation from regular blade shaving.  I absolutely become enraged when I itch after shaving in the shower with a blade.  But electrics just never produced a close enough shave.  But now this model does, beautifully. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that when I click the button to pop open the foil head assembly it is attached to the rest of the shaver by some frighteningly small, weak looking pieces of plastic.  I imagine when something breaks, it will be this vital part.  But, at least the two year warranty is comforting.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall pricey, but excellent results, provided it lasts for at least the 2 year warranty period.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still running strong, haven&#x27;t had any trouble at all with it all.  I know it says it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver but I only use it for dry.  It goes against every grain in my body to carry a battery operated appliance into the shower with me.  The Remington fits nicely in my hand, it&#x27;s easy to grip even in awkward angles.  It seems to keep a charge long enough to finish the shaving task and completes it&#x27;s charge within maybe an hour or two.  The buzz is louder than I&#x27;d like but it works so well I&#x27;m willing to live with that nuisance.  I&#x27;d definitely buy this brand of shaver again, it shaves much closer than I can get with shaving with a disposable twin blade razor, and I don&#x27;t get any of those red burning rashes from razor blades, even with the conditioning strips, they help but still irritate my skin.  I&#x27;ve used this Remington razor long enough, I&#x27;m confident no matter what the angle or surface, I&#x27;m not going to get nicked, that took many times of using before I fully trusted the level of close shave.  My legs feel like silk after shaving!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I had to send the first shaver back but because I have had this shaver before, I knew it was a good one.  So far it is still working and give me a close shave.  Happily satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, there are not many women&#x27;s electric razors on the market.  I replaced my second Remington with this model, after it died after a year of use.  I bought this one just a few months ago, and it has just died.  My first lasted several years.  I guess I&#x27;ll be going back to regular razors, because I am not going to pluck down $40 - $50 every few months to replace a razor.  This shaver was by far the worst... after several uses, it became very noisy, and did not provide as close a shave as my Smooth &amp; Silky Plus that died after a year of use.  Emails to Remington have been ignored.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I had the 3500 before this and I loved it! But it got all smashed up due to a poor packing job on my part. So far the 5500 isn&#x27;t giving as close a shave as the 3500 and the shave isn&#x27;t lasting as long. I mean you can&#x27;t see the hair or anything but you can definitely feel the stubble reappearing after a few hours and you have to spend a longer time going over the same areas. Having said that I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday (You&#x27;re supposed to use it every day for 3 weeks for it to work it&#x27;s best). Also I only do a dry shave. I&#x27;m hoping that, after more use, it will be as good as the 3500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s so convenient and easy to clean. I would NEVER go back to shaving with a razor, EVER!!! It&#x27;s definitely cheaper than razors as well. A good buy.</li>
    <li> Does not shave closely nor thoroughly. I am disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor because of all the reviews.  I found it no better or worse than the one I had before.  You must be very careful if you plan to use on the underarms, even wet with shaving cream.  I like the travel pouch it came with, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  Overall I think a good value.</li>
    <li> My mother bought this for me because she has seen me struggle with so many different ways to remove hair. I have used Nair that burned me terribly, Nads that was a sticky mess, and countless others. This razor worked ok for the first shave, but it was just chewing my hair off.  It was like the blades were dull out of the box. The plastic trim started to come off right away and it&#x27;s so hard to clean. I needed a toothbrush to get anything out of it. Just not good at all. It is now collecting dust with all the other useless hair products. A very expensive paper weight. If only men knew how much trouble we go through just to remove hair.</li>
    <li> As a breast cancer survivor, I was looking for an electric shaver to shave the underarm of my surgical arm, without the risk of being cut, or irritating the skin. I have had the Remington WDF-5500 for five months, and have been pleased with its performance. Be sure to follow the directions for use, and you will have excellent results. I like the ergonomic design,and I keep my shaver in the rechargeable stand, so it is always ready for use. You can use the shaver wet or dry which is also convenient. I recommend this product highly, and hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my wife (at her request). She is very happy with it, so who am I to complain?</li>
    <li> This shaver is  very thorough in shaving legs and underarms. The shave lasts for a couple of weeks. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I used it just a couple times since I got this item 5 months ago. It worked not perfectly, but it was the only electronic shaver I got so I had to live with it. Some day, it just didn&#x27;t want to work. I thought it was out of charge, so I tried to recharge it. But even after recharging, it still did&#x27;t move at all. The worst thing is, it has passed the \\&quot;30 days return\\&quot; period, I can&#x27;t even return it. I so hate this shaver and AMAZON the \\&quot;30 days return policy\\&quot;. The total working hour of this shaver through its whole life was less than 10 mins. Shouldn&#x27;t an electonic item last at least one year?</li>
    <li> I, too, have had health problems and needed to purchase an electric shaver.  Unlike the other reviewers, I have just had lukewarm experiences on the side of &amp;quot;cold.&amp;quot;  I have been using this shaver on a daily basis for about two months now.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, I have to shave my legs in the shower (with special non-scented, hypoallergenic shaving cream... I have been getting razor burn with old stand-bys) or else I get razor burn.  I cannot even shave my underarms in the shower, with shaving cream, because the irritation is just too painful.  &lt;br /&gt;Sure, the razor shaves a bit faster than a normal manual razor, but even after weeks of use, it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close.  Legs never really feel smooth, and stubble is visible in a matter of hours.  I am stuck shaving every day, versus every 3-4 days with a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other electric shavers and, unfortunately, this one is about the best.  Right now I am banned from using regular razors, but let me tell you: I&#x27;d go back in an instant if I could.</li>
    <li> So I waited until I had very long and thick leg hair before I used this shaver the first time (on Monday). It took me about 10-15 minutes to totally shave it off (very easily and without any nicks or hair-pulling).  It says to use the shaver every day for the first 3 weeks so that your skin gets used to it etc, and so I did shave again for the next 3 days. No problems at all, today (friday) I went out early and so I didn&#x27;t shave even though I should have.  Now in the early evening, my legs have a slight stubble that you can feel but barely see.  I am a natural redhead so any coarse hairs end up being bright orange when they are long enough to see, and always have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to them even when just starting out as stubble and you can&#x27;t see the color too much yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s been 5 days, the shaver works great on my legs, tried it once on my underarms and did yet some cuts/abrasions but I have a lot of little bumps located there and could understand why it happened.  I prefer to just shave with a blade underarm since it is so easy and quick anyways. I have another Remington product that has the 5 adapter heads that I use for my bikini area and other small trimming stuff so I won&#x27;t review it for that but it seems to work great (as other reviews say as well) and for something with a 2 year warranty, you can&#x27;t really beat that...</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used! I don&#x27;t shave very often but when I do I always have problems with the shaver (The regular kind).. My skin is very sensitive so I always get real itchy after using a shaver and I sometimes get nicks and cuts. So I have been looking for a good shaver for a long time and decided on trying an electric one this time.. Another problem I have is my legs get swollen real bad sometimes and I can&#x27;t shave them because the itching or cuts etc. get real bad during that time. But when I got this shaver I wasn&#x27;t expecting to much out of it but I was definitely amazed with it&#x27;s performance. I read and did the instructions it gave me and it was the best shave I had ever had in years! It did not hurt, pull, itch or cut my skin in any way and was very smooth and it was just wonderful and what amazed me even more was that my legs were swollen when I used it and it never hurt me and I got a real close shave without any problems. I have been using it dry but I&#x27;m planing on using it with my skin wet next time just to try it. Also I have used it when my legs were not swollen and it was just as good. I&#x27;m so happy to have a shaver that does not give me any problems. It&#x27;s really wonderful and easy to clean. :)</li>
    <li> My husband bought me a Remington last year...but a less expensive model.  This one...a gift for my daughter...is much nicer!</li>
    <li> I just got this shaver about three weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  Best shave I ever had.  Just wish the battery would last longer.  A full charge only goes three to four days for a complete shave.  Leaves my skin silky smooth.  Have had other rechargeables and they just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I just got this razor this week, and I love it. I had always assumed that it just wasn&#x27;t possible for an electric razor to shave as close as a &#x27;regular&#x27; blade razor; I had never used one that didn&#x27;t leave behind a hint of stubble. But this razor shaves you close and smooth, even in awkward areas like knees and ankles. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price when I consider what I will now save in shaving cream and replacement razor blades.</li>
    <li> This Remington WDF-5500 is a wonderful product.  It glides over smoothely over the legs and gives a very close shave.  I didn&#x27;t cut myself or itch like crazy afterwards.  And you can use it in the shower as well (yeaaaaa!!!).  The noise level was fine- it was not high, unlike the others ones I have used.  I saw no problems with the battery.  I had charged it all night and it worked fine in the morning.  It fits nicely into your hand so its not uncomfortable to hold- very light weight too.  I used warm water and shaving cream to be on the safe side.  However, it works fine with just warm water too- but it is smoother with the shaving cream.  &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t shave with a razor because I get red bumps, razor burns, and when it starts growing back, all I do is itch- let&#x27;s not forget the cuts and bleeding.  And no more waxing for me- OUCH.  This product takes care of all those issues for me and more.  I give it an A+</li>
    <li> As Remington recommends, I waited until I had used this razor dialy for 3 weeks to judge its performance---and then gave it the benefit of the doubt and added 3 weeks more.  I have decided to return the shaver because after 6 weeks these are the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I must shave each and every inch, each and every day if I want no stubble.  I was able to go 3-4 days between shaves with a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I still get red bumps, ingrown hairs, and irritation in my bikini line and armpits, despite experimentation with using the shaver dry, wet, with various shave creams, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I did get more cuts with this shaver than I have with a traditional razor, but that may have been because I had to go over some areas repeatedly to remove all the stubble/hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I will miss about this shaver is the convenience factor ( I could use it while watching TV, not so much water usage from shaving while taking a bath twice a week).  I may try a different brand of shaver and see if this is just a problem with the Remington shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaver I have ever bought, &amp; I have to say that it works really well, especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry. I used to use Nair &amp; I&#x27;d have to wait forever for the stuff to work on my legs &amp; my legs would end up all itchy &amp; red. With the Remington WDF-5500, it&#x27;s fast, easy, &amp; leaves my legs smooth w/o a scratch or razor burn. The only thing bad thing I have to say is that it DOES leave razor burn under the arms, so I stick with Nair when it comes to that since it doesn&#x27;t take as long as the legs to do. Overall, it was a very good buy &amp; I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I got this for my gal and she suffered massive razor burn under her arms. It didn&#x27;t hurt her legs, but it took a while to get all the little hairs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this woman&#x27;s shaver since my Remington WDF-3500 stopped working, which I had used for a few years and I really liked it.  I am pleased with this shaver and it is similar to the 3500 I had been using, however, this one is more expensive, and the price I purchased it for was very reasonable. I have been comparing other women&#x27;s shavers, and  I would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> This can only be used when it is charged and not corded which is what I really wanted but couldn&#x27;t find one, Its not the most powerful but does the job, as long as you leave it charging all the time.</li>
    <li> Here is a women&#x27;s electric shaver that actually works, whether wet or dry.  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve used that comes close to blade smoothness.  I particularly like the small recharging stand, and the fact that the shaver arrived charged.</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant about buying an electric razor - did they really work? I only shave a couple of times a week anyways, but with a new baby I needed something that is easy fast and didn&#x27;t require me to be in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this razor! No pain, smooth legs after one or two passes. I only use it on my legs, and haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet. I love shaving while I&#x27;m hanging in the living room!</li>
    <li> My second Remington and as always I am a satisfied customer of this product.  One has to remember to change out the head occasionally just like any cutting surface it gets dull.  You can order replacements on Amazon.  I actually did not know this until I purchased this one and it was automatically offered to me as an option to purchase at the time I put the item in my basket.</li>
    <li> my wife used it and complain about not to be a great for shaving frecuently, if you understan how women are, please let me know I am just typing</li>
    <li> My old remington died on me after 4 years of loyal service. Instead of replacing the battery, I decided to replace the whole razor in order to upgrade my model. This model gives such a closer and comfortable shave! In fact, I get almost as close a shave with this electric razor than I do with a manual triple blade. I highly recommend it when you need to touch-up your legs or can&#x27;t get into the shower to use a blade. Love it!! The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is due to the fairly loud noise the motor makes. But that seems to be inherent in most electric razors.</li>
    <li> This shaver is essentially &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot;.  It functions and is durable but doesn&#x27;t shave very closely.  If anyone buys one, keep a package of disposable bladed razors on hand as backup.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! Got a staph infection from using the disposable type razors so my doctor advised me to use an electric razor.  Does a very nice job!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the only review available here,  and let me tell you, she was right! I have unbelievably sensitive skin and have been suffering for the last two years everytime I tried to shave or wax. But no more! I was able to get a nice close shave with no irritation, itching or a trip afterward to the dermatologist. Just nice smooth skin. It works well wet or dry, but gives a little closer shave with shaving cream. It&#x27;s a great product and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I chose this shaver because it seems to have the best reputation overall, and I looked at a lot of different shavers on a lot of different websites.  At first I was fairly satisfied with it, it didn&#x27;t shave as close as I hoped it would wet (and definitely not very close dry, but I knew to expect that), and irritated my underarms and bikini line a little, but since I mostly wanted it for dry shaving of my legs I was OK with that.  But after owning it for only about three weeks, I was using it dry and noticed that halfway through it was missing a lot of hairs and just generally not doing a good job.  So I decided to stop and clean it with the little brush it comes with and I hit the button for the flip top head and the whole thing came off!  I was able to get it back on, but I don&#x27;t want that happening all the time so I decided to call Remington to see about having it replaced.  I found out that I have to pay for shipping it to them, which I think is unfair since their product is defective, and the customer service person HUNG UP ON ME!!  I called back the next day and spoke to a much nicer person, but now I am not sure if I want them to replace it or just return it and never have anything to do with them at all.  What if I have to keep paying for shipping it back to them every three weeks?</li>
    <li> I owned my previous Remington Razor for 30 years and finally decided it was time to upgrade to a newer model.  Not because it wasn&#x27;t still working - because it was! But, really only because I wanted a cordless model.  The obvious choice was Remington since my last Remington worked so well for such a long period of time.  I love this new razor even more than the last and recoommend it highly.  It gives a great dry shave (I haven&#x27;t tried it wet) and handles really well.  The only downside I have experienced is that it won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2 days without being put back in the recharge base.  I took it on a weekend trip without the charger and by the time I got home it needed recharging (and I only used it once while I was away).  Other than that, this is a great razor.</li>
    <li> When my trusty WDF-6000 gave up after 3 years of almost daily use I opted for the 5500 as a replacement.  I figured the main difference between the two (other than the colour, obviously) was the fact that the 5500 didn&#x27;t come with a bikini trimmer, which I didn&#x27;t need anyway.  I was wrong.  The 6000 is a vastly superior model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6000 has a trimmer on the back as well as the front so you can go forwards and backwards.  It has a red light to show when the battery is getting low (the 5500 only has the green charging light).  Neither of these features are hugely important.  But the biggest difference is that the 6000 ACTUALLY WORKS.  I had to go over everything three times with the 5500 to get all the missed hair.  It took so long that I was only halfway up the second leg when I ran out of battery.  Even allowing for blunt blades, the 3 year-old battery in my 6000 still lasted long enough to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the main difference is in the rubber strip that lifts and angles the hair into the path of the blade.  I&#x27;m going to try fitting the head of my 6000 onto the 5500 and see if that helps.  Otherwise I&#x27;m going to pay to get the 6000 repaired rather than persist with the 5500.</li>
    <li> While the razor did shave well, it was an old model, not made for over 7 years, and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I have returned it and now am waiting for a full refund.  I have since bought a different shaver from Panasonic.</li>
