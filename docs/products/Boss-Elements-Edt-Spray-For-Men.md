      <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
      <li>This is the original HUGO Element, and I refuse to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>FAST and PLEASED with everything.</li>
      <li>The deliver was really fast and the product was ok</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Fine, i like so much the smell</li>
      <li>I like Hugo products and this one smells great, crisp and clean and nothing heavy.</li>
      <li>Cologne smells fresh.</li>
      <li>A LOT OF FUN,</li>
      <li>Fresh linen.  </li>
      <li>cologne is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It was everything I expected, really good fragrance, that&#x27;s why I ordered 2.</li>
      <li>First: Took 2 weeks to get in my door when said that was going to take one week.&lt;br /&gt;Second: I&#x27;ve already had this Before</li>
      <li>Love the smell, husband wears it daily over others he owns.  </li>
      <li>Another pro from this particular seller is that&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered some cologne online before and when I got it, it was all wrapped nice like it was brand new just to open it and</li>
      <li>Very acidic.</li>
      <li>You can tell its a knock off of the real cologne</li>
      <li>If you really like this Boss, get from the store.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s fresh, but not heavy or musky.</li>
      <li>VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me</li>
      <li>I was wondering why it was so much cheaper on amazon than in stores.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance, very manly for everyday use</li>
      <li>recently purchased from Amazon and I was satisfied with it until I noticed a big difference in the scent</li>
      <li>being in a high quality sprayer (except the cap.).</li>
      <li>that are highly flammable or</li>
      <li>other reviewers have stated though, the smell wears off very quickly and even with 4 sprays (quite a lot, if you ask me), it isn&#x27;t noticeable after a two-three hours.</li>
      <li>fell in love with this cologne in 2006, and a year ago, I discovered it was not available at stores or outlets any longer.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 from separate product listings and was infuriated by the new</li>
      <li>This scent is new to me.  </li>
      <li>so I tried this one since the fragrance seems less strong, but nevertheless pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably purchase it again.</li>
      <li>My wife and son both have very sensitive noses</li>
      <li>and it was almost twice as much as this and in a slightly smaller bottle.</li>
      <li>highly recommend HUGO Element, and only buy this listing.</li>
      <li>Of the 5 who did not, 3 were just being daft, one was a 21 year old blonde punk, and the last was a women with no nose.</li>
      <li>Sweet smell that only requires a small amount.  </li>
      <li>an official retailer like fragrancex.com or something similar their pricing is a few dollars higher but you&#x27;re&lt;br /&gt;going to get a quality product unless they have the same thing.</li>
      <li>ive had this scent for about 5 years now and bought a new bottle on amazon because i thought it would be cheaper, but it ended up being different from the other Hugo Boss Elements ive bought in stores.</li>

<li> and Its was awsome because the fragrance last for a long time.</li>

<li> &lt;br /&gt;it smells awful because obviously it&#x27;s expired and didn&#x27;t smell the way it was suppose to, but this seller (at least for this cologne)&lt;br /&gt;came and smelled the way it is suppose to, new and great.</li>
<li> Maybe watered down?  </li>

<li> Personally my biggest thing for cologne is that I like it at least a little bit and have girls&lt;br</li>
<li> Slight musk, not over-powering, and a bit</li>
<li> To my blissful surprise, Amazon sold it and slightly cheaper than when I purchased it in store.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m not going to say its fake because there can be factors that are affecting the product, such as the time its been with Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> At least not in my region.</li>
<li> A bit weak.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like Hugo products and this one smells great, crisp and clean and nothing heavy. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Hugo Element has an amazingly wonderful scent.  Fresh linen.  If you want to wear an EDT, but not smell like \\&quot;cologne guy\\&quot;, this is an excellent one - you will smell clean and fresh, not overbearing.  The only problem is the horrid longevity - lasts about 2 hours tops.  But this is an excellent fresh scent that should be in anyones collection.</li>
    <li> First: Took 2 weeks to get in my door when said that was going to take one week.&lt;br /&gt;Second: I&#x27;ve already had this Before and Its was awsome because the fragrance last for a long time. I dont know if that one is a FAKE HUGO BOSS or something, but the smell lasts for 10minutes then its gone.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but in my opinion was a BAD Purchase... SO, Dont Buy It.</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected, really good fragrance, that&#x27;s why I ordered 2.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good! Very acidic. You can tell its a knock off of the real cologne</li>
    <li> Fast and effective buy good sales people, perfume&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100% original&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Element By Hugo Boss For Men Edt Spray 3.0 Oz by HUGO BOSS</li>
    <li> this is what my step son wanted and he got it. I like the smell of it so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my asthma and that is why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> A bit weak.  Maybe watered down?  There is better out there.</li>
    <li> The fragrance smells great (feels like spring and makes me want to lay on the grass and daydream).&lt;br /&gt;(This is my review of the product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised Review for Amazon purchase- (I&#x27;m not going to say its fake because there can be factors that are affecting the product, such as the time its been with Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased from Amazon and I was satisfied with it until I noticed a big difference in the scent&lt;br /&gt;(smells similar but the strength and time it stays on is not so great and it has a more acidic smell meaning&lt;br /&gt;it affects your sense of smell in an impactful way and I tried smelling the product my brother had and it just had&lt;br /&gt;a scent that was pleasing for my nose)with a product my brother purchased from a retailer I could smell it&lt;br /&gt;all day. I also noticed the cap was looser than the product my brother bought. The reasons I believe it could be a&lt;br /&gt;real product and not an imitation is the quality of the box it came in with the box tight cellophane wrap and the&lt;br /&gt;product being in a high quality sprayer (except the cap.). Not going to say this will be given to all purchasers but it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers Beware!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you think why couldn&#x27;t I just get a refund or exchange, its because the \\&quot;return exchange policy doesn&#x27;t allow&lt;br /&gt;liquids that are highly flammable or hazardous\\&quot; I could however contact hugo bosses manufacturing itself but that&lt;br /&gt;process would be painstaking so I just switched the Amazon bought one with my brothers. I&#x27;d recommend purchasing&lt;br /&gt;from an official retailer like fragrancex.com or something similar their pricing is a few dollars higher but you&#x27;re&lt;br /&gt;going to get a quality product unless they have the same thing. I would&#x27;ve been one of the guys leaving a 5 Star Feedback&lt;br /&gt;if I didnt have a comparison (I could&#x27;ve went out to a retailer like Sephora and compared but I already had one&lt;br /&gt;to compare it with so that information is for anyone wanting to do that)luckily I did.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind getting a hit or miss product then buy it on Amazon.&#x27;t mind getting a hit or miss product then buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like da smell but i dnt think dis is jst a clone of hugo boss its good but its gt dat cheap intimation smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne on and off for about five six years now and I have quite a selection of name brand stuff.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is by far my favorite. Personally my biggest thing for cologne is that I like it at least a little bit and have girls&lt;br /&gt;like it a lot. This is my favorite because I personally love the smell and I do get a lot of compliments on it from girls and&lt;br /&gt;even older ladies, lol. I would recommend this to anyone and especially at this price. I used to by this at Sephora in the&lt;br /&gt;mall and it was almost twice as much as this and in a slightly smaller bottle. Another pro from this particular seller is that&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered some cologne online before and when I got it, it was all wrapped nice like it was brand new just to open it and&lt;br /&gt;it smells awful because obviously it&#x27;s expired and didn&#x27;t smell the way it was suppose to, but this seller (at least for this cologne)&lt;br /&gt;came and smelled the way it is suppose to, new and great. So check it out, you can take my word for it or try something else, your choice. Later guys.</li>
    <li> ive had this scent for about 5 years now and bought a new bottle on amazon because i thought it would be cheaper, but it ended up being different from the other Hugo Boss Elements ive bought in stores. the bottle from amazon faded within an hour or so and has a slightly more acidic smell</li>
    <li> Nice smell but not kinde what I except from boss had many boss perfumes and much nicer smells but still ok.</li>
    <li> Of all the cologne I have adorned, I have found HUGO Element to be the best. Slight musk, not over-powering, and a bit sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with this cologne in 2006, and a year ago, I discovered it was not available at stores or outlets any longer. At least not in my region. To my blissful surprise, Amazon sold it and slightly cheaper than when I purchased it in store. Now here is the crazy part. The Element they sell online has a different scent. I bought 2 from separate product listings and was infuriated by the new fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowe and behold, I found this listing and saw a review of someone else who mentioned this smelled like the original! I immediately purchased this, and joy to the king, she was right. This is the original HUGO Element, and I refuse to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove a point to my friends, I actually have asked 52 strangers on the street, ages varying from 14 to 67, what they thought of the cologne. 47 of these lasses and ladies approved. Of the 5 who did not, 3 were just being daft, one was a 21 year old blonde punk, and the last was a women with no nose. Okay, I may be exaggerating, she wasn&#x27;t a punk. Oh, and the last one did have a nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend HUGO Element, and only buy this listing. The rest are frauds, I tell you.</li>
    <li> Fake, fake, fake! I was wondering why it was so much cheaper on amazon than in stores. Well, it&#x27;s not the same. The sell is a little similar, but it won&#x27;t last over an hour. If you really like this Boss, get from the store.</li>
    <li> Cologne smells fresh. I wish they still carried it on Amazon. I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> My friend showed me this perfume and I really liked. So I bought one. The smell is really good and lasts many hours. I like using in the night.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item as well as the service. Would definitely order again. FAST and PLEASED with everything.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, fast ship.</li>
    <li> The sensation of this colonge is great</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Items meet description.</li>
    <li> First, this smells amazing. It&#x27;s a great, masculine blend of cedar and citrus that&#x27;s fresh, but not heavy or musky. It&#x27;s great for the office - or for whatever. I really do love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have stated though, the smell wears off very quickly and even with 4 sprays (quite a lot, if you ask me), it isn&#x27;t noticeable after a two-three hours. I don&#x27;t want to overwhelm anyone with a scent, but if you can&#x27;t smell it at all, that&#x27;s underwhelming at best - if not completely pointless.</li>
    <li> Great smelling fragrance! Nice price also will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good seller.</li>
    <li> this perfect thank you</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, very manly for everyday use</li>
    <li> This scent is new to me.  Got a snail mail flier and tried this.  Sweet smell that only requires a small amount.  Many compliments.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, husband wears it daily over others he owns.  Would purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Can only find this cologne online now, and amazon sells it at a great price.</li>
    <li> GOOD ，I LIKE It VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me A LOT OF FUN,I&#x27;LL RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!NICE NICE GREAT</li>
    <li> My wife and son both have very sensitive noses so I tried this one since the fragrance seems less strong, but nevertheless pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good product.</li>
    <li> Very clean smell. This stuff is great! Hugo Boss makes the best cologne available. I like to use it for work because its not too strong.</li>
    <li> My favorite and good as aspected. I am putting it on every day and enjoying it, recommend this for every Guy who likes parfumes, it is an must have item in your assortiment of parfumes</li>
