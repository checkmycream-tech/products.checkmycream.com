      <li>SO SO SO HAPPY!!!</li>
      <li>Beautiful effect!  </li>

      <li>I am also impressed that I didn&#x27;t need any product (although I did use a heat protectant).</li>

      <li>I was floored how great it worked!</li>
      <li>It looks great!  </li>
      <li>The curls I get look awesome</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how perfect they are; got loads of great curls.  </li>
      <li>good decision!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
      <li>If you want to spend hours making your hair look like you just rolled out of bed (and not bedhead in a good way!)</li>
      <li>I loved the idea, the curls, the amount of curlers, the traveling case, everything!  </li>
      <li>Plus the best part was that I got a really good deal on it.  </li>
      <li>and I had beautiful curls and wavy body.</li>
      <li>Everything fits beautifully in the case.  </li>
      <li>and it worked beautifully.  </li>
      <li>and I have beautiful cascading curls everywhere.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Some people may of had a great experience with this product, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>and they were great.  </li>
      <li>Great product...</li>
      <li>and this just does not curl it great</li>
      <li>Really great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that my experience was everything I hoped for.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>could see this as a great product for SOMEONE ELSE doing your hair for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really a great product.</li>
      <li>these rollers have been a great addition to my working toy</li>
      <li>best thing is that my 11-year-old can use it by herself and get nice resutls.</li>
      <li>product itself is well made and comes in a very nice zippered travel case.</li>
      <li>i get very nice spiral curls.</li>
      <li>Title saids it all, they are really amazing!</li>
      <li>One set will be perfect for most.  </li>
      <li>Be sure you take the time to watch the video and read the instructions because it truly makes a difference in getting the best outcome.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not as good.  </li>
      <li>I get superior curls with my styling wand and with my hair straightener.</li>
      <li>(good luck with that).</li>
      <li>So, if I ever want good, all-over curls, I&#x27;ll have to use all the clips, then pin the curls, while they reheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good device, says my wife.</li>
      <li>You Tube has some good user videos as well</li>
      <li>If you need curls in 5 to 10 minutes this set isn&#x27;t for you because if you rush it you won&#x27;t get as good of a results you want.</li>
      <li>(If you used product now would be a good time to wipe that product off with a damp towel before it builds up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>do the rest of your look take them out and you are good to go!!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Soo</li>
      <li>The Topstyler works good on my hair.  </li>
      <li>That tells me something there, it takes practice, aka there is a technique, and not everyone is good at it automatically.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You Tube has some good user videos as well</li>
      <li>I loved the curls.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!!!</li>
      <li>Best amazon purchase I have ever made (loyal amazon shopper since 2009)</li>
      <li>So yes, I think these are worth a try if  you need curls and volume, but they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
      <li>It is great though this curly for when I want to put my hair up in a top pony tail.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have to be perfect... as long as you have the ends tucked in, they should form perfectly well.</li>
      <li>Love the topstyler works great and my clients also love the outcome of the curls!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and i really love it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>Was my first experience perfect?  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and offered at a great price.  </li>
      <li>easy to use and with great results.</li>
      <li>I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t work well, since I didn&#x27;t have amazing hair to begin with like, all the models do.</li>
      <li>and it did an amazing job.  </li>
      <li>This smoothed out the frizz, gave me really nice volume and body, and was amazing for taming my misbehaved side bangs.    </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I purchased them from Amazon for an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>When I ran a comb through it, I got some amazing body and waves, princess hair, if you will.</li>
      <li>It looks nice</li>
      <li>what I have also found helpful is have a headband or hat or some hair clips handy to use if it doesn&#x27;t come out how you wanted.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I didn&#x27;t have ANY product in my hair when I tested these, and they curled up really nicely.  </li>
      <li>The curls that it makes are nice bouncy spirals.</li>
      <li>and I am still loving my TopStyler.</li>
      <li>really feel this are a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>When I was clipping my daughter&#x27;s hair, this was an issue, when she did her own, she had no problems.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll be about 4 minutes for them to all warm up again</li>
      <li>Full body with great looking bouncy curls.</li>
      <li>Curl looks great immediately but falls quickly.</li>
      <li>I found it very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use as well.</li>
      <li>my soft supple perfectly shaped &#x27;pin curls&#x27; ..</li>
      <li>22 bucks + free shipping is a good price, but had to buy seperate comb set &amp; totaly</li>
      <li>But if I want those nice, springy curls I imagine it&#x27;s going to take me a lot more time to do it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the curlers three times now, but not with great success.  </li>
      <li>think if you have very fine hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No more burning my fingers with curling irons.  This is easy to use and curls in no time. Get it.</li>
    <li> Purchased these after seeing an infomercial on TV.  Doesn&#x27;t really work as well as it looks on TV.  I have thick, coarse Asian hair and needed something that would hold my hair and I thought I had found it.  Not really here.  Pretty expensive for the results you get, at least for my hair.  I would pass on these next time.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this product. I&#x27;m a clutz around hair products and am no where near ambidextrous enough to do anything with my opposite hand or behind my head. So when a product comes out that I could possibly use with my eyes closed, I have to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to heat up. And when they do they are HOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger twirling your hair is not as easy as it looks! OMG! With stick straight, fine hair, my ends were screaming to pop out from my little fingers. It took effort to hold onto my ringlets and try to shove them in between majorly hot clamps. My ends rarely made it in between the clam shells as they would almost always pop right back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clamshells did not hold hair very securely if your hair is thin/fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not enough clamshells to do an entire head of hair, no way to purchase additional clamshells for time being without buying an extra Topstyler. (Again, the wait for new shells to heat up was also very long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No consistency in curls. Mine were just everywhere in all directions. However that could be due to my inexperience with finger twirling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t break any but I&#x27;ve heard tons of horror stories from people who have dropped clamshells and the ceramic broke into a dozen pieces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if anyone feels this way but I found the clamshells to be flimsy on my head. They flop around a lot and don&#x27;t rest on my head well like rollers would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last, just way too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part looks and feels like a solidly made product. The ceramic shells breaking if dropped seems like something unavoidable since it is, well, ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you manage to get a good looking curl, it could last until your next shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see this as a great product for SOMEONE ELSE doing your hair for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair didn&#x27;t feel damaged at all with this product.  Pure ceramic really does do a nice job of not burning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I was better at twirling my hair and holding it I could eventually find this a great product that is fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Higher learning curve. Probably not great for anyone who&#x27;s got problems with dexterity in hands. However it&#x27;s a nice idea with great potential for someone doing someone else&#x27;s hair not own.rning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I was better at twirling my hair and holding it I could eventually find this a great product that is fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Higher learning curve. Probably not great for anyone who&#x27;s got problems with dexterity in hands. However it&#x27;s a nice idea with great potential for someone doing someone else&#x27;s hair not own.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me last Christmas (Dec 2011) I was a bit surprised he bought me one since I was satisfied with my revlon tourmaline ceramic hair curlers that I have in 1/2 and 1 1/2 inch.. He said it takes me a long time to do my hair with those but It doesn&#x27;t really bother me. If you have thick, med-long hair like I do, the c shells will not be enough -even with extra c shells. I find it hard to do the finger curling thing! And the curls doesn&#x27;t last very long! Maybe after an hour it would sog and be in your natural hair again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It takes about a minute to heat up and then your all set to go. It takes a little practice to use, but one you figure it out it&#x27;s amazing. The curls that it makes are nice bouncy spirals. My parents were laughing at me because of how bouncy the curls are. If you are someone who needs a lot of time to curl your hair, this product will help you cut down on the time. It&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product , but regular hot rollers really do a MUCH better job.  Leaves my hair messy looking.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional hairstylist; however, over the years I have become fairly adept at using a variety of tools and products to style my fine but curly hair.  All have which worked exactly as expected and advertised.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It does not work.  I tried the \\&quot;risk free\\&quot; trial.  Everytime I called to return it, the person offered to send me \\&quot;something else\\&quot; that would make the Topstyler work appropriately.  By the time I figured out that none of the \\&quot;something elses\\&quot; worked, I was stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the curls are beautiful.  THEY DO NOT LAST!!!!!!!!!  It does not matter if there is humidity or not.  The curls will last 15-20 minutes.  That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;What really ticks me off about this is I absolutely love the InStyler which is made by the same company.  NO COMPARISON WHATSOEVER!!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product!  I have thick, fine, straight hair that is hard to curl.  I usually use hot rollers, curling spray, and a dash of hairspray to curl my hair.  I thought these looked neat and would be healthier for my hair.  At first using them was a bit difficult, but after 2 tries I mastered the technique.  So I sprayed my hair with curl holding spray, put them in, left them in for about 45 minutes to fully cool and set the curl....exactly like I do with my hot rollers.  Then I took them out and used hairspray.  The curls were wonderful!  Unfortunately, every single time I used them the curls fell out within the hour.  I tried different styles, more hairspray, a half a can of hairspray, less curlers, more curlers...and to no avail.  I am so sad...I loved the idea, the curls, the amount of curlers, the traveling case, everything!  But if they dont produce a curl that lasts, I have to return them.</li>
    <li> these rollers have been a great addition to my working toy collection!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them everyday on some clients with longer hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also use the instyler and Velcro rollers alot!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo19Z6LENVKJBX]]I have seen a lot of negative reviews about this product AFTER I purchased it. Now this didnt deter me, and make me want to send it back. So first, a little bit of info about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 32yo caucasian female. My hair is just past the shoulders in the front, and longer in the back with long layers. I use Alba shampoo, and conditioner (the Plumeria one), and my after washing products are all from Moroccan Oil (the Original moroccan oil, the curl cream *also works for wavy like mine*, and the hairspray. My hair is considered wavy at most.&lt;br /&gt;I used 7 shells today. 5 on the top. 3 straight down the middle top, and 2 on each side of the middle, and two underneath by the ears.&lt;br /&gt;While waiting I read reviews, and was growing nervous. Since I am typing just before it is time for me to head out the door to go to work; I was REALLY nervous and thinking I would have to go to work today with a pony tail. Fortunately, It came out pretty well! I was rather impressed over how easy it was, and how soft the curls came out (I only did the 2 finger).&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy my video.</li>
    <li> I am a busy professional who was looking to buy the T3 or Calista hot rollers to throw a few rollers in to save time in the morning.  Instead I got talked into this stupid thing, which I should have known better than to buy.  Unless you have tons of time and are looking to have stupid looking kinks at your scalp because these clips are simply too heavy and rather than getting volume at the roots, they flop over and make your hair flatter, then go for it.  If you, like me, went in to buy a nice easy set of big rollers, then stay clear.  I spent 30 minutes trying to straighted out the kinks and made myself late for work.  I am not giving it another try or having more patience, this is not what I was looking to buy and they will never give me the look or the efficiency of rollers.  The worst invention ever, period.  About as easy to use and as great of results as those stupid twisty sticks from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I tried my Topstyler for the first time this morning.  The first time!!!  My hair came out better than it ever has.  It looks great!  I am so excited and thrilled with this product.  I have had the Instyler wand for years and love it too.  But these curls are fantastic and it was so easy.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me....I am just a normal (58 year old) and this was easy as pie.  Reminded me of when my Mother used to make pin curls all over her head held in place with bobby pins.  Plus the best part was that I got a really good deal on it.  I wanted it when it first came out and cost like $150.  Just got it for a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m off to work now....gonna shake my curls and say &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist so when i saw this infomercial i was very skeptical, but also curious. Since I&#x27;m able to get discounts on products like this, i decided \\&quot;why not try it out?\\&quot; if I&#x27;m unhappy, I can always return it. It&#x27;s SO easy to use, you can create different size curls depending on the look you want (also comes with a dvd on how to use) it makes my hair so silky, soft, shiny, and bouncy! The curls stay in for a long time, I did my hair for New Years Eve, fell asleep and STILL woke up the next day with curls, I brushed it out and added a little frizz control product to it and it looked great! I LOVE Topstyler, I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for it at first, but you pay around the same price for a straightener (a good one) right?! For me it was absolutely worth the money I paid for it, This is a purchase I would definitely make again. I recommend Topstyler to anyone who loves their hair!!</li>
    <li> The shells produce a different type of wave, more like s pin curl than a large curl. Good device, says my wife.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product. Curling irons totally fry my hair, but this is so much more gentle on my hair and lasts SO much longer. Got it at Super Target for $99.99, plus there&#x27;s no shipping (duh).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe everything you read. Some people may of had a great experience with this product, but I didn&#x27;t. I tried doing everything to make my hair look like the person in the DVD. No matter what, I had terrible results. It is not worth dropping 120 bucks on this product, for one, that it&#x27;s 20 bucks cheaper at Target or Walmart, and two, what you&#x27;re getting isn&#x27;t worth the money. If you want curly hair, stick with the rollers. It&#x27;s a lot easier then trying to perfect your finger twirling.</li>
    <li> Curl looks great immediately but falls quickly. Its an easy method but not a lasting curl. I prefer my curling wand.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever looked at the video, count how many curlers they use in the infomercial.  They use somewhere around 25-30.  I asked the company and extra clam shells will run you around $40 a set.  Not good.  You might need three sets for a lot of long hair.  Having studied the video tips, I didn&#x27;t do too badly for my first try.  Yes it will take practice, but so do all hot curlers...I mean the clips on hot curlers are super frustrating, so I didn&#x27;t find this any worse for sure.  Most of the curls flattened out very nearly right away...so that was disappointing.  You might also try looking on ebay because you might get a better deal on a gently used set.  All in all, I had higher hopes, but they don&#x27;t work any better than standard hot curlers.  I sure wish they did.  I&#x27;m glad they do for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my hair is a combination of straight on the outer layers and wavy on the underneath layers and it is fine, thick and past shoulder length.  With long hair, you can&#x27;t a very large section or it won&#x27;t fit in the curler...which means you need a lot of dang clam shells.</li>
    <li> I tried these out for the first time last night and well, I dunno how I feel about them. It was really difficult trying to curl my hair myself with my fingers and then quickly clamp the curl without it unraveling. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they&#x27;re not all bad. They heated up fast, I only had to leave them on my hair for like 5-10 minutes (I had to cause there weren&#x27;t enough of them and I had to keep putting them back in the heating unit to do the rest of my hair), the curls lasted all day long without any hairspray...but none of them were consistent. Every curl looked different, weird, and wonky. Some were tight, some were loose, some were crimped funny. The lack of c-shells is really the biggest problem for me. I have shoulder length, really thin hair and there was only enough to do half my head. I&#x27;m going to attempt to do Victory rolls with them and that will be the true test for me as to whether these are worth $50 or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a lot of work for something that&#x27;s so expensive. For $50 it should curl my hair itself, fix me a sandwhich, and fill my hair with diamonds.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I first saw this product on tv.  I&#x27;ve used hot rollers in my hair for over 20 years, I love the look of big curls and have been looking for a new set to replace my old rollers. I bought these (pricey, but if they worked, I&#x27;m okay spending the money), and rushed home to try them.  First off, despite how easy it seemed on tv, getting the clam shell clips onto my hair was very difficult.  I followed the directions given, and kept trying, but...it just didn&#x27;t work very well.  My hair kept falling out of the clips, and stuffing my hair in them would not result in the a wave.  Ok, so I gave up, gave it a day, and tried again.  I was determined to make these things work, but to no avail.  Maybe my hair was to thick, too much, I don&#x27;t know, but I could not get lovely curls promised.  Ultimately, it was to much work, when I could get the same result with normal hot rollers.  So back they went.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my sister. Works well. We did a quick trial test on my hair and left it in for half the time it was recommended and my curls turned out adorable. I could only imagine what it would look like it we actually kept it in for the total time and actually styled it.  Mine came used and was missing a comb or something. Kinda wish I knew it was used. Oh well.</li>
    <li> my hair is down past the middle of my back with layers and i also have very thick hair and this just does not curl it great and when it did the curl did not hold at all, my hair was flat in 30 min. barrel curl works and holds a lot better for me. sad this did not work. i also attempted to try this 5 times and just was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my hair, but it is down to my back and fairly thick.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is shoulder length and thinner and it worked beautifully.  I do like how quick it is; from the time I plugged it in to the time I took the shells out of her hair, it took 20 minutes.  I also liked that they weren&#x27;t terribly hot to the touch, and my daughter couldn&#x27;t feel the heat at all once they were in place.</li>
    <li> This is just too hard to use.  I&#x27;d rather use rollers.  The technique that you have to practice is just too much to ask from someone paying for an expensive product like this.  My hair was always flipping out of my fingers as I tried to clamp the hot clip over it.  The ends are especially hard to keep in your fingers, likely since my hair is straight, but still frustrating.  I was able to get one beautiful curl that really wowed me, but I just don&#x27;t want the frustration of hair flipping out and fingers getting burned.  When the clips rested near my ear I had to adjust them because they started to burn my skin.  This would be acceptable if they hadn&#x27;t advertised that it won&#x27;t burn you.  Also, if you don&#x27;t do it JUST right, there are crimps in your hair.  Topstyler is going back to Target today.</li>
    <li> I have first learned about the topstyler on an info commercial. Them making it look like its super easy and super flawless , of course it would be a seller to any woman. (or teenager). I bought mine at Bed bath and beyond for $85. Amazon over prices there products at least 10%.&lt;br /&gt;  Do not buy this product if you have medium thick to thick hair. It will not work for you. I have medium--thick hair and when i heated the curlers up for a very long time, I tried to wrap it around my fingers....just like the video said to do. It was really annoying and time consuming when it took 5mins to put on curler in. So finally after waiting for 20mins , I took it out. It was pretty and it looked like a curl , but it was very cinky and pinched looking. Then the curl just decided to uncurl. So I curled it again and this time I put hairspray on it. It still did not give me the &#x27;&#x27;3x longer curls&#x27;&#x27; that i desired. Then I tried on my mom , she has fine hair. It worked great for her hair , but so do regular curlers and irons. It is not worth tampering with and trying to figure our how to do it perfectly. I am taking back the topstyler today!</li>
    <li> my sister got me topstyler last x&#x27;mas and i really love it!  i used to use round brushes to create wavy hair (i have long hair) but the heat from the hair dryer really damage my hair.  with topstyler, i use 7 - 8 c-shells on the loose loop so my hair don&#x27;t get too curly.  after remove the c-shells, i still have to use the large round brush to make it to the wave i like but it only takes 1 min to do so.  it takes a while to get used to it but once you know how to use it, it&#x27;s really easy and fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and come to find out that this product will not work on my hair.  something about the instructions should have been stated in the description.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product. A little hard at first learning how to twist your hair the correct way. Overall good.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the VOLUME &amp; LIFT, that this product delivered, with CURLS and WAVES you can&#x27;t achieve, with a perm or a curling iron, however, YOU HAVE TO SPRAY THE SECTIONS, before you&#x27;ll. do the FINGER WRAP, ( which takes practice. ).  :-) :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Although I had to use 30 SHELLS, for my MASSIVE THICK HAIR, it&#x27;s still worth it.  :-) :-)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and offered at a great price.  Haven&#x27;t begun to unlock the full potential of this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this product! I&#x27;m so glad I ignored the bad reviews and took a chance on these. I have really long hair, which is not only time consuming to curl with an iron, but it usually doesn&#x27;t hold long. I was so excited when these arrived this morning that i skipped the instructional dvd and tried them out right away. I had to re-wrap a few sections, but overall I didn&#x27;t have that hard of a time. I was done setting my hair in about 20 minutes (a huge improvement from the 2 hours I spent curling it with a curling iron yesterday). It came out beutiful, so I can&#x27;t wait to see the results as i get more practice and actually watch the video. My hair came out bouncy, and soft and lots of curl. it&#x27;s still just about as curly 9 hours later, and I didn&#x27;t get the frizz I usually get when I use rollers or curl smaller sections. they heat up pretty fast (about 6 minutes for the unit, and then a minute or two to heat up additional clips,)and cool down quite fast too. I am also impressed that I didn&#x27;t need any product (although I did use a heat protectant). it also comes with 5 extra large clips so you get 15 total. I think this product really does perform as well as it is portrayed to in the infomercial. It seems to me that all the negative reviews revolved around ease of use, but for me it was very easy to use, I have a much harder time using hot rollers than i had using these clips, so I don&#x27;t see where the issue is. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at wrapping the curls as I continue to use it, but I still got alot of compliments on my hair today. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Topstyler works good on my hair.  I did not receive the comb that was supposed to be with it and no information as to who to contact about it.</li>
    <li> First off, this takes practice!  Many of the other reviews I&#x27;ve seen complain about the product but I would have too if I&#x27;d stopped at the first or second try! It isn&#x27;t complicated, per say, but it&#x27;s a simple motion that takes practice to execute quickly and effectively.  The product itself is well made. It heats up in about 3-5 minutes? You wrap sections of hair around two fingers and then tuck the curl you&#x27;ve created into the heated shells. They can be a little hot at times but never enough to burn your fingers by mistake while you&#x27;re putting your hair up. After anywhere from 4 - 10 minutes your let them loose and you&#x27;ve got great curls!  I used to curl with a flat iron and was never bothered by it but I was astounded by how soft my hair was while still holding curl! Some complain that there aren&#x27;t enough C-shells but if you replace them as you go (it comes with 5 more than fit on the unit) and then use the two or three from the beginning (you&#x27;ll be able to take them out by then) you have enough. Only a very light spritz or two of hair spray and I&#x27;m good to go! I haven&#x27;t gone crazy with experimenting but I am now comfortable with the standard curl and can do it in about 15 minutes.  Overall, it&#x27;s a little pricy, but I haven&#x27;t touched my flat iron since I go it! Practice, practice, practice, and you&#x27;ll find it worth your while.  *If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this here, price compare first! This is the most expensive listing I&#x27;ve seen so don&#x27;t be taken for a sucker!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to use at all, nor did it have near enough clips to do your whole head! I ended up returning it!</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for more than five minutes...especially if it&#x27;s humid outside.  (And it&#x27;s ALWAYS humid outside.)  After reading the reviews I crossed my fingers and took a chance on this product.  I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID!!!  I watched the DVD - TWICE - to make sure I understood the process, then dove right in.  The Topstyler took about 5 minutes to heat up, then it took me about 6-7 minutes to create the finger curls and secure them in the C-shells.  (Since I have fine hair, I had more than enough C-shells.)  After about 30 minutes I removed the C-shells, shook the curls loose and was amazed at my full, bouncy curls.  I played with them.  I used my fingers to brush through them...several times.  I slept.  The next morning I STILL had curls!  It&#x27;s now 24 HOURS LATER and the curls have \\&quot;relaxed\\&quot; into a natural wave gradually throughout the day, yet still full of body -- and I did not use any styling/finishing spray before creating the finger curls.  For someone like me that likes the look of curled hair, but has hair that doesn&#x27;t want to cooperate...the Topstyler is a dream come true.  For the first time in my life I feel like I have gorgeous, \\&quot;model-like\\&quot; hair.  Was my first experience perfect?  NO.  Did I look like the model on the DVD or infomercial?  NO.  I had one curl that the ends got twisted funny, and another that wasn&#x27;t as tight as most...but this was my FIRST experience with a new product and process.  And this process IS different!  Think back to the first time you used a curling iron or hot rollers...did you look like the model on the box?  Or did you have crimps from clamps and clips and perhaps even a \\&quot;rogue\\&quot; curl?  (I&#x27;ve been using curling irons and hot rollers for about 3 decades and I still get lines, crimps, and rogue curls.)  I consider my first experience with the Topstyler a success, and am looking forward to perfecting my technique.  TIPS FOR SUCCESS:  ~ Watch the DVD!!!  ~ If your hair tends to frizz, be careful about playing with the curls too much (or have your favorite frizz control product on hand)  ~ Practice!!!  ~ Google \\&quot;Topstyler Look Book\\&quot; for additional finger wrap techniques and styles in a downloadable PDF format</li>
    <li> These are extremely easy to use. I have really (really) long hair, so using a regular curling iron takes HOURS; it&#x27;s a headache. I love that I can pop these suckers on and do my make-up, or get ready. I&#x27;ll never go back to my curling iron. :)</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from a friend and I loved it so much that I bought it as a gift for someone!</li>
    <li> Was not a fan of these.  I recently cut my hair short and wanted something to produce more waves as opposed to curls.  I think this might be okay on longer hair.  They seem to be too heavy if there is too little hair to clasp.</li>
    <li> The Topstyler is easy to use and I like the idea of not putting direct heat on my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have straight hair that NEVER wants to curl. This curls my hair easily and it stays! Best amazon purchase I have ever made (loyal amazon shopper since 2009)</li>
    <li> i figured with the appropriate adapter it should work anywhere in the world, but guess what - i was wrong! i&#x27;ve purchased many, many electronic items in the US and never had this problem before. the auto-safety shut off does seem to work though, because it started blinking green and then stopped again immediately.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a product that could give me nice loose curls without the damage of a curling iron. This is not that product! It may work on other hair types, but for those who have thick ethnic hair like I do, this is a waste of time. The curls are not well defined and a bit messy. I&#x27;m not impressed. Tried it over and over, and convinced this may only work for certain hair types (not ethnic). This is nothing like the instyler which will work on most hair types.</li>
    <li> Shells don&#x27;t stay fix at my hair, they felt, then I took the product to my staylist to help me put them without any better results, as soon as I get my car two of them felt.</li>
    <li> I have ling thick hair, and would need to buy a second set to have any luck at all in getting my hair curled. What I did was curled the top of my head with the heated C shells, let them cool and duckbill clipped them, Then I curled the back and let them cool. Took much longer than I would like, and the effect was less than stellar. Will play around a bit more but will probably return.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine, straight, and thin, and it&#x27;s all one length to the chin.  These curlers really does give fine hair volume.  That&#x27;s one thing I like about it.  However, my hair just comes out kind of wild looking.  I&#x27;ve used the curlers three times now, but not with great success.  I think I need more curlers or maybe a second set.  I like to put five curlers on the sides and top of my head, and about 7 on the back, but this set has only 10 shells.  The shells are heavy and hang much lower than where I originally put them, which I don&#x27;t like.  This set does not come with the DVD, the special comb, or the extra curlers, like I&#x27;ve seen other places, and I was expecting at least the comb since the directions say to use it.  I&#x27;m not giving up on these  yet - but I do t hink I&#x27;ll need an extra set to really make this work just for the extra curlers.  I know I could take some curlers out and let them heat up again, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very practical.  And I know I could buy extra curlers on eBay or somewhere - I&#x27;m working on that.  I need more of the small shells since I like curly hair.  So yes, I think these are worth a try if  you need curls and volume, but they aren&#x27;t perfect.</li>
    <li> I like the curls it makes, but I find that I only have enough c-shells (10) to do the top part of my head.  I am still forced to use a curling iron to curl the rest of my hair.  The unit also takes longer to heat up than I expected.  It is really not a time saver as I was hoping for, but the curls do last.  I wish there was a place I could find additional c-shells, then I think I would be happier with the product if I could put all my hair up at once.  Until that time-I would not recommend this product-sadness :(</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to get this to make the Hunger Games &amp;#34;Katniss braid&amp;#34; like she had seen on Youtube. I expected this to be very expensive, but it was only $22. When it arrived, I was surprised to see that all items included were very well made, including the case. There&#x27;s plenty of space in the case to store everything. Extra 5 shells were included making it 15 total, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is that my 11-year-old can use it by herself and get nice resutls. There was a CD included, and Youtube and the manufacturer&#x27;s website had a lot of tips too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips: We&#x27;re looking for a texturizing product to make hair less slippery, it would make using the Topstyler even easier.&lt;br /&gt;When you clip the hair around the hairline, make sure the clips are high enough, and not touching the skin, they are hot! When they were above the hairline, no issues. When I was clipping my daughter&#x27;s hair, this was an issue, when she did her own, she had no problems.</li>
    <li> These are pretty easy to master.  My daughter and I were happy with the results after the first try.  Having thick hair, we do need to use the extra shells that come with the boxes available in stores.  I bought this from Amazon due to the lower price but was disappointed when the extra shells and instructions were not included.  You get what you pay for:) I ended up returning this one to Amazon because it only has the 10 shells and we need the 15.</li>
    <li> Michelle&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for my daughter who has fine long hair. It took too long to curl the hair and then the clamps are heavy and pulled once in place.  The curls/waves were disappointing.  I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually way too lazy to leave reviews, but I love these little c-shells so much! My boyfriend bought these for me for my birthday after I mentioned I wanted them. I hadn&#x27;t seen the gimmicky infomercial for them or I probably wouldn&#x27;t have (it&#x27;s so cheesy). After making some practice curls &amp; watching videos to make sure I was clear on its usage, I did my whole head. It took maybe 7-10 minutes to put all the c-shells on the first time and I let them cool while doing my make up. I took them out, shook the curls &amp; finger brushed a bit &amp; they were beautiful! INFINITELY easier than using my curling iron &amp; they stayed much, much better. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this, I highly suggest buying it.</li>
    <li> This is the FIRST product that I can really use with My long hair to get REAL curl that lasts.  I ordered another set .. but I have REALLY long hair.  One set will be perfect for most.  There are no clips to lose like with hot rollers.  Everything fits beautifully in the case.  Heating time is excellent.  Do not hesitate BUY Topstyler!</li>
    <li> Really great. Easy to use , beautiful and natural curves , this hair tool is really one of my favorite</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this topstyler, it meets exactly my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and with great results.</li>
    <li> Love the topstyler works great and my clients also love the outcome of the curls! Totally recommend this for updos or casual curls!</li>
    <li> Title saids it all, they are really amazing! I&#x27;m not a big infomercial person, but after doing a lot of research and watching reviews I thought I would give them a try. I am totally blow away by how much the actually work! I figured I would get bleh results like most other hair curling tools. My hair is naturally pretty straight, I&#x27;ve dyed it most of my adult life and it&#x27;s pretty damaged from all the bad things I have done to it, it is also only a bit longer than shoulder length. I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t work well, since I didn&#x27;t have amazing hair to begin with like, all the models do. I was floored how great it worked! They really are super easy to used. You just heat them up, put them in then do the rest of your look take them out and you are good to go!!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Soo easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*I haven&#x27;t gotten burnt yet&lt;br /&gt;*Comes with extra, large C-Shells so you can do all of your hair&lt;br /&gt;*DOES NOT HURT Hair!!! Everything hurts my hair and these honestly don&#x27;t, they actually make my hair feel softer and look better than not using them!&lt;br /&gt;*Nice container to hold everything with extra storage&lt;br /&gt;*Also comes with a DVD to show you how to use them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ( because there has to be some!)&lt;br /&gt;*When you turn it on, I have to press and hold my &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button for about 2 seconds. It&#x27;s not really a con but I thought mine was defective until held the button longer then I normally would and it worked&lt;br /&gt;*Learning how to style your hair. Sounds silly but since curling my hair has never worked in the past, it has taken me a few bad hair- do&#x27;s to learn the natural wave of my hair to place them so it looks best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really feel this are a wonderful product. I have recommend them to so many people. You can do so many different looks!</li>
    <li> If you have short or medium fine hair this just won&#x27;t work.  It seems like it would be best suited for thick, long hair.  We sent it back the same day we got it.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work on thick or long hair.  if you have thick , long hair, the curls don&#x27;t set in and fall out within an hour,</li>
    <li> I saw the Topstyler Heated Ceramic /styling Shells in a box exactly the same as the one above at Target.  I thought I would receive the same product for $10.00 less, shipping was free.  When it came it was not in the above box and it did not contain 10 large shells plus 5 smaller shells in a drawstring bag and a comb used to help curl into the shell, nor was it rapid heat up as is the one at Target.  It contained 5 large shells, 5 smaller shells and nothing more.  There was no way to get details about this item so I would have known it was not the same though the box and picture of the item looked the same.</li>
    <li> bought as gift for my daughter in law. she requested it, so it will be under our Christmas tree for her.</li>
    <li> This item arrived  attached with an american plug and although I bought an additional adapter in order to use them they still will not work. I wish I had been warned when purchasing them that this was the case.</li>
    <li> I just received these, at a great price on Amazon, and I am very happy with them.  I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews except that maybe those who tried them didn&#x27;t have freshly washed and dried hair.  I tried them with 2 day old hair and they didn&#x27;t work too well but then today washed and blow dried my hair (with my ceramic ion hair dryer) and then used them and they were great.  I left them in while doing my makeup and when I took them out, my hair was curly!  I have middle of the back hair and fine.  I did notice that you have to use more hair in the clip than you would think so that it touches the inside of the clam shell.  It was really easy and next time I will try to take the shells off sooner because my hair was &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;.  It is great though this curly for when I want to put my hair up in a top pony tail.  The curl has lasted all day.  These are easy to use, heat up quick and I like not having to roll over a roller.  The whole kit is really nice quality and I am sure they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> but for me, my fine, thin hair just didn&#x27;t do well with it.  I don&#x27;t think it holds the curl very well and my hair usually does pretty good with curl.  I really wanted it to add volume more than anything and just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.  My hair does better with velcro rollers.  Oh well, I tried.  I&#x27;m returning it.  :(</li>
    <li> It need time to learn how to use and practice.&lt;br /&gt;For straight hair needs hair product help to hold the curve.</li>
    <li> This was disappointing.  First of all I would need two boxes of these to do my hair properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the curl is weak and does not last.  I can usually acheive curls more easily than the average girl.  I have natural curl/wave to my hair.  I can use anything, including the cheapest of the cheap curling irons.  I even tried to use this to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my curls that I did with my iron, and I feel like it took away from my work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed.  I have watched youtube videos where people have gotten much better results.  Not sure why this did not work for me.  I am not a novice, and can usually get my hair to do what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extremely loose curls that do not last, buy this!</li>
    <li> I love this!  I know the reviews are mixed, but for my medium, above the shoulder, poker straight, layer hair....it is perfect.  I get nice waves or curls depending on how tight I make the &amp;#34;hair rolls&amp;#34; and how long I leave the clips in.  I tried it on my daughters super long, straight, heavy, Asian hair.  She got nice waves, but they relax too much with time.  I think it is better for shorter lengths.  She sill likes to borrow it for beachy type waves, but don&#x27;t expect as much curl with super long hair.</li>
    <li> My curls don&#x27;t stay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kinda unhappy about it expected more but ok ...it&#x27;s alright I guesssssss...&lt;br /&gt;Gosh I don&#x27;t know</li>
    <li> I love this machine.  Used for the first time this morning and I have beautiful cascading curls everywhere.  I have blonde,  very fine hair (but lots of it) and it did an amazing job.  I think people are getting to hung up trying to make &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; pin curls.  I was a little concerned because my head looked a hot mess before I took them down.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how perfect they are; got loads of great curls.  I also ordered this model and there were an extra 5 large clamps in the case.  Didn&#x27;t state there were 15 curlers but that&#x27;s what I received.  SO I was able to do my entire head.</li>
    <li> Is very easy to use, very fast, and can be used for curling hair or to give shape and volume The only bad thing is they are only 10 C-shell, I need five more but do not know where to buy</li>
    <li> After ordering and returning because the first did not contant the comb in the manual and the second did not turn on.  The third one  finally worked and had everything.  Yay, no trouble with shipping back and forth either.</li>
    <li> I am a stlying challenged person when it comes to my hair. I also has an arm and shoulder injury which makes using a curling iron very difficult. I thought I would give the Topstyler a try and see if I could easily get the curls I wanted. I got my shipment 2 days ago and plugged then immediately. A quick reading of the instructions and here I go. I have shoulder length hair. I started on the left side of my head, then did the right, then the back. Even did my bangs that are to my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took out the C Shells and I had curls that took me about 10 minutes to set. Ran my fingers through my hair and I had beautiful curls and wavy body. ON THE FIRST TRY!! When I woke up I still had some wave left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did figure out that doing the back made putting in the clips in harder, at least for me, so for today&#x27;s trial I did the back first, then the sides. Even better results. Me the styling challenged individual just did my hair that looks like my hair was styled, that is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 4 stars because I have only used them for 2 days. After I have used them longer I will change my rating accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a great product.</li>
    <li> I got this item off a close out web site with a low (er) price than others, $65 plus $2 shipping ([...]  I had looked at it in several stores, Ulta being the last.  Reading the information listed made me optimistic that I might have actually found a product to not only curl my hair but that could make curl stay in my hair.  I DID!!!!&lt;br /&gt;-I read the reviews and people seemed to either LOVE or HATE this product.  That tells me something there, it takes practice, aka there is a technique, and not everyone is good at it automatically.&lt;br /&gt;-This product takes the idea of a pin curl and transforms it from a old-fashioned idea that works for the general public okay, to a product that is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I took the product out of the box and read all the directions.  Despite reviews telling me to watch the videos before I attempted to use, I ignored that.  I&#x27;ve been dealing with board straight hair my entire life, and attempting all kinds of ways to CURL it, I jumped in feet first.  I didn&#x27;t have time during the week before work to play, so the night before my day off I didn&#x27;t wash my hair.  This is important because hair holds style better if it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; but a day or more dirty.  My hair was on day 4 (I usually wash the night of day 3) and had a heavy amount of oil present (that usually means it is much harder to curl). I remembered instructions to use some sort of product on each strand prior to \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; and clamping.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL THE TANGLES OUT OF YOUR HAIR BEFORE CURLING WITH THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Starting with \\&quot;not clean\\&quot; hair, get all the tangles out.  Decide what \\&quot;product\\&quot; you will use on each individual section as you \\&quot;roll\\&quot; and have it within your reach.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Plug in and turn on the product.  Plan for at least 3 minutes for it to heat up.  I gave it about 10 minutes.  Note:  remove everything combustible (could burn) from the mesh pocket included.  While my unit was heating I flipped it shut (did not zip).  I found out later this kept the heat in better and helped the Topsytler heat quicker.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Using the comb provided section a strand of hair.  Spray with whatever styling product you are going to use.  I use my dominant hand to hold the comb (with my fingers covering the comb teeth-if you don&#x27;t pay attention to this it will cause a problem later and you will have to re-do the curl) and my non-dominant hand to wind the curl.  With my non-dominant hand I grasp the strand as close to the root as possible, leaving room for the first wind or two around the comb.  Wrap the strand around the comb, you can overlap the hair or go down the length of the comb.  You can also twist the strand prior to or during the winding process (really neat spiral effects).&lt;br /&gt;5.  After winding the hair around the comb use the fingers from your winding hand to pinch the curl together from the outside in.&lt;br /&gt;6.  After gathering the curl, turn comb from a parallel position to perpendicular (flipping the curl over completely, upside down).&lt;br /&gt;7.  Remove comb by pulling straight out.&lt;br /&gt;8.  Pick up your shell and replace your fingers where you have pinched the curl together in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;9.  I resprayed product here again lightly.&lt;br /&gt;10. Wait!  I waited for about 12 minutes or until most of the heat was gone from the shells.&lt;br /&gt;note:  my hair is past my breasts (length) but fine.  I only needed to use the shells that fit on the unit in the beginning however after I used one row (one row of the two all the way back so I didn&#x27;t get confused-use the right until gone then use the left).  I used the right side until it was gone and before I started using the left I replaced with the provided additional shells.  When I was done the 6 I had replaced were all hot, ready to be used (even though I didn&#x27;t need them).&lt;br /&gt;11.  Remove shells.  (If you used product now would be a good time to wipe that product off with a damp towel before it builds up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effects:  WOW!!!!!  First I fingercombed my curls.  I have never had my hair respond to any product the way it has with the Topstyler Shells!  My hair was way too curly with only finger combing.  I reached for my wide tooth comb and gently combed.  Beautiful effect!  My husband was just as happy, if not more, with the curls as I was!  He said my hair looked so pretty, and more vibrant, shiny, and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;Four hours later I went back to play with my hair again.  This time I used my hair brush!  Hours later, my hair is still CURLY!  Not permed curly, where you cannot touch (let alone comb or brush) after hair is dry, but soft, brushable, formed curls!  I wish I had found this product so many years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t have used chemicals (perms) to damage my hair when this effect is available.  Let me add that I live in Chattanooga, Tn.  It is hot and humid here.  The humidity alone is normally enough to take whatever body I can put into my hair out very quickly.  Not the Topstyler curls!!!!!  I&#x27;d love to do a commercial for these folks.&lt;br /&gt;My curls will get prettier with practice!&lt;br /&gt;another note:  I did re-roll my right side of my head.  I had problems since this was the opposite from the hand I was using to wind the curls.  I had to \\&quot;figure out\\&quot; the best way to wind my hair based on the hand I used.  Even with re-doing one side my hair turned out beautiful, especially for the first time!  I&#x27;d go out with this style right now!</li>
    <li> When you take the c-shell off, you have a limited time to put hair spray on before it starts to come undone... I also had issues trying to get to the back... Completely, it does save time because for my spiral curler, it takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes. For this it only took 40 minutes, so it did save me 2 hours. I had to redo a couple places, but I suppose once I find all the tricks about this thing, that I will get the hang of it... I heated mine up to high, and it did not damage my hair or anything, so it is safe. Although, I almost got burnt a few times. Only because I was trying to get the c-shell to go were I wanted, and another was in the way and I accidentally bumped it. And no, I did not order from Amazon. I ordered off the internet on a 1 payment only order. Like you can click save 14.99 by doing a bulk payment, and I did that. Mainly because you can get a 2nd 1 for free right now, which does help out. I did not do rapid heat up. And I also ordered online to get the lifetime warranty on the c-shells. I think it is only 9.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 4 uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) do the heat up the top styler - or both... this way when you use the c-shells in 1, you can start on the other.&lt;br /&gt;2.) once heated, grab some hair, and do the 2 finger wrap around.&lt;br /&gt;3.) spray starch spray on it - I don&#x27;t use their sprays. I didn&#x27;t even buy their sprays. But buy starch spray or moose or something at the store, and use whatever you buy to spray the hair once it&#x27;s wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;4.) place the c-shell around it.&lt;br /&gt;5.) wait 10 minutes if you want loose curls, and between 10-20 for tight&lt;br /&gt;6.) take out c-shells. spray with any hair spray you might have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 of these top stylers since it&#x27;s the current offer, but the 2 packs are enough to do my hair with 1 time around, so totally it only takes me between 10-20 minutes now to curl my hair. I have thick hair too, so that&#x27;s like amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one thing I forgot to add, is that I start at the back and work my way to the front. It works easier that way in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! but takes practice curls last all day, you even wake up the next day with curls! So far is not damaging my hair!!</li>
    <li> I have thick but fine naturally curly hair that tends to look more like an 80s perm than nice big curls that I use to have when I was younger.  I am always looking for a way to style my hair that lasts throughout the day without having to flat iron it stick straight or diffuse it hoping that it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy or lose the shape throughout the day.  I was using a 1 1/2 inch curling wand but it requires time and the curls tend to go limp by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these ceramic styling shells for their ease of use, less damaging effect to the ends of my hair, and the more natural look of the curl.  They heat up really quickly and by the time I&#x27;m finished with my whole head (about 7 minutes), I am ready to start removing them.  The only dislike is that at times it will leave a wrinkle at the base of the curl and I still need to prep my hair before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for those with thick but fine naturally curly long hair (middle of the back when straight):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  use a curl enhancing / no frizz product on your hair when wet&lt;br /&gt;2.  blow dry roots and style the top of your hair to achieve smooth style on top&lt;br /&gt;3.  loosely dry rest of your hair taking out some of the curl but not like you would before using a flat iron&lt;br /&gt;4.  separate sections to curl (about the same as you would with a curling iron), wrap your hair around 2 fingers, pull fingers out while pinching curled &amp;#34;pincurl&amp;#34; and clip on shell.  (you may want to roll curl a little closer to your head after removing your fingers)&lt;br /&gt;5.  for a shorter hair style, do a bottom row of curls with top section in a bun, remove bottom clips, hairspray, drop down top section and curl top section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day if curls loosen up, you can wrap the curl around your finger again without the clip and it will go right back to the way it looked after you did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried these on my daughter who has waist length, fine, thick and straight hair.  not sure how easy it will be wrapping around fingers.  Any suggestions to make sure the ends curl?  My hair naturally wraps around my fingers making it simple even when super slippery.</li>
    <li> I was searching for additional c-shells when I came upon the reviews here. I have had my top styler for about a month and I will never leave the house again without using it! First I would like to say that I have short hair. It is bob and just below my ears. It is all one length though. The first 3 days well I did look a little bad but I quickly got the hang of it. I would spend a $100 on these things all day long. To the professional hair dresser that said these aren&#x27;t worth it and the curls don&#x27;t last I really have to chuckle at this. My mom is also a professional hairdresser and when I went to visit for Thanksgiving I told her I was having trouble with them holding curl as well. She quickly gave me some Miracle 10 style cream that I put on my hair when wet and blow dry it. Then she gave me some Redkin heat set that I spray on each piece I am curling. Once I take the clips out then I spray with Joyco hairspray. My curls LAST all day. I also stopped washing my hair everyday so day 2 and 3 look the best. I only put the heat set on my hair on day one of the wash. Now I have hair that rivals Meg Ryans curls and I love it. If you are treating your hair with something that will hold it, you WILL lose the curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a former hairstylist and I got really excited when the Topstyler went on sale on LivingSocial for $59. I strongly prefer the control I have of my curls using barrel and pin curls but, to be honest, I&#x27;m kind of lazy and just don&#x27;t have the patience to wait under a dryer. Of course I plugged it in and used the clips as soon as I got them and I&#x27;m happy to say that my experience was everything I hoped for. My long hair is fine and flat, but also sort of naturally frizzy. This smoothed out the frizz, gave me really nice volume and body, and was amazing for taming my misbehaved side bangs.    A few warnings:    1) It&#x27;s not a miracle product. If you&#x27;re hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl with hot rollers or a set and style, it won&#x27;t magically work with the Topstyler. If you have difficulty with your hair holding curl, I would strongly recommend waiting until the clip is completely cool to remove.    2) I find pincurls super easy because I&#x27;ve been doing them forever and my scalp prefers the clips over heavy hot rollers. That said, you may want to do a youtube search for pin curls or barrel curls for some help if you&#x27;re not experienced. They don&#x27;t have to be perfect... as long as you have the ends tucked in, they should form perfectly well. But learning placement is also important. For example, the angle at which you start your curl will determine the volume that you get: [...]  For those of us that have finicky bangs and parts, this is a god send- you can completely control where you place the clip. How much hair, what angle/direction, etc...    3) If you are having a hard time making the clip stay, you may not be using enough hair or you may not be clipping it close enough to the scalp. If you&#x27;re finding to much kink at the roots, you probably aren&#x27;t getting a good enough hold, either.    4) Don&#x27;t get stuck on the instructions. Play around and see what works for your hair.That&#x27;s the cool thing about these!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it was the same as advertised on the Topstyler website. It is not. It&#x27;s a whittled-down version with just 10 shells and instruction manual and that&#x27;s it. The styling comb, styling guide, and instructional DVD are NOT included. There are versions of this product that includes all the above-mentioned accessories, as well as extra shells. Please read the description carefully before you buy!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick,coarse, processed, with a bit of heat damage form using flat and curling iron for years.I was very apprehensive about buying this product since I hated the InStyler (made by the same company) so much. It takes a lot of getting used and getting comfortable with rolling your hair around your fingers or the styling comb. It took me aboout two tries (batches) to get the tecnique right, and once you get it down, the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray a styling thermal protector on my hair prior to using this product. Once I pin up all my hair,I do my make up or get dressed and by the time I am done the curls are ready. I brush my hair with my fingers to loosen the curls and thats it... :) My curls lasts up to two days( although I can tell it will last about three days but i always wash my hair every other day). The results are full, bouncy and healthy looking curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this product for two weeks and the product look sturdy so I hope it doesnt break on me. I kept my receipt just in case. I bought it at a Retail Beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and this product works like a charm!! Its fast and easy to use! I love it!</li>
    <li> I do a lot of research before I purchase an item and this was no exception.  However the most raving review was from a local hairstylist that uses on her clients.  She couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this product which is what prompted me to buy it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have very fine, medium length hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl long and has many layers.  So, when I got this item I was a bit anxious to see how it would work for me.  One of the most important things to remember when using this device is that it really needs the full 30 minutes the company recommends to set the curling process. If you need curls in 5 to 10 minutes this set isn&#x27;t for you because if you rush it you won&#x27;t get as good of a results you want. I LOVE this curling set. I washed my hair, dried it and then used the comb end (it was easier than using my fingers and more consistent) that was provided to get the roll correctly before using the ceramic clip.  It was so-ooooo easy to use and very quick.  I had my hair in the ceramic clips within a couple minutes. A friendly tip is to be sure all the hair is inside the ceramic clip because otherwise the curl may not come out properly. I used my time set for 30 minutes and the results were fantastic.  It gave me GREAT body and a soft curl that lasted well for two to three days.  I was shocked at the longevity and the fact that it didn&#x27;t give me the frizz or dryness I got with other curling products. I learned from experimenting that the tighter you wind your hair around the comb end the tighter your curl will be. Be sure you take the time to watch the video and read the instructions because it truly makes a difference in getting the best outcome. Unlike some other products the results have been consistent each time I use it.  I suggest you shop around for the price of this item because there are other websites and companies that offer it for less. I got my set new for 69.00.  I really feel I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth and the 30 minutes ittakes to get the extra body and lift is a lot cheaper than getting a body perm that ultimately dries and damages my hair.</li>
    <li> If you want to spend hours making your hair look like you just rolled out of bed (and not bedhead in a good way!), this product&#x27;s for you. I bought it tonight, watched the DVD and tried so many times. You get no volume at your roots because the clip is dragging it down. It make my hair looked kinked and awful. I look like Ronald McDonald on a humid day after wearing a hat! This is going right back, I don&#x27;t have time to make my hair look worse only to have to fix it with a regular curling iron. I&#x27;d give zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I love the different curl patterns that you can achieve and they don&#x27;t scorch you head like some hot rollers may. The only downside that I would have to this product is that my hair is shoulder length, with medium density and fine texture hair and I still needed to purchase two sets.  Other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not rocket science, it doesn&#x27;t take much practice.&lt;br /&gt;2 mins to heat up the clips, and 5 mins to set them, I have tons of hair, and I can manage to get it done in 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> GET IT! Stop thinking or considering. I use mine EVERYDAY and they are amazing. Does not make your hair greasy or weighed down and the curls stay even until the next day! Before using this, my hair would NEVER hold a curl! I am so so happy with this! Heats up fast, sets quickly and lasts!!! SO SO SO HAPPY!!! Please, get it!!!! You&#x27;ll love it! I don&#x27;t even have to use hairspray. Just make sure you finger roll neatly so ends are smooth and there are not stragglers. :-)</li>
    <li> I was most interested in the top styler from the infomercials I saw which took a frizzy haired woman and turned her hair into smooth bouncing curls. When I received the tip styler, the first couple of applications were a mess. The more I did it, and watched instructional videos, I got better and it went quicker. I still don&#x27;t feel like it completely smooths my naturally curly hair. The curls I get look awesome but, even with my naturally curly hair, it doesn&#x27;t hold all day. What really makes it worth while is being able to put the curlers in and do something else for 20 minutes. The only other downside is that there really aren&#x27;t enough curlers. I don&#x27;t have exceptionally thick hair and if I only use the 10 tht fit in the heater, I have to use really big sections of hair and he heat doesn&#x27;t reach the inside of the curl. All that being said, I like the instyler and feel good about the amount of money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I have finally bought this product from ulta after wanting to try it for a long time. I love it! I tried it out on my sisters hair at first which is shorter than mine so it was more difficult to work with ...but still worked. Then I tried it out on my hair and it came out beautiful! So happy I finally got this! I have not watched the instructional video yet so I am excited to watch it and figure out tricks to make this product work even more efficiently! Great product...I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tomboy that never was able to master a curling iron.  For years I was hoping for an easy to use product that would give me some curls (I have a straight bob).  This product delivered!  It is easy to use and after a few tries I had mastered the twist and wrap with no problem.  The curls stay in place all day and I only use a bit of mousse and thermal spray.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Some reviewers have said these curlers are heavy. I have extremely fine hair and almost didn&#x27;t purchase them because of that. I&#x27;m glad I ignored those reviews and purchased them because they aren&#x27;t heavy at all in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty short hair and getting pin curls was a little tricky. After a couple of tries, however, I am rolling up a storm. I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars only because I don&#x27;t yet have much experience with them. I will come back and update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift from a friend who swore by it. She has one herself and loved it so much that she got me one as a Christmas present. I had seen the infomercials on TV and have been looking for a quick way to curl my ultra straight, fine hair that didn&#x27;t rely on lots of hair products and hours working a curling iron. A curling iron was pretty much the only way my hair would ever curl. I was excited to try this product. As it turns out, a curling iron is still the only thing that will curl my hair. I have ultra fine, ultra straight Asian hair. My hair is extremely healthy but I don&#x27;t do much to keep it healthy. I just use shampoo and conditioner every day. I suppose my hair is healthy because I don&#x27;t subject it to lots of heat damage (I only occasionally blow dry or hot iron curl) and I don&#x27;t perm or color my hair so it hasn&#x27;t been subjected to chemical damage either. The large C-shells don&#x27;t hold my hair at all. The smaller ones are better but they still will literally fall out of my hair. They just can&#x27;t grab my hair at all. Well, if they don&#x27;t grab my hair then how can it curl my hair? I also wasn&#x27;t expecting to get really tight curls with this thing. I was just hoping for lots of big bouncy waves. The top styler can&#x27;t even do that. I told my friend that this product just doesn&#x27;t work for me and she was surprised. She said it works very well for her. She&#x27;s also Asian but she does so much to her hair that she&#x27;s pretty much destroyed it. And I think that&#x27;s why the product works for her. If you have super straight, super fine, and very healthy hair, it just won&#x27;t work for you. I can&#x27;t return this item so now it&#x27;s just occupying space in my apartment.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical because I&#x27;ve wanted the topstyler for a long time but didn&#x27;t want to pay the hefty price tag! Being the thrifty girl I am, I decided to buy one refurbished on ebay... good decision! It was less than 50 bucks and I LOVE it! I have really long, thin, natural blonde hair, so some products just don&#x27;t work for me. Fortunately, this one does! It created really pretty waves and very quickly. If I had more time/patience, I could also use this to create tighter spirals or ringlets, but I love the quick waves so I don&#x27;t usually bother with anything else. Great product.</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine and does not take curl very well if at all.  IN fact it doesn&#x27;t even take chemical curl willingly.... where the instructions on the perm say 25 minutes, it has to be left on my hair for 45 minutes or it won&#x27;t take the curl.  And I&#x27;m talking in a salon, not a home do-it-yourself kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried curling irons, hot rollers, braiding, rags, foam rollers, those weird bendy things, and I&#x27;ve also been getting my hair salon-permed since I was 14.  Up till now the ONLY thing that worked was the salon perms.  And ONLY when I could get them to listen to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these TopStyler thingies and right out of the box I decided to experiement by whipping a few of them into place *just* to see if I could do it.  Results blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: years of experience have taught me that several things work in your favor when working with any hot roller type thing.... make sure your hair is thoroughly dry.  It works better if your hair is dirty.  And by that I mean, texturize it a little.  Put some light styling gel or setting lotion in your hair before it dries, mist on some light hair spray and let it dry before rolling it up, or even *gasp* don&#x27;t have washed your hair for a couple of days.  Seriously.  Stylists have been telling people that for decades.... don&#x27;t wash your hair the day you want a smashing hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I didn&#x27;t have ANY product in my hair when I tested these, and they curled up really nicely.  I did them again with some leftover hair spray in my hair (from the day before) and they REALLY sprung up then.... clearly this helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really worth the money.  I have limited mobility in my arms and shoulders and I have difficulty rolling my hair onto curlers.  These clamshell things are so easy anyone can do it, even me.  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Not enough curlers to do your entire head at once, takes too much time to roll  hair and clam, etc.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted these since the first infomercial came out. But the price was wayyyy to much. I purchased them from Amazon for an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;They do exactly what they say they will do. Full body with great looking bouncy curls. Very easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> Bottom line if you&#x27;re tired of hot rollers burning your ears or back of neck this is for you! It does have efficient gentle heat-enough to curl your hair. It&#x27;s not as precise as a curling iron, but it does create bouncy healthy curls just like it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some practice to learn the &amp;#34;pin-curl&amp;#34; technique, but once you follow the instructions and tips online and on the cd it&#x27;s pretty easy, and very fun to experiment with different or your normal hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is well made and comes in a very nice zippered travel case. It would be a little large for a small suitcase. For the price it&#x27;s well worn having as an every day styling tool or an alternate to hot rollers and curling irons. Be patient and learn the technique! It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the product and I was soooo looking forward to using it!  The package arrived very quickly, which was great, but the directions refer to a special comb and dvd and both were missing.</li>
    <li> First may I say that I bought this SOMEWHERE ELSE and received 10 of each clip, not just the 5 you get here. Had I only received the 5, this product would have been completely useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... my hair is of the super-fine ilk that will never hold a curl more than 10 minutes. The first time I tried this product, I used all 20 clips, and my curl held for about an hour. The curls were firm and soft and promising enough to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, I applied gel and a leave-in conditioner and only used half of the clips. Then, when they were completely cool, I reclipped them with the remaining clips. I did this twice. These curls lasted into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with only using half the clips is that I have to use such large sections of hair that I couldn&#x27;t possibly clip it near all the roots. So, I try to wrap it as high on my head as possible, so that the big, flat parts are underneath curl. So, if I ever want good, all-over curls, I&#x27;ll have to use all the clips, then pin the curls, while they reheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever gotten lasting curl from an heated set. The only way I&#x27;ve ever gotten curl like this was from rolling wet hair and letting it set overnight.</li>
    <li> This is the bomb with bounce for days,  I received two as Christmas gifts as I requested this from four different friends,  I ordered one for myself which I returned. Anyone with hard to curl hair should purchase this item.  I will be purchasing as gifts for friends,</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even want to give it one star . Didn&#x27;t curl my hair much and stayed for maybe 10 minutes tops . Don&#x27;t waste your money I&#x27;m upset I spent 35$ on it .</li>
    <li> I have long hair and trying to curl it all with a curling iron takes way too much time and can be such a pain.  These were AMAZING!!!  I was able to use them for the first time with no problems (some people said they were difficult so I was a bit nervous, but I had no issues and I didn&#x27;t even watch the dvd, I just read the instructions).  It took me under ten minutes to curl and clip all of my hair and then about 10 minutes to curl. When I took the clips out I couldn&#x27;t believe how curly my hair was!  I brushed my fingers through them to give it a more casual look and hair sprayed it and the curls stayed in tact through a night out, including lots of dancing.  I would highly recommend these, especially to those with longer hair!</li>
    <li> I love it, works like a charm. Speedy delivery, too. I think this hair setter if well worth the 50 bucks it costs.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to this after watching Guytang&#x27;s youtue video about how to create VS model&#x27;s hair. After reading some of the negative reviews on amazon, it sounded like most compliants are about &amp;#34;curls don&#x27;t last&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not enough clamps&amp;#34;. I decided to try it anyways, and I am so glas I did. It does take practice making curls with your figure and clamp it. That&#x27;s the same as practice with using curling wand and try not to burn yourself at the beginning. As far as the lasting of curls, mine lasted for 2 days. You have to wait until it cools completely, that&#x27;s how curls form their shape! I put them on before iI start doing make up. By the time I am done, all of them are cooled in those 15-20 mins. One other complain is not enough clamps. Mine came with 15 jumbo and 5 small. 20 clamps are a lot! Do a apple to apple comparasion, most hot rollers comes with 10-18 rollers. I do have fine hair, and 12 clamps are what I use  to cover my entire head and create spiral curls. These are just my experience with it. Im glad I bought it, and really like it!</li>
    <li> The top styler left my hair kinky and frizzy. I have very fine sleek hair. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my favorite hair stylist uses it on his clients, and he claims its the perfect way to get that Victoria secret look. I found it very easy to use. My hair is naturally really wavy and thick, but I don&#x27;t like my natural curls, so I usually blow dry straight or curl it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl well, but I think if I use better hair spray and let my hair dry naturally before it will hold better. But over I really like how easy it is and how the curls looks.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that I loved, but alas, it died.  I ordered another and it&#x27;s not as good.  Maybe it&#x27;s the particular unit and not the product?  This particular one takes a LONG time to heat.  Really long.  The first one I had did not.&lt;br /&gt;The first one had extra clips, but this one does not.  I&#x27;m not happy, but returning is such a hassle.</li>
    <li> After all of the rave reviews I really though this would be the perfect tool for lasting waves in my hair. The curling part is a bit tricky and the curls are just OK and are relatively flat by the end of the day. I have shoulder length, fine hair but a lot of it.  So far, the only thing that makes perfect long lasting curls for me is a curling wand...but takes soooo long.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 1year ago when my hair was just barely long enough to make a curl able to stay in the shells. Even at that short of length I got great body from it.&lt;br /&gt;At first it did take me I would say about a week to get the rolling down good(remember my hair was very short). Now my hair is just past shoulder length and I am still loving my TopStyler. I did however buy another set to use because my hair is extremely straight and I like it very curly most the time. Having the second set already hot and ready to go saves me time from reloading my first set with more shells.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree that you can burn yourself as the shells get extremely hot but over the course of a year I have only come close like 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a book to show you different hair styles and how to roll it to achieve it (good luck with that). Mine never came out like the ones in the book but I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;HELPFUL HINTS: Try using your TopStyler before bed a few times during the week so if it doesn&#x27;t turn out good you can restyle in the morning or what I have also found helpful is have a headband or hat or some hair clips handy to use if it doesn&#x27;t come out how you wanted. You can hide ALOT with a headband and such.&lt;br /&gt;You start by sectioning out some hair (depending on the thickness you choose&#x3D;more or less curly)(ie more hair in a shell will result in less curls while less hair in a shell creates smaller curls).&lt;br /&gt;Roll your sectioned hair into a curl around your fingers (# of fingers used is a choice and explained in the book) making sure to tuck the end of the hair under the bottom of the curl or to the inside of the curl. I do this best by leaving a little room between my fingers and my scalp allowing me a little room to roll the hair end under the curl then make a tiny half roll to hold it near my head. Carefully place your shell on the curl and move to the next one.&lt;br /&gt;I serioulsy don&#x27;t even try to really \\&quot;style\\&quot; it anymore. I have a basic way I like to curl it and I just stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started It took me like 20 min to roll my hair and my arms got a little sore( I hate to admit how out of shape that is) but now I can roll it without even looking and be done in like 10 min. My 10 minute includes doing my entire head in about 18-24 shells for a really curly look. I can get away with a wavy look using about 12 or so shells.&lt;br /&gt; These are the biggest time saver and have not damaged my hair AT ALL like regular hot rollers did. Also, I use these 4-6 times per week. You Tube has some good user videos as well but you just have to do it consistantly and not give up. You will be SOOOOOO glad you bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave a 4 star instead of a 5 is because for the price I think they should include way more c shells or at least make the replacent ones cheaper. Other than that I am a 150% satisfied custmer. Also wanted to add that it really helps to set your curls and keep them in longer if you spray a little hairspray on the curls after you take the shells out but before you break any of them up.sic way I like to curl it and I just stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started It took me like 20 min to roll my hair and my arms got a little sore( I hate to admit how out of shape that is) but now I can roll it without even looking and be done in like 10 min.

    <li> LivingSocial was having a deal on the TopStyler, and since I&#x27;m always looking for fun hair gadgets, I decided to give it a go. I have long hair, thick hair, and a lot of it. I&#x27;m also a nearly religious hair straightener and will not leave the house without my hair straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TopStyler comes with 10 large ceramic shells and 5 small ones. I knew right away that if I wanted real curls, I would only be able to do half my head at a time, but I went ahead and used all them on my whole head by using larger sections in my hair. Heated them up, let them cool, unwound them and...eh. I didn&#x27;t have those lovely, springy curls. I had hair with a little bit of shape to it. When I ran a comb through it, I got some amazing body and waves, princess hair, if you will. It looks nice, it&#x27;s shiny, and it&#x27;s soft. But if I want those nice, springy curls I imagine it&#x27;s going to take me a lot more time to do it. Compared to a curl from my straight iron, these are definitely nicer, but the straightener gave me more definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it takes longer than they say it will. The commercial also says you can use 4-5 shells to make a basic style. THEY HAVE JOKES! There is no way I could fit all of my hair into 4-5 shells. I needed all 15, and then to re-use a couple, to do my whole head with these waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big con I have is that it doesn&#x27;t really get the tops of my hair very well. I guess I&#x27;d have to re-wind my hair and get it even higher in order to work right. I&#x27;ll update this with my progress, since I&#x27;m willing to keep using it and see how I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am trying this again, and am going to detail how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;12:45- plugged in the TopStyler&lt;br /&gt;12:50- TopStyler was ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;1:00- finished setting half of my head in the c-shells. I used 14 of the included 15 shells to do half of my head. My hair is long, to my waist, and thick. There is also lots of it, so I needed more shells.&lt;br /&gt;1:03- wrapped stray hairs in remaining c-shell. I always have these strands of hair that just don&#x27;t end up in the shells, so I need to make sure I have a spare shell or 2 in order to make sure all my hair ends up in the shells.&lt;br /&gt;1:10- the c-shells feel cool enough to let go of, and if I had finer hair I might, but I&#x27;m going to leave them in until they feel completely cool to the touch, because I want to give my hair all the time it needs to set.&lt;br /&gt;1:14- let out a c-shell that was completely cool and got a really unimpressive little curl. Keep in mind I waited until this particular shell was totally and completely cooled before taking it off. It was the first one I put in my hair at 12:50. This shell was in my hair for 25 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;1:18- took out the rest of the shells. It&#x27;s been nearly 30 minutes. I got much nicer curls on this side, but they don&#x27;t go all the way up to the crown of my hair. The stop abruptly right above the ear.&lt;br /&gt;1:20- all of the c-shells are back on the heating coils. It&#x27;ll be about 4 minutes for them to all warm up again so I can use them. In the meantime, I finger combed my hair. I got a lot of volume and waves, though I wish the waves would have gone higher.&lt;br /&gt;1:30- finished putting the other half of my hair into the c-shells. No picture, since it&#x27;s basically the same as the above.&lt;br /&gt;1:40- I&#x27;m taking my hair out, since it&#x27;s creeping up on an hour that I&#x27;ve been sitting down trying to do this and that is just entirely too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the difference in the setting times. On the right, where I gave it almost 30 minutes, I got some nice waves, but definitely no curls. On the left, where I gave the shells 10 minutes, I got some big body and waves, and this was using all 15 shells on both sides. All in all, my hair is soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t have that sort of rough ends that you sometimes get with a straight iron or curling wand. The downside is I definitely don&#x27;t have any curls. I get superior curls with my styling wand and with my hair straightener. The other downside is that it took way too long. When I straighten my hair, or use my wand or straightener to curl, I&#x27;m done in 20-25 minutes. This took me a whole hour to achieve, and the sides don&#x27;t even match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have very fine hair then this tool might work well for you. Those of you who have thick hair, lots of it, should just stick to the methods that we have perfected already, since this tool is really only good for waving and body. It doesn&#x27;t do what the infomercial promises, not by a longshot.air straightener. The other downside is that it took way too long.

    <li> The product is a fraud..it does not work...just burns the hair and doesn&#x60;t style it,... i hated it, don&#x60;t fall for it.</li>
    <li> I tried these because I thought they would be easy to use. It took 2 or 3 tries, but I mastered the hair-rolling technique. I really shouldn&#x27;t have bothered because they didn&#x27;t work.  I have shoulder-length hair that is wavy and thick. Normally it is easy to curl, but all that these curlers accomplished was.... well, nothing. They put a barely noticeable bend in my hair, which was not the look I was going for. Back to the old reliable hot rollers for me.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and purchased this product to use for bridal parties etc, hoping it would make my job easier and provide a nicer long lasting curl for finer textured hair. My 1st three attempts trying this on my medium to coarse hair were a disaster! The clamps left teeth marks in my hair and not a pretty curl. After watching a video I learned the best way is to use the end of he comb provided to wrap your hair around then fit curl completely inside the shell and leave until completely cool! Perfect curls is time!! Practice and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Saw this brand new at target for 70% off.  I can&#x27;t make it work.  Donated it to goodwill.  Impulse purchase</li>
    <li> No combs, no DVD, obviously not new, instructions were very crinkled &amp; had some kind of food stain..? 22 bucks + free shipping is a good price, but had to buy seperate comb set &amp; totaly miss out on the DVD altogether. Supplier claimed new, product not new.. I do however, enjoy this product! I just ordered another (different supplier) bc extra C shells are not available anywhere. It&#x27;s worth another 25 $ to me for just the shells. I used the top styler right away as I was very excited &amp; watched a ton of youtube vids so knew what to do &amp; I&#x27;m highly impressed with my soft supple perfectly shaped &#x27;pin curls&#x27; .. My hair curls fairly easy but doesn&#x27;t hold long.. This product has made great curls that last &amp; Is a keeper in my book. The seller, not so much.</li>
    <li> This product is great once you get the technic down. fast and easy.. I have super fine hair and have had no issues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check ebay tho I found an instyler dealer selling brand new sets for 55. thats shipped.... the sellers ID is offbetti</li>
    <li> I purchased this through Living Social (which was my first mistake). First thing, I&#x27;m really good with a curler or hot iron...but these curlers are a nightmare. They are heavy and hard to use. They leave my hair kinky and lifeless. I watched the video and numerous tutorials on how to make this thing work. Nothing does, the curlers hang from my head like dead fruit. Even if they did work, there isn&#x27;t enough of them to finish my whole head without waiting for them to heat up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to my standard curling iron for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to return the item through Living Social I was told it was a final sale item and that no returns would be honored. I&#x27;ve since canceled my Living Social account. Now I&#x27;m stuck with an expensive item that will probably end up at the goodwill.</li>
    <li> This did not arrive in the retail box shown in the pictures, but in a plain brown box. After reading the instructions, I also realized that the product is missing the comb and 4 extra C-shells that it should come with. I also believe there is supposed to be an instructional DVD, but that wasn&#x27;t included either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works. I have fine hair that I have never been able to keep a curl in, and this is able to do that quickly and fairly easily.</li>
    <li> love it it is simple to use after about 3 uses.  i find making the pincurl slowly with the included comb helps.  i use a heat spray first.  i get very nice spiral curls.</li>
    <li> If you can make a pin curl, you can use topstyler. There are tons of how to videos on you tube if you want to see more. It makes curling my hair so fast and easy. Plus, the curls are really soft and smooth. If you watch a few of the videos online you should have no problem using it. There are several techniques for making curls, depending on the look you want.</li>
    <li> I loved the curls. I have very straight and thin hair. Most of similar products doesn&#x27;t work for me. But this one can make natural curls that hold for about 6 hours, when the weather helps.</li>
    <li> I tried several times to make these work for me. My hair is naturally wavy and holds curl well, but the curls either came out in awkward kinks or overly tight grandma curls. They also fell flat within an hour which is unusual for my hair. I&#x27;m used to a lot of effort when it comes to styling products, but this product just was not worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Its okay, but just okay. Certainly not the miracle styling product its touted as being.  I can get the same or better results with a plain old curling iron, and the curls dont last any longer with this than with any other styling aid.  The one thing that is a little bit better about it is that its faster simply because I dont have to stand there waiting for the curl to heat as with an iron. Wrap it up and clamp it and move on to the next.  So thats a plus, but for the price? I dunno....&lt;br /&gt;Also, should mention that this seller did not include the extra 2 c-shells, the comb, or the instructional look book that is supposed to come with it.</li>
