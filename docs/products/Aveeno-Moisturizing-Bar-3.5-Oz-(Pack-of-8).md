      <li>The best bar soap I found for skin, thanks..........</li>
      <li>Have been using this soap for about 30 years since I got some kind of rash from using a deodorant soap.  </li>
      <li>Works fairly well; the liquid Aveeno is so MUCH BETTER.</li>
      <li>does leave my skin feeling nice, not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>To be fair to Aveeno, I have absurdly sensitive skin and this soap may well be perfect for 99% of the population.</li>
      <li>my husband has very sensitive skin, so this is the perfect bar of soap for him</li>
      <li>Excellent product for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>fast shipping, good price, arrived in good shape.</li>
      <li>For people who have eczema, it&#x27;s very important that you apply sun block to each inch of your exposed skin every time you go out.</li>
      <li>I have also tried &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; body washes but this is the best especially if you suffer from itchy skin.</li>
      <li>who would&#x27;ve thought that a couple of weeks using this soap would give me better results than all of that?</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the Aveno soap.</li>

      <li>, I love it</li>
      <li>My dad has been using this for many years.  </li>
      <li>This is the best natural soap available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove for many years, but wanted to try Aveeno because I use their lotion  and shaving products.  </li>
      <li>cool flesh-tone of the soap translates well, and contrasts nicely with the fabric overlay I gave them to provide as dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aveeno FF is perfect for winter&#x27;s dry skin itchiness.</li>
      <li>You will start to notice your skin looking much more smooth and healthy after using products with oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>So far it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I am 66 years old and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>The best soaps to help you dry skin must have it home !!!</li>
      <li>The bars dissolve very quickly also i think.  </li>
      <li>so this works fine for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great to keep my face from being itchy but does not dry it out.  </li>
      <li>This product helps smooth skin, uses oatmeal added to help ease itching, etc.</li>
      <li>This soap is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This product I recommend because this soap is good for itch and sensitive skin and is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>The eight bars work perfectly for carving the Seven Dwarfs, allowing for inclusion, the gentle Snow White.</li>
      <li>We are very happy with this soap and just ordered our second pack and definitely will continue to order more.  </li>
      <li>and when I did, I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Tried many types of soap, many brand name soaps and all types that costco offers.</li>
      <li>but after showering with the Aveeno Moisturizing Bar, I feel extremely clean.</li>
      <li>I like this product for how clean the ingredients are.</li>
      <li>so the soap stays dry which saves me money.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells a great soapdish</li>
      <li>&#x27;Oatmeal&#x27; soap does, in fact, wash clean based on &#x27;sqeaky&#x27; clean responses from hair &amp; body.</li>
      <li>but I could not feel as clean as I wanted to,</li>
      <li>I most certainly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I already know about the value of the product and was amazed to find it in bulk at a more reasonable price . . .</li>
      <li>Takes extra effort to get a good lather going.  </li>
      <li>Got 8 for $3 a piece, not bad.  </li>
      <li>they trully are great for dry skin,I do recommend!!</li>
      <li>I use Aveeno all the time - but most phamacys don&#x27;t stock more than 2 bars at a time - so I am always running low.  </li>
      <li>The soap does tend to deteriorate quite quickly, so it needs to be kept away from moisture and allow to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Mild soap with no scent, preservatives, dyes, or chemicals.</li>
      <li>soap melts away quickly in the shower</li>
      <li>specially if the skin is sensitive : )</li>
      <li>Good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I can get my products with no problem and ordering is easy and delivery is fast.</li>
      <li>you love this product, you might also enjoy using the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Aveeno Stress relief Body Wash or Aveeno Stress Relief</li>
      <li>This is the most gentle soap for all family members for whole body.</li>
      <li>Other soaps with frangrance irritate my skin, and this soat is great because it doens&#x27;t contain any parfumes and is very mosturising.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, the beautiful Snow White was carved oblong up, to give her the extra height.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice smell, soft appearance and skin after use is VERY soft.</li>
      <li>It works great and leaves the skin feeling very clean, but not smooth and soft live DOVE.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on my skin and helps with the itching that excema causes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My son has had eczema since he was a baby. This is the only stuff he can use to wash his hands without irritating them. Amazon is the cheapest place to buy this stuff. I hope they never stop carrying it.</li>
    <li> excellent product and excellent price, wonderful product for people who cannot use soap on their skin, thank you Roxanne</li>
    <li> As expected. Good product</li>
    <li> Not long ago, I started putting oatmeal in my bath. Then, I added rosemary and other herbs for variety. The combination of oatmeal and rosemary seems to be very healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this soap contains oat flour, it doesn&#x27;t contain herbs. It is a nice soap to use in the tub but it has to be put in a dry place after your bath because it gets very creamy and soft and can be used up faster than you intend it to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno products heal the skin and are comforting, soothing products. You will start to notice your skin looking much more smooth and healthy after using products with oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love this product, you might also enjoy using the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Aveeno Stress relief Body Wash or Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Aveeno items seem relaxing. I especially love the Stress Relief Lotion in the 2.5 oz tube that can be kept in your purse. The burst of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is healing at any time of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also want to try some of the LUSH beauty products as they have a few items with calamine powder (It&#x27;s a Pleasure Treasure massage bar) and lots with lavender (Golden Slumbers) and other healing essential oils. For an extra soothing bath, put oatmeal in some cheesecloth with herbs and tie with a string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lover of Long Baths with Essential Oils and a Poetry Book</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  The soap is great.  I continue to use the soap.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and this is the only product cleans my skin without irritating it. I also have peeling problem with my hands. My first dermatologist recommended Dove soap for sensitive skin. It worked for a while, then my hands start peeling again. My second dermatologist recommended Aveeno oatmeal soap. It not only helps prevent peeling, it also helps the peeled skin to recover. I&#x27;m really amazed by this product.    I have two complains though. First of all, it&#x27;s really expensive compare to other type of soaps. Second of all, it melts so fast. You actually can use up one soap per week.    If you have skin problem like me, you can try it out to see if it works for you. If you have normal skin, you can find something cheaper with the same function.    For people who have eczema, it&#x27;s very important that you apply sun block to each inch of your exposed skin every time you go out. Try to keep your skin dry, sweat aggravate the eczema.</li>
    <li> This Aveeno bar is made with oatmeal. Cleans your face without drying it out. I have rosacea and need to use products for sensitive skin. I have found that this product fits the bill, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good for dry skin. My husband has used this soap for years on the advice of his dermatologist. His skin is very dry and sensitive and other soaps would irritate his skin so it would get itchy and have a rash. The Aveeno solved the problem. It&#x27;s not the same consistency as regular soap and tends to fall apart a little and therefore gets used up faster. But it&#x27;s an excellent soap-highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the Aveno soap. It was recommended by my doctor and I agree, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use it excluively. I am not allowed to use soaps that have fragrance add or creams. This product helps smooth skin, uses oatmeal added to help ease itching, etc. For medical reasons I use it and for the price I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I dont notice a huge difference but my sking doesnt feel as dry  as it use to with what i used before, overall i like it. My skin gets super dry in the winter and i see this has good reviews</li>
    <li> Have been using this soap for about 30 years since I got some kind of rash from using a deodorant soap.  I use it as a bath bar in the shower, so it gets used up pretty fast and I typically buy in bulk at 6-8 bars at a time.</li>
    <li> I have terrible allergies to many soap products but this one causes no reactions.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is natural as well. Cheaper here at Amazon than it is at the drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;This soap melts away quickly in the shower so I bought a soapdish that I mounted in the back of the shower so the soap stays dry which saves me money.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells a great soapdish by[[ASIN:B003D4GWKC Thetford 36668 Bar Soap Staytion Case]] and I highly recommend it especially for this soap.</li>
    <li> The best soaps to help you dry skin must have it home !!! specially if the skin is sensitive : )</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and she swears by it and uses it exclusively to wash her face with. She said that she could no longer get it from the local grocery stores anymore. I personally use Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash to help with my chronic rosacea.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and had a great price!</li>
    <li> A perfect facial cleanser.  Removes all make-up without overly drying skin.  Lathers enough to make it effective but not so much that it is difficult to remove.  A definite winner</li>
    <li> G/F insists on using this as a face soap. I agree.</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic.  I have extremely dry skin.  I have tried several soaps from my local health food store as I wanted something more natural without a lot of carcinogens in it.  None of their soaps were moisturizing enough. Aveeno is very moisturizing and is closer to natural than most regular soaps.  The product arrived as described and on time.</li>
    <li> I already know about the value of the product and was amazed to find it in bulk at a more reasonable price . . . and it came to my door almost overnight!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this item since it arrived on the market. She would never use any other product on her body.</li>
    <li> My dad has been using this for many years.  His dermatologist recommended it for his extremely dry skin and contact dermatitis.  He also has EXTREMELY sensitive skin and is allergic to almost every soap. This soap is hypoallergenic as well. (Detergent is usually a nightmare for him, but we use Surf and it seems to work on his skin).  The soap does tend to deteriorate quite quickly, so it needs to be kept away from moisture and allow to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it when I had the chicken pox and it dried up the spots very well and stopped the itching.  Good for any skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good soap for dry skin but too expensive for how quickly it dissolves, plus there&#x27;s hardly any lather which I like to have. I&#x27;ll stick to Dove soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to keep my face from being itchy but does not dry it out.  I use it daily.  And it makes a great breakfast! ;-)</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as expected.  As a soap it works ok.  Takes extra effort to get a good lather going.  The bars dissolve very quickly also i think.  Still I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Tried many types of soap, many brand name soaps and all types that costco offers. This is the most gentle soap for all family members for whole body. Little more expensive but in this case worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, use it everyday as my bath soap, used for years, my family now uses it too!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive skin. This soap helps stop dry patches from appearing.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive, and it is always itchy.  This is the only soap that does not irritate my skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this soap and just ordered our second pack and definitely will continue to order more.  We were struggling with dry skin with the cold winter weather and the heat indoors.  I feel that most soaps and shower gels do a bad job of helping the change of temperature and lack of humidity.  They just contributed to our dry skin with all the unnecessary perfumes and dyes.  This soap just feels so natural and so balanced when I put it on my skin.  And we have definitely noticed a difference on our skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After trying several different brands of &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34;  body soap,  I came upon this.  My doctor had recommended Aveeno skin lotion, so when I saw this bar soap, I gave it a try.  That&#x27;s all I will use now!  It is very gentle on my skin and helps with the itching that excema causes.  This, plus Aveeno Skin lotion makes my skin feel great and stops the itching.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and have tried pills, creams, ointments, roll on cortisone...who would&#x27;ve thought that a couple of weeks using this soap would give me better results than all of that? No joke, my skin LOVES this soap. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Would recomend this.</li>
    <li> This soap is truly fragrance free!!! It has a soft feel to it and a bar lasts longer than regular bath soaps.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural soap available. I have used the soap, and Aveeno lotion, for only three days and notice a major difference between the Aveeno brand and the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands.</li>
    <li> Really helped with the skin allergy I got from normal bars of soap.  No more itching, not more burning from scratching.</li>
    <li> I like this. It&#x27;s not fabulous, but it works for me and I feel like I&#x27;m not getting a ton of chemicals when I use it.</li>
    <li> I returned from China in April 2014 and I had a rash that I caught I guess from walking in the wilderness there, anyway I went to my doctor who prescribe a lotion and it didn&#x27;t work at all the rash was very persistent I was freaked out it kept appearing in all parts of my body. I sought another doctor and nothing and then I remember that my son had a similar problem I went on Amazon as fast as could order the Aveeno soap bars and withing two days I was cured and that&#x27;s no bull I&#x27;m still using it and so is my wife.</li>
    <li> most soaps leave me dry and itchy.  I have also tried &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; body washes but this is the best especially if you suffer from itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Other soaps with frangrance irritate my skin, and this soat is great because it doens&#x27;t contain any parfumes and is very mosturising.</li>
    <li> I may have an overly sensitive nose but I think this soap stinks! As in, nearly gag-worthy stinks.&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT just smell like oatmeal, that would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the odor does not last long but I find it really hard to wash my face with it.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my skin feeling nice, not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I may just toss it. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Does not mositerize, smells bad.</li>
    <li> I actually never did use a specific dry skin bar soap for my face, but when I read about this product, I decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!  The dry heat in my home each winter causes my skin to suffer , but with Aveeno, I&#x27;ve discovered a NEW product that I love and solves the dryness problem! I recommend it highly!!</li>
    <li> I use Aveeno all the time - but most phamacys don&#x27;t stock more than 2 bars at a time - so I am always running low.  So I am happy to stock up and got free shipping too.</li>
    <li> Aveeno Fragrance Free Moisturizing Bar for Dry Skin , with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal is the only soap that my husband can use that heals up the rashes on his skin, It&#x27;s amazing .We&#x27;d tried all kinds of soaps, lotions, medicines, and Aveeno is the only one that helped.</li>
    <li> works very well.  soap is solid but lasts a short time.</li>
    <li> Aveeno is the best! Have been using it for years! I am 66 years old and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Helps relieve dry skin itching.</li>
    <li> I would not buy again. Personally, I did not like it , but that&#x27;s just me. It&#x27;s suppose to be really good, I like soap that lathers.</li>
    <li> The eight bars work perfectly for carving the Seven Dwarfs, allowing for inclusion, the gentle Snow White. The soap is soft, almost malleable, and does not flake off the same way Dial, Zest and Irish Spring so often would. Aveeno is the proper choice for creating figurines of favorite characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool flesh-tone of the soap translates well, and contrasts nicely with the fabric overlay I gave them to provide as dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Bashful&#x27;s face, though, I gave a mild pinkish color to appropriate his shy nature. He is seen looking blissfully at fair maiden Snow White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleepy&#x27;s beard was troublesome, as the detail required extended beyond my ability. It is long, but not nearly as sharp at the end as I intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy&#x27;s great smile smoothly lifts right and left, while Sleepy&#x27;s eyelids lilt low, almost covering his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sneezy is seen sniffing a flower. The flower is not from the soap. Instead, Sneezy&#x27;s nose is leaning into his shoulder, where I add a paper cut-out daisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doc&#x27;s glasses came out nicely, in a classic bookworm-off-the-nose style, to provide that distinguished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grumpy&#x27;s big nose broke in my first effort, but it was early into the process, and a second, more secure nose was supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dopey might have been the most difficult, as he has no special, visible features. Silence is not as obvious in soap carvings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the beautiful Snow White was carved oblong up, to give her the extra height. Her smile tilts upward, gracefully, unaware of Bashful&#x27;s unspoken affection, with her eyes showing is thinking amorously of some yet unmet lover. Dressed in rags, as she is still not known as a princess, she stands regally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second set can finish the scene with the huntsman, the prince, the wicked queen, and of course, the apple and mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno&#x27;s a great start for you budding soap carvers, and scraps work in their usual way... to clean what&#x27;s dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t care for it but I love it. It doesn&#x27;t lather like soap but it has oatmeat in it its not suppose to later, it cleans naturally, I love it these bars are now all mine!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years.  I am allergic to scented soap so this works fine for me.</li>
    <li> my husband has very sensitive skin, so this is the perfect bar of soap for him</li>
    <li> This product took away my dry skin from this winters weather. I highly recomend it to anyone with dry flacking skin from the winter weather.</li>
    <li> they trully are great for dry skin,I do recommend!!</li>
    <li> Perfect. No problems at all. Will buy from again. A Plus</li>
    <li> In my opinion Aveeno products are the best!  No perfumes or dyes.  It&#x27;s a great product and I constantly order more.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Works great for those of us with complicated skin. I am very happy with it and will never stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have to use this when we get far into the winter here in the northeast and the air is super dry and cold.  I always used to get very itchy this time of year until I discovered this soap.  It has no fragrance so you will have to add that after your bathing.  It also wears down rather quickly so you will go through quite a few bars of it and it&#x27;s not cheap.  But if you&#x27;ve had severe itching in the winter like me, try this and a little lotion and you&#x27;ll feel ten times better.  I have never found anything like it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Mild soap with no scent, preservatives, dyes, or chemicals. Excellent for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin or any skin type. Never has caused a skin reaction as other soaps can. Oatmeal based which is highly recommended by dermatologists. Product leaves skin soft and not dry.</li>
    <li> Aveeno FF is perfect for winter&#x27;s dry skin itchiness.</li>
    <li> The only soap my wife can use on her sensitive skin.  Other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; soaps still irritate her skin; this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I would describe it as a classy thing - it&#x27;s nice smell, soft appearance and skin after use is VERY soft. I like it.</li>
    <li> This is truly great product. I just moved from Florida to Mass and my skin was really dry and, itching all the time. I went online and read the reviews for this product and decided to try it. I was eager to try it and when I did, I was not disappointed. It really cleans and pampers your skin. I can tell the difference. This soap is not like all others that will just give you an fragrance, this soap actually works on your skin! Recommended highly</li>
    <li> I have skin allergy and I use this soap to take shower. It keeps my skin moisture during the winter. I also recommend the Daily Moisturizing Lotion to use together.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, who has sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use just any old soap, especially the way these products are made today, with all sort of chemicals that most buyers can&#x27;t pronounce. I think there are only four, maybe five, if not more ingredients on the box, and I can read them which let&#x27;s me know that the product, is, as close as they can get to natural. Oatmeal is good not only for cholesterol, but, for the body (outside) too. No harsh chemicals and does what is says it will do. Moisturize, calm and clear the skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, a bar that moisturizes instead of drying, and is unscented.</li>
    <li> Wife has exema, Dove seemed to work Well for years- then it didn&#x27;t. She is very happy with Aveeno. Says it does not burn. Her skin looks Good again. Amazon has good prices &amp; its easy to get rather then wasteing frustrating time looking for it.</li>
    <li> The best bar soap I found for skin, thanks..........</li>
    <li> My skin had become very sensitive because I swim everyday in a chlorine pool. Developed a rash. Now after swimmingI take a shower using the Aveeno soap.  Works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove for many years, but wanted to try Aveeno because I use their lotion  and shaving products.  It works great and leaves the skin feeling very clean, but not smooth and soft live DOVE.</li>
    <li> Fragrance ... similar to mud.  Works fairly well; the liquid Aveeno is so MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> Based upon a dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation, there is no other &#x27;soap&#x27; that I can use.  It has performed adequately, based on lack of perfume or other inorganic matter.  The soap is &#x27;oatmeal&#x27; based, retains moisture content on my skin and is neutral in all other aspects.  &#x27;Oatmeal&#x27; soap does, in fact, wash clean based on &#x27;sqeaky&#x27; clean responses from hair &amp; body.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and complete. Good price.</li>
    <li> Really helps with eczema and skin allergies. This product does not contain many of the chemicals found on other commercial soaps.</li>
    <li> I like this product for how clean the ingredients are. Good for the skin - no allergens, toxins, or carcinogens. Bar does not overdry skin like other bar soaps seem to, and it lathers as well as most bar soaps. That being said, it does seem a little rougher, with what looks like bits of grain or something in it, but it&#x27;s not that bothersome - consider it a light exfoliator. ;)</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good price, arrived in good shape. one of the few items i can use on hypersensitive skin. does not last as long as regular soap but, for reactive skin, i think it is great.</li>
    <li> Aveeno products are the only product my grand nephew can use for the eczema he suffer with</li>
    <li> I love this product. I start using this product by accident one day when I ran out of soap. So far it&#x27;s great. I order two times and both times my packages was perfect. Highly recommended also on time delivery every time.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;[s a little rough on my skin</li>
    <li> I use Aveeno everything, from shaving gel to body wash, and this is the first-ever Aveeno product I haven&#x27;t gotten great service from. To be fair to Aveeno, I have absurdly sensitive skin and this soap may well be perfect for 99% of the population. I was hoping to find a bar soap equivalent of their excellent &amp;#34;Skin Relief&amp;#34; body wash, but this doesn&#x27;t get there.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell that this soap moisturizes.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t especially appealing, but doesn&#x27;t stay with me either.  It doesn&#x27;t later as well as the other soap I was using.  I will use the bar, but just at sink for face and hands.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get this in my local pharmacy so i decided to pick up at amazon.com.  Got 8 for $3 a piece, not bad.  Now i don&#x27;t need to buy this soap until next year..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for almost 10 years, spent a small fortune on different products trying something that can help me with my condition, as I work in front of people and it&#x27;s sometimes uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve used the Aveeno Moisturizing Bar for the last month and it has already faded the red spots to an extremely mild pink, I will not claim this bar does miracles (but which does?), but it has helped me A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several brands of colloidal oatmeal soaps but I could not feel as clean as I wanted to, but after showering with the Aveeno Moisturizing Bar, I feel extremely clean. I most certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product-I&#x27;ve used it for years on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product I recommend because this soap is good for itch and sensitive skin and is fragrance free. I have used other products but this one I have stayed with. In ordering from Amazon.com I can get my products with no problem and ordering is easy and delivery is fast.</li>
