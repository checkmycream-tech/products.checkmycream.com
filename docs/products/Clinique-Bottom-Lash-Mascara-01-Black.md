### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If I got this as a perfect shape of product, It would be also</li>
      <li>This is the perfect size for bottom lashes.</li>
      <li>Perfect size for bottom lashes and for touching up top lashes.</li>
      <li>Very good coverage and smooth going on.</li>
      <li>Top rated!</li>
      <li>did an in depth review of my top 4 choices on my blog, too!</li>
      <li>I go over bottom lashes 3 times and then they are nicely defined.</li>
      <li>Although, the brush is very comfortable  to use on the lower lashes.</li>
      <li>might able to use for my bottom lash except this problem.</li>
      <li>I love this bottom lash mascara.</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I will continue using it as it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
      <li>It probably does coat more of the really fine lower lashes;  but with the clumps it leaves, I don&#x27;t think I would order again.</li>
      <li>I am so truly pleased with it; highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Hardly worth the money.</li>
      <li>It was worth a try...</li>
      <li>It does smears like any other not so good mascara.</li>
      <li>The tiny applicator would be great if redesigned to hold a little more product and curve to your lashes.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t use it right now but brush part is pretty tiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Oh I almost forgot the shipping was super fast</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get very much for your money.  </li>
      <li>so much I gave it as a stocking stuffer to friends and family who enjoyed the little brush that lets you do so much more to your lower lashes w/o painting your under eye area.</li>
      <li>Professional enough for those special occasions but perfect for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>I really liked the tiny brush which makes applying the mascara pretty easy but gave it just 4 stars because even though it is waterproof it still leaves a dark &#x27;shadow&#x27; under my lower lashes by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>The Loreal circular wand is better for the bottom lashes unless you have really long bottom lashes.  </li>
      <li>I love this Clinique mascara because it has a tiny brush that individually coats each lash to perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have to really concentrate not to get black under my eyes which is a pain to remove after having applied a full face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always tried to use regular mascara for my bottom lashes but the brushes are so large and it gets everywhere.</li>
      <li>I have no complaints about this product, however, I will say that you can accomplish much the sane thing with a regular mascara wand.</li>
      <li>Do not mess with it.</li>
      <li>Small brush for easy application to blonde invisible bottom lashes..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If I got this as a perfect shape of product, It would be also perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Cover part of mascara was smashed when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I don&#x27;t see any problem to use it but feels not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it right now but brush part is pretty tiny.&lt;br /&gt;I might able to use for my bottom lash except this problem.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product, however, I will say that you can accomplish much the sane thing with a regular mascara wand. It was worth a try...</li>
    <li> I can never wear mascara on the bottom lashes because regradless of the product claim... waterproof, smudge proof, whatever.. I end up with grey undereyes within hours.  I do have oily skin and hair which likely contributes.. BUT the Clinique product WORKS.  Small brush for easy application to blonde invisible bottom lashes.. and it stays out on the lashes!  Glad I found online, not always in stores where Clinique is sold.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this for quite sometime based on the rave reviews on other sites. The tiny applicator would be great if redesigned to hold a little more product and curve to your lashes. In fact, I notices that in some pictures the applicator actually is curved. My applicator is the stubble black on ethat I have to really concentrate not to get black under my eyes which is a pain to remove after having applied a full face. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I can now get mascara on my lower lashes without ending up looking like a raccoon. I like it so much I gave it as a stocking stuffer to friends and family who enjoyed the little brush that lets you do so much more to your lower lashes w/o painting your under eye area.</li>
    <li> Hardly worth the money. Could not get it to work without a mess on my face. Do not mess with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for bottom lashes and for touching up top lashes. Very good coverage and smooth going on. Top rated!</li>
    <li> No more messy raccoon eyes. This product separates your tiny bottom lashes and applies mascara to just those lashes without smearing product allover your under eye area. Professional enough for those special occasions but perfect for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> an alternative to SPIDER LOWER LASHES</li>
    <li> Too small and thin consistency</li>
    <li> It still left clumps.  It probably does coat more of the really fine lower lashes;  but with the clumps it leaves, I don&#x27;t think I would order again.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, but the mascara tube is very small.  Don&#x27;t get very much for your money.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have always had problems with applying mascara on my bottom lashes. The usual mascaras have really chunky wands and it always smudges under my eyes when I try to apply on my bottom lashes. With this product I have had absolutely no problems like this. I am so truly pleased with it; highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this bottom lash mascara. I simply wipe off excess on brush and begin to apply to my bottom lashes. I go over bottom lashes 3 times and then they are nicely defined. Oh I almost forgot the shipping was super fast, I ordered on Saturday and it shipped the same day, and was in my mail box by Monday. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this Clinique mascara because it has a tiny brush that individually coats each lash to perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did an in depth review of my top 4 choices on my blog, too! http://www.newlyag.com/the-final-four/&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps!</li>
