      <li>Great for natural hair.  </li>
      <li>What I LOVE about this product is that it is free of toxic chemicals and is very light and easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>First off the smell is amazing and it lingers with</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using as a leave-in on my fine, curly hair for almost a year now.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
      <li>It smelled like cheap air freshener that they spray in your car at the car wash.</li>
      <li>It has a light coconut fragrance.</li>
      <li>Great product keeps hair soft and very moisturized.</li>
      <li>I also used to use the cantu shea butter leave in (the original, not the natural one) and had a pretty good experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I gave it away to a friend who had the same results but loved the smell</li>
      <li>I love the Cantu product line, but this particular product did not add any shine or hold to my hair.</li>
      <li>I find that this mix of Cantu products is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, for so much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>

      <li>The more cream I use, the more defined the curls are when they dry, but they also aren&#x27;t crispy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The whole Cantu hair care line is the best for my hard to control hair.</li>
      <li>Since it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absorbed in my hair, so there&#x27;s no need to put on a scarf for fear of my pillow case being gummy or saturated in the morning.</li>
      <li>so she thought it was worth it.</li>
      <li>Smells like a freshly opened coconut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good product to moisturize my dreadlocks for a long time, and more recently I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards Cantu products.</li>
      <li>so I could wash it out right away.</li>
      <li>At first, I was hesitant to purchase this product because of my past experience with Cantu&#x27;s oil sheen spray; however, I purchased it because it has great ingredients</li>
      <li>They are pretty defined.</li>

      <li>Shea Moisture product of the same purpose is better to me, I will finish using this bottle, perhaps, but will not buy again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s first ingredient is water</li>
      <li>This product allows me to be cute and have freedom all at the same time.</li>
      <li>A waste of a good $12.</li>
      <li>The top dries flatter and the ends curl up and get thicker as they dry.</li>
      <li>When I tell you this product did absolutely NOTHING to my hair, it is an understatement.</li>
      <li>I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve had that epiphany, I&#x27;ve been so much happer with my hair.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.</li>
      <li>I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m testing different products for my natural locks and this particular product is just ok.</li>
      <li>I recently relocated to a dry climate and this has been a HUGE help to my hair!!</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to other naturalistas  and suggest you take this product with a high quality fish oil supplement for better results(Wild</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using less, i&#x27;ve tried using more.</li>
      <li>and it kept my hair soft and nicely moisturized without any heavy buildup or oils.</li>
      <li>Aside from that, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes wonderfully, has no crunch, a little bit goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.  </li>
      <li>I have so called 4a, &amp; 4b non chemically treated hair type, so daily moisturization and a clean scalp is crucial.</li>
      <li>I only dry my hair halfway so that I can shape my hair the way I want it and let it dry on its own.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s going to be that way, and that is the point of going natural.</li>
      <li>Let me start off this review by saying i have a mix of type 4 natural hair.</li>
      <li>Done with natural hair marketing hype products.</li>
      <li>so I naturally have a ton of hair.</li>
      <li>: My hair isnt weighed down easily with oils, especially since i can use castor oil daily and have no problem with my hair absorbing it.</li>
      <li>pressed, my only complaint about this product would be that I wish that it came in a bottle with a better spray nozzle, one that gives a wider distribution span upon application.  </li>
      <li>But it would work for 1-3B hair maybe...not for this thick fro of mine! :-)</li>
      <li>I really liked Miss Jessie&#x27;s curly pudding, but seriously, it is ridiculously expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely head over heels in love with this product! I&#x27;m greek so I naturally have a ton of hair. My hair is thick and very curly. First off the smell is amazing and it lingers with I like. I wash my hair every other day so the days that I dont wash my hair I spray this in my hair in the morning to put some life back in my hair so I can start my day. I even use this through out the day here and there just for a little pick me up. Its my holy grail hair product at the moment! &lt;3</li>
    <li> I love the Cantu product line, but this particular product did not add any shine or hold to my hair. Basically just acts as a morning wetting solution to overnight dry hair. I will not buy this shine and hold product again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! It is great on twist-outs and/or braid-outs. I like it in the morning and to set my hair at night. It will keep your curl pattern.</li>
    <li> My hair is 3b/3c. I&#x27;m half black and half Japanese, so my hair is very thick and is mostly s-shaped curls, some spirals underneath but with a hint of kinky as it easily frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always hated that my hair is so BIG. I spent years finding products to help tame my hair and weigh it down, but I realized...my hair IS big. It&#x27;s going to be that way, and that is the point of going natural. So that changed my ideas of what I needed in hair care products. I don&#x27;t want to weigh my hair down, I want to moisturize and define the curl. Since I&#x27;ve had that epiphany, I&#x27;ve been so much happer with my hair. I get lots of compliments, and my hair care regimen can&#x27;t be easier! Here is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;I use Creme of Nature sulfate-free Argan Oil Shampoo once every two weeks. (My curls are at their best when it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve shampooed but the products build up on the scalp.) Since it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much. I like the shampoo because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped I shampoo, comb through with a wide-tooth comb while rinsing out. I do not use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If I don&#x27;t shampoo, I still start here daily...I wet my hair and comb through daily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style:&lt;br /&gt;I squeeze out my hair in the shower, do not towel dry. From there, I spray some Cantu Coconut Milk spray on my hair and run through with my fingers. This stuff smells awesome and it adds extra moisture. I use a comb to part my hair where I want it. Then I slather on the Cantu leave-in conditioning cream liberally by running through with my fingers in sections on top, and then run my fingers through underneath, keeping the part where I want it. The more cream I use, the more defined the curls are when they dry, but they also aren&#x27;t crispy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry:&lt;br /&gt;I typically let my hair air dry from there. The top dries flatter and the ends curl up and get thicker as they dry. Sometimes, I will lie on my bed on my back and let my hair hang off the edge of the bed for a few minutes just to keep it still and let it dry. The less I handle it, the less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m going somewhere immediately and want dryer hair, I use my pancake hair dryer. Best invention ever! I bought it here on Amazon, Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic hair dryer. It is flat and round and comes with a diffuser attachment. I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still. Doing this adds volume so I have a fuller, more rounded shape, and it dries the curls quickly. They are pretty defined. I only dry my hair halfway so that I can shape my hair the way I want it and let it dry on its own. Using the hair dryer adds a little more dryness, so this is when I will spray a little Cantu Sheen Spray in my hand and shape my hair a little with my fingers, then leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products on my hair from the cheaper Africa&#x27;s Best, to Carol&#x27;s Daughter, to Mixed Chicks and also Miss Jessie&#x27;s.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good product to moisturize my dreadlocks for a long time, and more recently I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards Cantu products. They have been awesome on my locs. Great loc &amp; twist gel and this item just adds more pieces to the pie. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Cantu products smell great and do what their labels say they&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m testing different products for my natural locks and this particular product is just ok. It&#x27;s first ingredient is water so when the instructions say spray to refresh your curls if you suffer from shrinkage...watch out! I won&#x27;t order this again. But it would work for 1-3B hair maybe...not for this thick fro of mine! :-)</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous!  It doesn&#x27;t take much and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Family members say they want some too ~ so I hope I can buy more ~ the fragrance is lovely,  and it makes my hair feel great.  I am truly happy with this product.  Thank you Cantu and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fine-haired curly, low to medium density, type 4a/4b/3c. For extreme curl/coil definition I pair this as my moisturizer with Cantu&#x27;s Curl Activator Cream.  It moisturizes wonderfully, has no crunch, a little bit goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.  I spritz it on, work it through my hair, and then add the curl cream.  I immediately feel a slip and my curls/coils begin to pop. My hair has a beautiful sheen and stays moisturized all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If pressed, my only complaint about this product would be that I wish that it came in a bottle with a better spray nozzle, one that gives a wider distribution span upon application.  Aside from that, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This smelled so disgusting. It smelled like cheap air freshener that they spray in your car at the car wash. It was so gross that as soon as I put it in my son&#x27;s hair, I had to bathe him so I could wash it out right away.</li>
    <li> Let me start off this review by saying i have a mix of type 4 natural hair. I honestly bought this because it was cheap and the ingredients looked amazing for the price. I also used to use the cantu shea butter leave in (the original, not the natural one) and had a pretty good experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;My original plan for this was to use as a replacement for the pricey but effective Alikay Naturals Lemongrass leave in which i use as a refresher spray when taking down my twists. While the Alikay Naturals absorbs nicely, is moisturizing, and gives some slip, this Cantu spray is just a bunch of oils that seem to just sit in my hair. When I spray the A.N., a few min later i can run my fingers through my hair and feel smoothness and bouncyness. When i sprayed the Cantu, my hands came out greasy and sticky. I&#x27;ve tried using less, i&#x27;ve tried using more. I&#x27;ve tried it on damp hair, tried it on dry hair. I tried diluting it. Nothing. I gave it away to a friend who had the same results but loved the smell so she thought it was worth it. To each their own, but my search for a lower priced equivalent for the A.N. continues&lt;br /&gt;P.S: My hair isnt weighed down easily with oils, especially since i can use castor oil daily and have no problem with my hair absorbing it. This Cantu stuff tho... it was as if i was spraying mineral oil in my hair.</li>
    <li> Product adds moisture and makes my afro easier to comb. Great conditioner for the money. I like all the Cantu products.</li>
    <li> I just love this. I&#x27;ve been using as a leave-in on my fine, curly hair for almost a year now. It smells amazing, like a light, floral coconutty scent. It&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy. It dries without residue and gets rid of tangles. I subscribe &amp; save it for every 2 months. I wish the bottle made a finer mist, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal. I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
    <li> I use this product to add moisture, shine and hold when my hair is styled in a Afro. I also use it at night to add moisture when twisting my hair at night in preparation of a twist out style in the morning.Cantu Shea butter coconut milk shine and hold mist. It has a light coconut fragrance. Very nice, not overbearing.</li>
    <li> Shea Moisture product of the same purpose is better to me, I will finish using this bottle, perhaps, but will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Basically, I would use on my children&#x27;s hair as a slip detangler. It works good for that, but it goes quickly.  In other words, for the purpose  I use it for, the product doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> The product was good for what I wanted to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair spray about a month ago at a local beauty store for like $11.99. I am surprised that there aren&#x60;t a lot more reviews for this delightful, tropical smelling hair mist. First off all, my grew like 1 inch in a month  and it kept my hair soft and nicely moisturized without any heavy buildup or oils. I have so called 4a, &amp; 4b non chemically treated hair type, so daily moisturization and a clean scalp is crucial.What I LOVE about this product is that it is free of toxic chemicals and is very light and easily absorbed. I recommend this product to other naturalistas  and suggest you take this product with a high quality fish oil supplement for better results(Wild Alsakan salmon oil is the BOSS). I just ordered a batch of 5 Cantu hairsprays from Amazon for half the cost my local beauty supply is selling it for. When you find a product that your locks love, you gotta stock up!</li>
    <li> At first, I was hesitant to purchase this product because of my past experience with Cantu&#x27;s oil sheen spray; however, I purchased it because it has great ingredients and I am a product junkie. :0) I spray this spray on my hair every morning (in addition to massaging my scalp with coconut oil at night) to keep my natural hair moisturized while in a protective style. This product does make my hair shine and it feels moisturized. My only complaint is that my hands are a bit sticky after rubbing it through my hair. :0( Overall, I like the product because it does what it says it will do, smells great, and has great ingredients. :0)</li>
    <li> I use it just for the fragrance,  not really sure if it actually helps my hair, but the scent last from days. Smells like coconut! And my coworkers are always sniffing my hair. I also use some other mango hair product with it... the combination of the fragrances smells like paradise!</li>
    <li> Again, this is yet another product I bought together with the curling cream. A waste of a good $12. I have 4b/c hair. When I tell you this product did absolutely NOTHING to my hair, it is an understatement. It felt like I simply poured milk into a bottle of water and put it in my hair. No softening or loosening of my texture to make it easier to comb through. Just nonsense. And yes, I ALWAYS apply water beforehand to any product I put in my hair. Still didn&#x27;t work. Done with natural hair marketing hype products.</li>
    <li> This product is the &amp;#34;bees knees&amp;#34; for my hair, it lays and is controlled as I like. No flyaways, no stray strands, and on top of it all, my hair smells fantastic. It&#x27;s absorbed in my hair, so there&#x27;s no need to put on a scarf for fear of my pillow case being gummy or saturated in the morning. This product allows me to be cute and have freedom all at the same time. The whole Cantu hair care line is the best for my hard to control hair.</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair.  Smells like a freshly opened coconut.</li>
    <li> Great product keeps hair soft and very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! The price was great and this is an amazing product.. I love Cantu naturals. I recently relocated to a dry climate and this has been a HUGE help to my hair!! Thank you. WIll be ordering again... Subscribed!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  This has the most amazing smell ever and I just love spraying on my hair and my kids hair.  I will definitely reorder once it is done.</li>
    <li> Omg god.is good this product is all that.</li>
    <li> works nice and feels great.  Havent noticed a really big difference since using</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and try everything to tame it.  This didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
