    <li> As a rehab nurse these bed rails make it easier to assist our patients in their everyday needs. Would definitely buy aqain!</li>
    <li> meets requirements. Only comment is that compared to an identical unit, the one I purchased the interlocking tubes are not as snug and tend to shake.</li>
    <li> its strongand easy to hold ontoto get up[.for my husband who cant get up that easy sohe needed this and its excellent</li>
    <li> Good support for someone having trouble getting out of bed.  Strong and doesn&#x27;t move when bed moves.</li>
    <li> A bed side helper like this was the single most useful tool my brother Bill got for me after I caught a heavy duty stroke one year ago. I was visiting at Bill&#x27;s house. I ordered this one for a senior lady here; fresh out of surgery with a laminectomy. I know it will help . I have not installed it yet so quality wise I can not yet say. Maybe later. So I unfairly gave it 3 stars...it may deserve more. And thanks I am 80% better from the stroke.</li>
    <li> the smaller size is nice</li>
    <li> Amazing stable bed rail.  Worked great for my father who has only use of one arm.  It doesn&#x27;t move hardly at all, and is extremely helpful to get him out of bed.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as sturdy as an all metal rail.  The platform that fits between the mattress and box springs is a wide piece of plywood.  The metal rail is slightly loosely attached to it and can&#x27;t be tightened.  BUT it does the job.  I don&#x27;t think this would work for a larger person, tho, and a man may eventually pull it loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the only one I could find that is as narrow as I wanted, tho, and it does the job.</li>
    <li> It is easy to assemble, sturdy, and slides easily under the mattress.</li>
    <li> I am a home care Physical Therapist and recommend these bed rails to many of my patients. They only have to try it once and never want to let it go again, it makes getting out of bed SO much easier! I particularly like the small profile of the Freedom Grip, it gives you a great place to hold onto to pull yourself up, but does not get in your way either. As an added bonus, you have a nice place to push up from to get up to standing as well. If you have any problems with bed mobility, I highly recommend this bed rail!</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what I hoped it would do BUT....the photograph gave no clue about the large wood platform.  It is in fact very simple, functional and well constructed.  A diagram is needed to show it assembled.</li>
    <li> I went back and bought a second grip.  Sure helps save my back trying to get in and out of bed.</li>
    <li> My husband had back surgery five weeks ago.  He was struggling to get out of bed and we were anxious about falling. He says this is the BEST tool that he has used since surgery.  Simple to install and it has given him confidence especially when he gets out of bed during the night to use the bathroom.  Great item!!&lt;br /&gt;AND it came early last week.</li>
    <li> Bought this quite a while ago.  My mother would not be able to get out of bed without it.  Very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, strong, really supports a handy capped person getting in and out of bed. Recommend to all that need this kind of assistance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 89-year-old mother-in-law to assist her in sitting up to swing her legs over the side.  It installs smoothly under the mattress and is very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> Sturdy support for husband getting in and out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The Freedom Grip Bed Rail provides Mom a secure handle to hold when getting out of her bed.  It fits nicely under the mattress and does not obscure the area one needs to be should she need assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
    <li> My Mother had just recently suffered a stroke and without this she would not be able to get in or out of the bed.  Therapy was going to order one for me but at twice the price but I found it for 1/2 price on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy hand rail.  The attached board keeps the rail in place well. The rail works well for my mom, getting out of bed and readjusting herself as she gets comfortable.</li>
