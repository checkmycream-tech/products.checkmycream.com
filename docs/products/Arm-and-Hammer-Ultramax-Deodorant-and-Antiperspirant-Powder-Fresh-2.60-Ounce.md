<li> Keep me dry &amp; fresh ALL day long</li>
<li> The side effects of using other brands may include losing friends because your pits smell, large wet rings under your arms, and a loss of money in your wallet.</li>
<li> I also appreciate that it keeps me dry all day long and leaves no white residue on my clothes.  </li>
<li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like unscented ones because I don&#x27;t use any other fragrances</li>
<li> must admit it works just as well as the other scents</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s rather strong but not in a bad way</li>
<li> During de warmer months of the year it sometimes produces some irritation due to its antiperspirant power, so I tend to combine its use with conventional deodorants to prevent this effect.</li>
<li> this product is hard to find, but I bought it for my teenage daughter.  </li>
<li> Has a slight powder scent that does not conflict with scented lotions or perfume.  </li>
<li> Keeps me dry and stink-free through stressful days and serious work outs at the gym.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this product was missleading.</li>
<li> and I was afraid they quit making it.  </li>

    <li> Did not work for me at all.  I AM sweatier than many,   but still...  This was a complete waste of money.  Does not glide on invisibally, only  gunks on in white globs.    Did not help reduce my sweating.  Didn&#x27;t even have a stellar smell.</li>
    <li> Keep me dry &amp; fresh ALL day long</li>
    <li> Love. The smell is great but not overpowering. It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>

    <li> This is not a review that addresses the health risks of deodorant chemicals.  This product is not advertised as &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.  Is is simply Ultramax, and it delivers as such. As a woman, I appreciate the light powder scent which does not smell like perfume.  I also appreciate that it keeps me dry all day long and leaves no white residue on my clothes.  I have tried many other, more expensive, brands and they just don&#x27;t deliver as well as Arm and Hammer Ultramax.  The side effects of using other brands may include losing friends because your pits smell, large wet rings under your arms, and a loss of money in your wallet.</li>
    <li> I have been using Arm and Hammer powder fresh for years.  It has been the only deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t make my underarms itch.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately and I was afraid they quit making it.  I don&#x27;t like unscented ones because I don&#x27;t use any other fragrances and I like to smell good. the Powder fresh is a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am very allergic to chemicals and fragrances.  This deoderant is not free from those, but they&#x27;re gentle enough that I can use this.  It has a very light powder scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose and eyes.  For some reason this is inconsistently stocked in stores, so I bought a bunch online to last me.  The shipping makes it a bit more than it would cost in a store, but it saves the hassle of driving from store to store.  I have no complaints :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m furry...like Big Foot only not as tall...or as sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of fur equals lots of sweat which equals B.O. to the extreme.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used Arm &amp; Hammer Ultramax.&lt;br /&gt;Then they came out with this new one called Powder Fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit it works just as well as the other scents but it smells like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather strong but not in a bad way and anything is better than the Sweaty Yeti butt crack smell I exude without it.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great for me as I have a hard time finding this at my local stores.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant! The only one that Lets me go an entire day without any undesirable odors. After you purchase this product you&#x27;ll never want another deodorant again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was missleading. I ordered the powder fresh invisible solid deoderant which is what it shows in the picture. I was sent the non invisible solid. The picture and the description do not match. I did give them two stars because the order was delivered promptly and not damaged.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I discovered by reccommendation from a relative. I tried it and was pleasantly impressed. It is specially reccommendable for use over the winter season. During de warmer months of the year it sometimes produces some irritation due to its antiperspirant power, so I tend to combine its use with conventional deodorants to prevent this effect.</li>
    <li> this product is hard to find, but I bought it for my teenage daughter.  It might be cheap, but it holds her better than the $8 clinical strength.</li>
    <li> This deoderant works awesome and I need a strong deoderant.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite deodorant / antiperspirant.  Has a slight powder scent that does not conflict with scented lotions or perfume.  Keeps me dry and stink-free through stressful days and serious work outs at the gym.</li>
    <li> Good protection and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This deodorant antiperspirant is the only one that works for me. I highly recommend it. It keeps you dry and fresh all day long not to mention the price is right.</li>
