<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic product. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this and the Vitamin C Cream (which I use for daytime). I will continue to buy this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural truly has the best customer service I have experienced. Top notch!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!!! This is the first InstaNatural product I&#x27;ve bought and will not be the last! Love the way my face feels after I apply this product. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Feels very thick and greasy when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I love how my face feels. After about a month of use fine lines are fading and it is not making my face break out which still happens at 58!  Hope with longer use some of the deeper lines will fade.  Very pleased at this point.  Looking at puffy under eye cream next.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this cream, her skin is looking so much better after a couple of weeks using it. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This a very thick cream. So a little goes a long way. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine it effects on deep wrinkle lines.</li>
    <li> Sorry this night cream didn&#x27;t work for me, my complexion looked dry &amp; pasty after application even over a serum, plus I saw no real improvement after a months usage. The only good thing I can say is there&#x27;s a lot of it!</li>
    <li> InstaNatural has got to be one of my favorite brands when it comes to skin care products. I have tried quite a few of their products and I am never ever disappointed with the results that I get. I use this Night Cream under my favorite Anti Aging Serum before I hit the sack. The results I get from it impresses me. It really does a great job in keeping my face hydrated and eradicating fine lines. I love the fact that my skin is visibly brighter and plumper because of this product. I don’t think I will ever stop using/repurchasing this cream. It truly is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> This is a good night time moisturizer.  I have dry skin in the winter and this really seems to help.  Not oily and makes my skin feel softer.</li>
    <li> Wife has been using and is very pleased.  Her skin is much healthier looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving all the the products in this line a try... So far I am extremely happy.... It&#x27;s the same quality product as $150 bottle items for a tenth of the price... I will continue too purchase</li>
    <li> This cream is pretty heavy, but that is exactly what my skin needs. The comments other people have posted are true: a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Thick and pleasant smelling rich cream, love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super super satisfied with this product... I did a research for many other products as well but I liked this one since it&#x27;s natural and a good size for the price. I am 30 and I had adult acne problems. I did not want to write a review too soon so I waited 3 months (yes, it really last) and I can tell I&#x27;m in love with this night cream. I also use it mornings sometimes, my skin is looking smooth and clean, my face doesn&#x27;t get oily any more. Love it, love it!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using the instanatural night creAm and rose water last night! And I just love it! My face is so soft and wake up in the morning face feeling fresh. I&#x27;ll give an update in a week or two if my face like it and see changes. (Red itchy and dry acne).</li>
    <li> Omg ! I love this product. I&#x27;ve looking a for perfect night cream and I think I found it ! The texture is rich but when you rub it into your skin it absorb quick so doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residual on your skin. The best thing is my back feel soooooooo smooth when I wake up in the morning, oh also I like it has no sense so my boyfriend can use it too. You just have to try it !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product nightly for 3 months now.  It&#x27;s light and not greasy.  I see no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> It made me break out, I guess it didn&#x27;t agree with my skin</li>
    <li> Again love these cremes .. And the company making a product that works you can see the results .. I like the way they send you a email and explain how to use it best and give you tips .. Thumbs way up</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been looking for a night cream that doesn&#x27;t break me out but is moisturizing, and I found it in this product. I like that it is a pump bottle, as active ingredients in skin care products can spoil when touched by your hands. The pump bottle eliminates this possibility and it works wonderfully! I also purchased the eye gel by InstaNatural and I am quite pleased with that product as well. I will be repurchasing both!</li>
    <li> very good soothing night cream -i really like the texture : rich but not sticky or heavy -penetrate very well -it does helps my redness</li>
    <li> I can feel my skin became more firm</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using the products and have even shared them with my daughter</li>
    <li> The pump was broken &amp; would not dispense the cream.  I had to cut off the top to get to the cream with my fingers.  Now I have it covered with clear wrap &amp; a rubber band.  I sent a complaint, but never heard from  back.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing. I love it and the way my face feels after using it, morning and night.</li>
    <li> I was very interested in trying the Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Moisturizer. I have tried various moisturizers in the past for different skin problems, but have yet to find one that can treat everything I&#x27;m looking for without causing irritation. Some moisturizers are too heavy and will cause breakouts, some that treat acne will end up leaving my sensitive skin looking a little pink and irritated, or I see no change at all. Every product I have used from InstaNatural in the past has lived up to it&#x27;s promises, so I was ready to see if I could find a moisturizer that worked for me too!&lt;br /&gt;My skin can get a little dry and tight feeling if I spend too much time in the sun here in Hawaii. I also deal with hormonal acne since having my sons, so I don&#x27;t like using heavy or greasy moisturizers because I end up with even more breakouts. I have dark spots on my face that I also battle with, most of these are on the temple areas of my face. I have been able to get the ones on my forehead to fade with products in the past, but have not been able to get the worst spots around my temple areas to fade fully. Other than those two problems, I also have skin that can get irritated easily. (I gave up on acne spot treatments because I would end up with patches of flaky skin while my acne would heal.)&lt;br /&gt;As always, my product arrived from InstaNatural promptly and packaged well. The moisturizer comes in a 3.4 oz size container that fits in your hand, with a convenient pump for application. After cleansing and toning my skin as recommended, I applied the moisturizer. This formula is very thick and creamy. I quickly learned that a little goes a long way- so be careful not to pump out too much product. The Niacinamide Vitmain B3 Moisturizer has a faint clean, almost to no scent. When I first started applying, I have to admit I was worried that it might be too heavy because of it&#x27;s thickness. The moisturizer cream actually absorbed rather quickly and left my skin feeling soft. Once my skin absorbed it, there was no shine or greasy feeling that moisturizers have left me in the past.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural recommends to use this product morning and night. I have to admit, in the 2 weeks I used it before writing the review, I didn&#x27;t always use it in the mornings. Sometimes I sleep too late and rush in the mornings, skipping my routine to make sure I get my kiddo to school in time. I always take the time at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;The greatest benefit I saw, almost instantly within the first couple of days was beautiful hydrated and soothed skin. Any areas that were previously irritated, dry, and colored pink were soothed. With time any acne flare ups were less severe, and were lighter in color when they did show up. The dark spots near my temples have faded slightly which is wonderful for me. I am hoping they will continue to fade with continued use. I feel as though using this product is like using a reset button over night. It erases any dryness or irritation the day has brought. I wake up with my skin feeling soft, smooth and no signs of irritation. This is wonderful because it means that when I apply makeup to go out, I use less since I need less coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I love this moisturizer. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say, only positive from my own personal experience and benefits I saw using it. It&#x27;s thick and creamy without weighing down your skin or leaving a greasy residue. It soothes any irritation your skin may suffer from, and reduces and color your skin might have whether from acne or sun damage. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;And once again, with InstaNatural you don&#x27;t have to worry about the ingredients and what you are applying to your skin. With InstaNatural you know you are using natural and organic ingredients. I love that they also offer a lifetime manufacture guarantee, so what have you got to lose?bsorbed it, there was no shine or greasy feeling that moisturizers have left me in the past.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural recommends to use this product morning and night.

    <li> This night cream is odorless and absorbent. Like Insta Natural&#x27;s Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream,it has a pump for easy dispensing. A little goes a long way with this creaml. Left my face feeling soft and smooth. No greasy after feel. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream. It has helped my face a lot but it is a little thicker than others I have tried. It takes a little to rub in and it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well, but it is still an awesome product that does great. My face has had less break outs and looks better all around since using. I( use to have a very bad dry flaky patch in between my eyebrows that was stubborn but this night cream has cleared it up. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me like others I have used. I received this to review but will be buying in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used in once so far, just last night.  I&#x27;m pleased with how smooth my face feels in the morning.  When I rub my hands to my skin, there is a bunch of gook rolling off, so I think this stuff absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay product not the best not the worst.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Need a longer time frame to review.</li>
    <li> I have been trying out different moisturizers in order to find a good fit for the bitterly cold winter we have had. My goal has been to find something that moisturizers but that is not too heavy. I have been using this for almost a month now and really like it. I find it very nourishing without that greasy feeling that is so common. A little goes a long way and I have to admit that I like to save the best I can so the fact that I can use very little and prolong the bottle is a good thing. I&#x27;m glad I was given the opportunity to try out this night cream, now I just need to get a daytime SPF.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It moisturizes my skin and at the same time plumps up my skin as well. It is a rather heavy moisturizer but it dries very quickly. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it being greasy or leaving any type of film on my skin. Once it dried, it was as if I didn&#x27;t have anything on. It soaked right in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural&#x27;s Niacinamide Vitamin B3 moisturizer. I have been using this product for about three weeks and am very pleased with the results. I use it in conjunction with the InstaNatural&#x27;s youth express eye gel. I have noticed that my skin is smoother, softer and my complexion is more even. I notice that my face has a more youthful glow and I could not be more satisfied with this moisturizer.  I also appreciated the companies follow up directions for use after I ordered the product, as well as the follow up email to make sure that I was satisfied. I have never ordered a product before and received this additional customer service. I would recommend this product and company to anyone that I know.</li>
    <li> I received the Insta Natural product Niacinamide with Vitain B3 moisturizer for review.  I was excited because I have used Insta Natural products before and have always been pleased.  The cream came in a pump form.  It was very difficult to pump the cream out as it was very thick.  It did not come out in a consistent flow, but rather in spurts.  I thought maybe because it was the beginning of the cream, but as I continued using it, the inconsistency continued.  The scent had a clean strong scent- nothing impressive.  I felt that it did not spread as smoothly as other Insta Natural products. It definitely did hydrate the skin as the dryness seemed to dissipate.  This time of year, that is a plus. I would most likely attribute that property to the rose hip oil it contains.  It also claims to plump the skin, but I did not see too much of that.  The cream as okay enough to use up, but I a no sure I would purchase it again. This, honestly, was one of the first products from Insta Natural that was so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMd6e61c4629c39427f2c80058a569759b&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> One word..Awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use it day and night.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the night cream. My skin feels smooth and hydrated,  especially since I live in Rhode Island and the winter leaves my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> Great Night Cream moisturizer. My skin feels so soft and fresh in the morning</li>
    <li> Love it so far. Thick and creamy. Smooth on in a circular motion as suggested. Not greasy and soaks in well. Keep away from oily areas of the face. Good for face, under eyes, neck and upper chest area.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this night cream.  My skin tends to get dry and patchy, and this cream has helped to rejuvenate it, making it feel refreshed and healthier.  I am glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  This time of year my combination skin gets super dry and and this soaks in without leaving an oily residue.  Have not seen any particular improvement to my skin other than helping with the dryness, but it has only been about a week since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have never seen 300-400 reviews for a beauty product that equa 5 stars on average on one product, but this brand has that on their ENTIRE line!!!! it must be the real real deal right? Wrong, these reviews are fake, they are from professional reviewers who get paid and or the product for free to give five stars and say nice things. dont believe me? Well click on the name of ANY of the people who leave 5 stars and you will find a pattern, they all give five stars to everything they &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; and speak highly and they all reviews darn near the same products as the next and finally they on occasion write exactly the same comment. reall review have many 1,2, 3, 4, and 5 star review but these products dont. Amazon quit allowing/promoting this abuse or the integrity of you review system will be greatly diminished!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions to this cream.  I love the texture and scent.  The company is wonderful to work with. I have tried 3 products and so far all have worked well with my skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is amazing. I woke up and my skin was really even and moisturized I even got a compliment on it. I just wish there was a little more slip because you have to really rub it in good being so thick. Overall i&#x27;m pleased with it and it helps take the redness down on my acne and keeps my skin hydrated</li>
    <li> Feels greasy and does not really soak into skin. No visible improvement in 3 weeks</li>
    <li> As you have stated, &amp;#34;The Best Night Cream Moisturizer</li>
    <li> The results are instant, love this product.</li>
    <li> I use the cream day and night, it is a good moisturizer cream, I feel skin are well hydrated.  I just feel a little sticky when first put on.  Overall it is a good night moisturizer cream.</li>
    <li> I received this night cream as a sample. I am 61 with very dry skin. I feel that this night cream has made a very positive difference for my skin. It really helped with the dryness of the winter air.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It is so light feeling and tightens my skin.  It seems to plump up my skin as well.  Why just use it at night?  I use it whenever I see it on my bathroom counter!  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have been using it for the past month and have definitely noticed a difference. I put it on as the final step in my nightly skin care routine, a night mask to seal in the other products and the moisture. It is very moisturizing, but it sinks in and dries pretty quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair or pillows, but in the morning, when I wash my face, I can feel that it has been on there all night doing its work. When it gets wet, it gets slippery and washes off with a little face wash, and my skin is plump and hydrated. The bottle is very convenient with a nice pump and a cover to prevent a mess when travelling. It only takes about one pump to cover your whole face, so I suspect I will be using this one bottle for quite a while, but when it does run out I will certainly be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this from InstaNatural LLC and was very happy with their service, it arrived on time, well packaged, and they even followed up to ensure I was happy with my purchase. Great seller, if you buy this go with InstaNatural! :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have extremely sensitive skin and other products made me break out or dried my skin up. Thus night cream is rich and hydrates very well. I am recommending it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Nobody is paying me for this review. I have to tell you that this is a very good product, it works for me instantly and I am very happy about this product. You don&#x27;t have to spend to much for a very good results.</li>
    <li> I alternate between the Retinol, and the Night Cream each night. The night cream is a bit thick and heavy feeling when liberally applied to face, which at first felt &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34;. I was worried it would clog my pores, and leave acne in it&#x27;s place. BUT, after washing it off in the morning my skin has NEVER felt so SOFT, and even toned since my preteen years!!! No acne...nothing but healthier looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;The company shipped it right away, and sent me an email with instructions, information, and tips. I use 7 of InstaNatutal&#x27;s products because of my first purchase about 2 months ago!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  My skin was dry and sensitive, now well-moisturized with no more break-outs. I&#x27;ve had clearing of bumps under the skin as well. My face now feels supple and more firm.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> So Sorry, I thought I was reviewing the coffee I purchased through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars are not for the coffee, but for the NIACINAMIDE VITAMIN B3 MOISTURIZER, which is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;And I would definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the Original Donut Shop Coffee that I would not order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Original Donut Shop Coffee was not advertised as Extra Bold, but was on the coffee label,&lt;br /&gt;after receiving it.  It also said \\&quot;not for resale\\&quot; on the label.&lt;br /&gt;Did not have a good, nor fresh taste.  Did not like it at all, and have purchased at a Big Box Store for&lt;br /&gt;much less with a fresher coffee taste.</li>
    <li> very bad,i didn&#x27;t see any thing be changed after i used it.</li>
    <li> First time user of InstaNatural over 10 products.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely repurchase w the facts that they are made in the U.S. with natural products that my skin texture and overall had improved to a younger and more vibrant looking face.  Speedy delivery.  Nice packaging with clear listed labeling of logo, ingredients, size, benefits, usage directions, ctc info, address, caution, and expiration date.  Super customer service by Phil who was prompt and detailed to the customer&#x27;s needs and concerns.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to be my &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream, but sadly it is not. It has a sticky feeling while it&#x27;s drying after application, and the only thing I can compare it to is feeling like glue drying. My skin is naturally dry, when I wake up the morning after applying I don&#x27;t have that dewy feeling other&#x27;s have described.</li>
    <li> Very heavy cream. It is moisturizing but leaves a heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> I wish I never tried this product,  don&#x27;t ever waste your money on this product. This s***ty ass product made around my chin more darker than it was.</li>
    <li> Love this - wake up and my skin feels rejuvenated!</li>
    <li> This has become part of my nightly ritual and I love it. It hydrates my skin while I sleep.</li>
    <li> Only been using the product a few days, but am satisfied with the results I am seeing. I also loved getting an email from the company with additional instructions for their product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really renews my skin and is very brightening!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer treatment cames in a 3.4 ounce container with a pump. Just a little of this goes a long way. I used smaller than a dime sized amount and it was enough for my whole face. Right away I could feel a slight tightening of my skin. When I reached up to feel my face, it felt soft and smooth. I like this product because it fights wrinkles, dark spots, and uneven skin tone. It combats aging and also soothes acne and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate a product that addresses so many different issues. It also has wonderful ingredients including vitamin c and rosehip oil. What else could you ask for in a skin treatment?</li>
    <li> Very nice weight to this moisturizer.  I do not like it when something is heavy and greasy.  This absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is a little greasy and I have oily skin, but I am using it regardless because it works well with my powder foundation in the morning. But after one 1/2 weeks use I am noticing my skins complexion is so clear! So far I am happy and I am excited to see results after a month or so!</li>
    <li> Tightens and firms up skin, not to heavy just right.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product together with the InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum and began using both products at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: This cream is thick and feels absolutely decadent.  A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I&#x27;m not sure whether this cream or the Hyaluronic acid serum was responsible, but after a few days of use, I ended up with a horrible break-out and had to discontinue using both products.  I&#x27;ve never had acne before, so this was a real surprise to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was not able to use the product for long enough to see any results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice night time moisturizer. My skin is always so dry, especially during the winter months. This helps combat that. I love that it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily at all. It goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling that way. I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne per se, but I do have the occasional breakout. Since using this night cream I haven&#x27;t noticed any break outs or blemishes. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week or two and I&#x27;m very impressed  with the results I&#x27;ve gotten. You don&#x27;t need much of this stuff because a little goes a very long way. I can see myself making this a part of my nightly routine from here on out. While I did receive this product at an amazing promotional rate, this experience is that of my own and hasn&#x27;t been influenced by any outside sources. I would totally recommend this to anyone who is looking for a night cream that really does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Made my skin so soft! Love it</li>
    <li> Works great. I am definitely recommending this cream.</li>
    <li> I am rewriting this review because my first one was denied..???..Ok so I bought Age defying and skin clearing serum, Night cream and Vitamin C moisturizer and RETURNED THEM ALL. I had to review these because i Bought them ALL with my own money and felt like I had to make a review on all three of these products.&lt;br /&gt;Just search Simple Darling Instanatural&lt;br /&gt;After I did the online review, I decided I had to return all of them because I was not happy. I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> Kind of feels heavy on my skin after applying.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smooth texture. Spreads easily and absorbs quickly. Almost no fragrance which I love. Have been using it for only just over a week and have already had positive comments on my skin. Helps my acne. Reasonably priced. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I really love this night cream. When I wake up in the morning my skin is smooth and hydrated. Also my face wakes up looking refreshed which is a big deal for me because I have constant dark circle under my eyes. I definitely notice a difference in my face if I do not use the cream I look dreadful in the morning. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure, I mean it feels good and all does not irritate or anything, not sure if it does anything spectacular but we&#x27;ll see I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long so...</li>
    <li> This is just okay nothing special.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for bedtime.  It&#x27;s not too greasy, and does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> This night cream is the perfect moisturizing cream to use right before bed. It has a thick consistency and has a soothing effect which is great for night time. It moisturizers well and I wake up with my skin feeling refreshed. To be honest I didn&#x27;t expect the moisturizer to work as good as it did! Its creamy and soothing and i can feel working! It moisturized my skin so well I was amazed! My skin now feels silky smooth. I love the texture of this product as well! It really does what it promises! I highly recommend this moisturizer because it has given my skin a healthy glow as well as the vitamins my skin needs to remain youthful and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I love this night cream, it feels really good on my skin. I have been using this for about a month now and prior to that I always avoided night cream because they seemed so heavy on my face. This just seeped into the skin and left my skin feeling smooth and soft, I noticed that my make up looks better during the day since I have been using this product.</li>
    <li> I am sure many of these reviews are fake. Look at the profiles of some of those who have given 5 stars, looks like they are paid reviewers. They get paid to give 5 stars to everything.</li>
    <li> A little definitely goes a long way with this product. I hated it the first couple of times I used it because it made my skin feel heavy. It was because I applied too much because I was use to the high dollar products that didn&#x27;t work unless you slathered it on. Having been using this product for a month my skin looks so much better.</li>
    <li> I bought all of the InstaNatural serums and moisturizers  This is my favorite.  It&lt;br /&gt;provides all night moisture and it has a pleasant scent.  Best of all it does not&lt;br /&gt;cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this gentle, natural moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve added this product to my arsenal for helping my skin stay hydrated. I like the fact that it has a creamy texture &amp; absorbs quickly into my skin. I believe it has helped keep my dry skin at bay, especially the recent problem areas of my chin. It just seems my face has become more dryer as I am aging, and I like not only how well this works, but also how I can actually see a difference with it&#x27;s use. It is also helping keep the wrinkles less noticeable, which is a nice added bonus.</li>
    <li> Update 5/21/15: I received the skin brightening serum and have been using it with the night cream. I wake up with refreshed skin every morning now. My skin is very smooth and the dry patches I get every spring/summer have been kept at bay. This has been extremely helpful in combating my rough, irritated skin from blowing my nose due to allergies. I just put a little extra around my nose at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off: I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;prior to this night cream I was using Burts bees radiance night cream. I prefer this instanatural night cream. My skin feels baby bottom smooth in the morning. The lotion doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or too thick cream as these were my issues with the Burts bees.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this lotion and other products from instanatural  (purchased at retail price) for several weeks now and the difference is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite! I not only use it on my face but also on my the backs of my hands, my neck and chest. It makes skin so soft while also plumping my lines on my forehead.  I wake up feeling like my skin has been moisturized and also repaired throughout the night. I have also noticed a more even skin tone !!! I think this is a great product for anyone in their late 20s +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Great results!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past three weeks.  I really like it and it has helped calm my extremely dry skin. My skin feels so soft and my fine lines have diminished.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It really does moisturize your skin but it breaks me out.</li>
    <li> Great product feels nice on skin with amazing price!</li>
    <li> Love this night cream - really thick but not greasy. The people who work for this company are super helpful, too. Excited to try more of their products!</li>
    <li> Prior to this purchase, I had never heard of the InstaNatural product line.  I was looking for a night cream that would hydrate my face without causing irritation or breakouts (as many others tend to do), so I did a general Amazon search and looked through the products with the best reviews and came across this one.  I received this cream a few weeks ago and have used it every night since and have been very pleased with the results.  I have sensitive, pale skin with a number of acne scars and this has not caused any irritation and has also seemed to lighten the scars.  I&#x27;ve also been very happy with the amount of hydration it provides--not too thick or thin, just right.  It has a very light (not bothersome) scent, nice creamy texture, and better ingredients than most other drugstore brands.  I am also a fan of the bottle/pump application as I believe it lends itself well to keeping bacteria out unlike other kinds of lotions where you squeeze it out.  Lastly, the customer service for the company seems to really care about their customers as I received a \\&quot;tips &amp; directions\\&quot; email after my purchase providing some good advice for application and told me to reply directly to the email if I had any questions/concerns.  I think I&#x27;ve found my go-to night cream and will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I use it day and night!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Within the first week, I was able to see and feel a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s brighter and scars are fading! So glad I went with this product- highly recommend it! Bonus- it smells great!</li>
    <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
    <li> I received the product as a promotion tog give my unbiased opinion. I actually do love the product because it does what it says it does and it&#x27;s not grease. That is a bonus for me because I already have oily skin and I don&#x27;t want the cream to just sit on my face without being absorbed</li>
    <li> Wife:  Use this each evening and sometimes twice a day in the winter months.  Feels smooth and not greasy or heavy.  Leaves skin supple and smooth.  I have dry skin to begin with and this cream does the trick.  Also use the day cream as well. Priced very reasonably.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin. Made my skin burn and doesn&#x27;t feel soft, sticky. Very disappointed. I wanted to love it.</li>
    <li> i think this product is really going to work over time since it seems to be working already.  I love the feel of it and my skin is looking better. will purchase again</li>
    <li> I I try to be as natural as possible when it comes to my skin and hair care, and the ingredient list for this product is comfortingly short and understandable. This cream has no scent and has a very smooth texture. I didn&#x27;t get all of my skin care concerns addressed by it, but my sensitive skin felt notably soft and seemed &amp;#34;calmer&amp;#34;. I had no irritation or redness, in fact some of the usual redness seemed less than normal. It didn&#x27;t work well for me on my fine lines nor on the puffiness under my eyes, but my skin...is weird. The packaging is great because the measured pump is consistent and gives just the right amount. The customer service from the company is amazing! They had sent 2 emails to ask about my experience and when I replied that I didn&#x27;t think it was right for me, then sent a very pleasant response and refunded my purchase price. Easy.</li>
    <li> All of a sudden dark circles appeared under my eyes.  I purchased as a preventative measure because dark circles around the eyes are something that most people in my family have (young &amp; old).  I had no circles until I purchased this and another product by InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My face is much softer and feels great!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why many people have good review of this thing. I have used several InstaNatural products for its natural ingredients, but this one gives my face stingy and almost burning feeling. And it&#x27;s really oily, almost like sunscreen, and hard to absorb. Please avoid using it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I have really dry skin so I use this in the morning and at night. My face is left moisturized but not greasy like some other products. I love trying new facial products all the time but I really don&#x27;t think anything can top this one so I will be using it for a while :)</li>
    <li> It hydrates and plumps! I love the feeling when I put this lotion on my face before bed. It also smells great. It is super moisturizing and seems to plump and tighten my skin!</li>
    <li> Love the texture and the way my skin feels! Looking forward to future results!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this night cream.  It says that it can be used during the day also.  She will definitely be buying more of this.  She says that it makes her face feel supple and smooth.  She recommends this.</li>
    <li> I use many of the InstaNatural face treatments, and I like combining this Night Cream Moisturizer with their Rose Hip Oil in the palm of my hand to apply.  I am not disappointed with their products after using them for the past month.  I was concerned my wrinkles would return after purposely stopping the use of retinol creams I&#x27;d used for several years.  But InstaNatural products have amply replaced the retinol and keep wrinkles at bay, also giving skin nice texture.  This product absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
    <li> Feels like wax, and smells.</li>
    <li> First time using it and as soon as I put some on my hand it smelled like fried food. Odd scent. Even after several minutes I could still smell it. I felt like I had been frying food all day. Not happy. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nourish your skin. Moisturize and repair dry skin. Give your face the moisture it needsFight aging overnight with this night treatment, designed to even skin tone and reduce the look of age spots for younger-looking skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about a week now and have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin. I only use it at night since it does feel a little heavy on my skin but when I wake up, my face is soft and glowing. I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product! I bought it plus the serum, they came very quickly and were packaged nicely. I have been using them for a week now and my skin seems smoother.</li>
    <li> Heavy cream, it clogged my pores.  Cheap quality.  I had breakouts after using this product.  I gave this product a try for more than a month to see results but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great night cream to stay young. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> This is a lovely rich and thick cream. It glides on very smoothly. It absorbs into your skin very well without leaving a greasy feeling on your face. This is the perfect anti-aging moisturizer to help fight the signs of wrinkles, dark spots, hyper-pigmentation. I just LOVE InstaNatural products, I got this for *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive mature skin and over the years I have tried a lot of moisturizers. Most caused breakouts or didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin leaving my face and neck a sticky mess. When I bought this product I was skeptical that it would do what it says it would do because of the price. I am so happy that I ordered it.  The product does what it says it will do - I love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this night cream!! It feels great on my skin. I have been using it after the Instanatural facial toner. The moisturizer absorbs into my skin well and I also like that it does not have a strong odor (it has a neutral smell). I recommend this product for anyone looking for a good quality night cream!</li>
    <li> Great product works well.</li>
    <li> I love this product, as I do all products I have tried by InstaNatural. It feels so nice on  my skin and my face looks great! No problems at all!</li>
    <li> It is a good nature product. My skin looks good after using serum and this cream. I am going to try the day cream, wish InstaNatural have the day cream with SFP.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I received this cream approximately 2 weeks ago.  I started using the first night.  I noticed it is rather thick, so 1/2 pump was plenty for my entire face. It absorbed pretty quickly and when I woke up the next morning, my face felt smooth and moisturized, but not greasy. I have ordered a few products from this line and I really like them all!  No need to purchase expensive department store skin care products, Instanatural works!</li>
    <li> I use this at bedtime after washing my face. I like the lightness of it and can tell a defference in my skin the following morning. Softer skin.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, hydrating cream. I use it day and night. I will consider another purchase when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer-hydrating. Very pleased with InstaNatural products and great prices!</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a week but I have seen some improvement.</li>
    <li> This cream is pretty awesome.  The pump works perfectly, and the moisturizer has a thick consistency, but absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t wear heavy on the face.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update - I DID buy again.  Love this stuff!***</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong and gave me a headache. I am sensitive to scents, though. I tried using it a couple times, and each time I had a headache. Sadly this just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this cream as the first bottle did an excellent job on a dry spot on my forehead. I have used many products and this is the only one that took care of it. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy feeling for night wear either.</li>
    <li> I have used many of InstaNatural products. My daughter was having small acne problem and asked me what she should use and InstaNatural Night Cream Moisturizer Treatment for Face is the one that I suggested to her. Along with Vitamin C it also contains Niacinamide and Matrixyl 3000. The Niacinamide is good for acne prone skin and keeps the pores clean and helps in irritation of skin as well. With almost a month of use, I can see that her face has cleared up and the hyperpigmentation is reduced. It has also smoothed her skin and her face looks brighter and radiant. Rosehip oil and Argan oil hydrated the skin and give it a plump appearance. Like all other InstaNatural products it comes with their 100% satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Not greasy at all and smells great. I wake up with very soft skin!</li>
    <li> Eh, this cream is just so-so for me.  I did not notice any change at all, even right after applying.  My derm recommended Cerave&#x27;.  I&#x27;ll stick with that.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer. I think that its firming and the smell is very non-intrusive. I&#x27;m 30 so I only use night creams to moisturize my combination skin, I felt that this stuff worked quite well and wasn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
    <li> Too sticky. And I have found other products that deliver better results.  Will use this on my hands, neck and chest.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this cream so far. Have only been using a few weeks so don&#x27;t see a big difference yet. Will continue to use it though. Like the way it feels and smells. Looking forward to trying more products from InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream daily for about 3weeks. I love how it is absorbed into skin and feels good. I use it in morning and it isn&#x27;t greasy ! I love the pump container also, Great product!</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use my face broke out &amp; had  to stop using&#x27; as breakouts got worse.My skin is almost cleared up now. Could be allergic to Vitamin C maybe?? Would like a refund if possible.</li>
    <li> no difference in my skin using this product.Won&#x27;t buy again, and tossed the bottle. Waste of money for me</li>
    <li> This is s great night cream moisturizer. I use it after a vitamin c serum and love the way my face feels in the morning. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy. Just moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Nice, thick night cream - love it!</li>
    <li> This night cream is absolutely fabulous!  The consistency is perfect, and it&#x27;s effects are noticed right away.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just started using a night cream and I&#x27;m really liking this. My skin feels great in the morning, no dryness at all. Great packaging and good information was emailed to me from the company. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is very hydrating and feels good to put at night! I scent is nice to!</li>
    <li> I got this with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. The 2 together just work miracles. The deep wrinkle between my eyebrows does not look so deep anymore. I have noticed that the huge wrinkle between eyebrows is slowly looking not so big. My skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night since it came and I see a definite improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> I can really tell the difference in the texture and tone of my skin. I was surprised when I took a photo for a web page and saw my picture. I do use it in combination with another moisturizer; however, it was only after adding this product that I saw significant results.</li>
    <li> I woke up with the softest skin ever. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of good night moisturizers, but this one wins the prize.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes but I always just sweaty and uncomfortable with this on.</li>
    <li> Nice product, absorbs easily, not greasy. I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this smells nice and light and works great in the am and pm</li>
    <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was really excited about trying this night cream. Very disappointed that only after 1 night of use, I started seeing pimples around my mouth the following morning. After day 3, I had broken out all over my face. I stopped its use and my face cleared. Will never try it again.</li>
    <li> GREAT REORDERING works</li>
    <li> Just started using night moisturizer and I like this product</li>
    <li> I like it, work well on my face</li>
    <li> I do like this  night cream cream a lot . Nice texture and feel good on skin. Been using  the vitamin  c before day and night, and feel missing alitttle as a night  cream. This fits right into the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I n the morning  I can definitely  see smooth and  plumped skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS ITEM WITH A DISCOUNT TO TRY, BUT MY OPINION IS UN BIASED AND HONEST.</li>
    <li> I have been using the InstaNatural Night Cream for several weeks.  I like how great it feels, it is not a heavy feel.  I apply it over the InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines.  I do like this product very much.  I like how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Been using this Night dream for a month or so. I like how it softens my face. It keeps my face nice and hydrated and I look refreshed in the morning. So far it seems good, I need to give it more time to see how well it does as far reducing fine lines. I don&#x27;t have them very pronounced don&#x27;t have hardly any. A few light very fine ones underneath the eyes. I  was blessed with pretty good skin. I so far very pleased with the serums I use (all instanatural beauty products) I use 3 different serums. I apply each one giving each one time to absorb really good, doesn&#x27;t take long. Within seconds my skin absorbs it in pretty quick. Then I apply this night cream. Oh and after washing my face I use my own toner first and then apply serums making sure my face is nice and clean. Seems like it helps ur face to absorb everthing (serums,creams fairly quick I&#x27;d say), so far I&#x27;m very pleased with products. Will keep using. Will update in another month.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use a &amp;#34;night cream&amp;#34; as like we all know they&#x27;re usually heavy and greasy feeling for hours, if not all night.  I have acne prone skin, oily, but get flaky-oily (if that makes sense?) even if I use a gentle exfoliate weekly.  I was nervous about trying a cream, with such sensitive skin I figured for sure I&#x27;d break out. Nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the ONLY reason it gets 4 stars is because it feels heavy after a full night (I&#x27;m a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; faced in the AM).  But, I&#x27;m not breaking out!  Wish I could give 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is extremely gentle, and feels wonderful when applied.  It absorbs quickly, I use it on face, under-chin, neck, and chest (I tend to get sun color there even with SPF, trying to reverse or slow down that aging!).  I don&#x27;t feel greasy, nor look greasy/shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is hard to describe, it&#x27;s so faint, but a very soothing non-invasive scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the toner and serum.  The first morning, I laughed out loud!  My layers of bags and puffiness (every morning) were non-exsistant!  My skin tone was even, I didn&#x27;t look exhausted, even though I was.  I&#x27;ve been using this regimen for a week now, and every morning I am noticing better and better results.  I literally can&#x27;t believe that after all these years I&#x27;ve finally found products, and a night cream, that I can use that not only don&#x27;t break me out, but THEY WORK!  They don&#x27;t just put a layer on my skin, they&#x27;re IN my skin, working and improving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example of how fast this works:  I got ink (the color of a bad bruise, or nasty scab) on several fingers a few days ago - I&#x27;ve been scrubbing, and the air has been dry - my hands were starting to crack and looked 80 yrs old (I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s).  I put a pump of this cream into my hands before bed - soaked right in... this morning, I immediately checked them - they look so young!! Even after washing three times and not applying any more cream/lotion, they&#x27;re still supple and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this companies products enough, they&#x27;re amazing.  I&#x27;m blown away at how fast they work, how gentle they are, and I&#x27;m in love with my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin!enough, they&#x27;re amazing.  I&#x27;m blown away at how fast they work, how gentle they are, and I&#x27;m in love with my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin!</li>
    <li> Keeps face moisturized throughout the night.  Very rich and silky.  Nice product; will try eye cream next.</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone, combination skin. I saw a reduction in the small bumps on my forehead after my first few applications - after that, I experienced no other results. I was hoping to fade acne marks with its niacamide and vitamin c content, but no success. The texture was also a bit greasy and non-absorbing, and not moisturizing enough. I am disappointed since the reviews and ingredients seemed promising.</li>
    <li> Not meant for people with oily skin, feels greasy on face all day long  after use</li>
    <li> It works for me.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Consistency is far too thick for my liking. And i have not seen any results. Customer service however is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I like many insta naturals products, just not this one.</li>
    <li> This really cleared up my adult acne!!  I could also see fine lines disappearing along with more glowing skin!!</li>
    <li> Love this, the moisturizer has a thick consistency, perfect for the cold weather and keeps my face hydrated.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have already bought a second one. This a very thick cream that absorbs well. It is unscented. I was not overly crazy about the unscented smell. I have become very particular about this as I get older. I then decided to add some essential oils; some for their beneficial properties (I have melasma) and others for olfactory balance. I first scented one as lavender for the evening. I found myself using it in the am and thought hmmm I could order an am one....I used a rose/Ylang-ylang for the am. It is difficult to find ready made products w/ great ingredients. This is a great base and I think it is well worth customizing the smell.</li>
    <li> Ever since I tried insta naturals products I have fallen in love. The are 100% awesome. I started by ordering this as my night cream. The vitamin c serum and the brightening scrub. The night cream is great. You only need a little pea size and I don&#x27;t even bother with eye cream this does just fine on it&#x27;s own. It makes my skin feel so soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great and delivery was right on time.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly. It has a very light and pleasant smell. A little goes a long way. Liking the results. Just bought my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product when I first started using it. It has been a couple of weeks since I have been using it (day and night) and I LOVE IT. My skin is soft with no breakouts. I do tend to get oily on my T-zone area of my face but that is pretty normal to me. I would recommend to keep using this to see results at least for 2 weeks. At first i broke out a little but as I started to use this day and night for couple of weeks, I was impressed with how much it hydrated my skin and provided glow.</li>
    <li> Sooo hydrating! It&#x27;s hands down the best moisturizer for me. No grease, convenient pump, and pretty awesome results with consistent use. I apply it both in the morning and at night, and my skin is a lot less angry looking from being previously abused with harsher treatments.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Soaks in nicely, hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.  My skin is very soft and less greasy in the t-zone.</li>
    <li> This product, to my surprise, is really good. Fine lines have started facing away and my skin look great. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most products I try. But this didn&#x27;t burn or make me break out. One happy gal right here</li>
    <li> I really liked this night cream, but I ended up returning it to Amazon because it was rather thick for me.  I was applying it at night before bed, but it&#x27;s just too hot this time of year in California to wear such a heavy cream. I have oily skin, and this was a bit too much for me. I think it would be fantastic for someone with dry skin though.</li>
    <li> This cream and brand is my most favorite of all. It glides on my face and keeps my skin soft all night long. I suggest highly that you try&lt;br /&gt;the eye gel and any other product from this line. It is Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a creamy texture that seems to absorb quickly into the skin, giving you a feeling of deep moisture and elasticity in your face.  Living in Florida, it&#x27;s important to moisturize.  In the daytime, we use sunblock, but moisturizing at night is also important and this product does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I really like how soft it makes my skin feel. It sits well under makeup without making your skin oily.</li>
    <li> I just started using this moisturizer and I am noticing that my lines are not as noticeable, but I have also noticed that my skin is more sensitive in the sun. I also like the fact that it is not all thick and leaving a thick film on my face after using. I am using it along with their  InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the day moisturizer also and love both of them.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome night cream! It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky. You don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s there but it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth in the morning!</li>
    <li> I have been using the night moisturizer for over a year...I have tried many other products and the Insta Natural night cream is wonderful for keeping my skin hydrated. I work outside in the winter so I use as a day cream then.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of research on skincare. And I mean A LOT. Instanaturals products have all the leading ingredients proven to work in anti-aging and skin health. They also list the percentages of the main ingredients clearly. This is so important (and unusual!) because you need to know if the percentage of a particular ingredient in a product is high enough to effect change in the skin. For many popular and expensive products, the answer is no, they do not contain enough. This particular product is comparable to Nia 24 which is much more expensive and has dangerous parabens in it. I quit using the product a long time ago due to this and hadn&#x27;t found a good, safe alternative. I use this on my face and hands. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles on my face yet except light crows feet but my hands are crepey (kinda weird because I&#x27;m only 41). My hands are embarrassing to me, so I decided on this product in hopes of correcting this (Matrixyl and niacinamide). My hands have improved greatly but I do have to use it every day or they go right back. Therefore, I&#x27;m not sure that this is doing me any long term benefit really as far as collagen growth or elasticity improvement. But my hands look so good every day, and at this price point, I will continue to order. Additionally, there&#x27;s a wealth of research around both ingredients anti-aging benefits, so I will continue to give it time. I have also ordered for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for offering us girls that can&#x27;t spend hundreds of dollars on skincare a better option!&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie T.</li>
    <li> i like the feel of the moisturizer and that it absorbs quickly.  i live in the northeast so i&#x27;ll be anxious to see how it is in the winter.  i only use it once a day so it took longer to see a change</li>
    <li> The moisturizer has a thick and rich feeling. It&#x27;s great for my dry, winter skin!</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with severe acne. Now that I am in my twenties, I have become self-conscious about the minor acne scars that I developed in my teens. This moisturizer has done wonders with my skin by minimizing the appearance of my acne scars and dark spots in the month that I&#x27;ve been using it. This night cream is more of an emulsion than light moisturizer, so it does take a little getting used to. However, after a few weeks it should feel like velvet on your skin. This was well worth the $20.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The cream has become much stickier. Also, no long term changes in my skin have occurred. I will be purchasing another brand.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It is thick but not too thick for a night cream. My skin feels so soft after I use it.  I am ready to order it again ...but I would like to try some other ones as well...(from InstaNatural:-)</li>
    <li> This cream is thick and feels luxurious.  It makes my skin feel moist for hours.  I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week but so far I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Cream is kind of thick and took about half a minute to fully absorb into the skin. Didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything better than other moisturizer (Used it for a few months).</li>
    <li> so far, very please with the cream ... absorbs nicely, no break outs</li>
    <li> Superb line of skincare at a fraction of higher-end product prices.</li>
    <li> Night cream - made my skin dry after use for a few days. I meant dry dry. At first I thought it a good thing because I normally have a oily skin but it&#x27;s not. It made my makeup look horrible. and some review said it safe around the eyes. I&#x27;m not sure about that cuz it burn my under eye bad.</li>
    <li> I liked this cr&amp;egrave;me. it is good for my skin</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot, not only bc it&#x27;s in a jar that you pump and keeps the bacterial out, but bc it works!  It&#x27;s silky smooth and feels great and I believe it works well (so far).  I will look into other products of their&#x27;s once I am in need.  Happy customer!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It&#x27;s creamy and blends into the skin quickly. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> I just received it yesterday, so last night was The first time I used it, so far I liked it...I will give an update in 2 weeks or so, for The results</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to be a bit more oisturizing for anight cream, but I am not sure why I feel it actually dries my skin almost like a lifting effect, when I really eant moisture. So it depends on what you expect from a night cream.</li>
    <li> a good result but it is not yet understand&lt;br /&gt;Use very little time</li>
    <li> I loved this cream for a short period of time because of the hydration, but then it made me break out very bad! 😞</li>
    <li> Give me 1 Mounth and i&#x27;ll tell i have the results i&#x27;m expecting.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.</li>
    <li> Really works during night.  Please, make sure you have a good night sleep. It doesn&#x27;t make miracles :)</li>
    <li> Just got this 3 days ago and I am not sure if I am completely happy with this......#1, it smells like it is borderline &amp;#34;rancid,&amp;#34; you know that smell when a lotion has expired or gone bad.  Since it claims to have some herbal products in it, I was expecting more of fresh herbal or floral smell or at least a touch of it.  I&#x27;m a little freaked out about putting something that might be turning rancid on my face - defeats the whole purpose of using something natural, right?  I do like the texture  of it.  The container it comes in is very nice.  I&#x27;m just not sure if the one I got is really fresh or has passed it&#x27;s date of good use.  I found no expiration date on the container.</li>
    <li> Wow, I don&#x27;t know if I was expecting much from this moisturizer but it works SO well! I noticed skin improvements immediately and it gets better the longer you use it. Will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> The product is really moisturizing and gets the job done! Some night creams can be pretty sticky with no coverage and not fully hydrate the skin..that&#x27;s not the problem with this product, I highly recommend it to anyone. This company also prides themselves in quality customer service! I received my cream and it was slightly damaged, without hesitation they shipped a 2-day complimentary cream to me. They also remembered to follow up with me a few days later to make sure I was satisfied with everything! LOVED IT. Kuddos :)</li>
    <li> It is a lovely night cream. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Light and feels good on skin. Not sure if it corrects or make any lines disappear but hopefully prevents them from appearing too soon.</li>
    <li> I love all of their products. I will definitely buy them again. I can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Light weight. Works great over treatment products.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it goes on without feeling oily and makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure some of the extracts broke me out.</li>
    <li> I used this cream at night for almost a week and i started breaking out a lot! I will give it another chance to make sure if this is what made me breakout. I will update to confirm.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this cream, it&#x27;s very moisterizing.  A little goes along way, so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice a real&lt;br /&gt;Difference.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have purchased before and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a good night cream but the pump doesn&#x27;t always function properly.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazing. My face feels so soft and smoother and I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week.  The cream gets a Lil hard and tight after I put it on but it feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I use it as a moisturizer for the day time. Also, helped me get rid of allergies from other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel soft and supple. It also has a really nice light scent to it. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. Before using this cream, I was not sure if I would have allergy. However after applying some cream on my face, there was no rash, Not at all! I have been using this product for about one month. I feel my skin become more smoothly. Will recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel wonderful. Love how it smells. Will buy this again!!</li>
    <li> More than half way through my first bottle, just recently placed my order for a second bottle. Probably too soon to see any real effects from this cream but my skin already feels extra smooth in the morning, i will continue to use!  Also on a side note the company is a pleasure to deal with and respond to any questions or problems via email promptly!</li>
    <li> I love all the InstaNatural Products I&#x27;ve tried so far. This one is probably one of my favorites. This cream helped me clear up my acne problem and has made me feel a lot younger. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good night cream.</li>
    <li> It might be a good moisturizer buy didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it both morning and night. And there were small blackheads on my face afterevery time I used it. Once I stopped using it for a few days, those blackheads would disappear.&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize pretty well but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look any better but giving me more blackheads</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great.</li>
    <li> This works great.  I did break out somewhat so I am going to stop for awhile then try again b</li>
    <li> My wife ended up giving this to my grandmother along with the Daytime Cream of this brand. She says she loves it and it feels good on her skin.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few weeks and decided to return it for a refund (I have never done that for a beauty product. I was just so irritated that there were so many good reviews for a product that is horrible). Do not waste your money. I rarely write reviews but I just had to say something about this. I used Body Merry retinol, and at least that does something!</li>
    <li> I like the product, but I have very dry skin, so I use it as a daytime moisturizer.  I imagine for most people, it works fine at night. For me, it works fine during the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. At first i was skeptical about buying this product since i had never heard of this brand before. But after reading some reviews i thought of giving it a try. My wife has been using this for few weeks now and she likes it. She even thanked me for buying this. No satisfaction is greater than your wife appreciating your choice especially for her cosmetics :)  Thanks InstaNatural</li>
    <li> I do like this night cream😏</li>
    <li> Ok, so I may be a bit biased because every product I&#x27;ve ever gotten from InstaNatural has been overwhelmingly incredible.  So, I automatically expect greatness when I get a little bottle that bears the InstaNatural name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know when I pick up an InstaNatural product that it&#x27;s going to be ALL natural and that it comes from the US.  Those are important factors.  I used to not think of the ingredients and chemicals that I was needlessly and recklessly putting on my skin.  However, since I&#x27;ve started really reading and learning about products I&#x27;ve come to look for prodcuts that only carry Natural Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product with it&#x27;s mixture of Argan oil, Rosehip (for scarring), as well as Vitamin C and Vitamin B truly does #1 have a nice scent as well as has reduced the hideous dark circles for which I&#x27;ve always suffered from.  It feels nice on my face and truly does feel nicely moisturized after using it.  I have tried other &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; moisturizers that leave flaking and find that I have to add another moisturizer to them to counteract the dryness.  That&#x27;s NOT the case with this one, I can use it as a stand-alone product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with my other InstaNatural products, this was a winner.  It has now become my go-to night time moisturizer.  It&#x27;s even beaten out some Korean brands!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a review sample.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I needed a heavier moisturizer and this stuff is awesome.  Doesnt make my face greasy at all. When u put it on it feels like it would but it soaks in!  Will use this again!</li>
    <li> When I received Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Moisturizer, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  I love the combo packed ingredients.  Niacinamide promotes reducing fine lines and wrinkles, blotchiness and sallowing and has shown promise in the treatment of rosacea.  Vitamin C can also boost the benefits of skin peels and microdermabrasion, strengthen and improve the barrier of the skin while simultaneously reducing inflammation. Matrixyl 3000 helps smooth skin roughness and promote skin density.  Finally Rosehip Oil  is used to repair the skin&#x27;s surface, restore elasticity and helps protect against the sun and pollution stressors that can lead to wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer itself is very dense so I like to use it at night after I wash my face.  I gently rub the cream in a circular motion, all over my face and neck.  I need help in all these areas so it&#x27;s great that they are combined into step.  The skin on my face feels much more hydrated and the small wrinkles seem to have softened.</li>
    <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with finding a night cream that helps moisturize my dry skin without aggravating my skin and causing breakouts. I am prone to cystic acne  and occasionally white heads. Most acne night creams are too drying, and normal night creams cause break outs. This night cream has been my savior. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and have noticed nothing but good things.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is noticeably softer and looks more even. I get the occasional cystic acne (hormone related) and have noticed that it heals within 1-2 weeks instead of the usual month it use to take. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or fine lines, I&#x27;m more using it as a preventative measure so I cant comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is an amazing design. I adore the pump. I use about 1/2 pump and that covers my face and neck. The cream has a very slight scent that is, to me, not very noticeable at all. It&#x27;s a good thick cream that is easy to smooth in.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I started using this cream but it has become my Holy grail night cream and a staple in my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> happy with the cream. txs!</li>
    <li> this is great I wake up with my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> very nice company-product was nice but I was allergic to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with InstaNatural products,  this one in particular.  Results are consistent and noticed pretty rapidly. No real reduction in results if you happen to forget one night.  My sensitive skin does not react or break out. I am a big fan of this product and will continue to buy this night cream.</li>
    <li> Yet another InstaNatural product I absolutely love. This company knows exactly how to make quality products. This night cream is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts with it. It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily at all and absorbs into my skin quickly so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my face sticking to my pillow. I don&#x27;t have anymore dry, flaky patches on my face. You can tell my face is much more moisturized with the healthy glow I have now. This is the perfect anti-aging moisturizer to help fight the signs of wrinkles, dark spots, hyper-pigmentation, and uneven skin tone all while I&#x27;m sleeping. I just LOVE InstaNatural and the fact their products are made in the USA and cruelty free. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Love this  night  cream, just what I needed. I want something a  little more as a  night cream , and  this  fits the bill. My face is so smooth in the morning. I use this with their vitamin C Serum and  it works really  good  together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to try this with  a discount , but my opinion is all mind and unbiased.</li>
    <li> This absolutely the best night cream I have ever used.  It is so rich and creamy, I love the feel of it and it glides onto my skin.  The next morning my skin was moist looking as opposed to the dry, scaly look I usually see.  I am going to use this cream each and every night!</li>
    <li> So far it is one the best creams I have used for nighttime that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> very happy with this cream....I just started using this product....because I had a reaction to the fruit mango....now, I can use the cream nightly...</li>
    <li> This product actually made my face feel drier .... got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! It is not greasy but really moisturizes my skin nicely. I&#x27;m 47 and starting to want more moisture... I sometimes use it during the day if I have been in the sun. I have fairly normal skin with the exception of my chin and nose. It hasn&#x27;t caused any blackheads or pimples. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> The best night cream tight also you neck. You&#x27;re going  to love this improved my skin elasticity</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 4/19/2017: This night cream has a very unpleasant smell for me. It is very pronounced as you put on but slowly disappear afterwards. It is also very white as soon as it gets contact with skin, so I have to vigorously wipe on the my face then eventually the color goes away. This cream didn&#x27;t have this smell nor this while color before. I don&#x27;t care for the scent.&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/13/2017: This is my 3rd bottle and I will continue to buy as long as InstaNatural makes these amazing facial creams. Both the night cream and the eye cream are my favorites. I use no other. The price is as reasonable as the first time I bought the creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/28: ordered my 2nd bottle. I love my skin and have gotten a lot of compliments. I do tell them what I&#x27;ve been using. I will continue to use these products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this a few time because I only received it.  BUT, I can honestly say that my skin has never looked better at 51!!! I am a beauty cream junkie! Always looking for the so called &amp;#34;best cream ever.&amp;#34; I ordered their face mask which I love, so I decided to explore their other products. Lo and behold, their creams and serums have the highest stars on Amazon, so of course I decided to try. Well, well, well....I&#x27;m glad I did.  The price is justified for the amount of product you get. So, I will continue to use their products and I am confident that I will be very pleased with the long term results.  I will post a follow-up review after a few weeks. 5/24/15 Follow-up: My skin has never been better. I have a ceiling fan in my room which makes my skin dry overnight. But, this night cream has prevented the dryness and I wake-up refreshed and with supple skin. I hope InstaNatural will keep making this cream because I am a fan for life. Same goes for their eye cream and their Vitamin C moisturizer. 5 star is warranted (all three products).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this night cream. It is a great consistency, not sticky or oily. And I wake with my skin feeling plumped and moisturized. Love it and all the InstaNatural products.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect moisturizer ... highly recommended ...</li>
    <li> I am not feeling the tightening of the night cream as I have with other creams. It&#x27;s also might very thick.</li>
    <li> I received this cream for testing purposes and I was hesitant because my skin is sensitive but when I used the cream , I had no break outs at all. The cream is think and it left my skin hydrated and moisturized! And it also toned down some redness on my face thanks to all the active healthy ingredients that&#x27;s it&#x27;s infused with.</li>
    <li> I have used a LOT of different moisturizers, vitamin C creams, under eye creams, etc.  For the price, this is a big bottle.  The cream is medium weight and clogs the pores in my T-zone, so I stopped using it all over my face.  I have had the cream for almost a month now and am using it every day.  I am using the cream on my neck, forehead, and under my eyes.  I have not noticed a difference in my skin.  As a basic moisturizer, it is fine for the dry areas on my skin.  But, that&#x27;s about it.  I purchased this cream based on all of the positive reviews and, as a result, my expectations were high.  Perhaps that is why I am somewhat underwhelmed by this cream.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this it was an EXCELLENT rich creamy night time cream that worked well and felt expensive.  However THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA.  It is not longer &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;, it no longer smells nice and it&#x27;s now a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; watered down lotion.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this moisturizer and bottom self lotion at walmart.  I think they did a bait and switch with a cheap replacement and left loyal customers holding the bag and dups people with the ratings they had when this product was good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this product.  After a few days I have definitely noticed a difference for the better in my skin.  Now I know what the other reviewers mean when they say their face is much smoother and plumper and the dark marks are fading.  I&#x27;ve seen all those things for myself.  I use this Night Cream at night and the Niacinamide Vit B3 5% Serum during the day and my face is just looking better and better.  I had so much acne when I was in high school.  They&#x27;ve left marks on my cheeks.  These products have definitely made an improvement as far as texture and evenness of the skin.  The acne scars are definitely less pronounced.  Face appears smoother and clearer.  There are no gimicks with these products.  They definitely deliver.  I&#x27;ve been most pleased and will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> Rich,  creamy,  and I wake up to soft smooth skin.  Will certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> Terrific product! I can actually see results myself and others have commented, too. Also bought the retinol cream and really like that, too. So happy to have finally found a skincare product line. Have been looking FOREVER!</li>
    <li> Nice rich night cream that I also use on my neck.  This product is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have combination acne prone skin. This product doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it puts much needed moisture back into my skin. This is an amazing product not only for what it does for my face, but it&#x27;s also great for my wallet.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product for a long time but it moisturizes my skin really well. In the morning, my skin feels soft and plump. Also, it seems to take care of my pimples.</li>
    <li> I find this Night Cream Moisturizer to be an excellent face cream! The first night I use this product I could feel the difference, there is a tightness/firmness feeling to my skin.I can feel a difference in my skin and it has only been about two weeks since starting with this face cream!</li>
    <li> At last, a rich night moisturizer that quenches my dryish aging skin,yet doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts!  In the morning my skin is smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sponsored, I paid for this product, and will order again.</li>
    <li> “After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried about how it would affect my skin I suffer from some breakouts and read it has caused some who have not had any previous issues serious problems was too thick and also smelled I read after I had made my purchase but I am pleased to say I have had no break outs there is a light scent not unpleasant and constancy is like other hydrating creams.”</li>
    <li> Addicted to this stuff! Works wonders and my absolute rock solid night cream now.</li>
    <li> I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I&#x27;m 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It&#x27;s generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night cream is very gentle and I feel does a fantastic job of healing and softening my skin. Sometimes the serum can cause minor irritation but the moisturizer really helps keep and blotches or redness in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve never felt better about my own face and it&#x27;s because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something about this line that just works for me and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it&#x27;s a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> If you have a oily skin this product is not for you, you can give it a try and if its not for you they will refund your money.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Having been using about month and no regrets.</li>
    <li> Very effective reliable product. I have decent skin and this product makes my skin outstanding!</li>
    <li> The moisturizer works well to keep my skin feeling hydrated in this cold, Colorado climate.  However, at times, it seemed it &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; going on like it didn&#x27;t want to be spread.  I tried adding a layer of my Oil of Olay oil first. Perfect! The lotion glides on now and does feel tight at all. Sometimes I add a layer of Trader Joes daily moisturizer with SPF on top and there is no sense of smothering or caking.  I love that the cream is fragrance free and has an easy to dispense bottle. I&#x27;ll be ordering this again</li>
    <li> I really like the packaging and the pump works well. I like the way the product feels on my skin and I was surprised to see really fast an improvement in my skin: in the morning when I wake up, my skin looks much better, it is well moisturized and its firmness and its tone are greatly improved. Over the years I have tried many night creams, this one is one of the very best, if not the best, for my skin at this point in my life. I use it with their serum and their eye cream, all great products. I will order again.</li>
    <li> This really is the best night serum I have tried. I immediately notice improvement the first night I used this. I even began using it during the day. I like it better than the daytime product actually! This is a great find and worth trying! A great MENS product as well because it is not perfume-smelling and feels light on the skin!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly. Thick, but absorbs well. I have dry to normal skin and this works well.</li>
    <li> Really liking this product so far!!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and found that only really expensive night cr&amp;egrave;mes or Ponds work well for my dry face. I am tying to go all natural for all the products that I use, so this was a great find that is not too expensive and is natural and works great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Very good cream at a great price. I got better results with this cream in only 2 weeks than with any other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about changing up my night time moisturizer, so I bought this product to see if it would make a difference. I was just using an eDerma product for the past year and I think my skin was just getting &#x27;used&#x27; to it. After day one of using Instanatural night cream I noticed a pretty good difference!! My skin glowed in the morning... felt very hydrated and plumper. I&#x27;m a 43 y/o woman who takes great care of herself... so I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles yet... but I&#x27;m glad I found this product so I can keep looking 33 longer. :-)</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  Not oily, heavy, or thick.  Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.  I use it am and pm.  And the price is really good.  Most importantly, it does not cause my face to break out or peel, which many products do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Night Cream Moisturizer because it received so many five star reviewe.  I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I feel very satisfied with the moisturizer.  I recommend it and will very likely purchase it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the youth express night cream for a month now and have noticed a dramatic improvement in the quality of my skin, particularly in the mornings. My skin feels so soft and moisturized which is amazing as my skin tends to get dry and flaky during the winter months. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for firmer softer skin!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product for the price</li>
    <li> this is a perfect moisturizer for night time. It is thick and feels like it is definitely doing it&#x27;s job while I sleep. When I wake up my face is oily as usual, but hydrated. Sometime I get oily skin, but that doesn&#x27;t mean my face is hydrated. I get dry skin at the same time and I notice that being the case the older I get. I notice using a great moisturizer at night helps so much with keeping my skin healthy. I use several serums before application, but this is like icing on the cake. Remember if your skin gets too dry, imaging a drying up orange. All those wrinkle are more prominent. Hydration is KEY! The 5% Niacinamide is great to help fight those random blemishes that show up since this is such a long lasting moisturizer. I received this for review, however this does not effect my thoughts and opinions/</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet.  However, it is very creamy, without being greasy and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cling&amp;#34; to your pillow.  In the morning, your face feels moisturized.</li>
    <li> Too soon to see if it reduces the appearance of my wrinkles, but I think the best word to describe it is &amp;#34;luxurious.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s very creamy and thick but not greasy.  Love the pump applicator.</li>
    <li> I cant put it on my face because it feels like my skin cant breath anymore it does not do any good. Just a heavy cream.....though they have issued me a refund as promised</li>
    <li> This is a night cream by instanatural. If you have some hyperpigmentation like I do. It will help lessen the level of it. If you are prone to breaking out with acne. This has an ingredient to help fight that while you sleep. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! It also helps with calming down acne redness in your skin. You will notice your skin is even more hydrated over night when you use this. If you have some lighter wrinkles this should help with that. I am noticing my skin softer and less wrinkles. This is made in USA too.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product.  It is very thick and for me I would like it to be a bit thinner for better absorption. The skin natural loves water, both externally and externally. Drinking a lot of water also helps your skin and body.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream for weeks and I love it.  It is very thick, which is perfect for my dry skin.  Also, now that it is late fall my face and hands are even more dry than usual.  This night cream is white and comes out by pressing a pump.  My only complaint is that I wish it had a more refreshing smell.  It doesn’t smell bad, but I do not smell it and think “wow, I love that!”.  I really can’t pinpoint the smell but I’m sure there is something natural the manufacturer could add to enhance the smell. However, that is the only thing I dislike.  Since it actually helps my skin so much I would purchase this.  At the end of the day what I look for in skincare is moisture and this product delivers.  It is very hard for me to find moisturizes that keep my skin flake-free, especially in the fall and winter months but this InstaNatural Night Cream does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting on it’s claim to improve complexion.  I can say that my skin hasn’t gotten any redder since starting this cream, which is actually good.  The last few weeks has been very cold and windy here and normally by now my skin would be in bad shape if I stuck with my summer moisturizer.  That alone tells me this product is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this product is made in the USA.  I always try to support products made in the USA and local businesses!</li>
    <li> Great product. Goes on silky and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t a free priduct... I researched it, bought it, and was so impressed I had to write a review. Put it on last night gor the first time and the lines around my mouth plumped up. Amazing. I know it&#x27;s not a forever fix, but it&#x27;s good enough for me. The reviews about the product being thick and &amp;#34;dragging&amp;#34; your skin are misleading. It&#x27;s not very thick at all and goes smoothly over the skin.</li>
    <li> I must say, I absolutely love this night cream!  It is one of the best natural creams that I have tried.  I just love how it feels while massaging it into my skin as it is very luxurious.  My skin tends to drink it up!  In combination with other Instanatural products, my skin is looking its best in years.  Sun damage is fading from the past summer (had forgotten how harsh the California sun can be!), blemishes are few and far between, acne scars are fading, and the redness from my skin is fading as well.  In addition, I am finally transitioning out of the oily skin phase that I have had since a teenager.  My mother and nana told me I would be thankful for that later on, which I am!!  I would not call my skin dry, but I have noticed it is less oily and I can now use a heavier cream, especially in the dry winter months (or shall I write &#x27;winter&#x27; as it lasted for 2 weeks here :).  I have yet to experience any fine lines/wrinkles, but as I am turning 36, I thought it best to begin incorporating anti-aging products into my skincare regime.  I truly believe that in order to have a well-rounded healthy lifestyle, it is utterly important to feed my skin from the outside-in as well as the inside-out.  I look forward to trying new products from this line, especially a body lotion, hand cream and lip moisturiser, hint, hint :)</li>
    <li> I wake up to a better face every morning. I think it&#x27;s a great product and does what it claims. I will be a returning customer! The price doesn&#x27;t hurt either, I think it works just as well as the leading brand out on the market right now that you will pay more for. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This cream is really nice! It has a great texture and is good quality. Love putting it on as the last product of the night!</li>
    <li> Love it so far! Very thick night cream so it really feels like it absorbs into your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I loved the old formula but this new formula is not so good. It smells like foot cream to me which kind of grosses me out and it goes on like sunscreen. It is thick and leaves white streaks on your face if you don&#x27;t rub it in really well.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I will definitly order another one.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I have tried it for only a few days, but I face feels moisturized.  I liked the fact that I was sent tips on how to use the moisturizer via email in addition to the instructions on the box.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest moisturizer.  I have tried so many products and most are a disappointment.  Not only does this product say what it&#x27;s going to do, the price is affordable.  I just started using and my face already looks younger.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use will do!</li>
    <li> Fully enjoyed this, kept my skin moisturized all night</li>
    <li> Use it as night cream for winter. Leave skin well hydrated. I like it because it&#x27;s light and fragrance free. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Uh-mazing! I&#x27;m 45 now and have been trying different products for quite some time. I have a cream jar graveyard in my bathroom. It&#x27;s sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My evening routine is so fast now. I cleanse, tone then use an InstaNatural serum followed by this rich, non-smelly night cream. I rub it into my hands at night, too. People say I look like I&#x27;m under 30. 😊 Love love love!</li>
    <li> It feels great and smells great too. I have only been using it for a short time so I don&#x27;t know the long term effects but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural product but this Night Cream was not my favourite. The cream is easy to apply but maybe a little strong for my skin and I found I had breakout after 2 nights use. I am continuing to use but only twice a week. Not right for me but we are all different.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and my skin is very sensitive - this product worked well and did not irritate my skin</li>
    <li> Another great product by InstaNaturals that I will continue using in the future.</li>
    <li> excellent product! arrived on time</li>
    <li> Again, the InstaNaturals brand has me under their spell! I am in love with every product of theirs I try!&lt;br /&gt;This Professional Formula Youth Express Night Cream is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;The quality ingredients list includes: niacinamide, vitamin c, matryxl 3000, rose hip oil, organic aloe Vera, organic argan oil, and more!  If argan oil is in something, you can trust that it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have very red and blotchy skin, due to extreme sensitivity, and I can finally,  confidently, go out with a bare face and not feel self conscious. This product has evened out my skin tone, put much needed moisture back into it, and even given me a nice dewy complexion!</li>
    <li> Thick and luxurious. At first I was a little worried that it might be too heavy or make my skin oily,  but it doesn&#x27;t.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and beautiful. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it goes on smoothly and evenly. It doesn&#x27;t give my face a heavy, coated feel. I really feel a difference when using this cream. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so usually even creams feel heavy and uncomfortable but not this one. I Love it.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks. My skin feels softer. It didn&#x27;t dry it out like I thought it would</li>
    <li> My skin has been feeling so soft since sing this and the Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream.  I love it!</li>
    <li> this works great i got it reviewed it love it and def. will get again</li>
    <li> *Good for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;*love the scent&lt;br /&gt;*good packaging , comes in a pump bottle&lt;br /&gt;*not greasy or sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;ALthough I have received this free for review, but I would love to buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to review this product for InstaNatural. Just one more excellent product they have. This is a night cream that helps to smooth wrinkles and aging spots and to calm the redness on your face. An extra to help in improving your skin over night. I use their products before I put on my makeup and when I take it off I use the night cream.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer seems ok. No changes in my skin. But I do find it very heavy. When applied it was thick and the more I tried rub it in the more it would flake. I&#x27;m over 50 so I don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer. The reviews didn&#x27;t reflect this product accurately. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful night cream. Not too greasy and it makes my skin feel and look great.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of products and this one has stayed true to their claims yet again. Goes on great. No strong smell. Another happy purchase.</li>
    <li> This cream is seriously hydrating! Applied it the first night and my face was still absorbing the lotion in the morning! It&#x27;s a thick formula and I would definitely recommend this for dry skin. *sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> I have been thrilled with the results this moisturizer so far! Living in Florida, the humidity tends to dry my skin out even in the non-cold months of the year. I put this on every night before bed and wake up with nice, smooth and hydrated skin. The scent is nice and light, not overwhelming like some other creams. It&#x27;s super easy to spread over my face and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I am definitely going to continue to use the moisturizer and can&#x27;t wait to see the more long term results!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!!! I can not say enough good things. I bought this along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. My skin is so dry &amp; dehydrated. I have been buying and trying SO many products.... some seem to work, until I apply my makeup... then my skin is all dry and flaky and my makeup looks AWFUL! :( I have been getting so discouraged and frustrated. I&#x27;m so so glad I decided to try these 2 products! They are the only things that truly WORKS! After using them only twice, once at night and again the next morning, I applied my makeup and it looked AMAZING! For the first time in a long time. I am so excited that I finally found something that works. I recommend this to anyone and everyone who has dry and/or dehydrated skin. If I had to say a negative about it.... it would be that it feels kind of thick and sticky at first, but that feeling goes away in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I am always in the market for a natural, better moisturizer than my current one. This was a nice departure from my usual. The first thing I  noticed was the pretty packaging, the rosey-purple color is very inviting and makes me want to open it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air pump is what I noticed next, I LOVE air pumps. They are are far easier to use than a regular pump and offer more control over how much you squeeze out and it does not go everywhere so there is no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this was almost non-existent , there was a slight smell that was a tad unpleasant but it quickly went away while applying the product. Now to the product, it is THICK! I was surprised at how creamy and thick this was, as you can see in the picture below it was not moving! This means that it did take a little extra time to rub into the skin but also that you need to not use as much so it&#x27;s kind of a good thing!  Overall, I really did like this and it did provide me with adequate moisture for these dry winter months and I would recommend this to my friends and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice night time moisturizer. It is really silky and doesnt have a smell like the other ones. It doesn&#x27;t list this in the ad, but I have noticed that when I leave it on over night, it helps to shrink my pores, especially on my nose. I like it because it doesnt leave any greasy residue, but I love it because it is guaranteed to be organic and natural. I love using products like this, so I can actually know what I am putting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> This is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried in months that didn&#x27;t react negatively with my skin.  I love it as it goes on smoothly with no reactions whatsoever.  Based on all the positive reviews, I decided to try it and boy am I glad I did!!!  I will definitely repurchase once I run out and the bottle is huge so it should last a while.  I use it morning and night and I know I&#x27;ve been using it only for 10 days so far but I am noticing some improvement in my skin tone.  Thank you InstaNatural! - I will be back!</li>
    <li> After using Niacinamide Vitamin B3 5% Serum by InstaNatural for a reasonable time period without negative reaction, I decided to try the moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and products must be ph balanced or I develop dry patches, chemical burns, hives, rashes, etc. The cream is as gentle as the serum and I&#x27;m very pleased. The moisturizer absorbs nicely and is not greasy. You need only a small amount to cover face and neck. It&#x27;s a nice size container for the price when compared to similar products.</li>
    <li> My overall all experience with this product was good, I have never heard of Niacinamide Vitamin B3 so I was excited to try something new. I looked up Niacinamide Vitamin B3  and realized it is a vitamin b supplement which is great for your skin especially for acne. So I was excited to see what it will do to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the time I used the product I noticed a little in some dark spots that I had on my face. I noticed how moisturized my skin felt which was really amazing for me during the fall. I felt that my skin was slightly smooth, I feel that if I used it longer I would definitely see a big changes in my skin. Over all it was a great product and I love that products used in this product and that they are natural also the smell was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This product is really a life saver. I just got it about 3 days ago and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement on my acne. Not only has the redness disspated by a lot, the white heads have gone away. My skin feels plump. A lot of people complain about how thick it is but I feel it&#x27;s a good consistency. I have a mixture of dry and oily skin but this has kept my skin balanced. It&#x27;s only been a few days and also my dark marks a visibly getting lighter. You really do see good results. Yes it&#x27;s a little pump but you can easily choose how much you want to put on your face. It&#x27;s also good for under eyes. I&#x27;ve never written a review on anything, much less face products because nothing has really worked for me. But I actually love this product and I might get another bottle. It&#x27;s that good. Use it at night and in the morning. It&#x27;s a night cream yes but you also get the benefits of you apply it in the morning if your acne looks a little red after you wash your face. If you have an over drying face wash then this will also help you out.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly go in and on about this product. I can&#x27;t wait for weeks to pass by. I&#x27;m excited 😁</li>
    <li> If your looking for a night Cream to put on before bed, then seriously try this cream from Instanatural! Instanatural sent this to me for testing purposes and for a review on my blog! All their products are wonderful, and I&#x27;m not just saying that! I have almost their whole line and I use it everyday! And people never believe I&#x27;m 42 years old! This cream just prepares your face for the morning. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Another great InstaNatural product, I cannot say enough about how great these products are.  This one is definitely plumping up my not so firm facial and neck skin.  It has all natural ingredients like Vitamin B3, Vitamin C and Rosehip Oil so it really does moisturize vs. so many other products that are made of chemicals and cause drying or peeling effects after regular use.  I like that the moisturizer goes on very evenly and dries fast, it doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky at all and there is no smell. After using this product for 14 days (received a free trial),  I can tell you that my face is definitely &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; and my color is more even. Another huge plus is that InstaNatural products are Made In The USA.  I am also very pleased with the size of the bottle, it is 3.4 oz and it has a pump vs. a tube, I prefer bottles to tubes.  Try it out, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> absolutely not worth what i paid for this so called moisturizer, but after reading the reviews i was convinced.  I think by giving these reviewers free bottles they gave good rating.  It is a thick cream that stays on the face, after a few hours you can take your finger and bring it all up to the surface of the face.  I used up until a few days ago  when I realized I was better off using baby or hand cream on my face.  I have bought other moisturizers that are so much better and a lot less in the price.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product to anyone wanting a more moisturized face, this does not cut it !!!!</li>
    <li> Although I started my new skin regimen later than most people, I really have noticed the difference in how my skin looks. In approximately 2 months, I think my face is looking younger.</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural&#x27;s Night Cream Moisturizer Treatment, and I have been using it for several months now. I chose this product after researching Niacinamide, which I felt would solve many of the issues I&#x27;m facing (adult acne/breakouts, early signs of aging, some mild sun damage, other skin imperfections). Originally I was using InstaNatural&#x27;s Niacinamide serum, which is also a great product, but I love the night cream moisturizer because it has the Niacinamide AND is a great moisturizer. I use it both at night after I wash my face before bed, and in the morning after I apply makeup, and I love the texture and how it is clearing up my skin problems. After two weeks of using this product, I definitely noticed a decrease in my breakouts, and some of my mild sun damage is also fading, as are some small scars I have. Basically, I&#x27;m getting better results with this than I was with prescription Retin-A, and without the weeks of red, itchy, peeling skin! I strongly recommend this product, especially for the price. I would have spent more for a product this good, but I&#x27;m thrilled I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> I use this everynight. I love that it is not greasy or heavy and make my skin look so amazing. My skin has never looked so youthful and clear.</li>
    <li> Real thick formula. I use this at least twice a day. My skin feels soft and subtle.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a try after reading the online reviews. I love it!! I&#x27;ve shared it with my sister &amp; a friend.. We all agree your skin is so soft in the morning after using the night cream!</li>
    <li> A lot of creams promise a lot of things, but InstaNatural doesn&#x27;t promise what it cannot deliver. You can literally see the difference as you apply the cream on your skin, it&#x27;s instantaneous! Long term use reduces lines, removes imperfections, and makes your skin look radiant and youthful. I use InstaNatural Youth Express eye gel in the mornings on my whole face, it&#x27;s incredibly refreshing and a great base for make-up. I&#x27;m not sure if using both products makes a difference, or if using this product alone is all you need, but it has certainly made a difference in my appearance. I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It really works!  I love it and my skin thirstily drinks it in and feels happy!!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot  my skin feels soft and smooth when I get up in the morning</li>
    <li> Instanaturals night cream is fabulous! The formula is phenominal! Its thick and creamy, which is really awesome during these cold winter months in ohio. Most importantly it&#x27;s not greasy at all and rubs in easily leaving your skin hydrated, smooth and soft. It&#x27;s unscented, which is great, as I don&#x27;t like scented product on my face!&lt;br /&gt;The product is made in the usa, which i like. Its full of goodies for your skin like Vitamin C, Rosehip Oil and Argan Oil. It helps reduce the signs of aging, wrinkles, dark spots and uneven skin tones! It&#x27;s a really great night cream and I am glad to have found it to add to my daily skin care routine! update: this also works well in spring and summer. still doesnt make face greasy. Very nice! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as a night cream for a week now and I think it&#x27;s a very good moisturizer, a little bit goes a long way, it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy/thick side. It does have an interesting fragrance that I don&#x27;t care much about but I don&#x27;t find it too bad. The most important thing for me is that it worked. The next morning, I do find that my face is smoother and softer. It&#x27;s not dry at all, my skin feels nice and plump.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer, but I haven&#x27;t seen the results I had hoped for yet.</li>
    <li> Actually made my skin break out more...Pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me even though there&#x27;s a lot of good reviews. It&#x27;s a very thick cream and my face gets really oily when i wake up.  It REDUCES the appearance of acne, the first 2-3 days it seemed to work but after that my acne marks were back to normal. It did nothing for my skin but to break me out more. The company offered a full refund and their customer service was good.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream! It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance which I love but works wonder. After cleansing my face every night, I put this cream all over my face and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft right away. The next morning, my skin is so supple. I have been using this product continuously for 3 weeks now and it really has helped with my skin looking more hydrated, soft and firm. I would recommend this great product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Night Cream for about a week now, and it is a great moisturizer for my dry skin. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with break outs since using it, and overall, my skin appears to be firmer and a more even tone. I&#x27;m also using the serum and day cream, and the trio appear to be doing the trick. Will need to see how the next 4-8 weeks plays out to see if there&#x27;s any longer lasting effects regarding fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> Fully met my criteria in every possible way. I&#x27;m really excited to not only buy this again, but try out every other item in this line. Highly, HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> It has made my dry, acne ruined skin glow! Repairs damaged looking skin. Overall very happy with the product!&lt;br /&gt;If you have dull skin, do try it out!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I ordered this and a few other Instanaturals products and like all of them. This moisturizes really well, without leaving any sort of residue, like some creams can. It also seems to help reduce redness on my face. And, it&#x27;s a good value for the money compared to other similar products.</li>
    <li> This cream has a wonderful smooth and soothing texture.  I mix it with their Vitamin C and Retinol moisturizers and the combination is awesome.  This is a great company--high quality products for the best price and their customer service is outstanding.  I received several followup emails and they&#x27;ve answered all my questions promptly.</li>
    <li> VERY good moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t think it does all it claims to do. I have been using for a few weeks now, and I don&#x27;t notice any significant difference in the way my skin looks. At first, it seemed that my face looked better, but not so much anymore. I gave it 5 stars because of the guarantee the company provides.</li>
    <li> There are many reasons why this product deserves a five star rating. First of all it comes in a pump form, which is very hygienic. The capacity is 100ml when other creams have only 50ml, so it will last longer. The third reason why I like it is because it&#x27;s fragrance free and is suitable for sensitive skin types. Last but not least, the cream actually works, it offers ultimate hydration, reduces redness and actually gives that youthful glow.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and use it every night. It makes my face very soft and smooth. I will buy it again from this seller!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love but I don&#x27;t hate the product but I don&#x27;t love it either. The feel seems a little sticky  instead of smooth and creamy. I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in my skin.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Frankly speaking, I&#x27;m still not seeing any visibly improvement on wrinkles, large pores and dark spot.&lt;br /&gt;But I can feel a more smooth, soft and glowing skin. There&#x27;s no irritation or redness that i was first afraid of.&lt;br /&gt;I already feel good and hope that in a couple more weeks to feel even better !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the smell is light but relaxing. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought it initially for these lines appearing under my eyes (I&#x27;m 18) but...sadly didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;What happened was that it helped clear up my acne and it&#x27;s the healthiest I&#x27;ve seen it yet. Just a note that it does say it on the bottle and moisture is a must for healthy skin.</li>
    <li> Fortunately, this does not have petroleum products like mineral oil or petrolatum.  I have had dry sensitive skin since high school and am now 68 years old.  My skin seems to like this product.  I started with their eye gel-which I&#x27;ve reordered.  That is a very high bar to meet!  I put eye gel on my eye area and tap it around the mouth lines.  Then I work the night cream into the whole face and neck.  At my age, improvement is no change in the &amp;#34;wrinkle farm&amp;#34;.  The wrinkles are not increasing.  My skin is soft without the hard mask and breakout I get from petroleum products.  Read the ingredients on popular hand lotions--note that mineral oil is usually the first ingredient,  Did you know many women are allergic to mineral oil?  And baby lotion/oil is mineral oil.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product</li>
    <li> This night cream is a little bit thick. For night to use its just right. I already used 2 more weeks. And I can feel my face more moisturize in this hot season, in air conditioning everywhere. I am glad I am using it. Actually I bought day use cream too, it makes my wrinkles light. I think I am really happy about my choice. I have used bunch of brands, cost me more. None of them made this effects. I feel I look younger. :-)</li>
    <li> Works great for dry skin and make my skin so smooth and the softness is awesome</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I already see some improvement . My fine lines seem to be somewhat softened and my skin is so soft and feeling hydrated.  I will continue to use this every night as long as I keep seeing some results.</li>
    <li> See and feel results almost overnight. Skin looking and feeling much more healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the night cream moisturizer for just over a month now along side instanatural&#x27;s niacinamide serum, hoping that together they would help even out my skin tone or lighten the dark spots on my face but so far I&#x27;ve had no such luck. In my opinion, it also doesn&#x27;t help much with blemishes but it is excellent at providing the skin with moisture. It made my face feel smooth throughout the day. I also like that the night cream didn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy like their niacinamide serum did (the serum only made me feel greasy for a week but it was still uncomfortable). The consistency of the moisturizer is more on the thick side but not too thick. Overall, this is a good moisturizer that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my second InstaNatural product I&#x27;ve purchased within the span of 2 weeks and I&#x27;m convinced that this brand is a beauty and skin holy grail. I&#x27;m trying my hardest not to purchase everything they have listed. The hype and reviews are real people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer was the perfect solution for my very dry yet occasionally acne prone cheeks. I have combination very sensitive skin, I used to use 2 separate moisturizers on my face at night, one for my T-zone and one for my cheeks. Now I use this Night Cream, and the results for me were honestly instant. After applying at night and waking up I was amazed at how even my skin tone looked. No more red, dry, irritated cheeks; even the few little red acne bumps on my cheeks lost all redness. Not only that but my face has never felt softer, it&#x27;s almost like an airbrushed effect! I suggest this product to everyone and I rave about it so much my sister and her friends all purchased this too!</li>
    <li> makes my skin smooth. goes on so nice. it works. takes at least 14 days to work.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have only been using it for a few days and can already tell a difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this cream made me break out in a bumpy rash after using it for only 2 days!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After paying this high price I expected more. I use all bare minerals products and they never cause me an issue. I was looking for a night cream and well, I&#x27;m still looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is even slightly sensitive this is NOT for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it 2 stars because it did make my skin feel soft before breaking out and if your skin is not sensitive it might work for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for your face.  I&#x27;ve given it four stars instead of five because I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in the fine lines / wrinkles on my face. However, that aside, this is a good product.  It smells good, is affordable, and will moisturize your skin.  I&#x27;ve had very dry skin for years and am always eager to try new moisturizers because I&#x27;m so tired of eczema.  There are other moisturizers out there that are probably better... but at this price, that list gets much smaller. Recommended</li>
    <li> Night cream is a bit heavy for humidity here. I have mature skin and work on mature skin. I ordered 5 of InstaNaturals creams. I like the bottling/pump and labels. I&#x27;m trying different things to make creams lighter. Got any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Its a thick cream feels great on my skin very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores. The cream doesn&#x27;t leave any oily or greasy feel on my skin and certainly doesn&#x27;t smear on my pillow. I absolutely love the way my face feels in the morning smooth and nourished.</li>
    <li> Works great! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Helped even out my skin tone. Good for dry skin/very DRY SKIN, especially during the winter months. Nice fruit-like scent, has thick consistency. I will say that it clogged some pores around my nose, and if you have severe acne prone skin I would avoid this moisturizer. If you have extra dry skin I would recommend combining this cream with their hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
    <li> I have two addictions. 1. Boots. 2. Facial products.  I have researched the latter as if I was writing a thesis on the best products to apply to your face. I avoid high end products for two reasons.  I cannot afford them and secondly, I have found the lesser priced products are just as effective.  I am also leaning towards more natural, organic creams although they may not produce results as fast as the higher priced ones full of chemicals, they are effective, and I feel better applying them to my skin.  We do not know the long-term effects of most of the chemicals in a majority of skin care products but with that said, although I have opted for 100% rosehip oil, I am trying this product that consists of Matrixl 3000 that studies show has shown to improve even deep wrinkles.  However, Matrixl 3000 is lab created and the bottle has a long list of ingredients, which most are natural although not organic (organic &#x3D;$$).  Nevertheless, a few that sound *unnatural*  I guess I am a bit too vain to ditch every chemical and it is too early to document the results but the application is like butter without the greasy aftermath.  The organic rosehip oil does leave an oily sheen for a couple hours after application so I would advise using this as part of your night regime and use this product (it says Night cream but works well for daytime). In addition, the rosehip oil leaves my face much softer than this product.  My recommendations.  I am 60 y/o and fortunately, my skin is not too bad as I stopped tanning before my adult years. I would advise women to start a facial regime as early as their twenties and continue.  I am sure once a young twenty something woman gets to my age there will be fantastic products on the market and wrinkles will be obsolete.  But for now STOP tanning.  There are many foundations that will give you the same look and yes, there are numerous natural makeups. Do your homework. The internet is full of objective articles regarding everything from facial creams to mascara. Of course, I believe a sun kissed face looks much better than sickly pale skin (many women are blessed with that white porcelain skin tone and do not need colour) but tanning is a big NO-NO if you want wrinkle free skin as you age.  I am sure most women reading this have seen other women and can identify habitual tanners by the horrid aging tanning WILL cause.  A forty something woman who has tanned most of her life DOES look like a sixty year old WITH bad skin.  Will update after I am finished with this product.  A little gives a lot of coverage so 3.4 oz. should last a while.reams to mascara.

    <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t spread easily over my skin and doesn&#x27;t seep in quickly so even if I apply a small amount and rub it into my skin, it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed for a while. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin&#x27;s dryness even though I&#x27;ve been using these daily for about a month.</li>
    <li> I love this, have been using a month now and have noticed a huge difference in my skin, the thing I noticed immediately was no pillow and sheet marks on my face after waking up in the mornings. Nothing can be the price for this either</li>
    <li> One of the best night creams I have ever used! With combination skin and ageing, I feel like this cream is non greasy, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t create breakouts. I was very surprised by how much I love this night cream. For me it will be a permanent part of my skin routine!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my cousin and she loves it!!! she said that her skin feel moist not dry. she just started using it and she already feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it has such good reviews.  It was a marginal product at best.  There is no way it could be considered THE BEST.  There are much better products on the market.</li>
    <li> Great night cream. I love Instanatural products, that in the past few months I;ve bought tons of them. They all are quire impressive, in quality and price. This cream in particular is excellent. I use it at night just before going to bed, and my skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Iis a wonderful cream , it absobs very fast. It is a very good moisturizer, and the quality of all the produsts of this mark is excellent.</li>
    <li> Make a face feel soft and looks radiant over night. Love it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of weeks and am really liking it so far! It&#x27;s very light weight and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this cream based on the reviews, even though I was skeptical because most of the reviews are from people that got a free sample. I have used this cream since Jan. 10th. It worked very well for my dry skin during the winter. It is thick and a little bit goes a long way. It takes a few minutes to absorb but does not leave my skin feeling oily. Used it at night and morning. It has even out my skin tone and faded some of my acne scars and brown spots. I&#x27;m 31 years old. My skin looks great, so great that I can go without makeup. However, after 4 months the cream went rancid, probably due to the many natural oils it is made out of. During the summer my face gets super oily and I cannot use this cream because it is too oily and it makes me break out. I contacted the company to see if they had another lotion that was less oily but they ended up sending me the same one. I started using it again in the summer and only use it at night and it works good. It is too oily for me to use during the day. Awesome product and customer service. I highly recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman, post-menopausal, living in a very dry climate.  This night cream really nourishes and moisturizes my dry skin.  It absorbs almost instantly, leaving no oiliness behind to rub off on my pillow.  The scent is light and fresh.  I LOVE this cream!</li>
    <li> Great product. Hope it continues to work its magic  on my not so youthful skin!! I&#x27;m not real fond of those pump dispensers but I will probably reorder.</li>
    <li> It has really worked well on my skin does not cause me to break out, helps even out my skin tone.  I will continue using!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great ! I can tell a world of difference in 3 weeks. I&#x27;m 51 and look 35 ! Will keep using !</li>
    <li> Too heavy and thick make my skin irritated,itching and burning litter bit.</li>
    <li> NOTHING SPECIAL. At all. (Except for all the paid reviews.)</li>
    <li> I give this product five stars because, first, it is an extremely comfortable night cream to use.  I don&#x27;t know yet whether it&#x27;ll actually prevent any wrinkles, but I do know that I have never had a cream that made my face feel so nice and smooth after use.  It feels wonderful rubbing this in at night, and I think it helps me to relax a bit, too.  I also have noticed that I have far less redness on my face when I get acne; I tried a facial product (a cleanser) about a week ago that irritated my skin and I found that this night cream soothed the irritation very well and took the redness away.  I also appreciate the way the container is designed:  you don&#x27;t have drips or any wasted product; you just get a small, usable amount out at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to strong-smelling products, greasy products, and anything that is too thick on the face -- this night cream has very little scent to it and has a flawless texture.  It has really helped make my face softer and more comfortable, without requiring me to expel too much effort (I don&#x27;t like to spend hours messing with my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also need to say a word about the seller:  I was very impressed that the seller messaged me immediately after the purchase with advice as to how to best use the product.  I felt that the concern for the customer spoke volumes; I&#x27;ll definitely buy this cream again in future (although it won&#x27;t be anytime too soon because it&#x27;s big enough to last quite a while).</li>
    <li> Wow I love this stuff! I had bought a few other products from this company and they suggested I try this night cream. So glad I did! This cream is very thick and feels great on the skin. It&#x27;s very nourishing. I know its a night cream but I use it during the day and have no problems with it. I&#x27;m extremely oily and this doesn&#x27;t make me greasy or break me out. I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I like the thickness of this cream.  It absorbs fast without any greasy residue.  I have tried several products, some triple the cost, and found InstaNatural to provide great hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot verify the claims of increased firmness, the healing of sun damage or increased elasticity because I have only used the product for about 1 month.  But I can share that I like what I see so far and will continue to use this product.  The InstaNatural manufactures say that most clients notice a measured difference at about 8 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT overnight moisturizer with all natural ingredients.  Seriously, what&#x27;s not to love?  I have used a lot of moisturizers over the years and have wondered just exactly what I was really putting on my skin.  I don&#x27;t worry with InstaNaturals.  Also, and very important to me, there is no fragrance to bother me at bedtime.  I appreciate those who care enough to make good wholesome products and use contamination-proof packaging.  I am a very satisfied customer.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this--it does plump up the skin but things return to normal after a couple of hours--also it does make skin smooth but I &amp;#34;m after a wrinkle fighter--</li>
    <li> Excellent hydrating cream, it really absorbs nicely and makes my face feel soft and bright re next morning. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night since I received it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been doing much aside from being a good moisturizer, however.</li>
    <li> I have tested this cream for 7 days, and it has suited my skin really well. I can tend to get patches of dry skin over my cheeks and forehead, but this has not happened at all with Youth Express Night Cream. My skin feels very soft, and I have been getting some very nice compliments about my skin over the last week, which may or may not be due to the night cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a nice product and InstaNatural offer a Lifetime Money Back Guarantee if you are not happy with the product. So you really have nothing to lose by trying it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Skin feels great after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I am loving Instanatureal products. amazing. helps my skin feel youtful.</li>
    <li> The Youth Express Night Cream is non-greasy and leaves my skin super soft, smooth and silky.  I have used it for five weeks and it is one of the best night creams I have tried.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> THIS INSTANATURAL NIGHT CREAM MOISTURIZER TREATMENT.  I USE THIS CREAM EVERYDAY. WORKING SO GOOD. AND KEEP MY FACE SOFT AND MOISTURE.  THANKS.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> When I first apply this onto my face, I notice it looks powdery, but after about 10 seconds you can feel it starts to hydrate as it turns clear. Face feels really hydrated in the morning, it was easier to apply make up in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, absolutely love it! It is thick but not too thick for a night cream. My skin feels so soft after just a few applications. My skin tone has evened out. I will be continuing to use this.</li>
    <li> So far, so good- its not too thich or greasy, Ive only used it for a short time, will probably give it that last star in a few more weeks</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review because I really wanted to give an honest opinion . I shop a lot on Amazon and rearly do I review my purchases ,but I felt the need to for this product. I have oily combination skin for most of the year in the winter time I&#x27;m a little more dry, I have tried so many moisturizers in the past that left me feeling sticky and attributed to breakouts. After using the instanatural night cream for about 2 weeks I starting seeing a difference in my skin . My skin in the morning glowed and I had no dry patches. With one pump I am able to moisturizer my face and neck . My skin loves this stuff, it&#x27;s not oily or heavy. My skin texture is a lot more smoother and the general appearance of my skin is healthier. I am excited to try other products from Instanatural.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream I have used,and quite frankly Ive tried my share from places like QVC. I&#x27;ve had several recent compliments on how well my skin looks. Great product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user, hesitated before ordering.  Am so happy I ordered. Great value for money. Keeps my skin soft all night.  Will use this cream in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! I bought the InstaNatural Night cream to use for large patches of melasma on my face as I was looking for a cream without hydroquinone. I have tried quite a few expensive creams but none worked. After reading all the positive reviews I decided to give it a try. I have been using this night cream by itself for about two weeks now and I already see some improvement in my hyperpigmentation. I also noticed that it leaves my skin really soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> Have been searching for a night cream that will hydrate me throughout the night and this worked wonders. Very thick and makes my skin feel soft and moisturizers in the morning.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping the wrinkles. I like it so far/</li>
    <li> I love this for people with dry skin like I have it is really thick some people might not like it because it&#x27;s so thick but if you have dry skin this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This night cream is absolutely fantastic, the ingredients are second to none and are far better than in some creams costing as much as  20 times more.  I am a man and the fact that this cream is unscented is great, most creams whether intended for day or night are scented and most of those scents are nothing more than irritants.  Another great thing about this cream is the pump dispenser that keeps both light and air from the cream.  You also receive 3.40oz &#x27;s rather than the typical 1 or 1.7oz most common with high end creams.  The cream is very heavy though but not greasy at all.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this brand are their labels, for such a high quality product their labels look cheap and something more akin to a brand you would find in the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Everything it says works feels smooth on skin and easy to absorb on skin.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to get this night cream,I love this face cream it&#x27;s amazing I was in a wow after I used this product the result was amazing I loved the way my face felt after using it I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and my recommendations are go for it, it&#x27;s definitely effective and worth the money! 5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> This is a good night cream. I love that it is all natural and no harsh ingredients. I love that it absorbs quickly on my skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion claims to hydrate and plump skin, sooth acne and blemishes, and hydrate deeply. I have to be honest and say nighttime skincare is not part of my regular skincare regimen, and it’s been a struggle for me to regularly add it. (I want it to be a part of my skincare, but it’s making it a habit that I’m working on.) However, I have noticed while using this moisturizer that my skin is much softer and less red in the mornings when I wake up so I feel like it’s definitely working.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly but dries a bit grainy. Not sure of the advertised results.. Will update!</li>
    <li> I was able to notice the difference on my skin after the next few days that I started using it. My skin didn&#x27;t feel oily it absorb quick and just left a fresh sensation on my skin. My fine lines diminish and my overall complexion looked healthy. I am very pleased with the results and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A creamy white moisturizer with no fragrance. Applies smoothly, lightweight, not too thick but feels incredibly moisturizing. A great basic night cream to apply after your eye and wrinkle serums to seal in moisture while you sleep. Fantastic high-quality ingredients, a nice size bottle at 3.4 oz. Easy to use pump - one pump covers the entire face and neck area, which is super convenient!</li>
    <li> Very good product.You feel your skin so smooth and moisturized.I love it!</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling soft.. no breakouts</li>
    <li> Leaves  skin  very smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great cream, just something in this cream reacted with my skin, after using it for a couple days. I ended up with a type of allergic rash on my face. It went away after I stopped using the cream. I am a special case though because I have really sensitive skin. I still like instanatural products.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this moisturizer and it makes my face so soft.</li>
    <li> Makes my face super soft! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
    <li> Use this every night. I have noticed softer skin within a week of using the product. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> smells great, and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a thick, rich, luxuriously hydrating night cream that I have been loving since my skin has taken a beating this winter. When my skin gets dry, I tend to have noticeable wrinkling around the lower part of my eyes/upper cheeks when I smile and I dislike it greatly. This night cream helped hydrate that area and in turn makes me happier and  more youthful looking. It didn&#x27;t break me out and absorbed well, which is wonderful for a night cream.</li>
    <li> My skin is so smooth. Super hydrating and soothing night cream. Excellent product line!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I am ready for another bottle!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product!! Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 1/2 weeks and already LOVE it! I&#x27;m taking 4 meds that dehydrate my skin. This night cream has finally helped me! It&#x27;s a little thick, but you need that at night. You do not need very much. Not even a full pump!</li>
    <li> Great product, my skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily but this did not seem to bother my skin at all it leave my skin feeling great and moisturized! I also like how when you pump it one time you dont get a huge glob of cream, you seem to get the right amount needed and it does not make my skin feeling greasy like other products I have used in the past!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is my honest opinion!**</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is called night cream but I use it every morning under my face makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;my makeup goes on much smoother and blends so much better when I use it.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product!!  My skin has never been better!  It is so soft and younger looking after just a short time of using.  One of the best I have ever used.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best&lt;br /&gt; The two most important anti-aging ingredients of vitamin C and niacinamide plus good moisture ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am loving it so far. It smells good and plumps up my skin to get rid of my fine little lines and has been helping my dark spot i have it seems to be getting lighter!!! So I say try this with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved every InstaNatural product I&#x27;ve tried so far. Their creams absorb without ever feeling greasy and leave my skin feeling amazing. The scent is light and fresh which I really appreciate.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is really thick, and I thought at first it was going to be too greasy. However, I woke up in the morning with a nice, smooth face and it wasn&#x27;t oily at all. I really like this moisturizer for nightly use.</li>
    <li> product arrived as promised and works great along with syrums.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> the top is broken and will not work</li>
    <li> Great night cream.  It&#x27;s moisturizing without being to heavy or sticky.  It&#x27;s a regular part of my routine now.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!! I used it while in Las Vegas during the heat of the summer. It really gave my skin more moisture without the greasy feel of a heavy moisturizer. It also plumped up my smile lines. I am so thrilled with this night cream!!.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product was not for me. My skin is very sensitive and I have a number of allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Evidently, it contains sulfur, which causes my skin to break out. I stopped it as soon as the familiar red blotches&lt;br /&gt;started appearing -- after about 3 applications. The company was very gracious in its response -- immediately&lt;br /&gt;crediting my account for the full price and not requiring me to return the unused rest of the container. I will&lt;br /&gt;try some of their other products as long as they don&#x27;t contain sulfur.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin really soft.</li>
    <li> So far is has been just ok.  It is thick and has an odor that I don&#x27;t really care for.  Since starting using it, I have had a couple of breakouts.  If this is the culprit or not, I will update the review.  So in short, this is nothing special really.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great....this works as promised</li>
    <li> Used only a couple nights so far but there is a difference my face is got some of that firmness back I&#x27;m not gonna stop using this</li>
    <li> non sticky, no bad odor, leaves skin feeling soft</li>
    <li> LEAVES SKIN SILKY SMOOTH</li>
    <li> moisturizer is very creamy and works well with my skin tone. pairs great with their serum.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and well packaged.  I absolutely love this night moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t have the typical &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel of many night moisturizers.  I have very sensitive skin and thicker &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; creams seem to break my skin out.  This has totally solved that problem!</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 weeks now. I only apply it before bed, but I do not like how sticky it feels and does not seem to do much as far as hydration. As for the benefits i am not sure. I usually like to give skin care products a good 8 weeks before judging them. Will let you know.I did break out a couple times. Need to do more research on the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer.  InstaNatural products are awesome. I use this moisturizer at night and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  Love it!  The company sends follow up emails to be sure you are happy with their product and offers suggestions on the best way to use it.  delivery was fast and items were well packaged.  Great service!</li>
    <li> After 2 uses and I can say this product really seems to be working. A little goes a long way. Absorbs quickly. A little sticky but that feeling goes away quickly. No breakouts and if my skin was going to break out from this it would do so after the first application.</li>
    <li> This cream has helped in reducing deep pores. My skin is more smooth now. I have been using it twice from 8 months now and would never go with any other face cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Acts like a serum and moisturizer in one. I Will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love Instanaturals products! I&#x27;m never disappointed in them. During the winter months my face gets dried out a lot, so this really helped. I&#x27;m always pleased when I&#x27;m asked to review an instanatural product. I was also pleased that it always helped with wrinkles, but I&#x27;m pretty sure all of Instanaturals products do that, so I&#x27;m ok with that! Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> The lotion is so the thick the pump will not work.  I tried to fix it and made a mess. I believe the pump was not in working order, so I should have returned the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with this moisturizer. I have used so many and never really felt they were worth it but this one is different. After a few days of using this morning and night my blotchy red skin was gone. My face stays hydrated 24/7 and wrinkles are definitely reduced. I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation anymore because my skin looks so good. I would definitely recommend this to anyone young and older. I am so glad I found something that actually does what it says:) I will be trying their whole line.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional for winter weather. It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth all day without leaving a greasy residue on my face. Also, it has decreased redness and hyper-pigmentation on my cheeks, which has been an issue for me for almost 2 years. I use it at night on my cheeks and chin area, and then again in the morning on every part of my face except my cheeks (to avoid irritation). Just remember that you only need a pea-sized amount when applying the cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend, and will continue to use it throughout the cold winter season!</li>
    <li> This night cream is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This night cream is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two months and I&#x27;ve my skin is softer and more clear. I mostly use it at night (1x/day) and plan to order the daily retinol cream for the mornings. Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uodate: With a packaging change came a scent change that was hard to tolerate. More consumer info should be provided under in instances such as these.</li>
    <li> After success with InstaNatural&#x27;s eye gel, I decided to look into their other products; I didn&#x27;t realize they had so many! I was using a Cetaphil moisturizer everyday, and it was necessary. A combination of my face wash and harsh, cold New England weather made my face dry. I would moisturize at night and still wake up with dry, itchy, flaky skin all over my face (but mostly my cheeks.) The dryness would irritate my skin and make it red, sometimes it would cause me to break out. I tried Cetaphil and also CeraVe, and neither did the job. Cetaphil barely moisturized my skin and I would never wake up without flakes. The Cetaphil moisturizer would also burn me but I couldn&#x27;t decide if it was the Cetaphil or my skin itself.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cream to use at night. It is a thick, but not greasy; exactly what I need. It didn&#x27;t burn me, and it felt great on my skin. Also it contains a lot of good ingredients to calm my skin. I used it and saw results right away- I woke up the next morning with no dry skin AT ALL! I am very pleased. I am using this at night with the Vitamin C moisturizer in the morning. Both are great products and I recommend using them both for optimal skincare.</li>
    <li> Did not like the feel of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I liked this one as well. I am not sure I am old enough to need a Night Cream, but it made the area around my eyes firmer and brighter. I found I used less concealer while using the Night Cream, since I had less darker circles under my eyes. I would buy this again just for the savings on concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I was sent a free sample of this to review by InstaNatural.**</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have definitely seen a difference in my skin and it has been noticed by my friends.  I won&#x27;t buy any other products.  The price is a definite plus too.  I have spent a lot of money on creams and serums and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Bought this randomly after noticing dark circles under my eyes. I have been using this product for about 4 months now and love it. I can feel the difference already and almost immediately after I put it on. I still have some darkness,but I also have a 3yr old who likes to wake at random Times. I can&#x27;t wait to try another product of theirs! Oh and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It really delivers its promise ! Plump and reduce the appearance of wrinkles .... I am really satisfied with my purchase, for this price .... Hey ho :-)</li>
    <li> This Night Cream Moisturizer from InstaNatural is awesome! It feels so good going on my skin and leaves it soft and velvety! Like unbelievably soft!!! If you need a nice moisturizing night cream....LOOK NO FURTHER! You will love the way your skin feels! And InstaNatural uses wonderful natural ingredients that feed  your skin. What more could I ask for! Love it!</li>
    <li> This cream works for me. It&#x27;s light and absorb fast, it makes my skin smooth and soft. Love this product. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
    <li> Another great product by InstaNatural. I am a huge fan of InstaNatural products and have used many. None have disappointed. I as well as my teenager daughter use this nightly. It absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. Leaves skin feeling very soft. My daughter uses it for acne and it has helped to greatly reduce her acne problem. I use around my eyes to help with wrinkles and crows feet. I can definately see a difference. I would recommned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for 4 days now and love the way my skin is feeling.</li>
    <li> Cream is very thick and feel like im caking it on, but that feeling goes away quick when it soaks into the skin.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00QL1ZJK8 Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer 20% For Face - Best Anti Aging Facial Lotion 3.4 oz]]It does not smell good and it does not feel good on your skin. I can not tell it does anything for my skin. Of course i am older so it may just be to late. I also have a lot of sun damage to my face. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream at night for about a week so far, and I really love it! I was a little hesitant to try it out at first because I have oily skin but I&#x27;m glad I did. Even though many people say I still look like I&#x27;m in my teens, I&#x27;m already pushing 30, so I wanted to start using a night cream but I wasn&#x27;t looking for something &amp;#34;anti&amp;#34; anything because I don&#x27;t need it, just something to keep my skin healthy and protected for the time to come. Apparently, my skin was pretty dehydrated and this cream has regulated the oil production on my skin - my face is no longer greasy as it used to be even though it&#x27;s summertime. I have also noticed an amazing glow that I didn&#x27;t have and increased softness. Even with my oily sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve had no acne breakouts, clogged pores, or greasiness with this cream. It absorbs super fast and has a light scent that is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t trigger any sensitivities. I haven&#x27;t tried the rest of the Lumene regimen, but now I&#x27;m really interested in doing so.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer cream, it leaves your skin so nice and soft that my wife loves it. The can is almost gone. We both was using it, but she used it more than me and I was mad lol</li>
    <li> I have received this product for free for review. This cream helps moisture the skin and keep firm it goes on smooth and smells good and feels good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special after a month of usage.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with all InstaNatural skin products. This night cream is easy to pump the desired amount that you need to leave your skin glowing and moisturized!</li>
    <li> This is yet another awesome product from Insta Natural. I have used many of their products and have yet to be disappointed. This is a night cream that has great ingredients, some of the key ones are 5% Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Matrixyl 3000, Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work quickly to hydrate your skin with no great and slimy feeling. Goes great, I use the Moisturizer at night before bed and be sure to rub in a circular motion upwards. When you wake your skin will be mush softer and radiant. You can us in the morning and night as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural’s Youth Express Night Cream provides ultimate hydration benefits to your skin for an improved and more youthful appearance. Niacinamide, one of the key ingredients in our formula, has anti-inflammatory properties that reduce redness and inflammation to soothe irritated skin. It is also known to help reduce acne, scars and hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy yet another Insta Natural product and would highly recommend this to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product free for my review purposes, all opinions are my own unbiased thoughts.</li>
    <li> I have sever dry skin and this night cream is working wonders on me! Quick shipping and great customer service!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  It&#x27;s so refreshing, not sticky and it has a nice smell</li>
    <li> So far so good I like the fact that its not greasy. I use it every night before going to bed It smells great and leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
