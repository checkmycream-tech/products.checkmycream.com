### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Gueralin Vetiver is one of the best colognes I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This Vetiver Guerlain cologne is the best cologne I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a vetiver, this is the best one.</li>
      <li>The smell is great but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This has great reviews in the fashion circles that cover fragrance, but to me, it smells like an ashtray.</li>
      <li>it still smells great.  </li>
      <li>I agree with the reviewer Encee, that Vetiver is a great smelling cologne</li>
      <li>And it smelled great on her, too.  </li>
      <li>A really great scent is meant to seduce not assault the sense of smell.</li>
      <li>This has a great, kind of rugged yet refined odor.</li>
      <li>He looked around, sniffing, and said \\&quot;It smells good in here.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is one that is not worn by everyone--which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>Good luck, Tom Ford, with your mix, but this one excels, year after year.</li>
      <li>Like a good smoked gouda!\\&quot; Huh?</li>
      <li>According to my woman...it&#x27;s the most sexy and the best that she has ever remembered</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous smell, and I guarantee you would love it if you are looking to smell great without it being overpowering.</li>
      <li>buddy of mine also liked it and now he wears it.  </li>
      <li>As it turns out, even though it is a mens fragrance, she liked to wear it as well.  </li>
      <li>My people give me honest feedback about all of my fragrances.  </li>
      <li>This is a strikingly warm, sensual, exotic fragrance.  </li>
      <li>A great spray and perfume for a man you like very much..</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this cologne after reading so many great reviews on it.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver has always been my favorite men&#x27;s scent.  </li>
      <li>(more sniffing)</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, so I indulged him for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>for surely oneday i would love wearing this often.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, its unisex.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be better off spraying yourself with some Repel bug spray.</li>
      <li>This is one of my top 5 fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I find the more modern colognes that are very popular to be overly enhanced chemical reactions that assault the sense of smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very strong, so even if you love the smell, go really light with this one.</li>
      <li>or so it mellows to a nice, woodsy, clean aroma.</li>
      <li>Aside from that I will definitely recommend Vetiver for its uniquely pleasant and indescribable scent and the good value for its cost.</li>
      <li>Some people think the smokey undertone is a bit overwhelming, but I found it is good to make the scent a bit uplifting, since vetiver, by nature, has a very earthy tone.   </li>
      <li>I received the product very quickly, but the jury is still out on how I feel about the smell of the product.  </li>
      <li>That makes it easy to buy birthday gifts for him.   </li>
      <li>The purchase was easy and was delivered on time.  </li>
      <li>I knew a man who once wore this classic cologne, and always smelled so good.  </li>
      <li>Nothing compares to the fresh and sophisticated smell of it.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of all the great reviews on a fragrance site, and a sniff at the local Sephora.  </li>
      <li>It has filled this niche quite well</li>
      <li>Vetiver is such a great scent.</li>
      <li>You can check out basenotes.com that GV is currently the most popular and rated highest of all men fragrances.    </li>
      <li>The service was prompt and clean.</li>
      <li>As always, the larger 4.2 Oz size offers the best value.</li>
      <li>The smell is musky, fresh and old (in a good way).  </li>
      <li>Longevity is great, and over the course of the day as you get hot and work up a sweat you will get nice hits of vetiver wafting up to calm you down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and mellow, fresh.</li>
      <li>but I love it so much, I&#x27;d wear it myself.</li>
      <li>and it faithfully gives me a feeling of having a different more sophisticated (not &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mature), and gentlemanly ambiance.</li>
      <li>After using it  couple of times the smell of Vetiver just vanishes and is quickly replaces by an alcoholized smell.</li>
      <li>But it dries down to a nice, refreshing, clean springtime scent.</li>
      <li>have tried other Vetiver brands, but Guerlain&#x27;s is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Super clean, refreshing, cool but not cold, classy yet not stale.  </li>
      <li>I bought it for my hubby this Christmas and instantly remembered why I loved that smell so much.  </li>
      <li>Your chemistry is essential to create a nice after-scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Vetiver Guerlain comes from one of the most famous perfume houses in the world, and is a reflection in classic tastes - not current trends.  </li>
      <li>I like vetiver, and this blend of Guerlain&#x27;s is just right.  </li>
      <li>And for the price and very prompt delivery, I would recommend buying from this vendor, and I will order from them again !</li>
      <li>This has been the only perfume I have purchased since my Senior Prom, more than 30 years ago.</li>
      <li>I first started wearing Vetiver by Guerlain about 20 years ago when a girlfriend gave me a bottle for my birthday.  </li>
      <li>In fact, for the first twenty minutes you will smell like something that crawled out of the spice cabinet.</li>
      <li>It is a classic frangrance, not stinky or overpowering - but fresh.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that it has such a refined atomizer spray, it will last about 2 years!  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the sexy fresh carrot-smelling top quickly disappears.</li>
      <li>It is a classic, just like classical music - it&#x27;s been around for years, and most people prefer something else.</li>
      <li>But, when I smell it later on a shirt that I have worn I enjoy the lingering scent.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It is my lifelong favorite.  </li>
      <li>actually, the smell remind me of a young lover I had many years ago...ahahahahahah...</li>
      <li>The KEY is NOT to spray too much and NOT to smell too close, that is no closer the 2mm !!!</li>
      <li>This is not a scent that will bring the opposite sex trampling each other to get at you, this is something you will wear to smell good for yourself.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh smelling and citrusy when it first goes on, and then deepens into other scents, including nutmeg, which I usually don&#x27;t care for, but which is pleasant in Vetiver.</li>
      <li>first of all, to make things clear</li>
      <li>Lately, it seems that a lot of manufacturers are starting to use Vetiver more and more in their releases, as an example, Tom Ford has released (in 2010)</li>
      <li>Some things are classic and cannot be compromise.    </li>
      <li>Like others have said, it seems to last longer on clothing than on the skin, but you are going to love it just the same.  </li>
      <li>Younger people probably don&#x27;t respond to this fragrance because they are used to commercial trendy scents which include bio-molecular chemicals rather than real quality essential oils.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Things worth noting:    Vetiver was/is previously listed and probably currently one of the top five men fragrances in the world.    </li>
      <li>I would not put Vetiver Guerlain up there with my all time favorites, but I purchased it to augment my current collection with something more historical and masculine.  </li>
      <li>However, everytime I try to wear it all I can smell is a little old lady who put on way too much cheap hairspray.</li>
      <li>An amazing scent that is low key, but with hints of green citrus, bergamot flower, grassy hills and ocean air.  </li>
      <li>It is a simple but classic scent that women just love and will want to wear your shirt the next day, just because it reminds them of the previous day or evening.   </li>
      <li>Smells really old.  </li>
      <li>What a masculine fragrance.</li>
      <li>Vetiver is soft and never overpowering.</li>
      <li>,I&#x27;m 24,and feel its too old for my age.</li>
      <li>The 4.2 ounce is enough to last months and months, so it is worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>a version called Grey Vetiver, which is has garnered a highly favorable reputation.  </li>
      <li>It is a classic like 18 year old single malt or a Cuban cigar and to a woman having a platinum or white gold diamond ring.     </li>
      <li>I have no idea how the other vetivers like tom ford grey vetiver is gonna be, but for the money you spend on this one,its worth it.</li>
      <li>My husband has been wearing it for years, and even though he tries new ones, he always goes back to this one!</li>

<li> So now I buy it for special occasions when I feel nostalgic about the brand new smell</li>
<li> and I would suggest it to anyone looking to add a scent of Vetiver into their rotation but do not want to splurge on the more expensive Grey Vetiver from Tom Ford.  </li>
<li> but it does not last long on the body but has a long lasting cling on clothing.</li>
<li> I guess it smelled differently on her due to our different body chemistry.  </li>
<li> Was really excited to get this smell, unfortunately my boyfriend won&#x27;t be wearing it unless he plans on sleeping alone.</li>
<li> They changed the bottle a few years back</li>

    <li> I know people have different tastes, but GV is THE No.1 by consensus.  You can check out basenotes.com that GV is currently the most popular and rated highest of all men fragrances.    Super clean, refreshing, cool but not cold, classy yet not stale.  Some people think the smokey undertone is a bit overwhelming, but I found it is good to make the scent a bit uplifting, since vetiver, by nature, has a very earthy tone.   The KEY is NOT to spray too much and NOT to smell too close, that is no closer the 2mm !!!</li>
    <li> It is a uniqueand elegsnt fragrance for men</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly, but the jury is still out on how I feel about the smell of the product.  The smell reminds me of when I used to get a hair cut by this one person that would use talc at the end of the hair cut, not sure I like it. But, when I smell it later on a shirt that I have worn I enjoy the lingering scent.</li>
    <li> first of all, to make things clear i must say this cologne is not for everyone and definitely not for the teens,I&#x27;m 24,and feel its too old for my age.But still i have to say that it has its uniqueness and for surely oneday i would love wearing this often.I have no idea how the other vetivers like tom ford grey vetiver is gonna be, but for the money you spend on this one,its worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Vetiver by Guerlain for 35 years. I have tried other colognes but always return to Vetiver. Younger people probably don&#x27;t respond to this fragrance because they are used to commercial trendy scents which include bio-molecular chemicals rather than real quality essential oils. I find the more modern colognes that are very popular to be overly enhanced chemical reactions that assault the sense of smell. A really great scent is meant to seduce not assault the sense of smell.</li>
    <li> I first started wearing Vetiver by Guerlain about 20 years ago when a girlfriend gave me a bottle for my birthday.  I love it&#x27;s subtle blend of grassy and citrus fragrances.  As it turns out, even though it is a mens fragrance, she liked to wear it as well.  And it smelled great on her, too.  I guess it smelled differently on her due to our different body chemistry.  We broke up amicably years ago, but whenever I smell Vetiver, I am reminded of her.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A buddy of mine also liked it and now he wears it.  My brother returned from Europe and he borrowed a little.  He has worn nothing else ever since.  That makes it easy to buy birthday gifts for him.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried other Vetiver brands, but Guerlain&#x27;s is by far the best.  They changed the bottle a few years back and it was rumored that they had changed the formula, but no matter... it still smells great.  It is my lifelong favorite.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry...</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer Encee, that Vetiver is a great smelling cologne but it does not last long on the body but has a long lasting cling on clothing. Aside from that I will definitely recommend Vetiver for its uniquely pleasant and indescribable scent and the good value for its cost.</li>
    <li> The purchase was easy and was delivered on time.  Gueralin Vetiver is one of the best colognes I have ever used. I always get compliments. Vetiver is soft and never overpowering. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has a great, kind of rugged yet refined odor. Uusually don&#x27;t think men and cologne mix well. My daughter, who&#x27;s eight, loves the smell. I like vetiver, and this blend of Guerlain&#x27;s is just right.  Good luck, Tom Ford, with your mix, but this one excels, year after year.</li>
    <li> Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver has always been my favorite men&#x27;s scent.  My husband has been wearing it for years, and even though he tries new ones, he always goes back to this one!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a vetiver, this is the best one. The fact that it has been around since the 1950s should say something.</li>
    <li> This has great reviews in the fashion circles that cover fragrance, but to me, it smells like an ashtray. There are multiple layers to the scent, but it&#x27;s mostly bad tobacco, and that&#x27;s the one that just won&#x27;t wear off.  It&#x27;s also very strong, so even if you love the smell, go really light with this one.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cologne after reading so many great reviews on it. However, everytime I try to wear it all I can smell is a little old lady who put on way too much cheap hairspray. Not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> Vetiver is such a great scent. And for the price and very prompt delivery, I would recommend buying from this vendor, and I will order from them again !</li>
    <li> This fragrance never disappoints-I buy it every year for my husband but I love it so much, I&#x27;d wear it myself. The service was prompt and clean. No complaints!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, its unisex.  Smell lasts longer on clothing than on skin.  The smell strength on my skin is too low, it might work differently on your skin.   Unlike me, always test before you buy.  I will try Drakkar Noir next time.</li>
    <li> This has been the only perfume I have purchased since my Senior Prom, more than 30 years ago. The fragrance is just terrific. Nothing compares to the fresh and sophisticated smell of it. Sadly the fragrance won&#x27;t last. After using it  couple of times the smell of Vetiver just vanishes and is quickly replaces by an alcoholized smell. So now I buy it for special occasions when I feel nostalgic about the brand new smell and it buy it in the smallest size possible. Sad that Guerlain has not improved the formula after so many years.</li>
    <li> I tested this today on myself, and kept up the sniff test all afternoon. It&#x27;s fresh smelling and citrusy when it first goes on, and then deepens into other scents, including nutmeg, which I usually don&#x27;t care for, but which is pleasant in Vetiver. After an hour or so it mellows to a nice, woodsy, clean aroma. I will definitely get some for my hubby for Christmas, but he&#x27;ll have to share...</li>
    <li> This fragrance is one that is not worn by everyone--which is a good thing. This is a strikingly warm, sensual, exotic fragrance.  Like others have said, it seems to last longer on clothing than on the skin, but you are going to love it just the same.  You will get A LOT of compliments on this one.  It is NOT OVERPOWERING, but a scent that leaves a lasting impression of a man with class!  Vetiver Creed doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this one.  This is one of my top 5 fragrances.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Vetiver de Guerlain...un clasico atemporal que ha pesar de tener casi 50 años en venta, se sigue sintiendo actual.    Como dueño de mas de 30 fragancias distintas(D&amp;G,Chic,Versace,etc)esta frag está entre mis primeras 3, aparte que si buscas una fragancia para todo tipo de clima y que encaje en todo tipo de forma de vestir la adquieras.    Su durabilidad es de aprox 10 hrs. en mi piel con una buena presencia(sillage) y de Guerlain ya sabes..simepre ingredientes de alta calidad.</li>
    <li> This Vetiver Guerlain cologne is the best cologne I&#x27;ve tried. The smell is great but not overpowering. The 4.2 ounce is enough to last months and months, so it is worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of it for myself back in Barcelona, Spain at a perfumery about 20 years ago and I have not look back and I am just 43.  Something that transcends times and/or trends/fads; it is the man&#x27;s version of Channel #5.   It is a simple but classic scent that women just love and will want to wear your shirt the next day, just because it reminds them of the previous day or evening.   It is a classic like 18 year old single malt or a Cuban cigar and to a woman having a platinum or white gold diamond ring.     Some things are classic and cannot be compromise.    Things worth noting:    Vetiver was/is previously listed and probably currently one of the top five men fragrances in the world.    Also the King of Spain, Juan Carlos prefers Vetiver over any other fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, so I indulged him for Christmas.  An amazing scent that is low key, but with hints of green citrus, bergamot flower, grassy hills and ocean air.  The good news is that it has such a refined atomizer spray, it will last about 2 years!  Could be a unisex EDT.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews on a fragrance site, and a sniff at the local Sephora.  Unfortunately, the sexy fresh carrot-smelling top quickly disappears. The smell becomes very disturbing - stale cinnamon, stale tobacco, and fresh Raid bug spray.    My people give me honest feedback about all of my fragrances.  Here are five comments I received on this one:    1.  Dull.  2.  Smells like weed.  3.  Smells like trees.  It&#x27;s like sniffing the bark of a tree.  4.  Smells really old.  5.  I don&#x27;t like it.    I sold the bottle on eBay for 33 bucks.  I&#x27;ve never been happier to lose 7 dollars.    It is a classic, just like classical music - it&#x27;s been around for years, and most people prefer something else.</li>
    <li> According to my woman...it&#x27;s the most sexy and the best that she has ever remembered</li>
    <li> Vetiver Guerlain comes from one of the most famous perfume houses in the world, and is a reflection in classic tastes - not current trends.  Lately, it seems that a lot of manufacturers are starting to use Vetiver more and more in their releases, as an example, Tom Ford has released (in 2010) a version called Grey Vetiver, which is has garnered a highly favorable reputation.  I would not put Vetiver Guerlain up there with my all time favorites, but I purchased it to augment my current collection with something more historical and masculine.  It has filled this niche quite well and I would suggest it to anyone looking to add a scent of Vetiver into their rotation but do not want to splurge on the more expensive Grey Vetiver from Tom Ford.  The smell is musky, fresh and old (in a good way).  It would remind women, that they are out with a man of taste with an appreciation for the clasics.  As always, the larger 4.2 Oz size offers the best value.</li>
    <li> I bought this blind after reading the reviews here and on basenotes.  If I had tried this in a store I would never have bought it, the first whiff is almost unpleasantly herbal. In fact, for the first twenty minutes you will smell like something that crawled out of the spice cabinet. But it dries down to a nice, refreshing, clean springtime scent. Longevity is great, and over the course of the day as you get hot and work up a sweat you will get nice hits of vetiver wafting up to calm you down. This is not a scent that will bring the opposite sex trampling each other to get at you, this is something you will wear to smell good for yourself.    The closest to a compliment I got from this cologne was from a customer who walked into my store. He looked around, sniffing, and said \\&quot;It smells good in here. (more sniffing) Like a good smoked gouda!\\&quot; Huh?</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like bug spray, like some of the other buyers have commented. Was really excited to get this smell, unfortunately my boyfriend won&#x27;t be wearing it unless he plans on sleeping alone. You&#x27;d be better off spraying yourself with some Repel bug spray.</li>
    <li> I knew a man who once wore this classic cologne, and always smelled so good.  I bought it for my hubby this Christmas and instantly remembered why I loved that smell so much.  It is a classic frangrance, not stinky or overpowering - but fresh.  There are other Vetiver cologne&#x27;s out there, but they smell NOTHING like the Guerlain from France. It&#x27;s a gorgeous smell, and I guarantee you would love it if you are looking to smell great without it being overpowering. It&#x27;s smooth and mellow, fresh.</li>
    <li> What a masculine fragrance. It has remained the same for decades!!! It is unparalleled and remains undaunted by any of today&#x27;s fragrance wanna be&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> One of those beauties that morphs 15 minutes after applied. Your chemistry is essential to create a nice after-scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years and it faithfully gives me a feeling of having a different more sophisticated (not &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mature), and gentlemanly ambiance.</li>
    <li> A great spray and perfume for a man you like very much..it was a gift....actually, the smell remind me of a young lover I had many years ago...ahahahahahah...</li>
