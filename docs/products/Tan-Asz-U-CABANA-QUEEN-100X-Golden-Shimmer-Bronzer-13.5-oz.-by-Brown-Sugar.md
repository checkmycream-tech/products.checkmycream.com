    <li> ALL IT IS, IS A BRONZER. BUT ITS NOT BAD FOR WHAT IT IS U CAN SEE THE COLOR WHEN U PUT IT ON.</li>
    <li> The lotion was very thick and dark. It rubbed off onto everything and left marks on my clothes. It was messy and stained my hands. A little too dark for me.</li>

    <li> I wish it has a bit more of the micro shimmer. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion. I was feeling like I was at a plateau with my tanning. Well I tried Cabana Queen and I looked darker from right out of the bed. It smells wonderful and it is thick and rich. I think I will buy a bottle now. The smell stays with you long after tanning, which is something I always had trouble finding. Check it out!</li>
    <li> Cabana Queen 100x tanning lotion by Tan Asz U isn&#x27;t something I would buy again. i just was not very happy with it.</li>
