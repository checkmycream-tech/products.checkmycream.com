      <li>Petty gold make up bag but barely large enough to hold the make up palette.</li>
      <li>There was barely anything in it.</li>

    <li> Gift for my wife she likes it.</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER. I REALLY LOVE THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping from seller! Beautiful make up! Love the mascara,it lengthens and thickens my thin short lashes. The eye shadows are rich colors. I love the lip sticks and glosses also! It&#x27;s a big kit with nice serum and cream included. Petty gold make up bag but barely large enough to hold the make up palette. Very nice train case comes with it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good i gave it as a present to my wife and she liked except the foundation is missing</li>
    <li> EXCELENT FOR MOTHERS DAY OR CHRISTMAS!</li>
    <li> These are always a good gift item.  The listed price is somewhat high compared to some department store prices (Macy&#x27;s, Dillards, Nordstrum), but the department stores normally require another purchase to qualify for their price.  It pays to shop around.  Nordstrum and Dillards, for example, were also recently offering a free gift with purchase of $55 or more (while supplies lasted).  The contents are a good variety and are good value for the money.  I bought five of these to use as gifts.  Women friends look forward to such gifts.</li>
    <li> as described...great colors.. love the eye shadow..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know.  Gave it as gift. Person seemed to like it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t include half of the items described. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Everything perfect. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The seller was A+ in handling and delivery. I&#x27;ve been buying a Lauder Blockbuster for decades at Christmas. This Blockbuster is embarrassingly light. Where are all the eye shadows, brushes, pencils etc? This is the worst Blockbuster I&#x27;ve seen from Estee Lauder. There was barely anything in it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful !! I m so grat thanksss</li>
    <li> Great nice Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Wife loved it, thank you!</li>

    <li> An Estee Lauder Blockbuster is a set any woman would adore. The 2014 collection offers a nicely designed train case in dark navy satin with a full zip closure and signature gold tone hardware. The cosmetics are pure luxury. An array of versatile colors are included for day and night. I&#x27;m impressed with ALL. Included are the following:&lt;br /&gt;A gold faux croc companion bag, nice enough to use as a clutch. 2 Deluxe mirrored palettes designed in gold croc. One palette contains a collection of eye shadows and blush with applicators while the other houses 3 lip glosses (balm quality).&lt;br /&gt;But that is not all. Additionally there are 3 full sized lipsticks, a full size mascara, an eyeliner pencil, a full size bottle of eye makeup remover, fragrance, nail lacquer, and skin care items. It&#x27;s truly a value compared to what you could pay. The lipsticks alone retail for $26 each. I absolutely love it!</li>
