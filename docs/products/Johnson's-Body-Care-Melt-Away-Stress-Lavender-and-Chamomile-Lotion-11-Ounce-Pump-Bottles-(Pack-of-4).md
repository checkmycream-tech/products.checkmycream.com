<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only lotion that works for my sensitive skin, keeps my skin soft and actually relaxes my muscles. I would definitely recommend this lotion to relax your muscles.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The scent is so relaxing. I apply to myself and children before bedtime and it aids in their rest. My husband even sneaks and uses the lotion, I know it must be good</li>
    <li> I grabbed this at a Rite Aid as I was running to catch a flight. Needed something smaller than 3 ounces and saw this in the trial size bins. I was going on a dreaded work trip and I admit the words \\&quot;stress relief\\&quot; on the tube lured me in. But I have been using this lotion religiously ever since then. It just leaves my skin feeling so soft, almost like it has baby powder on it, not greasy at all. And I DO like drinking in the scent as I apply the lotion, although thankfully the scent is not overpowering. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion because I&#x27;ve been unable to find it at any local stores. It&#x27;s really creamy without being greasy. And it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Hands seem softer.  The lavender smell is relaxing and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a very respectable product. the scent is strong but not overpowering and the texture is not greasy and sinks in after a few minuites.&lt;br /&gt;  I took one star away because I was looking for a silky product that would be buttery and absorb more quickly, still a very good product.</li>
    <li> I concur with everyone else who raves about this lotion.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and has a very pleasant, though not overwhelming, scent to it.  There&#x27;s a reason every store I have been to can&#x27;t keep it in stock!  And Amazon&#x27;s price is quite comparable.  I also keep the small travel size in my car and in my fanny pack for on the go moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion because it has such a suttle smell, it&#x27;s not greasy or oily and keeps my skin soft. I use it an all over body lotion before bedtime and during the day I use it as a hand lotion. I love it for my hands because I do not like perfume scents on my hands...doesn&#x27;t mix well with food or if you accidentally taste it! Been using this lotion for 5 years and all my cousins use it as well! Was sad because I searched for months for it in all different stores as did my cousins because we ran out and only place I was able to find it was here on amazon.com. Amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. To bad they stopped making it. I have to find something else to replace it. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> Great product...really calms you down and helps u relax. Love this product sleep great at night with this product. It is the best</li>
    <li> Love its smell. It seems to melt (pun intended) into the skin and does not leave an oily trace. smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin all and it&#x27;s very sensitive! Glad I found this as it&#x27;s no longer sold in stores!!!</li>
    <li> I am such a big fan of this lotion, however sadly the company no longer makes it.  :(  If I am ever out and see it I buy it all.  It smells wonderful and my hands are super soft.</li>
    <li> My job requies frequent hand washing and consequent dry skin.  This lotion penetrates readily and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to the skin.  It has a pleasant fragrance without being feminine.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, non greasy, absorbs well. The price is horrible and I will not pay the price I paid for this lotion.</li>
    <li> best lotion i have ever used. glad i got the 4 pack. i will never go back to my old lotion. this smells great, light scent, just enough and not overpowering. makes my skin super soft with NO greasy feeling. i have never had a lotion that didnt leave even a little greasyness. this lotion soaks in and leaves skin soft. within seconds of rubbing it in my hands are soft but i can put my rings back on with no residue. love it and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just love this and the body wash.  Cant get enough wish they still sold in the stores so that i could buy soon as i run out.</li>
    <li> Why is it every time I find a lotion that I truly enjoy it gets discontinued by the company? Thank you Amazon for having this product. I work in the medical field and this lotion is always there after I wash my hands, which is a hundred times a day... Makes all the difference in the world to my hands!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great scent and soothes my dry skin and gets rids of itchiness! Smells great and feminine relaxing me  to rest like a baby!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion really make me feel silkly smooth and the smell is so pleasant I just lov eit.</li>
    <li> great item, item was as described. item arrive on delivery as was promised...i love the way this item smells...i need to purchase a few more.</li>
    <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson Lavender &amp; Chamomile Lotion is my favorite lotion. After a long day at work, the scent helps me relax. I apply it every night after I shower. It is a hard to find item though. Walmart may carry it 1 out of the 10 visits but I am able to go to Amazon.com and purchase them anytime of the day. I am able to buy a pack of 4 at a very reasonable price without leaving my home. Amazon.com is very convienent alternative to the drive and crowded stores who may not even have what I am looking for. The shipment is quick which makes the choice even better.</li>
    <li> After having been using this lotion for over a year, I can honestly say that I will never use another lotion again. Once you use it, every other lotion just doesn&#x27;t compare. The smell is so soothing its definitely a great night time lotion. After a warm shower it makes me just want to lay down with a comfy blanket, a good book, and a hot cup of tea and completely relax.&lt;br /&gt;Not only will it put me to sleep like a baby, but it helps me out with head aches too and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily it makes it so so soft. I love love love this stuff! Definitely recommended this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really nice and absorps quickly. Not only me but my whole family uses this lotion for dry hands.</li>
    <li> Johnson&#x27;s Body Care is just that: a smooth and very fresh smelling lotion that is great.  I ordered several so I could have one in my swimming bag, one by the bed, and one in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I love the scent - sublte yet soothing. I love the consistency, I never feel greasy after putting this on - just soft and moisturized. So glad I found it on Amazon to buy because I stopped finding it avaiable in all my grocery/drug stores.</li>
    <li> This product smells the same as I remember, but the texture is off -- it&#x27;s a bit gritty.  Not sure why.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. I am so upset that J&amp;J is discontinuing it!  Lightweight yet very moisturizing.  Excellent smell!</li>
    <li> THIS LOTION HAS A FANTASTIC SMELL OF LAVENDER AND CHAMOMILE.  IT IS NON-GREASY AND LEAVES YOUR SKIN FEELING GREAT.  THANK GOODNESS I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT THROUGH AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I had a small tube of this lotion and loved it. I had a terrible time finding it and was so glad when I saw that you had the product.  I love the smell and once I rub the lotion on I truly do feel a calming feeling. I&#x27;m afraid the next time I need it I won&#x27;t be able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you for carrying the melt away stress lotion by Johnson&#x27;s body care.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful.  It&#x27;s the perfect way to cap off a hot bath, very relaxing.  I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I am so excited that I found a place where I can get my lotion.  Love it because it smells good and it most definitely makes me feel good!!</li>
    <li> I&lt;br /&gt; love the scent, the smoothness of my skin after using it.&lt;br /&gt; Can&#x27;t get it anymore at my local stores.</li>
    <li> Cannot find this product locally.  Used every night on lower legs and feet for more restful sleep.  Love - Love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect...heavenly scent, not sticky at all.  Started using it a couple of years ago, now I can&#x27;t find it in stores, which makes me very sad!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used -- never greasy always silky. I&#x27;m bewildered why it is not being sold in stores any longer.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The smell is wonderful and apparently Jonhson&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s has discontinued the line. I ordered 4 bottles and all 4 contained grit, or some sort of granules. I have purchased it many times in the store without issue, but this was kind of gross.</li>
    <li> This lotion is something to die for.....I use it daily and the scent is awesome and would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> When I learned that they were discontinuing this scent, I was so upset! It smells so nice, and is really light.  Luckily, I found a set of four bottles here at Amazon (the place where nearly everything can be found ;-)!  I got a box of four, which will hopefully last me a while. Until then, I can deny that anything has been discontinued, and deal with it later. ;-)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion and I am unable to find in stores anywhere. Service was quick and reliable. I will definately use again!!</li>
    <li> I feel so wonderful when I put this lotion on. I have been using it for sometime now and I think it&#x27;s wonderful. Thank you Amazon for getting me this product. I can&#x27;t find it in any of my stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and was sorry to see that the stores I used to buy it have stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Not sure why they don&#x27;t make it anymore, was just very happy I could find it here on Amazon. Hopefully can find more when this is done.</li>
    <li> Dissappointed with this product.  The first 2 bottles I used of this lotion had a gritty residue when applying to the skin - I get the feeling that it was considered a bad batch but not bad enough to not sell :( I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best body lotion I have used in years!! I love the Lavender scent!! MY ONLY WISH IS: THAT I COULD GET IT LOCALLY!!!&lt;br /&gt;And... I&#x27;d like to find it in a light cologne to spray on...</li>
    <li> I love this lotion but they discontinued it ;-(, first it was the Body Wash and now the lotion, I found my last 6 bottles at Big Lots, I went looking for more yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t find any, the smell is so wonderful and body wash and lotion was great combo,  Johnson &amp; Johnson please bring this product back!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion, I keep it on my desk at work so I can use it every day. Target recently started selling the smaller, individual use bottles too!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Light lotion, good before bed and after showers. I wish Johnson did not discontinue this line</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best!!  It keeps my hands and body soft as velvet, and thats saying alot as I work as a nurse and have chronically dry hands...</li>
    <li> Looks and smells right, moisturizes well, but there is a somewhat grainy consistency - hard to explain but almost as if for every full pump there are 2-3 hard particles- as if there is exfoliant in it.  I have to imagine this is because this is a discontinued product so the stability of the formula is compromised.  Worth it if you&#x27;re as obsessed with this lotion as I am, but a little weird.</li>
    <li> This is the very best body lotion of all for my dry skin.  Since it is no longer in production, I&#x27;m grateful to be able to buy it at Amazon.  It penetrates.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily.  It&#x27;s smooth.  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have three daughters and we all love this product.  We couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, so we looked it up online and found it. This lotion smells so good and feels good when you put it on. We love it.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of my favorite daily use lotions. It feels great and goes on silky smooth. The scent is a lovely lavender and chamomile that smells especially nice after a hot shower or bath. Not only does it smell good, but it also is an excellent non-greasy moisturizer. I usually put this on before bed and the comforting fragrance helps me sleep.</li>
    <li> There is some kind of gritty stuff in this lotion. We got more than one bottle and it&#x27;s in all of them.  The stuff seems to dissolve once you apply it, but really, I wasn&#x27;t pleased that this lotion feels like Go-Jo hand cleaner. Not worth returning, nor is it worth buying again.</li>
    <li> I hate this lotion stopped showing up on shelves where I live because it&#x27;s great, light, doesn&#x27;t have too strong of fragrance and actually moisturizes well.</li>
