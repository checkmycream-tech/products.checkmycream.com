      <li>Also, using a Q-tips is wasteful too as much of the gel like product is absorbed by the cotton.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Giving only an okay.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3-4 weeks and have not noticed visible results yet.  Thus, the 3 stars. Seller appears interested in my opinion which is a good sign.  I just don&#x27;t know how long it takes before results (if there are to be any) show.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this serum, a little goes a long way.  I have experienced a lessening of the bags under my eyes.  I use it twice a day and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product love it !!</li>
    <li> Youthful Brilliance is a great product to turn back the hands of time!!  This eye serum is competitively priced and has some of the best ingredients on the market.  I use it for fine lines under my eyes.  It has shown a significant improvement.  Easy to apply and for maximum benefit you use it 2 times a day.  If you don&#x27;t see results within 60 days they will give you your money back!!  No hassle either which is great,  So you have nothing to loose. My favorite part is there is no greasy mess, no white residue, and no flaking! This is odorless so it won&#x27;t cause tearing.  I have sensitive eyes and allergies so lots of things I can&#x27;t use on my face.  This doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit and it works great.  You instantly notice a difference in the way your eye feels.  *received for testing and review</li>
    <li> The Youthful Brilliance  Eye Serum really works! It leaves you skin feeling soft and smooth. After using jt for a few days I noticed younger looking skin with less lines.</li>
    <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> good price, thank you</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot; however, it is difficult to maneuver the squirt top.  For the most part, too much product comes out with each squirt.  The product is excellent otherwise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C serums for my face and neck for about 6 months now with excellent results. The problem is that they all say to avoid the eye area. This product fills that gap. I don&#x27;t have puffy eyes or circles in the morning but I do have under eye wrinkles and they looked so tired. This wakes them up and minimizes my lines. I love the bottle. Bella NuDerma did not spare expense in it&#x27;s packaging. The pump disperses the proper amount of serum. There&#x27;s no need for you to figure out how much to put on. I prefer to use American made products whenever possible regardless of the cost but this fine product won&#x27;t break the bank. I&#x27;ll be back when I run out. I highly recommend this eye serum and appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount to test as a consumer.</li>
    <li> i love it!! very gooooood!</li>
    <li> very impressed something not soo expensive works a lot better than the expensive ones, i will definitely buy more of this product</li>
    <li> Received my first bottle on January 22nd and started using it immediately.  I do like the feel of the product and because a little is all that is needed, the product should last for several weeks.  The bottle is very small and will easily travel with you.  I am looking forward to the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peggy</li>
    <li> very very good!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> What a great product! My husband and I have been only using this product for a few weeks but can already tell a difference. It absorbs quickly, not greasy and takes away the morning puffiness under our eyes. Love the gel formula and a little goes a long way. The rich vitamins are great for the skin and you can actually feel your skin tighten with every use.</li>
    <li> use about a month, great product</li>
    <li> Price is also cheap, the product is also more than expected seller willing to very kindly answering&lt;br /&gt;Please buy good things comfortably</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this product is worth the money or not.  It was delivered but someone in my household failed to give it to me until this morning, 9 days outside of the return window.  When I tried to use it the pump would not deliver the product.  I really wanted to give this product a chance but smdo not want to pay for it twice for a chance it might work.</li>
    <li> My experience is that it feels sticky around my eyes and the stickiness doesn&#x27;t go away no matter how long it&#x27;s been on. I&#x27;m one who hates to waste anything so I&#x27;d kept it on hand and when I decided to give it another try before totally giving up on it, I found I couldn&#x27;t get but a tiny amount of it to come out of the nozzle. It turned out the reason was because it was only coming from the top portion of the pump mechanism because when I opened the bottle to see why it wasn&#x27;t coming out I found no stem attached to the pump. I&#x27;m unable to tell where inside the bottle the stem is located as it blends in with the gel like product quite well obviously and, thus, am unable to reattach it. So, I resorted to putting a Q-tip in the bottle to get some product out to try once more. Also, using a Q-tips is wasteful too as much of the gel like product is absorbed by the cotton. Having this experience added to the sticky feeling the product leaves on my eyes is why I only gave it only one star.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t see any difference, much to my disappointment.</li>
    <li> Youthful Brilliance Eye Serum by Bella NuDerma is like 911 for those of us who&#x27;s always going somewhere and doing something or even suffering from Gentics (Dark Circles) or allergy season &#x3D; Puffy Eyes...Just Say No!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is nonirritating, not heavily scented nor does it irratate those of us who wear contacts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Beauty Must Have</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older (51 ), the one area that is starting to show my age is my eyes.  I often have dark circles -- and the crows feet are showing up due to my age, sun damage, and environmental factors.  I&#x27;ve tried different products and when I saw that this serum by Bella NuDerma contains Argireline and Vitamin C, I was hoping it would help me.  After further reading,  I saw that it also contains Vitamins A, B6, D, and E. I was hooked!&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pump bottle - I use it in the morning and night after washing but before moisturizing.  The pump dispenses just the right amount. One pump is enough for both eyes.  I appreciate the pump because it keeps the product fresh.  Since using the Youth Brilliance Eye Serum I have noticed my circles are somewhat diminished and the fine lines are definitely softer.  My undereye area looks more hydrated--plumped up--moisturized.  I love the results and the way it goes on.  It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly into the skin.  I have been pleased with the difference it is making and I&#x27;m excited to see how much more improvement I will have as I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I got this eye serum at a promotional price for evaluation and review purposes and I&#x27;m happy to share my opinions, as I often buy items online and I  rely on the reviews of others when trying to decide whether or not to buy, as well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great product for my aging skin. I decided to give this one a try. It was definitely worth the try. It worked within a week. It did not take long at all to see the results that I was looking for. I love the way it makes my eyes feel. You dont have to use much at all. You will see the results fast and will be addicted to this product.</li>
    <li> feel better when I get up with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;it helps my eyes look young.</li>
    <li> very good serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my facial skin was than better.</li>
    <li> I wanted this for the saggy skin under my eyes.  It didn&#x27;t make as much difference as I had hoped but it did help the wrinkles appear less prominent.  If it were refrigerated it mike help the bags better.</li>
    <li> About the 3rd time I tried to use it nothing came out. Either it was empty or defective. I returned it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an expensive bottle of pretty much nothing... I bought this in hopes it would help me from looking like I&#x27;m dying (I am very sick and under lots of medication so my eyes have a dark ring around them so I always look really tired) you are better off getting a bottle of Aloe Vera and using it. It has the same thing pretty much. Also they only give you a few drops! Half the bottle is hallow plastic check this out I measured the death of the bottle with a small waxing stick. Don&#x27;t buy. All it does is stiffen your face a bit but you can do the same thing with Aloe Vera. Works exactly the same don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Good. It&#x27;s fantastic. I am well favored</li>
    <li> this is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;The effect seems to be better at night</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It only takes a drop for each eye.  It absorbs quickly with no greasy feel.  My eyes look brighter and not dark circle.  When I saw it on sale, I purchased it even though I don&#x27;t need it yet.</li>
    <li> This product is a scam no visible difference after using for several months</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed in this product.  I actually have seen no results from the cream other than a moisturizing effect.  I really wish it would have worked.  I was so looking forward to seeing some proof.</li>
    <li> Star using the little product I can get from such dispenser...(it absorb just right..) Worst dispenser impossible to pump .. Its kind of empty you just see a little bit of gel around the bottle, it has a little nozzle no stem attached to the pump  and you lost most of the few product that can come inside.. Kind of expensive for the little product that is available inside the bottle.</li>
    <li> I only used the serum once a day for the first couple of weeks because my eyes got sensitive at first. Now, I can use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I and my wife had used during about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;In a word, it seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;And, this serum is watery condition.&lt;br /&gt;So, it is easily absorbed into the skin rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this morning and night for a week.  One pump dispenses plenty of serum for both eyes.  I feel like this leaves a protective film moistening and softening under my eyes.  I will continue to use to see additional benefits.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome eye serum that does&#x27;t take long to see results. I used this eye serum on my son because it is great for both men and women and my son has natural puffiness around his eyes. This eye serum is very quick absorbing it only takes a small drop drops results are amazing!! The puffiness and the dark circles are gone! I have had him use this product once in the morning and once before bed. There is no trick to applying this serum. You just smooth it over the bottom of your eye where the puffiness and dark circles are and lastly on eyelid. Above are before and after pictures of my sons eye and also a picture to show you it only takes a small of a dot so this bottle will last you a very long time!  I did receive this product at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest opinion and review of this product. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> love this product and the changes it has made under my eyes&lt;br /&gt;this is a must try product</li>
    <li> Worst dispenser ever! !! Will not purchase again on that reason alone. impossible to pump a small amount out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as claimed for puffiness.</li>
    <li> Bags under my eyes from not enough sleep, wiping my make up or simply getting old .. . I was so excited to get this product called youthful brilliance-eye serum. I ordered and thought I&#x27;d have to wait awhile for it to reach here cause I am in Hawaii but it got here really fast just a couple days. I was so excited when  amazon messaged me it was gonna be here soon. I got it in the afternoon so I started using it the next day. In bout a week I seen my eyes look better then before. A must use or try product. Great product and fast shipping..</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...A FIVE STAR...I DON&#x27;T REALLY NOTICE A DIFFERENCE AFTER APPLYING IT...BUT IF I FORGET TO PUT ON BEFORE APPLYING MY EYE MAKEUP I CAN SEE A RADICAL DIFFERENCE ON MY EYELIDS...YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE CREPINESS ON MY EYELIDS WITHOUT IT SO IT REALLY DOES MAKE A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE...A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY...I BOUGHT 2 AND I AM STILL ON THE FIRST BOTTLE...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT &amp; I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> This caused a bump under my eye after 2 days, so does not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see much difference but I&#x27;ll keep trying</li>
    <li> A very little bit goes a long way. I use retan A and this too. Im very pleased with my results,but it must be used daily</li>
    <li> I have never loved anything more. Not only do my eyes look smoother and less puffy, but I&#x27;m addicted to the way this syrum makes them feel as well. Awesome product, I&#x27;d highy recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a less expences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a less expensive eye serum for my clarisonic opal. This was it!!! It works great! I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It works better then what I was using before</li>
    <li> There are so many products on the market today. If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ve probably tried more than your fair share. I&#x27;ve spent literally thousands of dollars over the years on *today&#x27;s miracle*&lt;br /&gt;This serum really works! You can immediately feel it&#x27;s firming effect with a pleasant tingling sensation. Fine lines are diminished and skin is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it every morning after I wash and dry my face. I use it before my daily moisturizer. I also apply it every night after I wash my face and remove all traces of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I love the tingling feeling!  I did receive this product at a great promotional price for fair and honest feedback /review /opinion. In no way was my opinion swayed by this.</li>
    <li> This is so wonderful! I have gotten this under a promotional price in exchange for a honest review. I am going to say this. It is one of the most gentle eye formulas. When I put it on I kept thinking it would be like some of the others. It isnt that they hurt they are just rough on the skin as I have very sensitive skin. This was great. My skin stayed soft and wonderful! After using it for a few days I notice less lines and younger looking skin. Very very nice. I will be adding this to my regular skin care products</li>
    <li> eyes feel smoother and not as puffy</li>
    <li> puffiness was greatly reduced after the first week. Dark circles may take more time..</li>
    <li> Great product, came quickly and seems to be working.</li>
    <li> It feels so smooth!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great..I&#x27;ll be honest..I use it as an under makeup primer on my whole face..may be wrong but who cares..it works! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I just got the eye gel and have only used it a few times, so even though its early to see changes my first impression is that the gel felt cool and refreshing, it has a cucumber smell which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to most eye creams and this absorbed fast and didn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus eye mask was a great surprise, Loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my girlfriend. she said she loves this products. No only around her eyes, she likes to use this also on her pimples as she saw this serum helps to reduce the small scars as well. I am going to buy another for mom soon, :)</li>
    <li> I received Youth brilliance Eye serum for a lower price for my opinion. I love it! I usually have datj circles around my eyes and they have been getting lighter every day. If  don&#x27;t like being a raccoon buy this product</li>
    <li> I tried this the evening I received it and when I woke up the next morning my eyes were very red and swollen.  The swelling took several days to go down but the redness and sensitivity I still have.  The serum felt like it burned the skin around my eyes, I wasn&#x27;t able to put any cream around them even to help heal them.  I am very disappointed in this serum, and the seller, they did contact me and ask what I thought about their product, I told them what happened to me and they didn&#x27;t even respond.</li>
    <li> I just used  this eye serum for a week and I liked so far.</li>
    <li> I received this product and met up with my Mom to ask her if she would mind testing this product for me as I received the product at a discounted price to provide a review during a promotional offer.  So I purchased the Youth Brilliance Eye Serum with her in mind because she always looks so tired and needed something to brighten her up. She has been using this product a little over two weeks and she has had an awesome experience with his product. Her bags around her eyes aren&#x27;t as noticeable and the dark circles have lightened as well. She told me that you feel the serum tightening up her skin the very first use and she is sold on the product.  That makes me happy. Thank you Bella NuDerma for the opportunity!
