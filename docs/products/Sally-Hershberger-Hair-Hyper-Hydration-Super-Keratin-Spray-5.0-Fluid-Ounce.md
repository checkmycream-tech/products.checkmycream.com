      <li>A fine mist</li>
      <li>but Im fine using it until is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff mostly makes my bathroom floor super slippery.</li>

      <li>Lightly work it in and you won&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
      <li>This spray makes the waves look beautiful and put together, not wild and out of control.  </li>
      <li>You know when your hair looks just okay after all the work of the right shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I love it and noticed difference right away when I was done styling my hair.  </li>
      <li>To me it&#x27;s an airy light clean smell.</li>
      <li>so I will not have to clean the floor every morning.  </li>
      <li>You will love it and I am very picky with my hair products.</li>
      <li>&quot; was SUCH a good instinct.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this spray.</li>
      <li>but luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger all day.</li>
      <li>havent had as much split ends, its OK as far as products go, ive used better keratin sprays at the price point</li>
      <li>No greasy and smells fresh.</li>
      <li>This spray has made my hair so healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>I am really NOT crazy about the scent</li>
      <li>I blow-dried and straightened my hair right after using (which I already never do</li>
      <li>But since it doesn&#x27;t really do anything special, it will go in the trash</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and it can get well very large and frizzy.</li>
      <li>For someone middle age with very long damaged hair, that&#x27;s incredible.  </li>
      <li>something I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to do without looking like a total disaster morning.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to focus on middle to ends of hair when spraying because you don&#x27;t want that on the roots.</li>
      <li>I have used products similar to this that work WAY better.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what the bottle says.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love this product - it has taken my dry hair and turned it to pure gold!</li>
      <li>but it looked like my only option because the right side of my head from the top down looked and felt like straw while the rest of the hair looked healthy.</li>
      <li>I may use it as an overnight conditioner only due to the great reviews, but I will not use it in the morning again.</li>
      <li>I also just started using the Babyface Pure Protein serum once every two weeks.</li>
      <li>straight while still maintaining body.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s even crazier is that I have been able to shower at night and go to bed with wet hair,</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
      <li>This product adds so much shine with no build up.</li>
      <li>One word of caution when you spray it on your hair if it gets on your bathroom floor our floor will be very slippery.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product which I ordered twice.  Pump did not work on either bottle and I will not order it again.</li>
    <li> Hair somewhat looks the same. Maybe a little less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Leaves my hair looking silky smooth and takes away my frizz!</li>
    <li> not bad, but not  best .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
    <li> this is a hard product to find in the stores in my area-it works just as gd if not better than the expensive stff</li>
    <li> This spray has made my hair so healthy and soft. My hair actually feels thicker. I will stock up on this spray and I have recomended this to my family. My husband loves it also</li>
    <li> I love this spray, I have tried so many things to get my hair to look less frizzy and dry.  this is the ONLY thing that has worked.  I am really NOT crazy about the scent but luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger all day.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly, both with wet hair and dry hair. There was no difference except the terrible smell and it&#x27;s impossible to not get a nasty taste in your mouth from using it.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase and it helps with keeping your ends from drying out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not always inclined to take time to write reviews but this product is great. It&#x27;s of a very thin consistency, much like pump style hairspray. I bought this hoping it would compare to a perfect 10 leave in conditioner spray.its nothing like it and I use the two product together at the ends of my hair. I have VERY fine hair and after using this product my hair feels light and conditioned, slippery yet manageable. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. To me it&#x27;s an airy light clean smell. Would definitely buy product again!</li>
    <li> I read about  this in 2012 and have used it since.  This product is great for someone with some natural curl.  It perks up the curl, while relaxing the frizzies.  Sally Hershberger has a winner with this product!  I&#x27;ve had trouble getting it locally, so of course Amazon fixed me up!  I ordered three bottles so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow! Made my over processed hair extremely soft. Finally a product that performs the way it claims. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Really liked how this hydrated my nieces 3b/3C Curly hair.  It keep it very soft  and moisturized.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, better than most products I have used for my frizzy hair plus it makes it very soft.</li>
    <li> I saw a review of this hydration spray online for heat protection and shine so I bought it since i was in need for heat protection spray. I&#x27;ve enjoyed it! No greasy and smells fresh. They directions suggest you spray when your hair is wet then blow dry and you can also spray your hair when it&#x27;s dry. Make sure to focus on middle to ends of hair when spraying because you don&#x27;t want that on the roots. The spray seems to help but further use will really test the long term effects.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Daughter likes to use flat iron but it was really damaging her hair.  This product smells nice and protects her hair from heat damage.  Noticed the difference almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair. I was very excited to try this spray after reading the reviews. I have used it once after washing my hair. My hair looked awful, like a huge fuzz ball. I may use it as an overnight conditioner only due to the great reviews, but I will not use it in the morning again.</li>
    <li> I have dry, color treated hair and was hoping this would make my hair soft and shiny. I tried it twice but the smell is really not appealing at all! Hard to describe the scent but really off-putting. The product doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to my hair. Maybe makes it a bit less frizzy but I can&#x27;t get past the smell to use it again. If it was a miracle worker, I could tolerate it .... Maybe. But since it doesn&#x27;t really do anything special, it will go in the trash</li>
    <li> Spray it on and your hair is at once moisturized and shiny and manageable like no other products I&#x27;ve used in a long time, and I try a lot of products in a month&#x27;s time.  Try it . . . you&#x27;ll love your hair.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly on my frizzy/coarse/wavy hair. You will see a difference immediately.  It also smells great, and protects your hair from heat damage.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend Sally Hershberger Hyper Hydration hair product to other people.  It helps my hair stay hydrated and looking soft</li>
    <li> I was using this product in combination with the Hyper Hydration shampoo  and conditioner I also just started using the Babyface Pure Protein serum once every two weeks. Let me just say that I have been searching for products like these for YEARS. I don&#x27;t even have words to explain how impressed I am. My hair has always been dried out and poofy and hard to manage but after using these products just ONE TIME I noticed an amazing difference. It&#x27;s like I have someone else&#x27;s hair now. I blow-dried and straightened my hair right after using (which I already never do because the summertime humidity just makes me have an afro anyways) and it gave me the fresh-out-of-the-saloon look. Out of all the products I have been using over the years, I have NEVER gotten these results before. My hair was silky, perfect, soft, sleek and everything I have always wanted. I have gotten tons of compliments already and I&#x27;ve only used it three times now! I would HIGHLY recommend these products - and they&#x27;re so affordable compared to salon brands! What more could you ask for?!!</li>
    <li> My (former) hairdresser OVERPROCESSED one side of my head and it was like straw- dry, crinkly and frizzy. I loathe having short hair but it looked like my only option because the right side of my head from the top down looked and felt like straw while the rest of the hair looked healthy. Like those dumb before and after conditioner commercials, seriously. I tried this on a whim. I immediately got home and sprayed a few pumps on the area on my dry hair and then used my wand hair dryer to do a quick dry and curl. I can&#x27;t believe how SILKY it feels. My husband was amazed. We both thought I would have to cut it off. Yes it is a little heavy if applied to dry hair, I mean it IS a leave in conditioner, but I would rather have silky hair I can run my hands through than hair that feels like it&#x27;s breaking if I even touch it.</li>
    <li> This did wonders for my hair, which is a weird combination of fine and frizzy. It&#x27;s hard to find something that adequately hydrates it, but doesn&#x27;t make it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this on an Allure Best of Beauty list, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic! Now one of my must-haves.</li>
    <li> great stuff! good product -</li>
    <li> Heard it was good and smells good but I didn&#x27;t find either of those with it</li>
    <li> I love this product - it has taken my dry hair and turned it to pure gold! So soft and silky, doesnt leave my hair limp and I have very fine hair. I love the smell of this too! Im sold!</li>
    <li> Adds extra curls to my hair and I just love this product.  Leaves your hair soft and curly.  Shipment was received very quick, sooner then expected.</li>
    <li> I have used many products for my dry, frizzy, middle aged hair.  This one has definitely done the trick.  I just wash, spray, brush and go.  It makes my hair wavy and sooo smooth and healthy looking.  You will not be disappointed. It also doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that wet look thruout the day like some other conditioning products.  I&#x27;m sold on this stuff. And the price is great too!!  Will def. be buying again.</li>
    <li> Just not getting the shine for my highlighted hair I wanted. I cannot see hydration either. Not working for me.</li>
    <li> LOve this product. It is really great, works on my hair every time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This spray is probably the crown jewel of all hair softening products, and it is ridiculously well-priced! My hair is unruly, tough, frizzy, wavy (not in the good way, it waves in all the wrong places, so I find I have to straighten or curl to keep me from looking like I slept wrong) and buying this product \\&quot;just to give it a shot\\&quot; was SUCH a good instinct. I&#x27;ve used similar products that cost me an arm and a leg ($40-$65), but this one ranks right up there for a fraction of the cost. A FRACTION. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to everyone and their mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does what it says. Only used it a few times, already saw the difference in my hair. Will definitely try out other SH products.</li>
    <li> I expected more of this product then it provided.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again or recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> A fantastic product!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great product &amp; highly recommended. I love Sally Hershberger hair products. I watched her on Nate Berkus show &amp; that&#x27;s where I found out about her products.</li>
    <li> Miracle worker! Great spray. .makes my curly hair soft.</li>
    <li> I was looking a for a keratin spray and came across this one. I have always believed you get what you pay for.  I was spectacle because of the price and the brand.  I decided to try it any way because of the reviews, which were all good by the way.  I bought it yesterday and used it this morning. I love it and noticed difference right away when I was done styling my hair.  I am sold.  One word of caution when you spray it on your hair if it gets on your bathroom floor our floor will be very slippery.  You will need to clean your floor or lay a towel down before you spray your hair to avoid a dangerous situation in your bathroom. I almost slipped in my socks. LOL, tomorrow I will be standing on a towel so I will not have to clean the floor every morning.  The reviews on Amazon are correct. It is a great product and I wanted to make sure I added my review. You will love it and I am very picky with my hair products. I am a product junky!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Makes my hair smooth and easy to brush after washing it. I loved to use it after the beach as well.</li>
    <li> You know when your hair looks just okay after all the work of the right shampoo and conditioner but it still looks dry and stiff and frizzy...well just mist a little bit of this on it after you have styled it.  Lightly work it in and you won&#x27;t believe it.  I can&#x27;t believe how I accidently found this product.  Amazing.  My hair is very curly, thin, fine and dry and pretty much never looked decent anymore (I am 63).  This stuff is a life saver as I feel like I have my old hair back.</li>
    <li> this makes my hair feel very soft...love it...will def order again in the future. would recommend this product for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I love how this product makes my hair feel.  I have wavy hair, and when wet, it is very curly.  I spray this on it, and my curls stay defined without my hair looking wet and greasy, or hard and stiff with other products.  I will never go back to anything else!</li>
    <li> Helps to add that shine!  I&#x27;m not sure if it actually protected my hair from flatironning, but it didn&#x27;t make it seem to fry or sizzle like other &amp;#34;thermal protectors.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every time I wash my hair for the past four months or so. After a month of use I really noticed a difference.  My wavy hair is much softer than it ever has been and is much easier to flat iron.  My hair also seems shinier and healthier.</li>
    <li> A fine spray that softens hair but does not leave it limp.  A fine mist so you can control the amount by the scalp and put more on the ends where heat damage can occur. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help my hair much. I have used products similar to this that work WAY better. This stuff mostly makes my bathroom floor super slippery. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair softer and my hair has not felt healthier, so I will probably switch back to the product I was using before.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel very soft! It smells pretty good too! Still not sure if I want to purchase another after this. Trying to find the best spray for my hair.</li>
    <li> After washing my hair I spray this on and wow it makes my hair sooo soft and manageable after it dries. If i  wash my hair at night it&#x27;s a guarantee that I won&#x27;t wakeup looking like a wild woman!! I am really enjoying this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope my review helps others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this from CVS instead of waiting a whole 24 hours to receive it from Amazon.  That said, I will definitely be making this a staple around here.  Just last week my hair was frizzy, dry, brittle and breaking off like crazy.  Now, after all of 5 days of use, it&#x27;s silky, shiny and looks so much healthier.  I colored my hair 2 days ago and there&#x27;s nothing dry or processed about it.  It just slides through my fingers.  For someone middle age with very long damaged hair, that&#x27;s incredible.  I actually have a gift card for a professional keratin treatment that I&#x27;ll be passing on to someone else...this product is THAT good.</li>
    <li> great product. good for hair and styling</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I love this product! I have curly hair and it can get well very large and frizzy. This stuff tames my hair and makes it look amazing! I use it almost daily</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product from Sally; leaves my hair soft and workable.  Will buy again and again and again.</li>
    <li> I dont know why, but I think I was expecting too much out of this product. First, I thought the bottle was bigger... But that&#x27;s my fault because I should have read the details more carefully. I read a lot of reviews saying how this was so awesome that you could wash your hair at night, apply it and in the morning there would be zero frizz and you&#x27;d get perfectly under control hair. Well, it&#x27;s not that it doesnt do that at all. It&#x27;s that it doesnt do it at 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, I like the smell and it&#x27;s very hydrating. I think I wouldnt repurchase it but Im fine using it until is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My hair is very wavy in the back. And its in between of being thin or thick. And I usually get a lot of frizz and bumps if I dont use some product after I shower.</li>
    <li> This product adds so much shine with no build up. It is not greasy, and works well for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Really kept my hair hydrated when used.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> havent had as much split ends, its OK as far as products go, ive used better keratin sprays at the price point</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, love it.</li>
    <li> My hair has been all over bleached for a few months now.  It is fine, naturally curly, and thick, in a graduated chin length bob.  It was very dry and frayed at the ends.  My stylist recommended keratin and I purchased this after researching several brands.  I won&#x27;t lie, the thing that attracted me most was the price.  This product is unbelievable.  I would give it ten stars if I could.  Only after a week of almost-daily use, my hair looks fantastic and feels soft.  The spray isn&#x27;t one bit greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  I spray extra on my ends and in my part where all those baby hair are broken off from flat ironing.  Truly remarkable results.  What&#x27;s even crazier is that I have been able to shower at night and go to bed with wet hair, something I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to do without looking like a total disaster morning.  This spray makes the waves look beautiful and put together, not wild and out of control.  I used to spend 30 minutes on my hair every morning after showering.  Blow drying, straightening, etc.  Now I shower before bed, spray this all over, comb it, and wake up looking great.  Really awesome product.  (I also use it on my son who shares my wacky hair gene.  His style looks so much thicker and nicer.)</li>
    <li> I have thick curly ethnic hair and I use this when I flat iron. Somehow this spray seals and smooths my ends and my hair gets silky straight while still maintaining body. This spray is also a great heat protector. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t deep condition as much and can go longer between trims. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this spray. It does exactly what the bottle says.</li>
