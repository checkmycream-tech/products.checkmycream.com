      <li>Love this brush, very well made.</li>
      <li>This is very well made and the favorite style for my husband&#x27;s birthday gift.</li>
      <li>It is well made and should last for many many years.</li>
      <li>Now, 56 years later, here is virtually the same brush - I&#x27;m happy!  </li>
      <li>This is a very handsome brush for someone who cares about their personal appearance.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>The cob is beautifully finished, clearly made for a long life.</li>
      <li>Pricey,but,well worth every Penney.</li>
      <li>It may seem pricey for a brush, but it is definitely worth every cent.</li>
      <li>This was a replacement brush for my 65 yo husband who lost his favorite hairbrush he had since he was a young boy.  </li>
      <li>I understand there are plenty more much more expensive brushes made by this company, but the wood is nice, fits in my hand nicely, but it&#x27;s compact enough to through in my bag for the gym or whatever.</li>
      <li>It even did a tour in combat with the US Marines in Vietnam; apparently fared better than my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush met all of my expectations; it&#x27;s attractive, light weight, and works well on my hair without irritating my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I can see how this wouldn&#x27;t work too well for anyone with long and thick hair but for my fine shoulder length hair it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>and I can get anything from a flat top to a lay-down with this pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It is very high quality and has very soft bristles to be easy on you scalp.</li>
      <li>I expect it to last many years.</li>
      <li>A bit less hair now than then, but the new brush works just fine, very comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I ordered this brush because I wanted to give my husband something meaningful, yet practical, in the hospital after the birth of our daughter (not just another &amp;#34;DAD&amp;#34; coffee mug or t-shirt) that he could use everyday and think of that special time.</li>
      <li>grooming much better than just a comb, or a single hand brush</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This wood is so light, it appears to be the same color as the bristles.</li>
      <li>Very well made but stiffer bristles than if was expecting.</li>
      <li>Seems very well made, just like all Kent brushes.</li>
      <li>The Kent MC4 is smaller and the box is labeled &amp;#34;Boy&#x27;s brush&amp;#34;, most likely die to the size.  </li>
      <li>Very durable and the bristles are soft.</li>
      <li>Half the reason I picked this particular model is the striking color of the cherry wood with white bristles.  </li>
      <li>This brush was too stiff for fine hair</li>
      <li>So far no bristles have come out or bent out of shape.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well made and the bristles are natural , not synthetic materials.  </li>
      <li>After only 40 years my old military brush set finally lost more hair (bristles) than I have.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a softer brush, and the description said it was soft.</li>
      <li>However, my husband is pleased with the brush both in quality and the softer bristles now that his hair is not has thick as it used to be.  </li>
      <li>Nice quality but the size was smaller than any other military style brushes I have ordered for my husband.</li>
      <li>I have tried others, but It&#x27;s the best, and less expensive per year!</li>
      <li>I ordered on of there other models to begin with but returned it because the bristles were much stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;After an email to Kent</li>
      <li>Stiff, so go easy if your scalp is sensitive, but if not you can brush hard and bully your hair into doing what you want.</li>

<li> This brush is high quality but the bristles are too stiff.</li>
<li> /&gt;Bristles are stiff and feel nice; a little bit softer than the black bristles, but still quite stiff.</li>
<li> This is a high quality brush, but i don&#x27;t like it because the bristles are very stiff.</li>
<li> It is a little smaller than a regular palm brush</li>
<li> Too small for an adult.</li>
<li> The bristles are tough enough to lay down my hair but soft enough not to hurt my scalp.  </li>
<li> You will instantly tell the difference between this and a little $5-10 dollar brush.&lt;br</li>
<li> I got my Kent military brush when I was 13.</li>

<li> In about another year I guess I&#x27;ll buy another military model.</li>
<li> the bristles were not soft, as advertised, but stiff.</li>
<li> I ordered both this and the full-size MG2 brush with black bristles because I was worried the MC4 would be too small (based on the description that states it&#x27;s 1/3 the size of the larger hand</li>
<li> But alas, the bristles in the outer edges are down to less than 1/2 and the middle area ones are just short nubs.</li>
<li> Well-made brush, with bristles stiff enough to manage thick, wet hair.  </li>
<li> This brush surpasses the other in how well it works on his hair!  </li>
<li> The challenge was that the brush he lost was shaped like a half a football.  </li>
<li> you can see from the picture below, that description is not entirely accurate -</li>
<li> the bristles are a little stiff, but</li>
<li> Since I have small hands</li>
<li> Although a little pricey if you can find it under $30 you will not be sad.</li>
<li> I bought this to replace a lost (sadly) Kent Brush that I had had since 1958.</li>

    <li> Love this brush, very well made. I ordered both this and the full-size MG2 brush with black bristles because I was worried the MC4 would be too small (based on the description that states it&#x27;s 1/3 the size of the larger hand brushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the picture below, that description is not entirely accurate - it&#x27;s about 1/3 smaller, but not 1/3 the size. Turns out, it&#x27;s the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are stiff and feel nice; a little bit softer than the black bristles, but still quite stiff. Seems very well made, just like all Kent brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush met all of my expectations; it&#x27;s attractive, light weight, and works well on my hair without irritating my scalp.  Since I have small hands the boys brush works well for me, and without a handle it&#x27;s easier to travel with.  I can see how this wouldn&#x27;t work too well for anyone with long and thick hair but for my fine shoulder length hair it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality brush, but i don&#x27;t like it because the bristles are very stiff. I was looking for a softer brush, and the description said it was soft.</li>
    <li> good value: got the brushes on sale,&lt;br /&gt;nice quality packaging if you are planning on giving the brushes as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;makes grooming much better than just a comb, or a single hand brush</li>
    <li> My husband had one of these that he had for 30 years and needed to replace it. We founded on Amazon and we were amazed that it was the same product.  As you can see it is durable and does the job it is supposed to do. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Lets&#x27; see. I&#x27;m 68 y/o now. I got my Kent military brush when I was 13. That would be 55 years brushing my still healthy head of hair!! But alas, the bristles in the outer edges are down to less than 1/2 and the middle area ones are just short nubs. But I can still get a good brush with it, but I think I&#x27;ll need a new one soon. The wooden handle has a few scratches in it, but the finish can still be found on it; here and there. The brush has been my constant companion literally around the world. It even did a tour in combat with the US Marines in Vietnam; apparently fared better than my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was surfing the net, I thought I&#x27;d google &amp;#34;Kent Brushes&amp;#34; and see if they were still being made. Needless to say I ended up here on Amazon. It&#x27;s nice to see the company is still in full swing and my model still available. In about another year I guess I&#x27;ll buy another military model. You know, for the next 55 years..!</li>
    <li> Nice quality but the size was smaller than any other military style brushes I have ordered for my husband. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  Nice feel, sturdy yet light in the hand.  My only reason for this initial post being a 4 instead of a 5 is that I refuse to believe the brush I received (stamped MC4) is cherry wood instead of beech wood.  Half the reason I picked this particular model is the striking color of the cherry wood with white bristles.  This wood is so light, it appears to be the same color as the bristles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an expensive hairbrush, (considering it&#x27;s a brush) I understand there are plenty more much more expensive brushes made by this company, but the wood is nice, fits in my hand nicely, but it&#x27;s compact enough to through in my bag for the gym or whatever.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.... a very good hairbrush. Need 11 more words.. it is a very, very good hairbrush!</li>
    <li> The brush has preform as advertised. Although a little pricey if you can find it under $30 you will not be sad.</li>
    <li> This is very well made and the favorite style for my husband&#x27;s birthday gift. This one pleased him very much.</li>
    <li> Well-made brush, with bristles stiff enough to manage thick, wet hair.  I expect it to last many years.</li>
    <li> Too small for an adult.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Reassuring to know that quality like this is still around!  I bought this to replace a lost (sadly) Kent Brush that I had had since 1958. (that brush was still in excellent shape). Now, 56 years later, here is virtually the same brush - I&#x27;m happy!  A bit less hair now than then, but the new brush works just fine, very comfortable to use. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband likes the brush.  It is well made and should last for many many years. You won&#x27;t go wrong to order this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Joan</li>
    <li> Very well made but stiffer bristles than if was expecting. Exfoliation to the max.</li>
    <li> Stiff, so go easy if your scalp is sensitive, but if not you can brush hard and bully your hair into doing what you want. It&#x27;s not prickly though and it feels great. Seems very high quality and does a great job. I&#x27;m a man with short hair and I can get anything from a flat top to a lay-down with this pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This brush is high quality but the bristles are too stiff.</li>
    <li> Great brush, has held up well so far</li>
    <li> the bristles were not soft, as advertised, but stiff.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement brush for my 65 yo husband who lost his favorite hairbrush he had since he was a young boy.  He was heartbroken losing it and was sure that there was no way to replace.  The challenge was that the brush he lost was shaped like a half a football.  So I was looking for size, hoping that the brush would function well too.  This brush surpasses the other in how well it works on his hair!  thank you!</li>
    <li> Great quality brush I use for my beard. Does a great job and should last for many years!</li>
    <li> Pricey,but,well worth every Penney.</li>
    <li> Bought for my father in law to replace a worn out brush.  He absolutely loves it.  Very durable and the bristles are soft.</li>
    <li> This is a very handsome brush for someone who cares about their personal appearance.  It&#x27;s well made and the bristles are natural , not synthetic materials.  The cob is beautifully finished, clearly made for a long life.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Excellent craftmanship.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush...my brother-in-law loved it!</li>
    <li> Best brush in history!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband to replace a similar brush he has had for almost 20 years!  The Kent MC4 is smaller and the box is labeled &amp;#34;Boy&#x27;s brush&amp;#34;, most likely die to the size.  However, my husband is pleased with the brush both in quality and the softer bristles now that his hair is not has thick as it used to be.  Overall, he would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The bristles are tough enough to lay down my hair but soft enough not to hurt my scalp.  Easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because I wanted to give my husband something meaningful, yet practical, in the hospital after the birth of our daughter (not just another &amp;#34;DAD&amp;#34; coffee mug or t-shirt) that he could use everyday and think of that special time. This was perfect! Kent is such a wonderfully traditional, long-standing company and it truly shows in their product. The wood is beautiful! It may seem pricey for a brush, but it is definitely worth every cent. Buy it for any special guy in your life!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift to hubby, he digs it, handmade! He feels like royalty whenever he uses it. Great buy, perfect gift.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It is very high quality and has very soft bristles to be easy on you scalp. I ordered on of there other models to begin with but returned it because the bristles were much stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;After an email to Kent they recommended this model because of the softer bristles.</li>
    <li> It is smaller and lighter then the old military brush(Kent) it is replacing.</li>
    <li> Trust me the best brush you can buy for any amount of money. Do some research. I bought two, one for me and one for dad. Dad bought some for all his friends.</li>
    <li> This is my third Kent in 30 years. I have tried others, but It&#x27;s the best, and less expensive per year!</li>
    <li> This brush was too stiff for fine hair and I returned it. However the quality of this brush looks excellent!</li>
    <li> You brush a good mane, booooooyyyyyy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic fit in the palm of your hand brush. Mind you the bristles are a little stiff, but as with all boar bristle brushes the do break in with time. I ordered a Kent comb along with these, loved that as well.</li>
    <li> Great craftsmanship, elegant design. Didn&#x27;t come with the lifetime warranty in the box and that&#x27;s about my only qualm with it.</li>
    <li> Received it in 2 days! Couldnt wait to get my hands on it. It has officially invaded the 360 waves lifestyle and it is a grand brush to have in your arsenal. It looks and feels like royalty. You will instantly tell the difference between this and a little $5-10 dollar brush.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a soft/medium. It is a little smaller than a regular palm brush but my hands are small so its like the perfect fit to me. So far no bristles have come out or bent out of shape. it looks and feels like it will LAST! and if it dosent no worries it comes with a guarantee ensuring Kent will replace your brush free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;I expect good things from this brush and dont regret spendin not one dollar that was dropped for it.</li>
    <li> After only 40 years my old military brush set finally lost more hair (bristles) than I have.  Ordered the Kent MC4 Cherrywood Military Brush and I am impressed; maybe I&#x27;ll get 40 years service out of this.  Strongly recommend.</li>
