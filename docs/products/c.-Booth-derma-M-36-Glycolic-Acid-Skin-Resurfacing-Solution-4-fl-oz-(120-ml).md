      <li>Best product ever for my skin!</li>
      <li>Excellent product that I cannot locate anywhere.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>I am some what fair skin</li>
      <li>I found it good to put on at bedtime .</li>
      <li>love this product!</li>
      <li>This toner is simply amazing.</li>
      <li>A great way to renew your skin with just a light once over every night.  </li>
      <li>The price was fair and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>I liked this product .</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This time the solution is more like an astringent.  </li>
      <li>After two or three applications my combination skin is more balanced, the texture more refined, and after a week</li>
      <li>I was at lunch with my daughter when she pointed out my top lip looked like a mustache</li>
      <li>Recently I have added  BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum For Face.</li>
      <li>The seller was top-notch -- the solution works fine, but I may need to opt for a more-concentrated glycolic acid solution next time.</li>
      <li>but it was very mild.</li>
      <li>Now I am just using it on my problem areas and fine</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin smooth &amp; free of flaking skin.  </li>
      <li>or so it becomes really soft and bright.</li>
      <li>I think it is a good addition to daily skincare regime, keeps skin smooth and removes flakiness.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely scent free!</li>
      <li>Drys quickly</li>
      <li>but nothing has given me the results  like this as quickly within  2 weeks  </li>
      <li>No smell at all, pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Worth price to me</li>
      <li>so you can put moisturizer on right after it.  </li>
      <li>and I can confidently say it is the only toner that works exactly as promises without overdrying or peeling.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will definitely be ordering it again.  </li>
      <li>Why would they ever DC such a fantastic product after addicting us to it!</li>
      <li>My skin is much smoother after just a few applications and I received it very quickly!!</li>
      <li>The first bottle of this was much thicker.  </li>
      <li>Seems less effective</li>
      <li>I have tried the Witch Hazel toner from the same company and I remember it helping to keep my mild acne under control.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend both products</li>
      <li>I also  highly recommend the microdermabrasion scrub.</li>
      <li>It really helps to keep fine lines smoothed down.</li>
      <li>and my skin is nearly perfectly clear.</li>
      <li>The only toner that comes close to this one is the Proactiv Revitalizing Toner, but it has a much weaker concentration of glycolic acid.</li>
      <li>I have been told by others I look like i&#x27;m in my mid thirties when I am really 49</li>
      <li>You feel a slight tingling sensation when you apply it but as long as you don&#x27;t apply it on any sensitive areas, you will be fine.</li>
      <li>It really reduces acne breakouts and helps fade dark spots.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the product that long, but so far I do like it.</li>
      <li>However, I initially used it on my entire face instead of just my dark areas first.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t buy unless you want to be disappointed trying to find anything even close...</li>
<li> I am 42 and had two \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; on my forehead from all of those California summers :(</li>

    <li> THis toner has glycolic acid in it, it refreshes it, also contains cucumber extracts along with aloe vera to soothe the skin. Im 15 with acne this has cleared my skin, and smoothed out the rough texture from the acne. Also it does wonders to hyperpigmentation spots.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for my skin! Wish it sold in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Why would they ever DC such a fantastic product after addicting us to it! Don&#x27;t buy unless you want to be disappointed trying to find anything even close...C. Booth, bring back this line!</li>
    <li> Rite aide used to carry it.  Now I have to but it online. It has 10% glycolic acid and helps keep my acne away. It is a PH balanced toner.</li>
    <li> I have  suffered from dark acne scars for years now and  have tried numerous products but nothing has given me the results  like this as quickly within  2 weeks  they were significatly lighter i&#x27;ve been usuing for almost a month now and my skin is nearly perfectly clear. I also  highly recommend the microdermabrasion scrub. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I use this daily in between my Skin Obsession 20% glycolic peel.  It really helps to keep fine lines smoothed down.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff but I got it at RiteAid for $14.99! Works well to exfoliate my facial skin . I love it.</li>
    <li> I liked this product . I found it good to put on at bedtime . Not good to wear when going outside in sun . It discolors the skins .  Overall I&amp;#34;d buy this product over and over again . It makes my skin feal rejuvinated .</li>
    <li> The first bottle of this was much thicker.  This time the solution is more like an astringent.  Seems less effective</li>
    <li> Need something even stronger, but got results.</li>
    <li> I found this at a local store. I have tried the Witch Hazel toner from the same company and I remember it helping to keep my mild acne under control. I couldn&#x27;t find the same product so I thought I&#x27;d try this to help fade some pimple scars, we&#x27;ll see.  I have only used it once so far, burned a little after i used it but it was very mild. This product is absolutely scent free! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. No smell at all, pretty cool.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year now and have noticed a big difference in my face. I have been told by others I look like i&#x27;m in my mid thirties when I am really 49 and no one believes me. Recently I have added  BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum For Face. Botanical 20% Vitamin C + E +... and wow it has put that little extra . I would highly recommend both products</li>
    <li> I love this product and will definitely be ordering it again.  My skin is much smoother after just a few applications and I received it very quickly!!</li>
    <li> this product is about 14$ at rite aide without a coupon. I think it is a good addition to daily skincare regime, keeps skin smooth and removes flakiness.</li>
    <li> Always get compliments on my skin since using this.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I am 42 and had two \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; on my forehead from all of those California summers :( I have been using this for 4 weeks 2x per day and they have thinned and lightened by 70 percent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that I cannot locate anywhere. Price is almost twice what I had paid in past. Takes off outer layer dead skin cells . Worth price to me</li>
    <li> The seller was top-notch -- the solution works fine, but I may need to opt for a more-concentrated glycolic acid solution next time. The price was fair and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> A great way to renew your skin with just a light once over every night.  Drys quickly so you can put moisturizer on right after it.  Keeps my skin smooth &amp; free of flaking skin.  Use it on face, arms, hands &amp; legs</li>
    <li> This toner is simply amazing. I have been using it for years and I can confidently say it is the only toner that works exactly as promises without overdrying or peeling. You feel a slight tingling sensation when you apply it but as long as you don&#x27;t apply it on any sensitive areas, you will be fine. After two or three applications my combination skin is more balanced, the texture more refined, and after a week or so it becomes really soft and bright. It really reduces acne breakouts and helps fade dark spots. The only toner that comes close to this one is the Proactiv Revitalizing Toner, but it has a much weaker concentration of glycolic acid. If you are over 30 or if you have acne, you have to try it. However, I would not buy c. Booth Derma 36 Glycolic Acid Skin Resurfacing Toner here because it is ridiculously overpriced. You can get it for about 20 bucks at any pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product that long, but so far I do like it. It does not irritate my skin and I do think my skin looks fresher after using. I&#x27;m curious to see what long-term use will do for my skin.</li>
    <li> I was at lunch with my daughter when she pointed out my top lip looked like a mustache and No it&#x27;s not hair. I was horrified to notice the skin above my lip and and a patch below was darker. I am some what fair skin so it is noticeable. I tried the home remedies, lemon juice, baking powder, luminators...they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon this at rite aid, I ve been using it for 2 weeks and noticed a difference in my fines lines and YES, my 5o&#x27;clock shadow.  However, I initially used it on my entire face instead of just my dark areas first. So, as my skin began to lighten the dark spot was still noticeable. Now I am just using it on my problem areas and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! It has been such a relief to finally find something that works!!! Thank you Booth!!!</li>
