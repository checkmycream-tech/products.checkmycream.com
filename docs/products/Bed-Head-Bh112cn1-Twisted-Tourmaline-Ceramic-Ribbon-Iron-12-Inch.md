      <li>Great shipping.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>but this was is perfect and so easy!</li>
      <li>Love this iron, brilliant idea!!</li>
      <li>Fine for someone who&#x27;s entering the Shirley Temple Lookalike Contest, but if you&#x27;re over 40, chances are it won&#x27;t give you the best look.  </li>
      <li>Try a good trusted brand like Remington....</li>
      <li>Nice ribbon curls, bright color.</li>
      <li>I love this iron!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>it kind of curled it.</li>
      <li>The waves this gives are pretty, and maybe it&#x27;s just that I need more practice, but I have great difficulty making my hair look good with it.  </li>
      <li>If you know how to use this sort of curlers then I think it would be a good one to get, but I just can&#x27;t give a full review because I couldn&#x27;t use it well.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair also and it gives me more fullness.</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the directions before starting so you can get the best out of the product.</li>
      <li>I would probably give this more stars if I weren&#x27;t a doofus when it comes to my hair and using hair tools.</li>
      <li>Favorite iron ever boughten.</li>
      <li>the curls are really cute but would be better when I have longer hair.</li>
      <li>I had so many questions and compliments about how i got that type of wave in my hair.</li>
      <li>This iron heats up fast and the curls it produces are great.  </li>
      <li>and I love Bead Head styling irons.  </li>
      <li>My problem was that the heat setting button slides too easily.</li>
      <li>While it does curl my hair, the top part doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
      <li>If I could trade it in for free for a new one I would... kind of dissapointing.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I got this because the barrel is oval shaped, but when I used it, it gave me beautiful round looking curls!</li>
      <li>This is the best iron I have ever had for nice tight curls, however I had only used it about 5 times and the screw that holds the spring in broke....</li>
      <li>It heated up quickly and from what I could manage to do with my fumble fingers</li>
      <li>I do highly recommend this!!!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
      <li>Unlike other Bedhead products that I bought in 2007(and still work), this curling iron does not heat up quickly nor was it able to fix the top layer of my curly hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth what I paid for it.</li>
      <li>I have that kind of hair that you put curls in and watch them fall out minutes later.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t warm up enough.</li>
      <li>but I can touch the top of the wand with a bare hand.</li>
      <li>It gives the kind of curls you get with a straightening iron only MUCH easier.</li>
      <li>While it isn&#x27;t exactly the same, I figured it would work out fine.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have with this product is the buttons are too easy to turn off while using it.</li>
      <li>It heats up really fast</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
      <li>do really like the curl it gives my hair, though.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t say when it is ready for use.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend more on a more expensive ribbon curler.</li>
      <li>The clamp is nowhere near long enough to help secure the hair sections around the barrel -- unless you start winding at the very bottom of the barrel, and then go up along the iron.  </li>
      <li>If you use hair extensions, it will curl them faster than your natural hair</li>
      <li>However, you&#x27;ll still have that tiny section at the very ends of your locks that will come out looking</li>
      <li>They last a very long time and quick heat.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I just need to practice with it more, but the oblong barrel is certainly different from the regular round one!</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the center part where you control the temp is easily moved and often to a higher temp.  </li>
      <li>Also, the boxy shape of the curls does not permit you to shake out the curls and make your waves look a little more natural and &amp;#34;less done,&amp;#34; as a round iron does.</li>
      <li>, I can even hold it with bare hands without burning myself.</li>
      <li>I also like that the barrel is quite a bit longer than a normal iron, so works well for long hair!</li>
      <li>I know that the small clamp is supposed to be better for your hair and to minimize the risk of a clamp marks in your hair, but I just had too much trouble getting my hair into it and wrapping my hair around the barrel.</li>

    <li> Unlike other Bedhead products that I bought in 2007(and still work), this curling iron does not heat up quickly nor was it able to fix the top layer of my curly hair. The heat didn&#x27;t seem to reach the tip of the curler. I have loose baloney curls and usually need to fix a layer. This curling iron did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the center part where you control the temp is easily moved and often to a higher temp.  Outside of that the curls are really cute but would be better when I have longer hair. You can get 3 different looks. One you use the clamp and the other two you don&#x27;t use the clamp.</li>
    <li> The waves this gives are pretty, and maybe it&#x27;s just that I need more practice, but I have great difficulty making my hair look good with it.  Perhaps I just need to practice with it more, but the oblong barrel is certainly different from the regular round one!</li>
    <li> I received my order in a timely manner, but the product itself is worhtless!! It leaves big creases in your hair. I would not recommend this product for others to buy and would return it if possible.</li>
    <li> Great product and so easy to use!!! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! It gives the kind of curls you get with a straightening iron only MUCH easier. I wouldn&#x27;t spend more on a more expensive ribbon curler. This one works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am so happy. I always wondered how they get those spiral like curls. Make sure you read the directions before starting so you can get the best out of the product. If you use hair extensions, it will curl them faster than your natural hair so dont burn them! &#x27;</li>
    <li> Love it! Must get! I do highly recommend this!!! Favorite iron ever boughten. Great shipping. its just perfection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must get!</li>
    <li> this item broke after three times after use . It wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. Garbage. I wish there was a zero star option</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this product is the buttons are too easy to turn off while using it. I keep accidentally turning it off.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I have another problem with it. It doesn&#x27;t say when it is ready for use. The lights keep flashing. Other than that I like the curling iron.</li>
    <li> I would probably give this more stars if I weren&#x27;t a doofus when it comes to my hair and using hair tools. I know that the small clamp is supposed to be better for your hair and to minimize the risk of a clamp marks in your hair, but I just had too much trouble getting my hair into it and wrapping my hair around the barrel. It heated up quickly and from what I could manage to do with my fumble fingers it kind of curled it. If you know how to use this sort of curlers then I think it would be a good one to get, but I just can&#x27;t give a full review because I couldn&#x27;t use it well.</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast and I don&#x27;t have to hold my hair in it long for it to work. I have long hair and it made curling faster and easier. My problem was that the heat setting button slides too easily. I have mine taped in place.</li>
    <li> I do lots of updo&#x27;s and I love Bead Head styling irons.  They last a very long time and quick heat.</li>
    <li> I saw a video online using a tool similar to this one. While it isn&#x27;t exactly the same, I figured it would work out fine. While it does curl my hair, the top part doesn&#x27;t get very hot. When I have it on high, the base of the ceramic tool is so hot it burns me but I can touch the top of the wand with a bare hand. I think I&#x27;ll try this product again for a few times and then I may return it. I don&#x27;t think it was worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I have ever had for nice tight curls, however I had only used it about 5 times and the screw that holds the spring in broke....If I could trade it in for free for a new one I would... kind of dissapointing.</li>
    <li> The clamp is nowhere near long enough to help secure the hair sections around the barrel -- unless you start winding at the very bottom of the barrel, and then go up along the iron.  However, you&#x27;ll still have that tiny section at the very ends of your locks that will come out looking bent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if you want to try this without a heat-protective glove, you&#x27;ll burn your fingers.  I use a glove (it came with a Conair curling iron I bought 2 years ago), and couldn&#x27;t use this iron without it.  The curls themselves come out a little boxy.  Fine for someone who&#x27;s entering the Shirley Temple Lookalike Contest, but if you&#x27;re over 40, chances are it won&#x27;t give you the best look.  Also, the boxy shape of the curls does not permit you to shake out the curls and make your waves look a little more natural and &amp;#34;less done,&amp;#34; as a round iron does.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a higher rating except that my thumb keeps turning it off - terrible design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like the curl it gives my hair, though.</li>
    <li> Nice ribbon curls, bright color.</li>
    <li> Love this iron, brilliant idea!! I have tried to achieve this type of wave using so may different irons but this was is perfect and so easy! I had so many questions and compliments about how i got that type of wave in my hair. I have very fine hair also and it gives me more fullness. beautiful relaxed beach waves. GREAT product! HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t warm up enough. Also it seems like the product warms more close to the clamp and at the lowest heat setting the point of the curl iron is cold, I can even hold it with bare hands without burning myself. Even at the highest temperature the hair is not curled. Also the mini clamp is pretty bad, does not hold the hair, and if you try to curl without using the clamp, just wrapping the hair around it, it doesn&#x27;t work, again because of the low heat.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!!!</li>
    <li> I have that kind of hair that you put curls in and watch them fall out minutes later. This actually curls my hair so it stays!! I love it!</li>
    <li> If you have fragile hair....please dont buy this product. I literally burned off to portions of my hair to a blackened charcoal mess. I had to grate the burt hair off of the iron. ....And that was on the lowest setting.... I would mot recommend this product to ANYONE! Try a good trusted brand like Remington....Happy shopping to all!</li>
    <li> I love this iron! I wasn&#x27;t sure when I got this because the barrel is oval shaped, but when I used it, it gave me beautiful round looking curls! I also like that the barrel is quite a bit longer than a normal iron, so works well for long hair!</li>
    <li> This iron heats up fast and the curls it produces are great.  It works well on stubborn hair that doesn&#x27;t like to curl.</li>
