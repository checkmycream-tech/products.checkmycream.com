      <li>Best one ive ever bought</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Stays on perfectly until you wash it off.</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara and at a great price.  </li>
      <li>Lovely mascara that provides great coverage but requires 3 coats for nice impact.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I really liked the L&#x27;Oreal mascara that comes in a gold tube, that Gwen Stefani was marketing (I can&#x27;t remember the name).  </li>
      <li>by far this is the best even than the one with fiber in it.</li>
      <li>thats just fine because I have Loreals&#x27;s Power Volume Collagen!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really really huge!</li>
      <li>Plumps, lengthens, and makes the most of every lash.</li>
      <li>I love the volume and length i get with this mascara.</li>
      <li>it is my favorite mascara from l&#x27;oreal.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara</li>
      <li>I had to rinse the wand to be able to see the bristles again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I usually love loreal mascara.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I spend more time trying just to APPLY the mascara</li>
      <li>Easy to layer.</li>
      <li>Hands down, best mascara out there under $30.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s significantly cheaper to purchase through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save.</li>
      <li>eyelashes looked neither voluminous, nor full and luscious.  </li>
      <li>I think the brush might be too full to allow the lashes to get into the core of the brush where the mascara is.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much for that!</li>
      <li>This is a great mascara for anyone who has trouble with Mascara smudging under your eyes.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Makes my eyelashes look nice and long.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others but always come back to this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thinner formula, but with those 2 or 3 coats, this lengthens nicely, and volumizes a little, with no clumping that I could detect.</li>
      <li>This one will do well as any as a replacement for Clinique&#x27;s High Impact or Lancome&#x27;s Definicils (non-waterproof) provided you&#x27;re willing to apply 2 or 3 coats.</li>
      <li>many times, and was always highly satisfied with the results, but this mascara was a huge disappointment for me.  </li>
      <li>It really does what it says it&#x27;s going to.</li>
      <li>That mascara wore really well.</li>
      <li>Use it as a 2nd layer after a lengthening mascara to add significant volume.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake, is easy to wash off, but is not nearly as irritating to the eyes as similar formulas are (Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; for example - I&#x27;m completely allergic to it).</li>
      <li>The actual mascara isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
      <li>It takes some patience and careful strokes to apply coats to avoid scratching my lids, but the semi-wet formula applies fairly easily and does not clump.</li>
      <li>Nothing about it is decent or recommendable.</li>
      <li>it last long and does not have to be applied many times a day.i tried every mascara from l&#x27;oreal.</li>
      <li>I get really clean, dark lashes</li>
      <li>but I love how dark the black is</li>
      <li>Actually, the more I think about this mascara the more I hate it.</li>
      <li>After two uses that involved a lot of scraping around just to get mascara ON the wand, the next 2 uses were fraught with so much mascara stuck to the wand that it looked like a black q-tip.  </li>

<li> Messy and flaky.</li>

<li> If it would flake less it would get 5 stars for the way it makes my eye lashes look!</li>
<li> but the formula is not easy to apply.</li>
<li> I usually add another coat around lunchtime to freshen my look.</li>
<li> This one isn&#x27;t waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to run all over the place at the least hint of moisture.</li>
<li> the brush is thick and it spreads the cream uniformly.</li>
<li> Makes thin lashes thick &amp; fuller.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to find a drugstore mascara to replace the Lancome and Dior mascaras that are now so ridiculously over-priced I can no longer justify the expense.</li>
<li> I hate the gigantic brush on this mascara...</li>
<li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> But this is just awful.</li>
<li> The brush is the worst brush I have ever seen.</li>
<li> Terrible made my eyelashes look clumpy</li>

It doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake, is easy to wash off, but is not nearly as irritating to the eyes as similar formulas are (Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; for example - I&#x27;m completely allergic to it).</li>
    <li> My girlfriend adore it! Thank you very much for that!</li>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes look nice and long. I love it!</li>
    <li> Terrible made my eyelashes look clumpy</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and at a great price.  It creates thick and long and very dark lashes.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> If it would flake less it would get 5 stars for the way it makes my eye lashes look!</li>
    <li> I like the wand but the formula is not easy to apply. It made my lashes clumpy.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It really does what it says it&#x27;s going to.</li>
    <li> Makes thin lashes thick &amp; fuller. Let dry between coats !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 8 years and will never switch! I&#x27;ve tried many others but always come back to this. I quit wasting my money on other mascara and just buy this one! Any from their Voluminous collection are great!</li>
    <li> I love the volume and length i get with this mascara.</li>
    <li> it is my favorite mascara from l&#x27;oreal. it last long and does not have to be applied many times a day.i tried every mascara from l&#x27;oreal. by far this is the best even than the one with fiber in it. the brush is thick and it spreads the cream uniformly.</li>

    <li> I usually love loreal mascara. But this is just awful. The brush is the worst brush I have ever seen. It looks like they put the leftover defective bristles from all the other brushes onto this one. It&#x27;s just a nightmare mishmash of bristles. Then the actual mascara comes out in one big glob. I had to wipe the brush with a paper towel otherwise I would have had goopy black widow leg lashes.  The actual mascara isn&#x27;t anything special. Messy and flaky. It&#x27;s not buildable at all. It&#x27;s almost like wearing no mascara at all,but worse because it&#x27;s time consuming trying to actually get any results. Actually, the more I think about this mascara the more I hate it. Zero stars for this mascara!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump. Easy to layer. Great product!</li>
    <li> I hate the gigantic brush on this mascara...it&#x27;s really really huge! The bristles are so long it&#x27;s almost ridiculous. However, I have to admit that I like this mascara! It works on my lashes. It adds volume and length both. It takes some patience and careful strokes to apply coats to avoid scratching my lids, but the semi-wet formula applies fairly easily and does not clump. I get really clean, dark lashes and I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
    <li> Hands down, best mascara out there under $30. Adds volume, definition, and is buildable. I always get compliments on my lashes. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to find a drugstore mascara to replace the Lancome and Dior mascaras that are now so ridiculously over-priced I can no longer justify the expense. This one will do well as any as a replacement for Clinique&#x27;s High Impact or Lancome&#x27;s Definicils (non-waterproof) provided you&#x27;re willing to apply 2 or 3 coats. It&#x27;s a thinner formula, but with those 2 or 3 coats, this lengthens nicely, and volumizes a little, with no clumping that I could detect. The brush is tapered at the end making it a little easier to reach those tiny, inner lashes and bottom lashes. This one isn&#x27;t waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to run all over the place at the least hint of moisture. But if you want lots of drama and volume, this probably won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Use it as a 2nd layer after a lengthening mascara to add significant volume.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and I use a ton of it. It&#x27;s significantly cheaper to purchase through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Best one ive ever bought</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and have never had this problem.  My lashes are getting thinner and I thought this mascara sounded like it would give me fuller, defined lashes.  That is not the case.  I spend more time trying just to APPLY the mascara and then I look like I have almost nothing on my lashes.  Its like having a nearly empty tube of mascara.  I think the brush might be too full to allow the lashes to get into the core of the brush where the mascara is.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers on the L&#x27;Oreal website who say the same thing.  I bought this mascara only a couple of weeks ago but I don&#x27;t have the receipt or packaging anymore so, I can&#x27;t return it.  But, I think I&#x27;m going to throw it away and get something else.  I really liked the L&#x27;Oreal mascara that comes in a gold tube, that Gwen Stefani was marketing (I can&#x27;t remember the name).  That mascara wore really well.</li>
    <li> I have used [[ASIN:B004BCXAM8 L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara, Carbon Black, 0.26-Fluid Ounce]] many times, and was always highly satisfied with the results, but this mascara was a huge disappointment for me.  After two uses that involved a lot of scraping around just to get mascara ON the wand, the next 2 uses were fraught with so much mascara stuck to the wand that it looked like a black q-tip.  I had to rinse the wand to be able to see the bristles again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes looked neither voluminous, nor full and luscious.  They looked clumpy and I had black flakes speckling my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it did not matter because the four applications was all of the mascara that was in the tube.  It was empty, and that was that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Loreal&#x27;s mascaras, starting in the late 80&#x27;s with Lash Out. This is by far my favorite. I&#x27;m 42 so my days of having naturally luscious lashes are behind me and thats just fine because I have Loreals&#x27;s Power Volume Collagen! Plumps, lengthens, and makes the most of every lash. Stays on perfectly until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> the brush takes a little getting used to but I love how dark the black is so I figured it out 😜</li>
    <li> Lovely mascara that provides great coverage but requires 3 coats for nice impact. It stays on with no smearing or flaking but it does seem to wear off slightly by midday. I usually add another coat around lunchtime to freshen my look. But it is now my go-to mascara!</li>
