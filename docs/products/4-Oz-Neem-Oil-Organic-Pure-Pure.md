      <li>In a month it went from the (normal for me with ideal being 100)</li>
      <li>Great for hot  oil treatments for the hair as well.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not greasy and very light</li>
      <li>Smells really fresh for neem oil, probably the most pleasant smelling neem I have come across..</li>
      <li>The neem reduces my  insect bites and itching about 80%, which is very good for something all natural.</li>
      <li>I will order some more soon</li>
      <li>Am satisfied  to the extent that I ordered more.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>so, so glad I did.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had my order for a week now.  Like everyone says, it smells awful.  But it is a powerful healer.  I got a scratch from a bouganvilla bush and put it on it and in one day it healed my wound.  It is helping with my skin  I can&#x27;t wait to use it to repel bugs. I have used it on my eyelids to heal stys and it is working.  You know, with all the crap we are being sprayed with, my eyes are all googy and this really helps.  I have also put a few drops in my toothpaste (which I make and is liquid) and will see how that works.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil. I use this in my anti aging facial oil, as well as a thin line around my plants. It keeps the ants out!</li>
    <li> Great brand! Neem oil does smell really terrible, but remember to dilute it. I dilute it with extra virgin olive oil and both are great for your skin! Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This s*** smell like booty boo...and it did not help my acne ..no I would recommend it to anyone sorry maybe another oil but not this one</li>
    <li> I bought this Neem oil to apply on my cat who&#x27;s been suffering during the hot summer months.  He actually likes it!</li>
    <li> This cleared up my dogs bacterial rash!  He was on antibiotics 2-4X a year.  A few drops in his water every other day and applied topically, if he had spots.  He is a three year old french bulldog.  They tend to have allergies and sometimes cannot be pinpointed.  I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also mixed with a little dish soap and water...  got rid of all bugs on my potted plants!</li>
    <li> The Oil is intense, and have been using it for 3 weeks. It takes a little getting used to the smell, but after that it seems to be clearing up several skin matters I have been contending with. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> This oil work good on the body and one did not get a rash.</li>
    <li> Neem. Oil.  Is. Fantastic , works  on my skin Perfect , not oily.  Absorbs  fast  by. My. Skin !!!!  NOT NLY FOR MY SKIN , I USE IT ON SCARS !!!!!!  EVEN.  MY. HAIR , BEATIFULLY.  SHINE. AND. SOFT !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great PRODUCT THANKS SO much for fast delivery.</li>
    <li> helped heal small sore that wouldnt (diabetic) ck w md first--usual recommendations--but worked for me--like --sour &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell &amp;#34;acquired taste&amp;#34; so to speak--happy w product</li>
    <li> I literally could get sick smelling it, however I think that&#x27;s just what neem oil smells like. I would never use it again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get pass the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells HORRID but it did cure my rash. I also use it on mosquito bites, minor irritations and things, it clears them right up.</li>
    <li> Smells aweful... but works like magic. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I was unaware of it&#x27;s garbage like smell. Not sure I can use it on my pets for ticks which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Stinks, but is great for multiple uses.</li>
    <li> This product smells TERRIBLE. Think fermented rotting onions. And the smell lingers. Although it may help psoriasis, I can&#x27;t tell as I have a hard time forcing myself to apply this daily. Definitely can&#x27;t apply and go to work as the smell is offensive.</li>
    <li> beware of the smell...it is definitely unpleasant but it made my hair feel so good</li>
    <li> Its good and I expect it works well....</li>
    <li> We mixed 2 tablespoons of this product with a gallon of water and sprayed our miniature Alberta spruce tree with it several times...it took care of the bug problems 9spiders and aphids)...no pesticides needed.</li>
    <li> Okay so it smells bad but the effects are great especially if you have acne, oily prone skin.  I have been dealing with adult acne on and off for 10 years and I know all the products expensive not expensive prescription non prescription. I stumbled across some blogs that have raved about natural/essential oils and they raved about Neem oil because it has anti bacterial properties. The price is right too. I still get pimples here and there especially around that time of the month (sorry tmi) or if I eat badly however they heal faster, they are smaller and it&#x27;s usually one or two pimples I&#x27;m dealing with as opposed to several :( YIKES! No one wants that so if you&#x27;ve tried everything but haven&#x27;t tried this yet, do it.</li>
    <li> Like this although would be better if it arrived in a class in stead of plastic.</li>
    <li> Its good oil, works for what I needed it for but need oil in general has a pungent smell I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
    <li> It works great if you can get past the smell.</li>
    <li> This is not pure neem oil. It should harden when cold. When I left it the frig over night only a small portion of it hardened. It still works but does not appear to be pure neem oil.</li>
    <li> good size for price--much cheaper than Whole foods</li>
    <li> Smells strong, I dilute with water and use as a spray for spider mites.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a severe rash I had on my underarms. When it comes to smells, I&#x27;m not picky, but damn, this is by far, the stinkiest oil I&#x27;ve used. I cannot tolerate the smell. Sorry. I stopped using after a week of torture. It didn&#x27;t really help with my rash either.</li>
    <li> Very unpleasant smell as promised.  It is very soft on your skin.  Used with a towel to prevent odor from leaving residue on bed linen.  Appears to leave skin soft.</li>
    <li> Was delivered very quickly and as advertised.  The odor isn&#x27;t as bad as I was anticipating.  It smells like a combination of nuts and very garlicky.  I am extremely sensitive to smells, and I can endure this alright. I use in my hair and on my skin.  Feels nice.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> in just a few days use i have seen a reverse of excema symptoms on my child, fading of scars, bed bug repellent, itch relief. i mix it with baby lotion and use it on myself and my toddlers and i love it!. its worth enduring the smell of onions and coffee beans.</li>
    <li> Neem Oil is effective in combating mites and lice in a chicken coop and on the hens themselves. I haven&#x27;t had the need to use it but I am glad to have it as part of my all natural chicken first aid kit.</li>
    <li> Mixed 1oz Neem oil to 7oz water in a spray bottle and use gloves, I recommend spraying entire animal and doing it outdoors if you have a weak stomach cause it is very smelly! You could add orange oils or some other good smelling oils to help the smell as well!&lt;br /&gt;Totally Green and Organic!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a truly excellent neem oil.  Smells really fresh for neem oil, probably the most pleasant smelling neem I have come across.. Works well over time to improve my dry skin that may have been irritated by chlorine swimming pools, stress, and had a bit of resemblance to psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews for items I haven&#x27;t purchased on Amazon but I just had to write about my experience using neem.  I read all the reviews and no one mentioned the wonderful benefits it has on your gums and teeth.  I have always had problems with my teeth since I was very young but things got worse when I was unemployed and didn&#x27;t have dental insurance so I did some research and started brushing with baking soda and it helped.  Then one day while shopping in an Indian market I saw Neem oil I had no idea of its use but I bought it anyway.  I have been brushing with neem oil and  baking soda daily for the past two years.  The results are simply amazing.  My gums on the lower front teeth were blackened and I always had some kind of mouth pain but after using neem for a very short time things started changing.  My teeth and gums no longer hurt and my gums have lightened up considerably they are no longer black and inflamed.  Seems a little like a miracle to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent but I like the oil for my face.</li>
    <li> Very effective for killing body germs. It also alerted my whole body.</li>
    <li> really good for my skin, don&#x27;t like the garlic smell though lol!</li>
    <li> I use this oil for everything the smell is strong but I use to it because it is good.</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible.  Maybe it was spoiled.  Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has an odd smell which take some getting use to but it works</li>
    <li> Great, wonderful, fantastic, love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing this with soap and water in a spray bottle and spraying it on my plants. Works like a charm. Bugs can&#x27;t get away from this stuff. It works especially well on pincher bugs, though I&#x27;m not sure if it works on fungus gnats</li>
    <li> I have been using Neem oil for decades for pest &amp; parasite control. This particular brand is VERY high quality oil at an affordable price. You won&#x27;t regret ordering it.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I am happy I learned about Neem Oil</li>
    <li> I think I would use this product more if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad. I can only apply it at night on the weekends because the smell still lingers during the day.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helped my skin not look so scaly. Use it as night cream, not greasy.  Heals sores and lessons scars.  Helps inflammation.  This. Is great deal for price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want stock in company!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for hair oil. I had previously purchased a different product that was already mixed with other ingredients, which was ridiculously expensive. Instead of doing that again I chose to just create my own hair oil with pure Neem.&lt;br /&gt;I had no previous knowledge of the smell of Neem, but wow it is certainly potent. It smells like a baked onion with a sprinkle of garlic.&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought organic Rosemary oil and Organic Lavender oil to mix it with and it cuts the scent down considerably. I don&#x27;t have exact amounts for you but I can say that if you use about two 10ml. of essential oils (in other words the whole bottle) to the 4 oz of Neem that should do it. Really though you&#x27;ll have to test it yourself. I added both my essential oil bottles in this bottle and it made it tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is completely worth it, because this oil makes my hair so healthy, shiny and soft. It&#x27;s a bonus that it keeps the bugs away too. I plan on making a body oil next, possibly mixed with olive oil and grape seed to make it thinner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this oil is 100% neem as most neem oils I&#x27;ve used are semi solid at room temp, and this one never ever solidifies. It was not as effective on lice as other neem I&#x27;ve used either. I would go to the health co op and jut buy some.</li>
    <li> I bought it to protect my plants from flea beetles. I would not purchase it for this purpose because the solution will burn your leaves. The other reason to purchase this product would be more warranted. I would use Diatomaceous Earth for the flea beetles.</li>
    <li> My sister and dad have -Keratosis Follicularis (Darier Disease)  a horrible skin disease that is genetic. The test has proved remarkable to say the least. Softer skin , reduced infections, my Mom calls it a miracle, , that I can believe. I felt so  helpless until this perfect skin treatment  was used. if anyone knows of this type of disease its horrible . Am satisfied  to the extent that I ordered more. and sent them to her and my sister.  so this POST is for all those who suffer with this skin type tragedy. no more changing tee s***s 4 times a day, nor more agony. thank god. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Kills the powdery mildew on the zucchini plants, but I need to use it 4 or 5 times a week.</li>
    <li> Because this helps my hands and hands to keep soft &amp; prevents skin breaks, which allows for infections.  I suggest to others, in my swim class, to use this item in small amounts after every hand washing.  We must avoid germs that are passed along from others &amp; to others.</li>
    <li> THE SMELL ALONE WILL DROP YOU TO THE FLOOR. I SAW NO BENEFIT THO IT IS SAID TO BE BENEFICIAL.</li>
    <li> Now no one likes the smell but it does what meant to do.I use It for my hair for a deep condition treatment and I mean it grows the hair fast and thick.I use it for the hair because its natural so I use natural things on it.I use it for my body also along with other natural oils.need does smell bad I know, but it is a five star oil.lol</li>
    <li> So - just so you&#x27;re aware before purchasing this latest beauty secret, the smell is absolutely strong, and will never leave you.  To me, it&#x27;s terrible!  Someone else might like it, but don&#x27;t wear this unless you&#x27;re trying to chase someone off.</li>
    <li> With this oil, I missed the fact that it is not for sensitive skin.  I am using Skin Medica 1.0 Retin A, (I bought at Dermatologist office this time, to be sure I get the real thing, NO COUNTERFEITS) and I learned once I received it, the reason why Neem oil it did not help for the burning feeling is because, (after some researches online), this oil is actually not for sensitive skin.Too late.....!  Regarding Amazon, I am just tired of the fact that, instead of paying one shipping fee for all the items, you have to pay a shipping fee for each and single one item you buy with Amazon, and the worst is that, some shipping fees are even higher than if you buy each item directly with the seller.  Not only,  Amazon does not even stop the sell of counterfeiters&#x27; products, (which happened to me when I bought &amp;#34;Skin Medica&amp;#34; products with Amazon,) but I realize more and more that they are actually a waist of time and money with their weird shipping rules). Same thing with Mario Badesku products, Amazon said that they could not send it to me because I did not have the minimum amount to qualify?!!!!  What?...........I have to qualify now....., to buy something that I want to pay for?  Get real.  I went straight to the Badesku&#x27;s web site and ordered what I wanted and how much I wanted.  Better than that, no issues with shipping,  no weird stories. I only paid ~ 4.00 dollars for shipping for 2 products.  My order was done in minutes. AMAZON, USA is a developed country, so let&#x27;s go forward, not backward.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this oil does everything it proclaims to do, but nothing could have prepared me for the smell. Buy your carrier oils first (e.g. Lemon or lavender). You have to drown out the garlicky/oniony scent first.</li>
    <li> Neem oil is great for fungal infections, kills them dead  It does have an odor so careful when you use it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Beware of the smell!</li>
    <li> My dog had scabies and was itching like crazy. i tried everything to cure her nothing seemed to work.  I read about this product online. My dog scabies was gone in one treatment! I mixed one part oil and three parts water in a spray bottle, it worked like magic... I was so amazed by the results i started using it on my skin.  This product is safe with no side affects!</li>
    <li> use this on my farm animals to keep pesky bugs off of them.  I also spray it around the barn to reduce bugs</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> the scent is not to bad and i used it to clean my makeup off and for my soaps. I love the neem products.</li>
    <li> I like this oil very much. It has kind of a grassy smell with a touch of basil aroma. Neem has so many heath benefits &amp; I am glad that I can use it on my skin this way.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and great product.  I use it together with other essential oil for my bug spray and works great.</li>
    <li> Potent and smelly.  Seems to do its job.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.Its 100% real no fillers.And I received it like 2 day&#x27;s after purchasing online. GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Tried the neem oil, but couldn&#x27;t really see any direct result. The smell was not as bad as many people had indicated. I will continue using it until the supply is exhausted and hopefully it will work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a very specific purpose - to wean my 2-year-old after all other methods failed. It literally took one time of putting some oil on and she quit nursing just like that. Every time she thought about grabbing her human pacifiers, she&#x27;d take one sniff and go back to whatever she was doing. Worked like a charm! Warning though - this stuff is extremely stinky!!! If you&#x27;re wanting to use it, do it over the weekend or whenever you&#x27;re not going out in public for a few days. It kind of smells like burned garlic but very strong.</li>
    <li> Fast ship.. Great product..  Using it for my Frenchy who has bad dermititis.. It works very well she not itchy that much and the fleas stay away to..</li>
    <li> It helps, but it smells strongly of garlic flavoured peanut butter. I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I thought I&#x27;d be able to, but I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am stillf trying to figure out what is so special about this product?  Anyone know what is useful for?</li>
    <li> Healthy GOOD!!!  ♡ PH</li>
    <li> 4 parts neem and 1 part tea tree works great for controlling acne!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have struggled with acne since I was 21 (currently 26). My skin is oily and dry by turns and super petulant. Not only that, it&#x27;s very sensitive, so products hurt more than help more often than not. I tried this on a whim and I am so, so, so glad I did. Not only have I not had a single breakout since I started using this, but I have noticed dramatic fading of hyperpigmentation from past breakouts and a more even skin tone in general. What I do is, after washing my face/showering, mix a dime-sized amount with my moisturizer (Korres velvety moisturizer, which is also PHENOMENAL for oily/dehydrated skin). I give myself a mini-facial by rubbing this mixture into my skin (twice a day, morning and evening). And... voila. No breakouts, just softness and evenness. Don&#x27;t let the smell dissuade you. It&#x27;s like a mix of peanuts and garlic, not exactly pleasant, but let me tell you it&#x27;s so worth the benefits. Please try this if you have acne or scarring. It&#x27;s the single most helpful thing I have ever used, and that includes prescriptions.</li>
    <li> I use neem oil with water and spray it onto garden herbs as an organic pest control.  Potent smell like a mix of onion and rubber.</li>
    <li> Works great for making moisturizer</li>
    <li> Bought this because a vet recommended it for skin issues with our guinea pig, worked great!! Recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The scent is too strong but it works.</li>
    <li> The smell is HORRENDOUS. I can&#x27;t even use this.</li>
    <li> This stuff really stinks but it works for my natural hair.  I had issues with my scalp being really dry and flaky.  I tried lots of products, but I use this before I wash my hair every week and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my scalp.  Be warned Neem Oil has a strong odor and I recommend you dilute it and rinse several times after you wash.</li>
    <li> Extremely effective in hydration but the smell is rancid.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I used this in some homemade bug spray and it worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Excellent product give 5 stars</li>
    <li> not yet sure if i see any of the good that others mention, but i can tell you that the smell leaves a bit to be desired.</li>
    <li> Got this oil because it was recommended to me for eliminating dandruff. I found mixing it with tea tree oil works best. The smell is not that bad to me, it stinks, but its bearable.</li>
    <li> This product in my opinion is good for many things.  I use on face sometimes to help heal blemishes.  Also very useful for flaky scalp, dandruff.  Put some on fingertips and massage Into scalp before bed.  Wash out on morning and scalp will thank you.  It does make hair appear shiny and feel soft also.  Extra plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells.  Mixture of garlic and peanut butter? I don&#x27;t know. Still trying to decide.  Not the best smelling I agree but its usefulness outweighs the odor.</li>
    <li> I recently began using the oil cleansing method in my skincare regimen and chose this as my oil because it is antibacterial, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and moisturizes. It smells really bad, but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re slathering that stuff on your face as a mask, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I use it at night before bed. It removes excess makeup hiding in your skin also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this every night to cleanse before bed, my skin has become smoother, more moisturized (even in this ridiculous winter with my typically dehydrated skin), and most importantly--has MUCH more even coloring. I break out less and my skin looks healthier and more lifted/plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be repurchasing, definitely.</li>
    <li> I heard amazing things about neem oil and wanted to try it for my eczema. I got it and the smell was so horrific I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Then, two weeks after purchasing, I got the flu and two weeks after that, found out I was pregnant. I had to throw the hole bottle out and swore I could still smell the oil. I am sad I could not give it a fair chance and the only feedback I have is how intensely awful the smell is. Guess I will still to jojoba and sweet almond oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short time since I&#x27;ve received it, but I wish I would&#x27;ve ordered it sooner to get me through this dry, excruciating winter! My skin tone is a lot more even and my face is almost as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Neem oil has got a bit of a stank to it, but mixed with Dr. Adorable&#x27;s Golden Organic 100% pure Jojoba Oil, it&#x27;s not as pungent! It is quite light and absorbs quickly into my parched skin, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about being all greasy faced the whole day if I put it on in the morning. It shipped in a very timely manner and packaged double bagged, just in case it leaked, which it didn&#x27;t because of a safety seal and nice quality of bottle it was in. I recommend Dr. Adorable to you, yes, you!</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep ticks away for the awful summer season we&#x27;re having in New England. It works, smells AWFUL, but it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the US Virgin Islands for a while; the bugs were eating me alive. The neem reduces my  insect bites and itching about 80%, which is very good for something all natural. The people down here use the actual neem tree leaves for animal (dogs, horses, etc.) and human insect control. They did not believe that I had purchased REAL neem oil. Recently got used to the odor and since I don&#x27;t do much socializing here, it&#x27;s not a real problem. This product gets four stars because I think it has a small amount of water in it; it is not as thick, or dark, as the neem oil I bought from Swanson and it has a few little bubbles in it. It&#x27;s still worth the money if it works for your intended use; four ounces for about the same price, or less, than the one ounce Swanson product. I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
    <li> the oil works well on my breakouts but smells like garlic....  I put it on the affected areas with a tooth pick dipped in the oil...got a nice amount for the money....</li>
    <li> Good price but I want to use it and see just how good it is.</li>
    <li> Seems to work by itself to cure plants of bugs (in water of course). also appears to feed them as well, the plants of  course. For bedbugs dust with boric acid before and after and of course make the neem water 2 to 12 % (whatever that means) pyrethroid so the neem carries and harbors pyrethrins which are safer than chlorine.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with neem oil.  At first, I wanted to throw up from the smell.  It was horrible, but I covered the scent with Jasmine oil.  I use it on my scalp, face and hair.  This is hands down THE BEST product I have ever used in my hair.  I am biracial and I have used many products in my hair that usually leave my hair feeling weighed down and tangled.  After using the product for a month, my hair is super soft and sleek!  I use it as a once week deep conditioner and it works wonderfully!  Less breakage and tangles and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Unlike the majority of mainstream hair products which just sit on top of the hair, neem oil actually penetrates the hair shaft.  I also had dandruff and eczema and thanks to the neem oil, those issues are minimal to non existent.  I also applied neem oil, olive oil and aloe vera gel to a food triggered allergy skin rash and it went away within a few days.  I no longer buy expensive hair products and facial creams to address the multiple issues that had been going on with my noggin!  If you try the neem oil, buy a nice scented oil to help you not gag on the neem oil smell.  I&#x27;ve recently gotten use to the smell and don&#x27;t necessarily use essential oil with it.  I am a neem lover FOR LIFE!</li>
    <li> It is fantastic on the skin.....high quality and makes the skin so soft and supple....A great buy.....I would recommended to anyone..</li>
    <li> The smell is a killer, made me sick to the stomach, but mix it with other oils like jojoba, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, Lavender oil. Will take away the smell. Works good on my mom&#x27;s arthritis hip pain and she said and swollen ankles. A little goes a long way. I even put a little on my hair helps with itchy, flaky skin dryness on my scalp. I&#x27;m true believer, only except the smell, but my mom says the smell don&#x27;t bother. It&#x27;s like a spoiled, burnt onion smell.</li>
    <li> Stinks like Neem does and works as well as it stinks!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works well for repelling fleas.</li>
    <li> It is almost embarrassing to use topically because of the smell. It doesn&#x27;t wash off easily, and the smell lingers for hours. Other than that, it works</li>
    <li> Neem oil is absolutely disgusting. It smells like rancid chicken stuffed in a burning rubber tire, but damn it all, my skin cannot get enough of the stuff. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful for clearing up all breakouts WHILE moisturizing your skin. Acne medications and diluted tea tree oil are also great for clearing up breakouts - but while using them, my skin would get so dry and flaky and gross, that it was almost worse than the acne to begin with. This stops my breakouts in their tracks while beautifully moisturizing my skin. You just have to get over the smell.</li>
    <li> Trying this for acne and general summer itchy and irritated skin after reading reviews. Surprisingly very effective, relieving itch after first application, hopefully it&#x27;ll continue to help in the long term. A warning for those who are very sensitive to smells as there is quite a strong garlicky/onion smell but it does dissipate after about 15 minutes and over time you may become more tolerant... I would rather tolerate the smell as long as it works.</li>
    <li> Made the wife happy, for what ever she thought it had to do...Thanks for the smelly shampoo</li>
    <li> Did not stop itch and smells horrible</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little soon for a review, but it&#x27;s supposed to be a stronger and faster solution than Tea Tree oil for for ear aches, skin anomalies, etc . . . We shall see.</li>
    <li> Neem oil it works very good. will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Stinky but works great in CP soap! love it very good quality</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Stinky stuff but worth it I can sleep now. Still got bedbugs, just not in my bed! Sleep is priceless!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it consistently yet for flea treatment on my dogs, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Amazingly good.  Works great in the garden as well as a mosquito repellent. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Got it quickly but it smells awful! I can&#x27;t use because of the smell...</li>
    <li> its the truth.  strong and smell like rotten garlic.  but smoothes skin</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Smooth and golden brown. Very clear. I have found several uses for it.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t improved my condition.</li>
    <li> I just started to use it. the only thing o don&#x27;t like is the strong smell</li>
    <li> Works, however for indoors leaves your house sticky!</li>
    <li> This does work but has a bit of a strange smell but if you can get use to it it is worth trying.</li>
    <li> Works great, just has a very strong odor when you first put it on. The smell goes away shortly after.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it was recommended for skin problems but it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle leaked because cap was damaged, so USPS delayed delivery and sealed bubble wrap package in plastic. Package was soaked with oil and had very unpleasant odor that filled up entire room.&lt;br /&gt;Strong odor is not really an issue if only a few drops are used, and a few drops go a long way. If it works for someone else, this is a good deal because 4 ounces should last a very long time... maybe an entire lifetime... and it supposedly never goes bad if refrigerated.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS (and more) which has no cure or treatment for me and 1 great side effect is BAD acne and they are like systs. I put this with Tea Tree oil on band aids overnight for a week or so and it is allllll gone!! I haven&#x27;t had a real recurrence like I had but when I have any real skin issue THIS JUST WORKS! smells weird but get over it, if I can deal, with my heightened sense of smell I know you can!:)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t expire either.</li>
    <li> I give it a four star due to the smell. I tried cutting it with tea tree and vitamin e oils but I still smell it. I can only apply this at night, because it smells like some burnt up. I have a weak stomach lol but it&#x27;s still going to be used. Very fast shipping I&#x27;ve only had it a day so haven&#x27;t seen any benefits as of yet when I see a change I will write another review telling if I recommend this product or not.</li>
    <li> It is real neem oil for the price  it&#x27;s a great product. I used for my skin every day. I star see the result in my skin after few days.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful. Works! Buyers beware, scent of this oil is not pleasant. Maybe clip your nose with a clothes-pin!</li>
    <li> Wow. I have never smelled and oil that smelled this horrible. I almost threw up. It&#x27;s not worth the return. I&#x27;m throwing it in the garbage!  Disgusting!!!</li>
    <li> strong smell, use it to add to other oils</li>
    <li> The smell is unbareble. My whole house reeked after opening it! I had to throw it away. Not worth it at all</li>
    <li> I received this today! Dr Adorable took the time to create this and it&#x27;s not greasy and very light and I have already started using it. My skin appears to agree with it. it is certainly worth the time and $</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I bought this because I had fleas in my house, I rubbed some on my ankles until the infestation was over and I never got bitten when it was on, they wouldn&#x27;t even land on me.  I didn&#x27;t put any on my cat because I read it can be potentially harmful to cats, but it certainly worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it while camping yet, but I imagine it will work for that as well.  The only bad thing is that this stuff stinks, but if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to traditional bug spray and pesticides, you should get used to being a stinky hippie anyway.  It&#x27;s not excessively bad, it&#x27;s just a little stinky.  I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Neem oil has healing properties.  It certainly has aided my dry skin problem.</li>
    <li> I found Neem oil is good for dry scalp, dandruff and to prevent lice add it to you/your child&#x27;s shampoo.  It can also be added to dog shampoo.</li>
    <li> Getting used to the smell was the hardest part but once past that this oil is amazing for the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the worst smelling oil! It may have helped us get rid of lice but I think it was the Coconut oil. Hard to wash out of clothes and the high-efficiency washer if you get any on a towel. I would never use this for that purpose. Product is strong, may be good for other uses.</li>
    <li> Good old stinky Neem Oil.  The product was damaged in the post,  but the shipper was most gracious and refunded me imnediately.  I will definitely order from them again.  The US Post Office must have broken the bottle somehow en route, but I bet the Neem Oil killed alot of insects on its way to my address.  I had some cockroach problem, and NeemOil, while not killing roaches outright, after exposure to Neem Oil they can no longer lay viable eggs, so roaches die out.  Heh Heh Heh.  Live and let live, but the damn things have no respect, like your electronics too much and eat the glue in books, AND DO NOT PAY RENT!! SO one has to do what one has to do!</li>
    <li> It has a good consistency but the smell is horrible. I have used it once or twice because it smells like fermented onions. This is the only reason I do not use it much. I have to find a way to mask the smell. If the company can add lavender, vanilla or something to kill the smell I would definitely change my rating and buy it again.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the smell is disgusting , to decrease the smell I use it with bath and body lotion . But other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> As described , pure Neem oil . Good to go!</li>
    <li> Works very well for my plants.</li>
    <li> Cured the mange on my friend&#x27;s dog in a week or so. I was looking to help my friend&#x27;s dog and had read online that Neem oil worked miracles. I gave it a shot and it is absolutely true. Within days the hair was growing up through the blistering, bloody sores...within a week the sores were healing and within 2 weeks the issue had completely cleared. Truly unbelievable and we were so grateful for such a quick and efficient cure. We first mixed a few drops into the dog shampoo and bathed him. Then we would mix the neem in with coconut oil to use as a salve on the sores every few days. It only required about 1/4 of the bottle to take of the dog. With the rest of the bottle I experiented by washing my face with it. To my amazement, it cleared my skin completely (guess that should make sense, as Neem Oil is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal &amp; anti-parasitic).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for the past 6 months (this bottle lasted that long) and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else. It&#x27;s affordable and does the complete job.&lt;br /&gt;I swear by this stuff!</li>
    <li> I use it in my garden to protect it from white moths and caterpillars and it has worked really well.  The price was right and it helped solve a problem.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells like old rotten fish but helpsy skin feel and appear soft</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate. Love this neem oil.</li>
    <li> I am using it on a rash on my neck that nothing else has gotten rid of including prescriptions.  I had been using the neem soap and did notice that it became lighter so I purchased this and the capsules (which are great!) and it smells like fried onions to me so I mix it with the neem lotion and it makes it much easier to apply and reduces the smell considerably.  Like the idea of mixing with Tea Tree Oil too.  It absorbs easily into my skin and my rash is getting lighter every day.  I&#x27;ve only been using it once daily.&lt;br /&gt;I love Neem and I do believe it is a natural miracle.  I have been using the Neem Capsules too for about a month and it has completely eliminated my constipation which is caused by the medications that I take.  I go monthly to the doctor and every visit among the tests that he does is the oxygen in my blood.  In a month it went from the (normal for me with ideal being 100) 96 to 98 which is a very good thing.  All the pain in my stomach, bowels, liver is completely gone after years of pain from the constipation.  I see tiny particles in my urine which I believe is from the cleanse of my blood and organs from the use of Neem. I don&#x27;t recommend using the oil internally but the capsules certainly works wonders.  The Neem Oil works great externally for my skin and my dogs skin (I put some in her shampoo).  I am a Neem lover now....I also use the Neem Cinnamon Tooth Paste and Mouth wash :)</li>
    <li> It is doing wonders for my skin texture, tone, blemish and preventing acne. Athough I am eating better and drinking more water</li>
    <li> I like it. The  hair on the sides  of my head was coming out. I used this and got a new growth of hair. Great for hot  oil treatments for the hair as well. The scent is smelly, but worth the results.</li>
    <li> It stinks to high heaven my girls won&#x27;t use it even though I tried to mask the smell  with other oils so it won&#x27;t smell so bad. I put in my shampoo  too.</li>
    <li> perfect for making soap</li>
    <li> I bought this originally thinking I&#x27;d use it in some homemade toothpaste.  That idea went out the window with my first attempt.  The flavor is WAY too strong, like brushing with onion oil.  Luckily google gave me many other uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I use it for now is as a general anti flea/parasite treatment on my dogs.  I don&#x27;t feed them the oil, though my littlest one laps up any stray drops as if it were candy.  Generally the oil is considered too strong orally though not toxic. Powdered neem is preferred for oral use.  Instead I put a smidge on my hands, rub it around and then rub all over my dogs body.  It is also conditioning.  I use other natural treatments like B vitamins with my dogs to prevent fleas, so hard to tell which part is working best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it recently as a topical treatment on myself along side tea tree oil when I was recently exposed to scabies at work.  I didn&#x27;t develop scabies.  Just google and you will find many other ways to use this oil.  I&#x27;m very glad I bought this even if it didn&#x27;t work out as a toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Appreciate keeping things as natural as possible, neem oil is one way to be ahead of the problem.</li>
    <li> love it.  Smell is strong so I don&#x27;t use it during the day.  Don&#x27;t want to offend others.  SMells like onions, but therein lies it power.  Great for scalp and hair.  Would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent pice for quality neem oil- used in so many holistic and natural applications. Very potent, a little goes a long way so this will lay a long time if stored in cool, dry place.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so I cannot comment if it works but it does stink. I mixed a tiny bit in a cup with some coarse salt(something I found online) and washed my face with it followed by a yogurt mask. The smell was stuck in my nose so I used a nasal spray shortly after.</li>
    <li> Order this product, suffer from eczema and I can honestly say saw a better difference in 2 days not 100 % but better. Than after the fourth day, family noticed the eczema gone on my neck and arms. Smell is very strong, I have no problem with the smell but those around can&#x27;t stand the smell. I would just put one to three drops per body section, its all you need. after about a week good result but needed to moisturize the skin with something else. in the end good stuff</li>
    <li> 4 Oz Neem Oil Organic Pure Pure;</li>
    <li> the smell was a little over whelming&lt;br /&gt;.  I needed to make an ointment for a 6 month old and his mother refused to use it on him because of the smell,  But I will use it for other purposes and hope to knock the smell down a little</li>
    <li> amazing stuff!! I think this must be the forbidden tree that Yaweh talked about.</li>
    <li> it is a true neem oil and hence i expect it to be effective</li>
    <li> The smell was bad. So  I have only used in my hair once however I plan to try again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never had experience with herbal remedies, this may be an offputting way to start. I got this to help in curing scabies in addition to the Permethrin 5% perscription I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, the oil does not smell good... at all. But it&#x27;s not supposed to. I diluted the oil with another oil as recommended (I used baby oil). The mixture smelled like an only slightly off peanut butter, which was better, but I still could not get past it. If you have a very sensitive nose, I would not recommend this!</li>
    <li> giving a 5 star for delivery</li>
    <li> Works great as a pesticide for my plants. Thanks.</li>
    <li> If you need help quick go no further start here n sulfur soap bars 10% your free of nasty visitors</li>
    <li> Smells horrible, but works wonders for dandruff or mild rashes when mixed with the right oils.</li>
    <li> if its suppose to be good for me and smells so bad.. I&#x27;d rather not sorry company but this neem oil stinks it smells like rotten onions and it didnt really help my skin.. I dont like neem oil .. and I wasted my money.. too late to return it .. maybe I&#x27;ll donate it to goodwill or something.. but I&#x27;m not using it again.. bad buy on my part well I know next time and thats half the battle..</li>
    <li> This product works really well. My fiance uses it for the dry skin on his feet due to having athletes feet. It&#x27;s been about two weeks and he likes it so far.</li>
    <li> Yuck, this stinks so bad, that I can even go near it :(</li>
    <li> This has one of the most unappealing smells I have ever smelled, like old fish.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Product shown is exactly what was delivered.  Was packaged very well to prevent damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be using this oil to kill mites on my plants.</li>
    <li> Works very well in baths for my son eczema</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here but good product</li>
    <li> It smells like the salt pack in ramen noodles...horrible</li>
    <li> Stinks like old onions, but I use it on my face, cuts, irritated skin. I love it. I&#x27;m already using a toothepaste with neem and I&#x27;m going to make DIY mouthrinse with Neem, clove and peppermint oil. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have moderate excema and seborrheic dermatitis.  In the past I&#x27;ve tried everything and only tar shampoo on the hair and body as well as steroids from the dermatologist has worked.  I&#x27;d like to go more natural and get away from the toxic tar/steroids.  I heard about Neem Oil on Dr Oz and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I first purchased shampoo from Organix with Neem in it.  It did not work and in fact, made me more itchy.  Using the straight oil on problem areas has been hit and miss also.  Some areas have improved, some have not.  Given that the smell is sooooo strong and the product is only partially effective, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but my skin may be different from others and it may work better for someone else.</li>
    <li> This oil is strong in smell. I mix with another oil. It works well.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR ECZEMA, PSORIASIS, AND YOUR HERB GOOD FOR YOUR TEETH, DO NOT INGEST THIS.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected very smelly made me nauseas the whole night</li>
    <li> I like it but it smells kind of strong--like onions or like cooked meat or something. Best to wear it to bed and not out in public. It makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging not so much as a leak. I got my neem oil before expected and am trying it tonight on my seasonal hives.</li>
    <li> So damn smelly who cares if if works! :-(&lt;br /&gt;Yuck!!</li>
    <li> Once thawed. It will be used</li>
    <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;good delivery time and it was the real stuff not like my sister got from some company that was 60% watered down&lt;br /&gt;Jake&lt;br /&gt;PS I will order some more soon</li>
    <li> The Oil is intense, and have been using it for 3 weeks.  It takes a little getting used to the smell, but after that it seems to be clearing up several skin matters I have been contending with.</li>
