<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect size including the one inch finger hole, perfect medium stiff bristles. Very satisfied, though six of them are a lot.</li>
    <li> sooooo hard to find, i bought a set of 6, these work great in the shower and help keep your hair healthy well into your 90&#x27;s, i would encourage everyone to buy some!</li>
    <li> They last forever, no problem</li>
    <li> Great shippng.  I got the merchandise in less that a week.</li>
    <li> I have no trouble holding and using the brush. The tips are rounded and flex when pressure is applied. A very gentle massage and easy to clear any hair it picks up. A very sturdy brush that will last for years to come.Each family member gets their own and three are spare. I like this item cause it&#x27;s the same one my barber uses.</li>
    <li> Exactky what i wanted</li>
    <li> Problem with these brushes is that the plastic loop holding the brush onto the palm of your hand breaks fairly soon after wearing and using it. The loop, where the middle finger goes thru...should be reinforced so it does not break and this has happened to me already with three (3) of the brushes I have used.&lt;br /&gt;BOBBY GOLDMAN bobby777@rcn.com</li>
    <li> nice and big&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought number of different ones but keeps losing them when I travel. I left a few in the hotel. I use it when I shampoo. I just purchased this one and like its larger size than the others that I had. Also I feel the stiffness of the teeth is right for me. I rarely give five starts.</li>
    <li> Best I&amp;#34;ve purchased thus far...the OceanPure Scalp was good for a man that has thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these forever.  It is comfortable and feels great on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The ones that I received are painful to use.  The bristles are uneven and some are very sharp.  When I used the first one for the first time, I actually bled!  I haven&#x27;t tried to return them nor have I contacted the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a simple item but impossible to find locally.  I love to wash my hair with them.  Shipping was more than the cost of the items, but I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Yes. This is a good replacement for the original GOODY brush. The original, from Goody, seems to be unavailable, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is very good. I had been using four original Goody brushes for the last four decades, as crazy as that sounds. I could never locate a very much needed replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is the same diameter, with bristles that are 1/2 inch long, just like the original. It has the same curvature, and is sufficiently flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, incredibly, it is actually made in the USA . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I WOULD SAY BUY IT.</li>
    <li> These are great to have in the shower, on the dresser and in the truck. Good quality and design.</li>
    <li> I did not need six but I chose to buy them since buying just one cost about as much as six.  Not too much to write about, gentle on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy these in drugstores.  They have disappeared.  I had an old one that had some reference on it and I found these.  They are very well made and good quality.</li>
    <li> You can feel the bristles tearing out the dandruff from your scalp. After you use this brush, your head feels like it was scrubbed. Similar brushes are too blunt and leave the dandruff intact, not this brush, it gets them out. I don&#x27;t have to shampoo twice, once is enough, just lather, scrub and rinse, you&#x27;re done and it feels like it too. This brush is not for the fufu types that like a soft rub, but for those that desire an effective shampoo, period. The bonus is water doesn&#x27;t pond in it too, when left in the shower upside down, due to the opening in the middle</li>
    <li> How and when did these things disappear from store shelves?? They&#x27;re just GONE! So glad I could find them online. Can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> they are very good. I use them every day.</li>
    <li> Works great - I&#x27;ve been trying to locate these for years</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for almost 50 years. Then all of a sudden I could not find them in any retail stores. Thanks to Amazon I found these and a number of others. Great for curly hair...</li>
    <li> Not too hard on the scalp.  Glad I ordered the 6 pack - it should last the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I had one of these from many years ago.  I bought a replacement, but it wasn&#x27; the same.  i went back and continued to use my old broken one for years.  Finally, I go the wild hair and looked it up on the internet.  It feels great on my scalp and provides me with a good massage.</li>
    <li> Would have preferred firmed bristles to provide better scalp massage. They get the job done and were a great price.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen these in quite a while so was happy to order them.  Design is just like I remember except for the handle.  Used to have a single post sticking up now a loop over a large hole.  No big deal but the loops have been breaking off from normal use.  Also seeing a few bristles breaking off now and then.  I think the plastic is a mite too stiff and brittle for a scrub brush which needs to be flexible.</li>
    <li> Perfect price, works great! Flexible but firm.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these in the stores for a few years. Finally bought 6. These really get the scale off the scalp without hurting it.</li>
    <li> These would be perfect, however the comb&#x27;s bristles are too soft. Husband says he&#x27;s used to stiffer bristles that scratch his scalp and these just don&#x27;t cut it. Feels good but not what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> I use these to comb my hair.  The whole family seems to use them as well for grooming/head-scalp shower scrubber.  Over time the bristles become brittle and crack off.  Highly packable and a straightforward product though.</li>
    <li> I had one of these brushes many years ago and after it wore out I had never seen another like it in any store I shopped at. When I looked them up on line I was really happy. Gave one to each of my 3 sons, one to a friend, kept one for myself and gave the last one to one of my son&#x27;s for his dog.&lt;br /&gt;They are really great for massaging your scalp when you shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend these to anyone that wants to feel great in the scalp area:-)</li>
    <li> I thought I needed one of these.  Turns out, I needed all 6. I use these to &#x27;brush&#x27; my very short hair, so I keep two in my make-up drawer, one in the shower, one in my purse, one in a pretty box on the coffee table to brush out my &#x27;chair hair&#x27; when I&#x27;ve been resting my head and get that unsightly part down the back of my head.  And one for the hubby! That makes 6.</li>
    <li> The brushes just seem to have been designed perfectly.  A scalp brush may seem pretty simple, but there is quit a range of quality and usefulness.  These brushes have a perfectly sized finger ring and the material is just pliable enough to conform to your head, but firm enough to scrub like you want.  And they are made in the USA!!!</li>
    <li> Made in the USA, these are the very best EVER.  Works best/easy for short hair.  Great gift for men - received many thanks, especially the comment:  Who knew there was such a thing.  Keeps scalp clean and healthy.  So easy to use.  Good for kids (especially the boys)!  I have been using these for years.  They truly last and last.</li>
    <li> Excellent and bristles are not sharp,  I only needed 2 but bought the whole set because they are so nice,</li>
    <li> The is the perfect scalp massage brush.  Bristles are durable enough for thick curly hair, but does not scratch scalp, so ensures a great clean, massage.  Hope they keep manufacturing!</li>
    <li> A basic, inexpensive short hair washer and massager which is hard to find in retail stores anymore.  I forgot to bring&lt;br /&gt;my well worn red model to my summer home and so I now have six blue ones.  I like red better but the blue works&lt;br /&gt;as well as the red.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shampoo scalp brushes: durable, rounded just right, with firm finger grip and long, well-spaced bristles that deal well with thick or longer hair.  Bristles are also just dull enough at the ends not to hurt the scalp.  Best shampoo brush I can remember using, and they&#x27;re reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is just like the old &amp;#34;Fitch&amp;#34; scalp massage brush that I had used for over 50 years but no longer can find.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need 10 but now I have an extra 9 of these I can leave to my grandchildren in my will.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that they are curved to fit over the scalp better.  The prongs are sturdy, but gentle and without flaws to keep from catching and pulling the hair.  Great value for the number of brushes so we have extras for our travel bag.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband who owned one similar to these many years ago.  Unfortunately, while cleaning I somehow threw it away.  Time passed and we weren&#x27;t able to find them in the stores any longer.  Thanks to Amazon he now has six and was pleasantly surprised that I ordered them.  He says they clean the scalp and feel just like the one he had so long ago.  They arrived promptly and are exactly like described.  It fits to the curve of the hand comfortably and massages the scalp without being too abrasive.</li>
    <li> I finally found shampoo brushes after decades without them. They work, but the bristles aren&#x27;t stiff enough for my liking.</li>
    <li> The original FMS is made from soft plastic and a terrific product.  THIS ONE IS NOT!&lt;br /&gt;The ones sent are extremely stiff plastic and very, very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles scratch the scalp rather than massage.  It is almost unusable.&lt;br /&gt;This may be a counterfeit, made from a cheap copied mold, using very cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are thinner than the original, which implies that the mold was a copy.&lt;br /&gt;I will look elsewhere for the original, and I hope to return this junk.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I wanted, exactly as described and delivered exactly as promised. Who could ask for anything more? (last line courtesy of G. Gershwin.)</li>
    <li> My head, i.e. scalp and hair, is so very happy to have this new shampoo scalp brush.  My old one is starting to lose its bristles and have been looking for a replacement for over a year.  Am so happy to find one that is so close to the old one I&#x27;ve had for probably 15 years.  It fits the hand and massages the scalp just the way it should, without getting tangled in hair.  A great bargain and its nice to have one for every shower and left overs for travel and sharing.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the measurements on it and these are VERY small in diameter...like 3 inches.  They are also made out of a hard plastic so yes you can scrub your head in the shower and yes you will bleed.  Mine went straight to the trash and I will have to be more careful next time.</li>
    <li> Having used these since April (4 months), I can gladly say I have no regrets towards this purchase. The brush is made with a cheap plastic, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the tips breaking so far. The product feels great against the scalp and I am using it daily in the shower. I&#x27;ve given one to both my brother (he also uses it daily now) and my dad. My dad actually liked it so much, that I gave him a second to use around the house (when not in the shower). He has had issues with flakes, and I won&#x27;t go so far as to say the scalp brush has gotten rid of them, but it&#x27;s definitely improved. When I gave one to my mom, she didn&#x27;t care for it as her long hair would get tangled in it.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! They are used a lot in barber shops to get the shampoo and conditioner completely into the hair. Note: These are quite sharp compared to others. The Marvy Brush is a good alternative if you don&#x27;t like sharp hard plastic. Our house uses both - long hair quite enjoys these Century brushes, while the short hair enjoys the Marvy</li>
    <li> my husband has a brush in every car he drives and in every bathroom of our house. He loves them.</li>
    <li> my family had one f these when i was growing up and ive been looking for one since. It removes the dry skin and massages the scalp while shampooing.</li>
    <li> OMG, I love these!  I was stationed in Korea and the girls that cut hair used these. It&#x27;s like a backscratcher for your scalp. Amazing!</li>
    <li> This brush works well and feels good on the scalp. I feel like a get a better, more thorough clean using it. If there was one thing I would change however, it would be the handle. To me, the loop handle that&#x27;s on the brush is a little clunky &amp; awkward to use. Also, I lack the extra space or shelves in the shower as well. And these brushes don&#x27;t include a rope on the handle to at least hang on the shower knob. I had to put one on myself and it definitely works for my needs. I just wish it came with the rope originally and the handle was designed differently or wasn&#x27;t there at all. It&#x27;s function over form in this case I guess...THE BRUSH WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> These work well for getting dead skin, dandruff, off your scalp while shampoo&#x27;ing.  Great price, too.  Can use on pets if you want, too.</li>
    <li> I could not find these in ANY store locally.  Most did not even know what I was inquiring about.  My dad used these as long as I could remember, and he had a FULL head of hair when he passed on ! !  Thanks AMAZON ! ! !</li>
    <li> Plastic shampoo brushes are difficult to find in the stores- these tend to have very sharp bristles, but they will suffice.</li>
    <li> I use these when I shampoo so I do not break my hair scrubbing my scalp.  This gets the shampoo to the scalp without tangling my hair so I don&#x27;t have to use much shampoo to get my scalp clean.  Having very long hair, the ability to clean the scalp without breaking hair is important.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product, and definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Replacement for ones I had for years and were breaking.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and long lasting. Fits curvature of skull perfectly.</li>
    <li> Good brush.  Finger loop gives firm easy hold &amp; control.  Have used these for years from barber; but the switched to another style and it took me forever to find them.  I liked the black; but blue is find.  I stash one each place I use them.  I use them most just to comb my hair.  So I have one in car, bed room, bath etc.</li>
    <li> Great to find these with a solid finger hole.</li>
    <li> These shampoo brushes were an excellent purchase. Brushes of this kind used to be ubiquitous, like those net bath poufs, but I&#x27;ve been currently unable to locate any locally, so I turned to Amazon.  They&#x27;re a good size, not too big or too small, and they&#x27;re sturdy. The bristles are not sharp and feel great as they massage your head. The handle is part of the brush, not just attached, and you can comfortably slip one finger through it for leverage as you scrub.  The scalp stimulation and cleaning obtained with these brushes far exceeds that which you can achieve with your nails or finger tips. They feel great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for these in drug stores and several other retail stores in recent years but I&#x27;ve been unable to find them. This brush gives a good scalp massage, and with a pack of six they&#x27;ll last a long time. The bristles are firm but not to rough on the scalp. Great for showers. Thanks Amazon..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
    <li> These combs are awesome. My sons and husband use these every day. They aren&#x27;t used in the shower just to brush and style their hair and they work great and are not flimsy. No problems so far. Love that I got enough in the order if they lose some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush for only a month now.  It doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as the Goody but it doesn&#x27;t tangle in your hair either.  The bristle tips are slightly more rounded than those on the Goody so the Century brush feel slightly more comfortable to use.  All in all, the Century is more than acceptable for me.</li>
    <li> Product delivered was purple in color not blue as described by Amazon. Other product features were as described.</li>
    <li> My husband found one of these in the street (go figure) so after strong disinfectant tried it out ahd just loved it!  So we were delighted to find them online and we got the pack of 6 of them.  The fingers are strong enough to provide great stimulation (his hair is thin, so they don&#x27;t have to get through a lot) and he enjoys scratching his head while shampooing and his arms to exfoliate.  He says the handle fits his hand well.</li>
    <li> I love these for both my cats and me.  I have a pesky cowlick that has virtually disappeared since I started using it.  I like my hair very short, and these brushes have helped me get rid of implements.  The cats love it, and when I start brushing on, the others can&#x27;t wait to get into my lap quickly enough to get their share.  If I use it regularly for them, I find fewer hairballs laying around.</li>
    <li> The scalp brush is comfortable to hold with the finger ring, they are softer than others I have used, and thus are more gentle on the scalp, while still providing great results.  They work great on my scalp and beard.  I gave them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Best scalp massage...shampooing...  Love them.  Great for pets ...even ones that hate being brushed love these....I have Briards and they love getting brushed and massaged with these....Kids....!!!  Love scrubbing their hair themselves with these.  Some are to stiff....glad to find these are just perfect...It&#x27;s an odd gift to give to people but much appreciated when you do!!!  We all had them growing up!!!  Fullerbrush man maybe!!!  Nice find on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Not only does this brush give you a great scalp massage, and get your scalp super clean, it&#x27;s also a great detangler.&lt;br /&gt;Glad they came 6 to a package.  Will use them forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 10-29-12&lt;br /&gt;Today I brushed my scalp &amp; HAIR with this brush. OMG!&lt;br /&gt;It f-e-e-l-s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;**LOVE** this brush!  I can tell, it&#x27;s good for your hair .. and scalp.</li>
    <li> Sturdy brushes. Cost for the multi-pack makes them very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the bristles were a bit shorter - but otherwise these are near perfect.</li>
    <li> They break very easily.</li>
    <li> just what I had been looking for</li>
    <li> These work quite well.  They are more &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; than some others out there, and will not scratch or hurt your scalp.  I have had one already break one side of the finger-grip, but I think some CyanoAcrylate glue might fix it.</li>
    <li> Great product, very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> i have one in each shower. they are not too hard nor too soft. i use them not only on hair but for facial hair too. mens beards tend to shed more than people think.</li>
    <li> feels good on your scalp</li>
    <li> Very well priced for a decent product</li>
    <li> Gentle on scalp, good for a sensitive scalp. I like it.</li>
    <li> I had a red one that I have had for 12 years used every day and the teeth started falling out. Finally found these and decided to get the pack and keep them at the cabin,home and don kit for travel. The I out fitted my son in law as well. Love them</li>
    <li> I love these! They are not too stiff or sharp. Using a scalp massager along with T-Sal shampoo has reduced my dandruff to almost nothing. The only time I have a problem now is when it is hot and my scalp sweats too much. And I do think that the massaging action helps stimulate blood circulation which improves hair quality. And it feels great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes for washing my hair before.  Nothing else has compared for the massaging and the feeling that I&#x27;ve thoroughly cleaned my hair and scalp.  I purchased the quantity of 6 just so I would have extras because I love them this much.  The delivery of this item was very prompt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used scalp brushes for 30+ years to slow hair loss.  These are best brushes I&#x27;ve found.  My scalp feels as though it&#x27;s receiving a vigorous, yet gentle, thorough massage that leaves it soothingly tingling and stimulated.  I never knew such a brush existed.  I will use these brushes for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I like this type of brush. I use it as a regular hair brush. I have found it holds up and last longer than more expensive brushes. Some times simple is better.</li>
    <li> These do the job and really massage very well.  Cheap plastic but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with the scalp brushes!!!  I have looked long and hard to find them, and you were a Godsend.  Thanks again!!!!!</li>
    <li> favorite scalp massage took</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  These are nothing special, just exactly as pictured.  I use them to massage my scalp in the shower.  It would be cool if the pins were more rubbery, but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> cheaply made, look cheap.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. Maybe I was expecting more...time to keep looking. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> I love them. They help my dandruff and the scalp massage is awesome. They leave my hair really soft afterwards too.</li>
    <li> My husband had been the proud owner of this very same brand for over 20 years. He wasn&#x27;t hopeful when he asked me to search and see if I could find him a replacement. I new Amazon was the place to go...he  was SUPER excited when he saw I ordered him a 6 pack. He even became a bit nostalgic when he threw is old one away. (It had some missing bristles)</li>
    <li> I use this when I shampoo my hair and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and it makes combing your wet hair with ease.  I use this brush when using hair conditioner - works wonders.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!!!</li>
    <li> Family loves them. They make you scalp tingle. Now I think I know how the dog feels when I scratch his head.</li>
    <li> I used one of these as a kid and loved it!!  When I saw these on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to get them.  It does not pull your hair out and makes your scalp feel tingly and clean.  Am giving them to family members  and hopefully they will love as much as I do.</li>
    <li> search at many stores looking for these brushes, I only found them here and they are exactly what I needed. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Although the handle break off too early.</li>
    <li> it is NOT hard - actually a bit on the soft side; unless they hv many varieties.  glad amzn carries it!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting the bristles to be hard and scratchy, but they felt fine on my scalp.  The brush definitely adds an extra touch to my salon appointments.  I truly feel like I&#x27;m being serviced at a spa when my stylist uses it while shampooing my hair.</li>
    <li> My step-daughter uses one of these on her daughter&#x27;s scalp.  Until then I had never seen such a thing.  Then I learned about it on a website and decided to order it and try it out.  The price was right so not really out much if I didn&#x27;t like it but I actually love it.  When I wash my hair I use it to massage my scalp.  Not sure what it&#x27;s actually doing for my scalp or hair but I do know it feels really good.  I got the 6-pack and throwing the extras into stockings at Christmas.</li>
    <li> So I have long finger nails and don&#x27;t like to use them to scrub my scalp because it isn&#x27;t ideal for my nails or my scalp. These brushes are ideal for getting a good scrub without being too harsh. I also have a serious dandruff problem that these have helped to manage. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now and still on the first one so I imagine a pack of 6 will last a really long time because the plastic is durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also ideal for using with pets - I use one to scrub my cat during her baths. She doesn&#x27;t assault while attempting to clean her so it must not be that harsh and I don&#x27;t notice lesions or cuts on her skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> We keep these in the bath and they are flexible enough to go into toilet bags for travel.  Works as advertised and are durable.</li>
    <li> Too soft. I wish the bristles were stiffer, and I fear that each brush will have a very limited lifetime. Luckily, they come in a six-pack, but I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for a firmer version once these have run their course.</li>
    <li> the greatest palm comb on the market.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Had the original Goody&#x27;s head massage brush that I got from a drug store years back. It finally gave up the ghost and I had tried several different ones over the years and this is as close to the original as I have found.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> A little lighter weight than the ones we have had for years, but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else so these are appreciated. Husband and pets love them.</li>
    <li> strong plastic lightweight and cleans the hair a great product</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo accessory, I had one like this years ago and have searched the retail stores with no luck,, so when I found it on the internet I purchased 6!&lt;br /&gt;It fits your palm and head curves, is not too stiff and is better than all of the competitors that I have tried!</li>
    <li> About 15 years ago, I ditched regular brushes and combs and started using these to tame my mane. Even though I&#x27;m now suffering from male pattern baldness, I used to have a thick head of curly hair. Regular combs couldn&#x27;t make it through my mop without getting stuck; natural bristle brushes weren&#x27;t strong enough; and the prongs on most plastic brushes were too far apart to do much good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my barber suggested one of these, and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. These brushes are gentle on the scalp, follow the curve of your head, don&#x27;t pull or knot the hair, fit well in a shave kit, are easy to clean and are basically indestructible. I&#x27;d been using the same one every day for 15 years (and had others in the shower and shave kit), but my 3-year-old took my oldest one and it hasn&#x27;t turned up yet. I decided to replace it, and figured a few spares wouldn&#x27;t hurt. They&#x27;ll probably last me the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I was happy to learn that this massage brush was still available after 50 years of owning one.</li>
    <li> My scalp can get dry. The brush really helps lather up and also scrub well. I have one in my bathroom and gym bag now.</li>
    <li> Use this product every time I take a shower. I love it. Feels good on the scalp and goes through hair to scalp well.</li>
    <li> feels quite good to use while shampooing.  durable as well, been using the same one for about a 1 year.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these!</li>
    <li> I think the texture of these things is soft enough for me to massage my scalp occasionally, but not so soft as to lose its shape over time.</li>
    <li> Not only do my husband and I like to use the brushes, we use them for our five small dogs.  They normally fight me when it is time for their brushing but with this shampoo brush it feels like a massage to them.  Also, with five dogs, I am constantly covered with hair on my cloths and this work better than anything else I have used to remove hair.  The product is a great price and I would recommend this hands down. :)</li>
    <li> Have not had it too long so I can not say how long it will last, but it feels great and does a great job.</li>
    <li> We looked everywhere for these.  Good price and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Do what they are suppose to</li>
    <li> I found this group of brushes to be a nice find and a nice deal! They are slightly larger then many Massage Brushes of others, giving you more coverage by the stroke. I also like the decent quality in the plastic material. I would have gave it a 5 star but, the bristles are a little too sharp and may irritate or scratch the scalp if applied various strong strokes.</li>
    <li> THIS is the best product  everyone should have one .  I recommend this very highly I cannot be without mine  I took mine to my beauty salon.  I hope they buy them to use on all of their clients</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of shower massage brushes and none match the Century style and effectiveness. I have one that is probably 20 years old and needed to be replaced and could not find it anywhere. Only Amazon had it and what a bargain on on a package of six.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these combs for 10 years.  So was glad to finally find them on the internet.</li>
    <li> I have used these forever...and they are becoming more difficult to find. Perfect for using in the shower with conditioner to make hair smooth and detangle while it stimulates your scalp.</li>
