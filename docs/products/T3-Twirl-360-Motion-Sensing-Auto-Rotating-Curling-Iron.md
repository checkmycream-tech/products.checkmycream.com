      <li>Even though I received it free for a review I think if one is paying this price it should be easier to use.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t burn your hand, but I don&#x27;t find that very useful.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use, and heated quickly.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to receive and try this because I already own a T3 product I love, the Veloce Dryer, which I&#x27;ve had for nearly 3 years and love just as much as the day I got it.  </li>
      <li>This product was supposed to be easy to use by both experienced and inexperienced alike.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to try this newest offering from</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s high cost, but ther are more inexpensive curlers on the market.  </li>
      <li>Very highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>Because of this I already went into trying this product with an understanding of why T3 products command such a high price - they have great longevity, are well designed and help style your hair quickly while keeping it feeling and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>definitely like the 9 foot power cord that swivels very easily and freely in any direction.</li>

      <li>but once I had my hair sectioned out with alligator hair clips as I normally would and started working with 1 to 1 1/2 inch sections of hair I found it surprisingly easy.  </li>
      <li>The most unique feature is the automatic rotating barrel, which can be used at two different speeds.&lt;br</li>
      <li>curling iron gets hot and does so quickly.  </li>
      <li>The iron  heated quickly and I could curl a fair amount of thick hair in a quick time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I found the T3 Micro Twirl 360 Motion-sensing Auto-Rotating Curling Iron easy to use. It heats quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair which is extremely hard to curl. Many curling irons can&#x27;t even grip my hair because it&#x27;s so fine. My hair will slide out of the clamp.  Very frustrating. Because my hair is hard to curl &amp; this barrel is large (my hair curls better with a 3/4\\&quot; barrel or smaller), I curled small sections at a time. It didn&#x27;t matter how small of a section I used, the T3 held on to it &amp; didn&#x27;t let it slip through the clamp. That&#x27;s impressive...well, I think it is.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also impressive that I didn&#x27;t have any problems using this curling iron...there was no learning curve for me.  Of course, I read the directions first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the T3 with 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel curl my hard to curl hair?&lt;br /&gt;Not really. I got some very, very large loose curls though. They didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;The barrel is just too big &amp; my hair is very hard to curl. I know everyone loves beachy waves these days so these large barrels are popular. I get beachy waves using a 3/4\\&quot; barrel. I don&#x27;t know if the T3 comes in other sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I like this curling iron a lot &amp; think it would ideal for me with a smaller barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used curling irons for 30+ years, and this is the heaviest one ever (approx. 13.7oz).  If you have arthritis in your hands, fingers or wrist problems, etc., the T3 might be too heavy for you. Also, when it rotates the clamp lever might be hard to find, depending on where it ends up. I panicked a couple times when I couldn&#x27;t find the lever. The instructions explain how to recenter the lever. It&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;--5 Heat settings from 260° - 410°F. The temperatures aren&#x27;t marked, but are designated by small LED lights in a vertical line.

    <li> I finally figured it out. When reading other reviews on this product on various sites I found that a common complaint was that the curls don&#x27;t &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it I did my usual wash and blow out. The following morning I wanted to add some curls. I definitely had trouble figuring out the right way to use this, there is a learning curve! I&#x27;m a bit clumsy and I burnt my hair and dropped it and got all confused at first. After a few tries I got better. By the end hair was completely glam! I loved it! Until...on the 20 minute car ride to work I noticed my hair starting to go limp. No curls. About an hour later it was straight. I was really upset, this is not a cheap item! I tried it again later and had the same experience. This made me MAD.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted so much to like it, it&#x27;s a beautiful iron and such neat technology! It looks fabulous in my bathroom. So I stuck it out.&lt;br /&gt;3 days ago I let my hair (naturally wavy, thin, puffy, middle of the back length hair) air dry and I gave the iron another shot. PERFECTION. I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days or used the iron since and I still have big, sexy waves. I&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;So, there&#x27;s the secret: DON&#x27;T BLOW DRY BEFOREHAND! :)</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and saying that I flat iron my hair most of the time.  I went all out on this curling iron because I have had T3 items that have lasted forever and were of great quality.  This item broke just out of the 30 day range by about 4 days.  Since I only use a curling iron for special occasions, this was used maybe 5 times and the clip holding the hair broke completely off.  When I called the company, I was told that it was probably a knock off so I gave the customer service person my serial number.  I was told by customer service that they would research the serial number to see where the item was bought (since it was a gift, I had no idea where the item was bought.)  Honestly, I know how much was spent on this item and I am seriously upset about such an item that cost so very much broke that easily.  Save your money girls and find a more reasonable curling iron.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to LOVE this product but after a few uses it is in the like box.  While the idea of it is great there is way too much going on with the two buttons on the product.  The power button controls the power, temperature setting and speed of the motor.  There&#x27;s also only the LED lights but no indication of what speed setting you&#x27;re on for the motor.  I never could quite figure that all out.  The go button just controls the motor turning on or off but it kept landing in different spots making each curl an adventure in finding the go button.  I realize after reading some reviews that if you tap twice it goes &#x27;home&#x27; but again, lots of tapping on one button for multiple things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the curls didn&#x27;t hold at all, which was the other disappointing factor.  They were beautiful when fresh but even with hair spray, on air dried hair the curls dropped rather quickly.  The ends stayed curled and I had a bit of body left but not a lot and not what I was hoping to end up with.  Normally I have no issue with curls staying after they fall a bit but even on the highest setting these fell unusually quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while understandable, this sucker is quite heavy due to the motor.  You may not be twirling the iron like normal but it&#x27;s still hefty to use and a bit clunky due to the weight and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a decent iron but not one I&#x27;d highly recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> We have had the curling iron for a couple of weeks now. The T3 does make the process of curling your hair easier because it slowly spins so there is no need for your to turn your.  That being said, if you have been curling your hair for any length of time, you can expect the time to curl your hair to take longer.  The designer is beautiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron gets hot and does so quickly.  One issue I noticed is you sometime have to turn on the twist on to get the lights to be on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far no complaints but we are not seeing any better result with T3 vs our $35 curling iron.</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to be easy to use by both experienced and inexperienced alike.  I fall into the definitely inexperienced category so I hoped it would be as easy to use as the product page implied.  No---not for this hair klutz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the barrel is large, 1 3/4&amp;#34; (which was not stated on the product page when I picked it) so you will need at least shoulder length hair to use this item easily.  I would have liked a smaller diameter barrel, but I think I would have still had the same issues with the curling iron.  Almost every part of the construction of this item is good; the ceramic barrel definitely gets hot and the clamp holds the hair in place and the twirly-whirly part works like a charm with a simple motion of the wrist.  The stay-cool tip gets warmer than I would like and I even noticed the area you hold while styling gets pretty warm.  Several times I &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; the hair clamp release and almost panicked wondering how I would get my hair off the wand but then realized I could just take my finger off the &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; button and all would be well.  It helps if you press the &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; button before you put hair into the clamp so the &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; button and the clamp are centered with each other before you curl each portion of hair.  This appliance will give you long, bouncy curls but I have to say, it was not an easy appliance for me to use as a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the things which cause this to be a three star product for me.  There need to be actual buttons you can push to get the desired temperature you want the wand to be.  Not only are the temps not printed next to the buttons, it was also difficult for me to finally get the wand to only heat to the lowest temperature setting which is what I wanted.  If there are multiple users of this device, the default heat setting will always be from the previous setting.  Lots of users, lots of changing the temperature which can be frustrating.  Also, the barrel of this wand getsvery hot to the touch.  If you own one of those mesh gloves, use it until you become comfortable with this appliance so you might save yourself some burns to your fingers and palm.  In addition to this, that &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; button needs to stand up much more prominently from the barrel of the device so it is easier to find with your finger.  I spent loads of time groping around and missing the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably a better unit for women who already are familiar with other curling irons that give these big, long curls.  I think the learning curve is going to be pretty steep for me.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to trying this curling iron, however it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  The iron itself is quite nice looking...white with gold accents. It is quite heavy, I assume from the motor? If you purchase this, keep the instructions as it is not as easy to just plug in and use as a regular curling iron would be. First off, there is no temperature display, just small dots that indicate what temperature it&#x27;s set at.  You need to reference the directions as to what each dot means in terms of degrees.  The barrel can move slow or fast depending on how many times you hit the power switch.  The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; tip gets warm, but not hot. If you have a hot iron glove handy, I would wear it at least until you get used to this power curl design.  I burnt my finger badly on my first use. It did actually curl my hair, but no different than a less expensive wand.  It comes with a small heat mat to place your iron on.  Not impressed...stick to a regular curling iron or wand.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use a curling iron regularly for my long, frizzy hair so I was excited to try this newest offering from T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T3 Micro Twirl 360 features a Tourmaline Ceramic barrel, has 5 selectable levels of heat (from 260-410 degrees F), a 9 ft. swivel power cord, a cool-touch tip and a 1 1/4&amp;#34; diameter barrel. The most unique feature is the automatic rotating barrel, which can be used at two different speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very attractive white curling iron with pretty, copper colored accents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heated hair styling products, like curling irons and flat irons, that feature ceramic surfaces are much, much gentler on your hair than those with plain, metal surfaces. Ceramic also produces negative ions when heated which leave the hair significantly smoother and shinier. Tourmaline is a gem that, when crushed and integrated into ceramic plates and coatings, emits even more negative ions and leaves even damaged hair extremely smooth and shiny. If you&#x27;ve never used a tourmaline ceramic curling iron or wand, you&#x27;ll definitely notice a huge improvement over metal irons and wands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 1/4&amp;#34; barrel will produce large loose curls or waves and it&#x27;s really most effective for shoulder length hair or longer, IMO. My hair is several inches past my shoulders and is very frizzy/curly. This iron gives me smooth, large, loose curls that are shiny and last all day. If you have shorter hair, you likely won&#x27;t get any real curl because your hair won&#x27;t be long enough to wrap all the way around the barrel. However, my daughter used it on her bangs (which are short) and it made them very smooth and shiny and mostly straight, which was exactly what she wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need to read and keep the included user&#x27;s guide because the way you select and set the temperature and the way you select the barrel rotation speed is not very intuitive. There are only 5 unmarked LEDs on the barrel to indicate the temperature so you really need to refer to the user guide. However, once you&#x27;ve done it a few times, it&#x27;s easy to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron defaults to 390 degrees on first use, which is indicated by 4 of the LEDs being lit. After that, the iron will default to whatever temperature you selected during the last use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the iron, plug it in and then press the Power &amp; Temperature button once quickly. That selects slow barrel rotation speed and heats the barrel up to 390 degrees F (first use) or whatever temp was selected during the last use. The LEDs will cascade up and down while heating up and will then stay solidly lit when the iron is fully heated and ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to change the temperature, wait until the iron is fully heated and then double click the Power &amp; Temperature button. Then you can click through til you select the temperature you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating barrel takes some getting used to but now that I have the hang of it, I really like it. All you have to do is clamp the end of your hair on the barrel and then press (and hold) the GO button located just beneath the clamp lever as you turn your wrist toward the direction you want the barrel to rotate. The iron then rotates and curls your hair toward your head. Take your finger off of the GO button to stop rotation. Wait for a few seconds for the heat to create the curl and then press the clamp lever to release the curl. Start with the low rotation speed until you get used to using the feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the clamp is very nice and definitely holds even small locks of hair securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue with using the barrel rotation feature is that the GO button will rotate, too, and so your finger can&#x27;t automatically find it for the next curl because it&#x27;s in a different place. The solution is to double click the GO button before starting each new curl. That makes the GO button rotate back into its original position under the clamp lever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like the 9 foot power cord that swivels very easily and freely in any direction. It makes it much easier if your plug is not near your mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T3 also included a small heat proof pad to set your hot iron on between curls or to cool down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an inexpensive styling tool but it is made of top quality materials. For someone with longer hair who uses an iron on a daily basis, this is a very nice tool because the ceramic tourmaline barrel is less damaging to your hair. If it&#x27;s within your budget, it&#x27;s worthy of consideration.ivels very easily and freely in any direction.

    <li> I was pretty skeptical about this curling iron, but I&#x27;m so happy I gave it a try. I am so amazed at the technology that we are able to use today! This makes curling your hair as easy as a flick of the wrist. I did my entire head in just a few minutes, without any back pain like I usually get from holding my arms up for so long. Very highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> The Twirl 360 motion sensing gyrospcopic technology senses hand movement and rotates in its&#x27; direction in order to make curls.  The Twirl&#x27;s ceramic frame pumps out ionic, infrared heat that generates moisture. The iron has SinglePass technology with 5 heat settings up to 410ºF and 2 speeds.  The iron also has an Ergonomic Design, a 360° Swivel Cord and comes complete with a 2-Year Warranty.  Unfortunately, the iron is a bit heavy (1.8 pounds).</li>
    <li> I love this.  I will never buy a non ceramic iron again.  I have long, thick hair, about three inches below my shoulder (It takes over 15 minutes to dry with a blow dryer). The iron  heated quickly and I could curl a fair amount of thick hair in a quick time.  In less than five minutes I had my hair just the way I like it with heat rollers, only those don&#x27;t curl evenly.  The roll function worked great, but it takes some getting used to.  You have to make sure you don&#x27;t get other hair tangled up while it rolls up. It comes with a hot pad so you don&#x27;t burn your hand, but I don&#x27;t find that very useful.  The tip did get fairly hot which surprised me a little.    I would recommend this product, I liked the large size of the barrel.  It was easy to use, and heated quickly.  While this brand of products is of high quality, I am thinking this would really just be beneficial to someone that styles hair all day long, but I am thrilled with it for every day use.  Pros:  Ceramic barrel Size Even heating of hair.  Less than 30 seconds for strand to curl. Heats up in seconds Electric roll function was nice and easy.  Cons:  I don&#x27;t really understand the heat/function buttons, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to change the functionality of it. Price  I will update my review as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> T3 Micro Twirl 360 Motion-Sensing Auto-Rotating Curling Iron, 33 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats Up very quick, makes hair feel smooth &amp; silky, gets very hot with five heat settings, definitely Professional Salon Quality. Automatically rotates in the direction you want just by the way you wrap the hair. Curls look long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fairly expensive, but working in a salon, its tools such as these that save you time and offers great curls for your clients. You get results very fast. Like any new tool being used in the Professional Cosmetologist field, there is a learning curve involved. But once mastered, you&#x27;ll love this new style of curling iron.</li>
    <li> I am not dexterous with hair tools and have failed with countless manifestations of curlers, curling irons and blow dryers. I have very long, fine straight hair. I would like some way to do my own hair for a special event and not have to go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this curling iron is the easiest to use I have ever tried. it heats up quickly, and automatically winds the hair with a touch of a button. I like that this product allows you to vary the heat settings although you need to hang on to the materials that came with it; there are no degree descriptions on the iron itself. What was remarkable to me was that I could achieve a curl without the telltale &amp;#34;you hair is burning&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With not much practice (and I repeat I have minimal hair skills) I was able to create a head full of curls and waves. That was with no setting product; I look forward to what I can do with a setting gel. For me, this is the best curling iron I have tried and the one I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive and try this because I already own a T3 product I love, the Veloce Dryer, which I&#x27;ve had for nearly 3 years and love just as much as the day I got it.  I&#x27;ve also had other T3 heat styling tools used on my hair in salons or by friends.  Because of this I already went into trying this product with an understanding of why T3 products command such a high price - they have great longevity, are well designed and help style your hair quickly while keeping it feeling and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lives up to my expectations and enhances how I feel about the T3 brand.  I had no idea that such a thing as a motion-sensing, auto-rotating curling iron existed but now that I do, I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the labeling on the iron itself is pretty minimal this is the kind of thing that can be a little confusing at first, but once you figure out how to adjust the settings and maneuver it, it becomes very, very easy.  Prior to trying this on myself I watched various online videos.  The first thing that struck me is that the technique commonly used with this iron is different than how I normally create loose curls in my long hair.  Generally I start an inch or so from my roots and work my way down, with this wand you start from the ends instead and rotate to the top.  I thought this might be an adjustment to get used to but once I had my hair sectioned out with alligator hair clips as I normally would and started working with 1 to 1 1/2 inch sections of hair I found it surprisingly easy.  Other than starting from the bottom vs. the top the motion is very similar to what I would normally do and I love that this iron does most of the job of rotating my hair for me and that it happens smoothly without any tangling, pulling or pain what so ever.  I could see where this feature wouldn&#x27;t be worth spending extra money for if you have short hair, but as someone who has long and very thick hair, it does seem to cut down on my curling time while still giving me great results.  I also like that there are two speeds available.  I&#x27;ve found the slower speed to be perfect as you&#x27;re getting used to this iron, but have a feeling I&#x27;ll be able to graduate to the faster speed with more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the auto-rotating feature is what sets this curling iron apart from a lot of others on the market it&#x27;s worth noting that it&#x27;s not the only feature this curling iron has going for it.  It also heats up incredibly quickly.  And most importantly, it seems to do a great job of adding curls or waves to hair while minimizing damage, which as someone with hair that is bleached blonde, this is a huge plus.  I love that there are five different heat settings and that I get perfect curls in a single pass.  It&#x27;s also very sleek looking.  The design is quite pretty and looks high end in person so this is an iron I don&#x27;t mind leaving out on my master bath counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about this curling iron.  It lives up to my high expectations of T3 and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> My wife has hair down to the middle of her back and she likes to have large curls. She likes the T3 Micro Twirl 360 Motion-Sensing Auto-Rotating Curling Iron, and she likes the barrel size. She was not thrilled with how complicated and unintuitive it was. Her biggest complaint was that she burned her hand twice, and she is used to using curling irons. That&#x27;s not good. She also said that she had a hard time with the Go button. The heat settings go from 260 degrees to 410 degrees (F). There are five settings, but only lights, nothing to tell you what temperature each setting is. It would be nice to have the temperatures noted at each light. The gyroscope seems to work well, and she likes having it rotate. Curls looked great, and depending on the humidity, lasted well enough. I would say in the times she has used it for when we have gone out, they lasted through the events and in the morning they were pretty much done. She has used it several times, and has now gotten used to it enough that she can use it comfortably, but there was a lot for her to get used to, especially since it rotates. That seems to be the biggest point of frustration for her.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is pretty good.  It heats quickly, it seems like it is of high quality material and build.  It senses your motion and then automatically turns for the perfect curl.  The main problem is the price.  Even though I received it free for a review I think if one is paying this price it should be easier to use.  It&#x27;s a little awkward and it takes a while to get use to.  I have had previous irons of this type and they were easier and more intuitive to use.  Overall it&#x27;s pretty good and definitely of high quality.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to try and we were decently impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried other, more gimmicky &amp;#34;rotating&amp;#34; irons before and found they didn&#x27;t curl very well, but this one seemed easy to use and actually worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told to inform readers that my wife&#x27;s hair had been unwashed for a day and that we weren&#x27;t using any product. Knowing that, what you see in the picture is what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron clamps onto hair, and when you turn your wrist, it automatically rotates your hair into a nice, tight curl in an instant... and they stick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, but expensive, curling iron.</li>
    <li> The T3 Micro Twirl Curling Iron works well and does the job.  It takes a little getting used to, as it turns as you use it with &amp;#34;motion sensing.&amp;#34;  The iron evenly heats and does a nice job on hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it surpasses other curling irons I&#x27;ve used for far less money.  The results are basically the same.  The price is incredibly high, even outrageous.  It works fine, but I can&#x27;t see anyone except Donald Trump buying this.  It would work great on that thing on the top of his head, and he can afford it.</li>
    <li> I have T3 products and I love them but I couldn&#x27;t manage this one.  Hope to return it.</li>
    <li> Hello. My unit does not turn on. I have tried multiple sockets and it just won&#x27;t turn on. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I paid so much money for this !</li>
    <li> Easily the most ergonomic curling iron I have used. Multiple speed and heat settings are a plus. One drawback is that it needs to be plugged in, via it&#x27;s nine foot cord, making it not as convenient as it could be, if truly portable. It&#x27;s pretty heavy, white with copper/brass  highlights. The advanced technology may make it worth it&#x27;s high cost, but ther are more inexpensive curlers on the market.  Great if you want to splurge or treat a loved one.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a great curling iron for awhile. This item really excited me when I was reading the Amazon page about it. When it arrived, I was immediately disappointed. The curling iron is HUGE and really, really heavy. I have slight carpal tunnel syndrome in my dominant (right) wrist and hand. I still type a lot daily and can do most things without issues. However, holding this curling iron for a few minutes kills my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still pushed through and curled my hair with it. It was difficult for me to maneuver because the curling iron was so large. It took me forever because I was afraid that I was going to burn myself. I almost did once or twice. After a little while, I settled for just a few curls and brushed them out to make them blend. This curling iron does work, it is just too big and heavy for me to use. Therefore, I am going to give it three stars. I unfortunately can not recommend this product.</li>
