      <li>being said, it isn&#x27;t what we were looking for for us, but if you like a clean, the-washing-machine-just-finished&lt;br /&gt;type of scent, then you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a floral/spice, but in a masculine way.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good cologne. I bought it for my 14/15 year old brother, he was meh on it but when I put it on my gf loved it. Sooooo I think it is a bit more sophisticated scent.</li>
    <li> Antoino Banderas Seduction In Black for Men Eau-de-Toilette Spray,...&lt;br /&gt;ANTONIO BANDERAS  excelente perfume. original buen precio y muy rapido envio</li>
    <li> Comprado como regalo de cumpleaños a mi esposo y le encantó. Aroma perdura y a recibido comentarios positivos. Ya he comprado otro para navidad.</li>
    <li> Nice product, good smell, it was a gift for my father and boyfriend and they just love it</li>
    <li> This is a sexy scent for a man. Women and men alike go bananas when they smell this on my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Sexy! Sexy! Sexy!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a daily cologne because it was cheap, turns out it was better than i thought, endless compliments, good lasting power and it just smells great, can&#x27;t go wrong to be honest.  I have other top of the line colognes and this competes with them no problem</li>
    <li> Perfect ,, sweet, sexy, smooth, balance between notes... Not so many high notes,  perfect for a date...</li>
    <li> I bought this without testing it, as a holiday gift for my husband.  It turned out to be a good choice!  It has a deep - but not too strong to be overwhelming - very sexy, manly scent.  It&#x27;s kind of a floral/spice, but in a masculine way.  The black bottle and packaging is nice too!</li>
    <li> My husband wears this cologne. Everyone always ask him what he is wearing.  This will cause the women to beat the door down.</li>
    <li> So, this is my first cologne review and purchase on Amazon. I&#x27;m not disappointed; I know a lot of people have received fake frags off Amazon. Lucky me, I got recieved an authentic one. So, before I review the cologne itself here&#x27;s a few tips to know if yours is an authentic, first; instead of buying from other merchants buy it off Amazon itself instead, that way even if you got a fake, you can get a refund. Second, once you receive the cologne, there should be a code of numbers somewhere on the box and the cologne itself, mine is five numbers above the barcode yours could be different. If the number on the cologne matches with the box, congratulations you have an authentic frag. Third, go to checkcosmetic.net to check the shelf life, enter the code of the bottle or box in and it should tell you when it was manufactured. People usually say the average shelf life of a cologne is 3 years, if it&#x27;s less than 3 years your cologne is not expired. I hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So onto the cologne, my nose doesn&#x27;t pick off the notes and I haven&#x27;t \\&quot;worn\\&quot; it yet but I did a test spray on my arm. It smells great, it starts off as a fresh black oriental smell, keeping that mysterious black masculine feel to it but fresh then after maybe half an hour it changes to a sweet masculine smell, it doesn&#x27;t overdo it in fact it lures you in; I guess that&#x27;s where seduction comes in? Sillage depending on the areas you spray it could be average, to almost average. Keep in mind that I only sprayed once on my arm so it might be better on a different area or if you spray on multiple places. Longevity it&#x27;s very good in that department, the scent lasted 8 hours with one spray on the arm. And even after I took a shower, there was still a very small lingering faint scent on my arm that I tested which the other I didn&#x27;t spray did not have. All-in-all it&#x27;s a good buy and I plan to purchase from Amazon again. Now, where would I use this cologne? I would say the ideal place or setting would be on a date, the lure this scent pulls off makes it ideal in a date situation. It&#x27;s not a loud scent but if anyone gets close enough, they might be lured in by this frag. 4.8/5 due the sillage but since it might be because of one spray to the arm and the lure, I decided to give it a 5/5.</li>
    <li> The reason i opted for this cologne in the first place was because i was searching for a replacement for Baryshnikov that got discontinued a few years ago for unexplainable reasons. The notes listed were some what similar to Baryshnikov&#x27;s so i thought I&#x27;ll give it a shot. Not only does it not smell like Baryshnikov, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all. Let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I don&#x27;t like strong smelling colognes and am all for subtlety when it comes to mens fragrances. However, i either got duped with a fake bottle or this thing is like water. It has very little to no smell and it evaporates within seconds. I haven&#x27;t tried a tester at a store so i can&#x27;t really compare the two but at the end of the day this thing was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Another nice scent that leaves the impression it costs considerably more than it does. Does it project like it&#x27;s higher end competition? No. But then I judge most things against scents from the House of Creed and Tom Ford&#x27;s private line. Yes, that&#x27;s unfair as they can cost nearly 10 times as much but when you wear them you know why. It&#x27;s the difference between an off-the-rack suit and one hand-tailored at Saville Row.</li>
    <li> spectacular fragrance. i love it</li>
    <li> You wear this perfume and it does not last long at all. The price is not bad but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3.4oz Antonio banderas cologne spray for a price you really can&#x27;t beat.  Smells just like the first bottle i purchased and it arrived as scheduled!  This was the first time i place an order from perfumania and I will definitely order from them again! I can only hope my next experience will run as smoothly and as solid as the first!</li>
    <li> I got this for him for his birthday and he loved it! It has this nice smell! It drive me crazy   Like its a sexy smell idk it just smell really good! Excellent price I would buy it here again. Shipment was like 6 days! Buy this for your bf, brother, yourself   It smell really really good!</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance in a larger size -- I had purchased a small 2.5 oz bottle and every woman that I encountered was mesmerized by its smell - including nurses when I was hospitalized around t  Thanksgiving.  It is subtle but is a real attractant.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to be the same as before.</li>
    <li> I was shopping for new cologne with my fianc&amp;eacute; and we came across this, and to be honest - I only tried it on because it was Antonio Banderas and he is super suave. We both really liked the smell and it was not over powering (nothing like the teenage Ambercrombie type colognes). I like that it is a unique smell that is pleasant, so you don&#x27;t smell like every other guy out there. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne. No it&#x27;s not Gucci or Hana Mori. It does smell great on him. Great smell for a little bit of money.</li>
    <li> I have used this spray for couple of years now. I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance. It&#x27;s mild and not at all overwhelming and yet durable and long lasting. I find the scent very pleasing and I think you will to guys. Most importantly, the ladies will enjoy it more:) The price point is, as well, a nice enticement. I just started on my third bottle and the scent is consistent from seller to seller. This is the product for me.  cbrstrks</li>
    <li> Perfect for the night</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase and the product I come in ideal conditions, and as is as the pedi I did not have problems</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, along with Blue Seduction, because it is one of his favorite scents! We both can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> Great price . Great shipping</li>
    <li> One of my favorite&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Not too shabby..!!  Smells great and I believe, very underrated.  Seduction Black is a nicely done blend of amber, cardamom, musk, nutmeg, and tonka bean notes in which the combination is very easy on the nose.  I was pleasantly surprised this morning.  While the projection/sillage is within arm&#x27;s length distance, the longevity performance lasted most of the day and still solid on clothing.  As noted in some previous reviews, I am not a fan of celebrity fragrances, but this one I might hang on to.. Probably geared more toward night time wear in fall or winter, Black is sufficiently &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; to allow wear to most events and during most times of the year.  The &amp;#34;price is right&amp;#34; for the novice collector to add to their collection.  For the more experienced &amp;#34;frag head&amp;#34;, take a pass on Black unless you are &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; and need a fragrance - in that case, I can recommend adding to your collection.  Final tally for Black is 3.9 stars out of 5 stars.  Black is a solid &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;, but fails to carry the &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to achieve &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; status.  Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great fragrance</li>
    <li> Good afternoon, it really was a pleasure doing business with your company in the future I hope to continue doing business with you. Excellent product. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> The product arrived just on time for Christmas. My boyfriend loved the smell as did I. Great deal! I shopped around for a better one and this was the best!</li>
    <li> nice scent, but could be a bit stronger. it stays on my clothes long enough, would definitely buy again. great price.</li>
    <li> great for the price ilove it the ladies love it cant go wrong a must buy in my eyes got</li>
    <li> Last Xmas I purchased myself a Banderas gift set containing a 1oz. EDT of both Blue&lt;br /&gt;Seduction and Black Seduction for only $20.  It was a little pre-xmas gift for myself and what a great purchase it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later I am just finishing the Black Seduction (as I generally rotate 12 different fragrances), and my sentiments on it are this:  I have received numerous compliments over the year, it smells great, with masculinely sweet, tempered notes of dark fruits and musk, and it was a great deal for basically only $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well-blended.... however, I&#x27;ll be honest and admit it&#x27;s lasting power is a bit less than average and sillage is only decent for the first 30 minutes in my extensive experience with this fragrance.  So everytime I used it I refreshed after each 3-5 hours, otherwise I&#x27;d probably still have 1/3-1/2 of a bottle left.  I don&#x27;t really mind because I believe the compliments came from people detecting the fragrance due to my extra applications.  That&#x27;s another positive of this scent:  it&#x27;s non-offensive even with a heavier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I enjoy using many different fragrances and probably won&#x27;t re-purchase unless I can get it for a good deal.  The 1oz normally retails for 20-25$, which I wouldn&#x27;t pay, but I&#x27;ll consider revisiting it if the price is right.  If you&#x27;ve never tried this one, it&#x27;s a winner, and I would wager you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Be sure to continue the avalabity of this product!! It is by far the best on the market today. Time and trial tested, year after year, compliment after compliment...wow what is that cologne your wearing!!!</li>

    <li> Saw the 1.7 bottle at Ross for 10 bucks and picked it up. I&#x27;m glad I did! It has a manly blackberry type sent to it. It projects very well and last a long time. It&#x27;s nothing I would wear everyday though. Any time I take my lady out on the town though I&#x27;m sure to wear it.</li>
    <li> i tried it about a year ago its one of me n my girlfriends favorites gotta have this in your colonge collection</li>
    <li> very good scent, very clean and elegant and sexy !!!! antonio has a a good line of colognes. Keep it up</li>

    <li> I love this cologne . So when my boyfriend and I began dating , I unknowingly bought him this cologne almost 6 years ago . We both loved the smell, and this price is great .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth buying .</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I expected a fragrance that distinguish me from the other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Es exactamente lo que esperaba una fragancia que me distinguiera entre los demas</li>
    <li> This item is very good. Thanks!</li>
    <li> smells amazing. my gf loves this smell</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Black\\&quot; in the fragrance world means dark and mysterious, powerful and noticeable. This one does not really meet that definition.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, in fact, it smells pretty good, but is nothing really astounding.  It is sweet and mildly floral, with tones of, I believe, black currant (perhaps this is the \\&quot;black\\&quot;).  It is an acceptable everyday cologne which most will probably like, because it isn&#x27;t offensive.  It&#x27;s sweetness will make women, if not like it, not be offended by it.  Although I think many women will like it.&lt;br /&gt;So why 3 stars?  If it were expensive, it would be lower.  As I said, it really smells like at least 2 other EDTs that are more expensive-- Polo Black and Dior&#x27;s Aqua Fahrenheit.  For this, as a slightly less complex and impressive version of more expensive scents that others are happy with, it does it&#x27;s job pretty well.  Where it falls short is in the \\&quot;special\\&quot; category; you might smell this anywhere and not really go \\&quot;Ooh...I like that\\&quot;.  This is neither a corvette, or a ferrari, but rather a customized honda civic--nice because it is good for it&#x27;s price, but c&#x27;mon--it isn&#x27;t expensive and never can mimic other&#x27;s performance OR gravitas.</li>
    <li> Very good perfume to buy it for the day and is excellent is Adacta body very well and last long. I am very happy with this seller because I see that one reailice my purchase both days I get my perfume. recommended</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. The recipient is quite happy with the fragrance, though he said the smell fades too soon</li>
    <li> After about 3-4 uses the Pump Broke off and doesn&#x27;t work right...  And now leaks when I try to get some out, Cheap....</li>
    <li> Very good perfume looks like really expensive one i can compare this with gucci or cartier quality ,you have to try it...</li>
    <li> This one of those rare finds. Saw it at the store once and thought I&#x27;d try it out! I&#x27;m not sure what they put in it, but damn! did they give it the right name... I tell you! ;)&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I&#x27;m not the only one who loved the perfume!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, A new and different product to be used personally, highly recommended to buy again in this store. Tankyou ok</li>
    <li> I love a man who smells good!  We have no decent stores or malls in our area, which is why I often shop online.&lt;br /&gt;So, I had never smelled this one before. I decided to take a chance, since it had pretty decent reviews,&lt;br /&gt;and of course, a great looking bottle! LOL  It was a fair value here on Amazon, so it was worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Our former favorite men&#x27;s cologne was Lagerfeld&#x27;s [[ASIN:B000C214OW Photo By Karl Lagerfeld For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces]], but they have changed the formula on that one, and we didn&#x27;t much&lt;br /&gt;care for how light that fragrance is now - it&#x27;s gone within the hour after putting it on. It is like they have weakened it beyond&lt;br /&gt;belief for reasons unknown. So, I&#x27;ve been searching online for a new scent. Not an easy task, I might add, since I can&#x27;t smell&lt;br /&gt;them. I have been reading reviews and fragrance layers to get an idea of what might be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received our order very quickly and in great shape. It was obviously fresh stuff, so that was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been wearing it all week now, and here is my take on this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very fresh and clean, in a non-soapy, just-showered way. I hope that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell like soap or shampoo, but smells like fresh laundry, perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, only one person has mentioned the new fragrance to him at work, and that was a guy, so not so sure about the&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;sexy\\&quot; qualities of this one!  Ha ha! It does seem to stay for a few hours, but by the end of the day, you can&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;smell anything except on the collar of his shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?  Both my husband and I vote nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While good, it isn&#x27;t great, and doesn&#x27;t create that \\&quot;who is that hunk\\&quot; sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I realize everyone is different, and skin oils, even medications taken can affect how a scent smells on an individual.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it isn&#x27;t what we were looking for for us, but if you like a clean, the-washing-machine-just-finished&lt;br /&gt;type of scent, then you&#x27;ll like this one. We&#x27;ll keep looking for something a little more to our liking.just-finished&lt;br /&gt;type of scent, then you&#x27;ll like this one. We&#x27;ll keep looking for something a little more to our liking.</li>
    <li> One of the worst dupes ever ! even if you pour whole bottle you will not get the fragrance. i read the reviews but failed to understand this product is so much a waste, its highly adulterated, not original product for sure as I have used original and just a drop is enough for . Not sure why Amazon is continuing with such sellers !!</li>
    <li> Mild smell which i kind of like. I dont like smelly perfumes like the one kids wear. This smells more mature and really mild.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He loves the scent. Apparently, the girls do too.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love it</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. A very long time looking for them and finally found on Amazon. The price is good. 100% original. Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband and he really likes it and I do too.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend</li>
    <li> Thank you received the product in good condition</li>
    <li> I was just browsing and came across this advertisement. I never ordered cologne online. But the previous reviews were encouraging. I placed my order, recevied a notification on when the product was to arrive within 48 hours. I was greatly impressed. The scent is excellent.</li>
    <li> Gift recipient loved it and asked for more when it ran out. I love the scent, too. Looks like this will be a regularly repeated purchase for our household!</li>
    <li> This EDT was my favorite but after awhile I change my preference but from time to time its a good product and it last longer maybe about 5-6 hours... and I have to apply it again after work.</li>
    <li> I tried this spray first time and I like it... Moreover, it is allowed for air travel. This spray is good buy!</li>
    <li> this is for a gift is very good, what I liked most was the price they recommend is a soft, pleasant scent to any skin type, very good!</li>
    <li> antonio banderas smells like a girl</li>
