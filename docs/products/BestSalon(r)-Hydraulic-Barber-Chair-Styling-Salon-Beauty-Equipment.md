<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this product in a new salon I have opened.  It seems to be a nice chair.  My only problem with this chair is it seems to be more stiff in turning.  I am hoping with use it will loosen up as I turn it more.</li>
    <li> This chair doable and very good I would recommend it to anyone the price is excellent</li>
    <li> Good hair. Good price.</li>
    <li> we recived a defaulty saoln chair. when we contacted the seller by phone the lady basicly blaimed us for the problem. we at first wanted to just exchange the product but were hassled about how much it was going to cost them to recall it.(not my problem i paid to have it shipped to me) so in the end we asked for our money back. still waiting on that  I WOULD NEVER DO BUISNESS WITH THIS VENDOR EVER!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great chair.  It was purchased for children and it is very comfortable and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I have had this chair one year and it  started leaking hydraulic fluid about a month ago. I have to put papertowels around where it is leaking or hair sticks to all the fluid leaking out of it. i imagine when all the fluid is gone it will stop working. you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a good chair and suits my needs well, though the piston only lifts the chair an extra 5.5 inches.  The problem I have with it is the the chemical smell that is off-gassing from the cushions.  It is very strong and unpleasant.  If it doesn&#x27;t go away, I will have to return the chair.  Made in China where restrictions on chemical uses are fewer.</li>
    <li> I wanted a barber chair and When I saw it here on amazon it looked good to buy. I was looking for a good nice chair and this one fits the description. Got it shipped quick works great for home use. Really easy to assemble I think it was only two steps. nice leather with chrome color. I would recommend. Its a good buy.</li>
    <li> great chair wider than most very happy</li>
    <li> My mother and myself are both stylists and we have family, friends, and neighbors that we work on from home. This chair has done the job!! my only minus is that is has the new smell that lingers for a while of plastic or rubber im not sure what it is but that would be my only complaint</li>
    <li> overall it looks great, price right</li>
    <li> The chair came with a rip in the seat right out of the box. So much for the claims of the chair being strong agaisnt tears and ripping. After a year of use the hydraulic part of the chair broke and it is unable to lift up anymore. It happened while a friend was in the chair who weighed maybe around 140lbs and I was lifting them up with the foot pedal. The footrest also comes off constantly even after being tighten with a wrench. Save your money and buy a chair that cost a little more and is more dependable. This one is going out for trash soon.</li>
    <li> Yey so happy! I just got my chair, its the best, brand new very easy to put together and the PRICE...love it what a great buy.  If your are looking for a good chair, you should go with this one...I Like :)</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a slightly posh, leatherette chair that was inexpensive. I was hesitant at first when buying, but I will be placing an order for a second chair this week. Great product. Solid construction for what it&#x27;s worth. This product was also delivered the same week my order was placed. Easy to assemble and very sturdy design.</li>
    <li> This is the first and last time I will buy anything off the web. I thought I was getting a good deal on this chair until I tried to put it together. When I put the chair together it didn&#x27;t work at all. The hydraulic pump didn&#x27;t work, the chair wouldn&#x27;t go up or down. The foot rest was scrapping on the floor, and it wobbled really bad. I would buy something from a store that you can take back right away!!</li>
    <li> it came in red. I had orderd it in black but its okay i can figure out a way to make it work</li>
    <li> So far so good. Great chair for the price and very easy to put together. Would recommend this chair for sure.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of these chairs, and 2 of them are defective and I&#x27;ve had them less than a year...</li>
    <li> this chair was a beast for me to put together,well the pump was..lol but its works great and have had no problems..</li>
    <li> This chair is wonderful,even tho one of my chairs had a hole in it when it was delievered. Thank You</li>
    <li> This chair does not raise high enough,and it is stiff trying to spin it. The back sits to straight up. I am very disapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> it just plain works.. and at a great price.  I am not sure what more you can ask for in a chair.</li>
    <li> This item met expectation, its sturdy and performs all the basic functions well. Good value for money, an excellent item to start up with our to use as a second chair</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price. Strong smell but is starting to fade. Comfortable but worried about the stability and the hydraulics. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Chair is well made however pump and the rotating is no to good</li>
    <li> I was very upset with this order first the chair was broke and the box was broke I believe this was ups that did it second I lost 25.00 from what I paid because I supposely had to pay half to send it back and all I wanted was a replacement chair I am very unhappy about this and don&#x27;t think ill be using amazon in the future Josefa Santiago</li>
    <li> The chair is wonderful! The back of the chair is a great height for cutting hair and the lift was a bonus compared to a regular chair.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the SHIPPING cost as much as the chair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this chair for my home based business. Great chair, easy to put together. Had it now for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This chair is horrible, that is why I included two \\&quot;VERY\\&quot;s in the review title. The construction is very, very poor, and the arm broke off in less than a week. The first one was replaced and the second chair also lost an arm after one week. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this chair.  I got tired of using my sewing chair for my customers. I was afraid they would damage it. This chair is a lot stronger and more convenient to have.</li>
    <li> Great construction and price. a little tricky to put to assemble because the bolts don&#x27;t like to line up in the seat. i do believe that happens with all furniture with big pad on it. goes up and down nicely and sturdy. but if you are really tall maybe look for another its for a average height cosmologist</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CHAIR...IM SO HAPPY WITH IT AND TOO THINK THAT I DIDNT WANT TO BUY IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REVIEWS ON IT BOY AM I HAPPY THAT I GOT IT ANYWAY AND THE BEST PART IS I DIDNT HAVE TO PAID ALOT OF MONEY FOR THIS GREAT STYLING CHAIR</li>
    <li> i bought if for my home shop. It is sturdy, easy to work with. i don&#x27;t feel like my posture is damaged buy working with it. customer-braider distance is minimized.</li>
    <li> A excellent chair everything we expected</li>
    <li> When I opened the box the footrest was missing. I have contacted the seller and will leave feedback on how the seller handles the situation.</li>
    <li> Very good chair, however does not work well for larger clients.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s client love the chair😊</li>
    <li> I have only had this chair for a few days, but it has worked out excellently thus far.  There is a slight smell that comes from the chair when it is first pulled from the box, but it just smells of manufacturing and disappears not too long after.</li>
    <li> these chairs I do not see lasting long they are like dorm style furniture very cheap feeling a complete waste of money ..u get what u pay for ususlly but in this case they suck</li>
    <li> We ordered the black chair as shown.  Got a burgandy chair.  They made me send a picture of the wrong chair after a week of emails...then never resolved.  I&#x27;m sending the chair back even though they haven&#x27;t authorized it and disputing the credit card charge...They should be kicked off of Amazon for such poor customer service.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this before with Amazon purchases and I would recommend NEVER buying from them.. False advertising...they don&#x27;t send you what you order...take two weeks to respond - then your word that you got the wrong thing isn&#x27;t good enough...you have to send a picture...what is that about....then they never respond or send you the correct item.  SAD!!!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for...&lt;br /&gt;I have had this chair less than a year in my salon, and all three of my stylists chairs are bending at the base.  The bolts holding the base together are stripped at the bottom and it&#x27;s like the metal is so cheap that it&#x27;s sinking in and slanting.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on something that doesn&#x27;t last even a year.</li>
    <li> This chair is comfortable, but it dont turn very good.  It feels like its stuck in half-lock mode. But the lock works great.</li>
    <li> I love this chair I have a home salon and it is very comfortable and it is very nice for price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great I&#x27;m happy that I have it.</li>
    <li> I have three more of these in my beauty salon. The are a nice chair, priced right. No complaints here!!</li>
    <li> The chair is exactly what i expected,its easy to put together, fast delivery without damage, it stylish, comfortable &amp; it doesnt take up alot of space. Its doesnt lift as high as i thought it would, but over all its a great chair for its price.</li>
    <li> Really nice, arrived in three days!! Little difficult to assemble :(</li>
    <li> In the process of preparing to opening up my own shop, Awsome product will share with other student cosmotologist upon graduation</li>
    <li> The chair is not what I thought The base of the chair is #! $@# I would never recommend this chair to any of my hair dresser friends.It said it could hold a lot of weight my 8yr old daughter flipped out of the chair .</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed. First one arrived with a damaged arm and the other was shipped outside of the US and on arrival it was also broken in the same place. Quality is poor for everyday use. No head rest and they are short.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any complains about this product ;)shipped quickly I am very enjoy to use this product thank you very much</li>
    <li> Love the new chairs. Also got reclining shampoo chairs at the same time. They look great in my salon. My stylist are very happy with the new equipment.</li>
    <li> I have been a hairdresser for 28 years, and I have always wanted to setup an area just for me, in my home.  A place for me to retreat to, a place to do my own hair and makeup.  This hydraulic chair is priced very well, great construction and most definitely professional.  I love my girly version of the man cave, all my friends enjoy the pampering and fun we have when we just experiment.  A grown up pj party!!!</li>
    <li> The chair was really nice looking, but doesn&#x27;t pump really well. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase another nor recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I need a good professional chair. alot of pieces but what i needed..</li>
    <li> it broke after a YEAR. started chipping on the base. and wobbling. i didnt even use it that much. maybe once a day. woudnt buy for commercial salon. maybe for house salon.</li>
    <li> This chair is made for a very short person. I wish it would raise higher. I see a bad back ache in my future. But the plus is it is comfortable for my clients. Oh it was also missing a screw and we had to go hunt a replacement part for it.</li>
    <li> Great for the price ,look great feel good .</li>
    <li> Great Job On Send My Chair Fast. I Love It! I Will Order In The future with you guys Again!!! Thanks! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t hard to put together at all.Loving my chair.</li>
    <li> The hydraulic foot lift on the chair is built backwards, instead of stepping on the lift to make the chair rise, you have to pull up on the lift. This is totally backwards from the way the chair is supposed to operate. I have the exact same chair in my shop and it works correctly, that&#x27;s how I know this is a defective chair. Please reach out to me so that we can remedy this situation.</li>
    <li> I Just opened  a Barber shop the chairs are ok nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> to small, came in look like a hundred pieces, was hard to put together, had to have someone else to put together</li>

    <li> This chair is just like the ones in a real salon.  My daughter uses it at home for her clients and it swivels goes up and down turns everything she needs it to do while performing her techinques.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend it to other customers,r family members and friends...&lt;br /&gt;The price was good also!  We&#x27;re pleased</li>
    <li> well, you get what you pay for. it was  very cheap. we&#x27;ll see how long it takes before it breaks.</li>
