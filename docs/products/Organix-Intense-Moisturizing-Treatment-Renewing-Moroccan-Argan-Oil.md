    <li> I have curly, snarly, easily-tangled hair. This is a great conditioner to use once in a while to deep condition my hair. It allows me to get a comb through it when I otherwise might not have been able to.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a treatment for my dry hair and decided to give this a try. I would use this item once a week and it made my hair so smooth. I used this along with the K-pak Reconstruct Shampoo/Condition and they worked well together. It really does, with time, make your hair healthier as long as you keep up with it. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I put a moisture mask on my hair almost every night and rinse it out in the morning. My hair is fine and was damaged from coloring. While the other masks I use are heavy, Organix is a light-weight mask yet it is still a great moisturizer. If your hair needs help, Organix is a great place to start.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it came fast and with plastic over it to ensure a spill free delivery. My only issue was how it came with nothing over the container once I opened it. (No seal)  It makes you wonder if its been opened which isn&#x27;t a great feeling. It smells good and my hair was really soft after which I loved.</li>
    <li> i have 3c natural hair. This conditioner works better than ANY that I&#x27;ve used before. Ive tried several from affordable to high priced. This conditioner leaves hair feeling soft for up untilmy next wash day.NO LIE. Try it. It ACTUALLY WORKS. It has good slip and makes styling hair so easy after rinsing. I&#x27;m not one for reviews but if I could help any other 3c naturals having a hard time finding a GREAT deep conditioner that&#x27;s affordable I will. Definitely reccomend</li>
    <li> treats my hair really nice. Grey hair is difficult to keep hydrated. A little goes a long ways.  I appreciate the leave in conditioning.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that will reduce snarls in long curly (frizzy) hair, this product works great.  For short curly hair, this helps the hair to stay the way you shape it without becoming frizzy.</li>
    <li> Works very well not oily, makes your hair very soft also your hands  and has a good clean smell. I would re-order</li>
    <li> Well, purchased this item ,because I&#x27;ve bought this before from Walgreens and they were out of this stuff. Anyways, I bought this from amazon and when I received it  Instead I got hydrating macadamia oil instead of marroccan argan oil in the blue jar. I didn&#x27;t complain to the company I deiced to keep it ,but I want order this again. This is why I gave it 3 stars because they didn&#x27;t send me the right stuff.</li>
    <li> This is probably the most insane thing ive seen on amazon in a while. You can buy this amazing product at a drug store or Wal-Mart for no more that $6.00. Don&#x27;t get ripped off! I give the product itself a 5 star rating because it really is amazing. I gave it one star because of the price!! rip off!!!!</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Does nothing and is full of chemicals.  Nothing organic or moisturizing about this at all.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair. My hair after conditioning  is not tangled and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely WONDERFUL! I love how it made my hair feel and when I used it to deep condition my hair (natural 4b). The smell is amazing and it lasted for about 4-5 days.
