      <li>first!They dont get hot and are very light weight.</li>
      <li>Does not get hot like most.</li>
      <li>plus...I was so excited to order this product...</li>
      <li>I would oil and clean it every use.</li>
      <li>It stays cool...</li>
      <li>That is true of any electric hair cutter, though.  </li>
      <li>Quick ship.</li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied with this purchase and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>i took good care of these clippers and they broke not to long after purchasing them.</li>
      <li>but this way is very hard to do and you almost never get it perfect.</li>
      <li>and they cut very close and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>and you will be golden.</li>
      <li>After you adjust your blade its good to put some of the provided blade oil and NEVER EVER wet the blade</li>
      <li>it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Nice cut on the back  of my husbands neck...  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as sharp or good as thought.</li>

      <li>so I know I bought the right thing.</li>
      <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t working right.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> if adjusted correctly these cut close and sharp. Very quiet and cool, these are the only trimmers i will use from now on.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Trimmer is perfect to use right out of the box. Just add some oil (which comes w/product) and you will be golden. Very light, Get&#x27;s hot but does not burn to touch. All in all Thank You Amazon reviewers because I was leaning towards Andis M3. Recommend to anyone trying to buy clippers at a lower rate. Don&#x27;t let the high prices (M3) fool you.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best liner ever. The main drawback is that the blade doesn&#x27;t come aligned properly and it is very hard to get it perfectly aligned. I have posted a picture which is also located at this link    [...]    [...]  [...]    This is how your blades should look this is called zero gap, they show you in videos that its easy to just adjust the screws while pressing it on a flat surface but this way is very hard to do and you almost never get it perfect. The best way to do it is to loosen the screw just a bit and align it by what you see or use a magnifying glass to get it perfect. Right out the box my Andis was cutting my skin and right away i knew it was the blade. Once you get the blade right the liner cuts perfect lines well worth the money i paid. After you adjust your blade its good to put some of the provided blade oil and NEVER EVER wet the blade NEVER i repeat NEVER wet the blade! Thanks Andis and THANK YOU AMAZON!!!</li>
    <li> This is a phenominal pair of trimmers. They cut very close, close enough to where it looks like I utilized a razor to bald my head. No nicking, tugging or burning of the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pulls the hair, I have to use 1 side to avoid pulling, one half gets very closely and the other half bearly cuts. Another stylist has it in sliver with the same problem...</li>
    <li> Bought specificaly for \\&quot;edge ups\\&quot;. Blades cut quite close, almost shave close. Does not get hot like most. The ease of taking of the blades as an assembly is a huge bonus. And they are still able to broken down further to replace individual blades. Been using daily and sometimes for a duration of time and have ZERO complaints. Very pleased with purchase. Recommend for anyone needing that \\&quot;fine line\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It works fine but its too sharp. It will scratch your skin all up. I recommend buying something else. I&#x27;m disappointed with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> After a long, hard search for an electric trimmer to replace both electric razor and safety razor, I decided to go with the Andis Inferno based on reviews on Amazon and in other locations.  I discarded warnings of it running hot because is is made by Andis and human nature being what it is, some people simply will not follow directions about where and how to oil things properly.      The trimmer warms slightly, not uncomfortably, and its temperature does not rise further, nor do the blades become uncomfortably hot.  I use it both for beard shaving (goodbye ingrown hairs) and outline/trimming. It shaves very close--(5 o&#x27;clock shadow length on a heavy beard) but I&#x27;ve experienced neither nicks nor cuts to the skin, although if one forgets to pull loose skin taut, for example, around the larynx, it is easy to abrade the skin. That is true of any electric hair cutter, though.  All in all (providing it lasts!--it&#x27;s not my first Andis so I have high hopes) I am completely satisfied with this purchase and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> this is a very good trimmer, I am a cosmetologist who works in a barber shop so we always need a good clipper and trimmers for tight cuts and catering to military its a must!  We normally order a different type of trimmers for the shop but I always have to be different so I wanted to try these trimmers, they are very light weight and they cut very close and smoothly.  any smoother would be with a razor! I have had them now for a week and have not had any problems with them,</li>
    <li> it gets warm, slightly warmer than body temp. Then it doesnt get warmer...ever! It stays cool...used it for 1 and a half hours straight never hot. quiet...very ergonomic.. feels great in your hands. It is light but has a good wieght to it and balance so that i can cut my hair aplombly.</li>
    <li> Great ... A lil adjustment to da blades n than u are good to go... Real quiet n easy to use</li>
    <li> First, let me describe my situation.  I&#x27;m mid thirties and pretty much bald on the crown of my head.  I&#x27;ve been using Andis brand trimmers to shave my head once a week for a few years now.  I bought this to replace a standard T outliner that I broke when I dropped it from my head to the tile floor in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second this trimmer touched my head I knew it wasn&#x27;t working right.  It didn&#x27;t cut at all and it pulled my hair something awful.  Just so I could confirm I wasn&#x27;t crazy I had my wife try and trim my neck hair with the item, the very thing it&#x27;s designed to do....outline!  But no, it wouldn&#x27;t even cut the hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big promoter of Andis products and this incident doesn&#x27;t change my view of them.  It could have very well been a defective unit.  I replaced it with the same trimmer I dropped and broke.</li>
    <li> They are the best liners I&#x27;ve used thus far--nice crisp line don&#x27;t hurt when u put them on your head and they come already to cut no adjustment needed</li>
    <li> This is possibly the most powerful trimmer out  on market .Quiet does NOT get hot CRISP lines.Very low price sharp trimmer blades.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when my Andis T-Outliners broke. The motor would buzz, but just wouldn&#x27;t move and I didn&#x27;t know how to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned because none of my friends have ever talked about the Superliner. Everyone always gets the grey Andis t-outliners and that made me worry.  But I am glad I made the switch.  I am not a barber, but use them strictly for personal use on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Superliner&#x27;s are lighter, quieter, don&#x27;t heat up as much, and smaller. The size really helps when traveling. I also am a big fan of the new look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming from the classic T-Outliners, this is a much welcomed upgrade.</li>
    <li> The paint for the red chips and comes off as a result of spraying cool care they are pretty weak use gtx liners or m3 for more professional power but these are good for kids and sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come sharp as I wanted them too but still great buy. Nice color also.. They are also very light weight. This is my second pair. First pair came with the exact settings I needed them at.</li>
    <li> My son purchased these for college and he loves them. He is also using them to cut some of his teammates hair with them.</li>
    <li> had it for only 1 year, used it once a week. I would oil and clean it every use. I had to already replaced the whole unit once due to the rotor defect and loud, and replaced the blade three times for $24 each. It will pull your hair to the point you just want to throw it out the window.</li>
    <li> Replaced and old pair with these and so far they out perform them in every way. Smooth edging, quiet, close cutting, easy to hold, longer cord,and  Andis reputation all make it my edger for years to come.</li>
    <li> Professional barbers are very selective when buying tools.  My husband loves these.  First of all, he is the only one in the salon with red trimmers.  If there was anything wrong with them he would have cried like a baby by now so I know I bought the right thing.</li>
    <li> I actually agreed with a lot of the positive points made by the other reviews, BUT there&#x27;s a catch ! When I first received them I absolutely loved them. they cut pretty sharp, they don&#x27;t heat up as fast and the shaving attachment to this date were the BEST I&#x27;ve used. I bought these clippers despite the fact one of my peers cut with these clippers and swore by them in the beginning, and cursed them over time. I thought maybe he did not take care of his clippers as well as I&#x27;ve learned to do for over 20 years. (Mind you we didn&#x27;t buy them at the same time or from the same place, nor do we have the same cutting style/habits)  DOWNSIDE is that after maybe a month or so, they went from running pretty quiet to literally sounding like a lawn mower. The spinning element got loose after a few weeks and they buzzed sloppily and no longer cut as dependably. I hate this because week one and two, I myself would&#x27;ve absolutely sworn by these clippers.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, but it seems as though the motor is weak!</li>
    <li> Not pleased with this item. Want cut. I always write good reviews. Not pleased with this item. It looks good. Only. I will change the blade to see if that will help. I&#x27;ll update late.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first buying this item, i read tons of reviews. I couldnt choose between wahl 5 star detailer or andis superliner. I cose andis superliner inferno, it came pretty fast, 3 days, i first used it on myself for an edge-up. And HOLY MUTHA****ER, THEY WORK GREAT, i had the sharpest edge up i had in years, it was better than a barber shop edge up.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It works great, easy to clean, doesnt get hot fast, lightweight, cheap, ships fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NONE!!</li>
    <li> Quick ship. Awesome product</li>
    <li> I am a veteran hairdresser of 40 years plus...I was so excited to order this product...(the word inferno got me)...I was willing to wait 2 months for it, instead of walking into a supply house (as I had to today), thinking I was getting a great product...Wow!!!!!What a disapointment...It edges terrific, but cutting and shaving is a no go.  AWFUL</li>
    <li> I am a professional barber.. So I ordered these for the house because I leave all my tools at the shop.. The first them I used them.. Nice cut on the back  of my husbands neck...  I love andis trimmers.. But not this one</li>
    <li> Not my first pair of superliners.  I just really wanted the red trimmer.  Doesn&#x27;t perform any different then the silver one I just love the color</li>
    <li> Gives good shape ups. Thanks !</li>
    <li> DIDNT HOLD UP TO WELL&lt;br /&gt;ALSO DIDNT LIKE OW YOU REMOVED THE HEAD IT PULLED HAIR ALOT AND PINCHED DEFF NOT A GOOD TRIMMER STICKING WITH THE REG ANDI&#x27;S TRIMMER FOR MY WORK</li>
    <li> i have been using andis products for a long time . i am not a barber but i do know how to cut hair. i took good care of these clippers and they broke not to long after purchasing them. the motor decided to start making a loud noise. i have yet to send them back for repair because i am constantly working but from what i know its covered under warranty. i never had an issue with andis before but this pisses me off. i have to make the time to send them back for repair and in the meantime i don&#x27;t have another set to use. i rated 2 star because of this. i will admit the clippers did cut well when they worked. also i have to say they were very quiet.</li>
    <li> It cuts the hair well, however it is not as close a cut as expected.</li>
    <li> Received product as described and it was zero-gapped.  This has become my primary shape-up tool.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using these clippers very light weight an doesn&#x27;t get hot an it has a detachable head which I have the other part for the shaving.</li>
    <li> when i first got the trimmers and used them they weren&#x27;t what i was expecting.It wasn&#x27;t as sharp or good as thought.Then i Zero gapped them...AND WOAHH!! it made a big change. Sharp,on point lines!Once you receive your superliners make sure you zero gap them first!They dont get hot and are very light weight. ITS WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
    <li> Finally got the close shave I&#x27;ve been looking for! After trying 3 others, this is the one that gave me very good results.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works perfectly for my hair.I love it and I would recommend it to all of my friends.Trimmer is the best for my hair.</li>
    <li> it is worth the money. and i got to say the best out there must buy. runs as hard as my andis mvp clippers. for so little they have a lot of power</li>
    <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product. It did not as close as I thought, I will stick with the t-outliners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional barber for over ten years used every price of equipment under the sun and these are pure junk didn&#x27;t cut out of the box and after trying to adjust them they still suck don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I bought these because I wanted to try and Andis product other than my Masters, everything else I own is wahl, I have 4 different coders and 2 edgers all wahl. I had these for 4 days and dropped them from chair to wood floor and it chipped the blade, bought a new blade fro 21 bucks and now it&#x27;s so loud I can&#x27;t even go around a clients ear because it&#x27;s so loud it vibrates their eardrums! Smh I literally sent it to Andis company to repair it, When it comes back in selling them. I&#x27;m sticking to wahls!</li>
    <li> It came a day earlier than expected and runs great. Having blown out my last pair, I still had all the attachments and just needed the machine.</li>
    <li> Blade became dull rather quickly.</li>
    <li> did not remove  hair.did not work the way it was suppose to pulled hair instead of cutting it this product does not work.I read 1 review where the customer realigen blades you shouldnt have fix product before you can use it.</li>
    <li> Adjusted correctly these are precise and cut effortlessly.  You will not be dissappointed.  There may be better but I haven&#x27;t tried them and apparently neither has my old barber.    M.P.M  The New Aira  [...]</li>
