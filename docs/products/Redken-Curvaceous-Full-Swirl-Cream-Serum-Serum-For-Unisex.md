      <li>While the Cream Serum seems to do a fairly good job of curl definition, it does not have the frizz control I am looking for.</li>

      <li>My husband loved this serum.</li>
      <li>The company that I purchased it from The Best Beauty Finds, very resonable!!!</li>

      <li>and I love this product!</li>
      <li>This product is the first I&#x27;ve used like it, it is wonderful for curly hair.</li>
      <li>It is just beautiful &amp; I did receive many compliments on how lovely my hair smelled.  </li>
      <li>&quot; Of course that was when there was no cream rinse or cream of any kind for hair, she would wash my hair in the sink and then rinse it with vinegar.</li>
      <li>Love it, good value compared to salon prices.</li>
      <li>I get nice curls without the stiffness.</li>
      <li>I have the kind of hair that can have frizz or a wave.</li>
      <li>So, I decided to try this out on my own.  </li>
      <li>I have tried lots of products for my curly hair both from the drug store &amp; from salons, this is by far the best.  </li>

      <li>It is by far the best product I have ever used on my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>With this product, if I put it in right after I wash my hair and DONT comb it, I have attractive spiral curls for the day.</li>
      <li>I have spiral curls, but my hair is very fine.</li>
      <li>works wonderful, my hair is straight as a board, this helps to keep a light curl in my hair</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t receive as many compliments for how my hair &#x27;looked&#x27; &amp; I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s more of what this product is supposed to do,besides smell nice.  </li>
      <li>Everything goes very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Love this line of products</li>
      <li>I love this serum.  </li>

      <li>I love this product as it gives definition to my wavy hair without weight or making it crusty.</li>
      <li>Seriously love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I loved Redken&#x27;s Fresh Curls Curl Refiner-</li>
      <li>Nothing in my hair would have been better.</li>
      <li>These two work together like magic.</li>
      <li>I also use it on dry hair with excellent results.</li>
      <li>This is a great line of products for naturally curly hair- manages and controls.</li>
      <li>Great for soft curls.</li>
      <li>It did a good job of keeping the frizz away, but by the end of the day it was very flaky.</li>
      <li>Not at all good for fine hair, as it this product is VERY DRYING.</li>
      <li>Too strongly scented is all I can say.  </li>
      <li>Gives fine hair body, too.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a perfectly fine combination of discount store products</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat it for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine, corkscrew curls/waves.</li>
      <li>Luckily I looked on Amazon and was delighted to see that I could purchase it for a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>This product, by the respected haircare company of Redken, whose products were used by many beauty salons I favored,  is intended for unisex use, for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair that needs to be tamed and elongated, for loose waves to spiral curls.  </li>
      <li>Plastering a huge mass on your head will leave you with the potato chip crunch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice lightweight product that really works.</li>
      <li>This is the one product I have had the most success with.  </li>
      <li>It smells like cheap men&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
      <li>I am now trying the Smooth Lock Stay Sleek by Redken.</li>
      <li>just so I could enjoy just washing and conditioning my hair and just letting it be</li>
      <li>Seems genuine.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair feeling light and without product, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>One more tip: this product works best if you let your hair dry naturally!</li>
      <li>This is a somewhat heavy but pleasant and nice smelling cream-serum, and my hair did develop waves after using.</li>
      <li>Love this product for my very curly hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>So far, I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I have the curly on top, the kind of wavy in back</li>
      <li>The manufacturers state that it will give the user the best of  both worlds with its formula that combines a balance of cream and serum with their patented Curl Memory Complex that includes sugar crystals,</li>
      <li>REDKEN CREAM SERUM CURVACEOUS FULL SWIRL, 5 OZ.  </li>
      <li>This product gives my hair volume and makes it look really piecey, which I love.</li>
      <li>If you have really curly hair and want a more relaxed look, this is probably for you.</li>
      <li>Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl was recommended to me by my hairdresser, but I think it was intended for a curlier hair type.</li>
      <li>Dries your hair and makes what was naturally beautiful curls into a matted mess.</li>
      <li>I acts pretty much like a mousse, and gives the hair that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, but as anyone with curly hair knows, most hair products will do that.  </li>
      <li>It was suggested to me by my stylist who also has curls but different kind.</li>
      <li>Imagine a fresh brillo pad.</li>
      <li>Delivery arrived quickly and exactly as ordered.</li>
      <li>Best combination of hold, softness, and lasting power that I&#x27;ve found for my tight, curly (and frizzy without any product) hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks guys!</li>
      <li>Firstly, I don’t like its fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Although to date nothing has come to replace it, this product comes pretty close.  </li>
      <li>The product claims to have some hair-helpful oil (&amp;#34;Moringa&amp;#34;), but actually among the top 5  </li>

    <li> Not as stiff as I wanted</li>
    <li> REDKEN CREAM SERUM CURVACEOUS FULL SWIRL, 5 OZ.  This product, by the respected haircare company of Redken, whose products were used by many beauty salons I favored,  is intended for unisex use, for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair that needs to be tamed and elongated, for loose waves to spiral curls.  The manufacturers state that it will give the user the best of  both worlds with its formula that combines a balance of cream and serum with their patented Curl Memory Complex that includes sugar crystals, Moringa oil and UV filter to seal in moisture  and definition  while locking out humidity for frizz control  and shiny hair. The manufacturer recommends it for daily use; apply a small amount to damp hair and work through from root to tip focusing on frizz and dry ends.  Diffuse or air dry; can also be used on dry hair for added control on ends; store in a cool, dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have regretted my curly frizzy hair all my life, and have spent many hours and dollars in various beauty salons trying to get it straightened, with results that included horrendously dry hair with breakage and oxidation.  My mother and other well-meaning people used always to tell me how many people wished they had curly hair, and got permanents to curl their hair.  I looked – politely, I hope—disbelieving.  But here in North Carolina, the American South, with long hot humid summers, as a young woman no longer, I decided the time had come to try to make my peace with the hair with which I was born.  So over the last few years, I have tried many products to try to preserve my small curls and prevent frizz.  When I saw a Redken trio of beauty aids for curly hair, this one in particular, with its eye-catching design, I remembered the hair salons that had used Redken products and decided to try it: the whole trio, in fact.  I have been disappointed in this trio of products.  Firstly, I don’t like its fragrance.  Then, I find that, though it does give me the small curls I want in my hair, my hair is not as shiny as some other products have made it.  Finally, I have found it just doesn’t hold long enough, I am lucky if it holds for a full day.  Other products have worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;•hair, my hair is not as shiny as some other products have made it.  Finally, I have found it just doesn’t hold long enough, I am lucky if it holds for a full day.  Other products have worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the fragrance of this product.  It is just beautiful &amp; I did receive many compliments on how lovely my hair smelled.  However, I didn&#x27;t receive as many compliments for how my hair &#x27;looked&#x27; &amp; I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s more of what this product is supposed to do,besides smell nice.  I have naturally curly hair that is normally light &amp; &#x27;fluffy&#x27; if you will.  This weighed it down when I applied it to damp hair - almost to the point of being &#x27;sticky&#x27; at times.  Now I live in Florida, so humidity might be a factor some of the time, but on the whole, it&#x27;s just too heavy a product for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;I found the product does work much better if you apply it to completely dry hair (&amp; only the ends).  You get the out of this world fragrance &amp; your hair isn&#x27;t as &#x27;weighed down&#x27; as when put on damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I&#x27;ll save it for when I want an epic scent on my hair - cost &amp; performance take it out the running for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Delivery arrived quickly and exactly as ordered. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it, good value compared to salon prices.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair.  Medium length. I have used numerous products over the years to try and achieve a fuller look. This is the one product I have had the most success with.  In addition to this, I spray my hair with Josie Moran&#x27;s Bohemian Waves spray.  These two work together like magic. This will NOT leave your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; if you use it sparingly. Plastering a huge mass on your head will leave you with the potato chip crunch. A nickel sized amount will work for shoulder length hair.  I do not rub this into my scalp.  I apply a small amount into my palm.  I rub for a few seconds in a circular motion to warm the product and then apply it to my fingertips. I flip my head over and touch my hair everywhere and scrunch. One more tip: this product works best if you let your hair dry naturally!</li>
    <li> It seems to be the best setting cream I&#x27;ve tried to date. And I don&#x27;t have curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would be like sunsilk. But I still have to use mousse with it and even then I prefer my other hair cream more.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to post anything but i really recommend this product to those people that are suffering of tiny, dry and fallen hair.&lt;br /&gt;it has helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It controls and makes my hair shine.  I have fine, corkscrew curls/waves.</li>
    <li> Best combination of hold, softness, and lasting power that I&#x27;ve found for my tight, curly (and frizzy without any product) hair.</li>
    <li> I have Naturally curly hair... Color treated. This products really make the curls come to life and keeps soft curls, not hard and yucky like other products. Love this line of products</li>
    <li> Third time doing business with these folks. Very satisfied. No problems. Everything goes very smoothly. Can be confident when dealing with this store.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair dresser and I have been using for many months..Quality product..good for my hair type!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product as it gives definition to my wavy hair without weight or making it crusty. It&#x27;s a nice lightweight product that really works. It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love it. My hairdresser used this on me. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to do the job, one squirt - I have short hair, and it can be reactivated with a little spritz of water from a spray bottle, or running wet hands through hair. It&#x27;s not stiff or hard, my hair still moves and it smells clean. This is my second can. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this every year during warmer weather when I never blow dry my hair. I am naturally curly and it has a surprisingly not crunchy feel, yet prevents frizz. I use it on my hair just blotted.</li>
    <li> After applying it  on towel-dryed hair, It looked pretty bad-sort of sticky fake looking thin strands of curls.(I have naturally soft curly hair.)  I figured it would equilibrate as my hair dried, as it was recommended by a friend. Looking at myself later in the mirror was an appalling experience-my hair looked brittle and dry and at the same time frizzy-exactly what the product claimed to overcome. Imagine a fresh brillo pad. That is what it looked like. My hair never looks that bad naturally. Nothing in my hair would have been better. The product claims to have some hair-helpful oil (&amp;#34;Moringa&amp;#34;), but actually among the top 5  listed ingredients are water, glycerin, butylene glycol, and denatured alcohol. Not at all good for fine hair, as it this product is VERY DRYING. There is even coumerin among the ingredients, aka a blood thinner used to kill RATs.  I am going to return it.  This product is toxic with respect to my mane.</li>
    <li> Holy Cow ! this is awesome!. Buy don&#x27;t think twice. Get it wherever you find it.</li>
    <li> I have accepted this product in place of the Redken Contour.  Although to date nothing has come to replace it, this product comes pretty close.  The company that I purchased it from The Best Beauty Finds, very resonable!!! very prompt at getting the order out to you. Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> Seriously love this product.  I get nice curls without the stiffness.</li>
    <li> works wonderful, my hair is straight as a board, this helps to keep a light curl in my hair</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and I LOVE this product!!! Just a little bit goes a long way. It keeps the curls in place without the stiffness. It&#x27;s a little on the strong side with the smell, but overall I would rate this product a 5 PLUS!!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have the kind of hair that can have frizz or a wave. With this product, if I put it in right after I wash my hair and DONT comb it, I have attractive spiral curls for the day. No frizz and a look I really like. I have used cheaper products that do a similar action, but nothing works as well as this.</li>
    <li> When I was searching for this product I read all of the reviews for this one and the other products in this line. The others said they dried your hair out and made it feel straw like. The reviews for this one were perfect. Well, sadly this product is just like the others in the line. Dries your hair and makes what was naturally beautiful curls into a matted mess.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for keeping the curl for many hours..The price was better than local stores and it ships to me.</li>
    <li> I got this to go along with the shampoo and conditioner set I also bought.  I acts pretty much like a mousse, and gives the hair that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, but as anyone with curly hair knows, most hair products will do that.  My biggest issue with this product is the smell.  It smells the same as the conditioner, which I&#x27;ve described before as &amp;#34;cheap men cologne&amp;#34;, so if you are sensitive to smells do not get this!  The smell does go away eventually after the hair is dry, but I don&#x27;t think I will be getting again, just based on the smell</li>
    <li> Got this for my girl friend and she says it works wonderful, and form what I have noticed it has her curly hair looking really good</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! I use it after washing my hair to get curls galore out of my somewhat frizzy, wavy hair. I also use it on dry hair with excellent results.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair when she styled it, and you know how your hair always looks its best after leaving the hairdresser?  So, I decided to try this out on my own.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this hair stuff does smell a little &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as one reviewer mentioned but I actually like the smell. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.  And a little seems to go a long way.  I do one pump and use it to &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; sections of my hair - especially the ends - and then apply a second pump when I scrunch.  I find that this product induces my hair to curl and my hair holds the curl throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering hair products from Amazon has always made me a little wary as it&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;authorized seller&amp;#34; (or I&#x27;m not sure it is) but I&#x27;ve been happy with this product.  Seems genuine.</li>
    <li> I threw it out! It was so sticky it felt like corn syurp. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair kinda stiff , have to be very careful how much you use, still trying to find the right amount to use. Was advertised as not making hair stiff.</li>
    <li> It works as a mousse/curl holder! I have spiral curls, but my hair is very fine. While voluminous, it is not thick. This product helps hold a style and the curl. I&#x27;ve only used it in the winter months so, I&#x27;ll have to update you on the summer humidity. So far, I am very pleased. I don&#x27;t like a lot of gunk in my hair and this product is not too heavy, but does the job.</li>
    <li> great price. great service</li>
    <li> It has alcohol or something...my hair looks stiff</li>
    <li> Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl was recommended to me by my hairdresser, but I think it was intended for a curlier hair type. It does tame the frizzies, but it also loosens the curls. If you have really curly hair and want a more relaxed look, this is probably for you. If you don&#x27;t have tight curls and want to keep the curl that you have, you might want to try another product.</li>
    <li> A must buy if you have curly hair. Manages the frizz and makes it &amp;uuml;ber soft. Use it often and is great for long thick hair.</li>
    <li> If you have a little natural curl in your hair, just squish this in and it really helps bring out the curls!</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly hair. It adds just a bit of curl definition and works great on frizz. The product is &amp;#34;swirled&amp;#34; to evenly dispense cream and serum. Unlike other swirled products I&#x27;ve had, this actually does dispense both evenly. You don&#x27;t have to worry about getting a handful of only one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this product to the mousse in this line, or any mousse in general. It leaves hair feeling light and without product, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for those on the &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method: This product has alcohol and dimethicone in it.</li>
    <li> This cream works very well and I really like it!</li>
    <li> Fast and as promised.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Soft curls.  Do keep it away from your roots though.  I have thick curly hair and I love this product!</li>
    <li> I really had bad luck with this product.  My hair is naturally curly but this product didn&#x27;t seem to help it curl up in any way that I wanted it to.  If my hair got wet or had to put up with humidity after initially drying, it would immediately frizz out and could not be tamed without washing it again. (I tried Argan oil with my flat iron). I am now trying the Smooth Lock Stay Sleek by Redken. My hair had much nicer curls and it seems to stay smoother for a longer time.</li>
    <li> I starting using this Redken Cream Serum, Curvaceous Full Swirl about a year ago, then all of a sudden I could not find it anywhere.  Luckily I looked on Amazon and was delighted to see that I could purchase it for a reasonable price.  This product works really well on curly hair to keep the frizz away.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came very quickly in good condition.  You don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I loved Redken&#x27;s Fresh Curls Curl Refiner-but of course, that has been discontinued now!  This product was recommended as a replacement.  While the Cream Serum seems to do a fairly good job of curl definition, it does not have the frizz control I am looking for. I could probably live with that by adding other products to it, BUT I really can&#x27;t get past the smell.  Usually odors don&#x27;t bother me, but this product&#x27;s odor is super strong and smells like a stinky men&#x27;s cologne to boot.  I certainly can&#x27;t wear any perfume or lotion when this is in my hair.  I think it will have to be returned.</li>
    <li> It controls my hair&#x27;s propensity to frizz and does not create that sticky, crunchy feeling that I&#x27;ve had with every other product I&#x27;ve tried (professional and over-the-counter). The smell is horrific. You&#x27;d think I put men&#x27;s cologne in my hair. That&#x27;s why I docked a star. The good news is that the smell dissipates in a minute or two.</li>
    <li> I like that I was able to find online at a very good price. I normally buy at JCPenny but they are always out and the price has gone up a lot for this product. I would highly recommend to my my family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> This product is the first I&#x27;ve used like it, it is wonderful for curly hair. I use it after I shampoo and condition my very curly and frizzy hair. I tried to rewrite the book on natural curly hair from the time I was a teenager and found out there is no arguing with it. It wants to do what it wants to do and you might as well give in. The Curvaceous products for curls is outstanding. It was suggested to me by my stylist who also has curls but different kind. There are no two curlies a like. I have the curly on top, the kind of wavy in back and of course the frizzes in the front. I tried to kill my hair many times over the last 76 years but it just keeps reviving itself. My Mother used to tell me there were hundreds of people who would pay to have my hair and all I could say was \\&quot;show me where they are.\\&quot; Of course that was when there was no cream rinse or cream of any kind for hair, she would wash my hair in the sink and then rinse it with vinegar. Whoop, I smelled like a pickled egg for days. She wouldn&#x27;t cut it either. Now I love my hair and just had it highlighted and with the few silver strands I have it&#x27;s very shiny and I keep looking at it every time I pass a mirror. I figure I earned the right to enjoy it after so many years of being teased and having boys throw things in my very thick curls. I was even  the recipient of a dead bird once. I wish I had all those years to do again just so I could enjoy just washing and conditioning my hair and just letting it be it&#x27;s self. Actually, that&#x27;s all it wanted all along. Thanks Redken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A happy Great Gramma of 6 and Gramma of 8 And Mom of 4, almost all curlies</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my stylist applied it to my hair after a cut. I loved it and the curls were amazing! I did not get the same results and had to return it. It somehow found a way to straighten my hair instead of curling it and it&#x27;s way too sticky and crunchy. Went back to my Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus styling milk for curly hair instead.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my very curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great for soft curls.</li>
    <li> Too strongly scented is all I can say.  It works well, I liked the product but can&#x27;t get past the scent that is overpowering and hangs around for hours or even longer.  I could still smell it on my pillowcase after being gone for two days.  I washed all the bedclothes and swore I would never use it again.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick but not coarse, 2c/3a curls that tend toward a little frizz and need enhancement. I&#x27;ve been using a perfectly fine combination of discount store products but I wanted to see if increasing the quality of the products made a difference.  Even though reviews on this were mixed I bought a small 1-oz bottle and tried it.  When you put it in it feels like there is nothing there so you&#x27;re tempted to put in more--but don&#x27;t!  It smells like men&#x27;s cologne, which I didn&#x27;t like for a woman&#x27;s product.  My usual routine is to use a serum and then a cream-gel on clean hair, but since this is a cream-serum I used this alone, applied a dime-sized amount, combed through and then scrunched all over like usual and let air dry. Curls came out very soft and relaxed, but in some areas too relaxed and messy-looking.  Frizz was decreased only slightly over the drugstore products. For someone who has tight curls that needs a bit of relaxing, this could work for them--it&#x27;s just not for me.  I will keep the small bottle to use when travelling (and might cocktail with a touch of gel, or use serum first) but will not buy the full-sized bottle--not worth the price for a product I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied with.</li>
    <li> Great for coaxing waves/curls out of hair.  Gives fine hair body, too. Definitely worth a try if other produts have failed.</li>
    <li> This is a somewhat heavy but pleasant and nice smelling cream-serum, and my hair did develop waves after using. I&#x27;ll use this occasionally; probably I should use a Redken shampoo product but I haven&#x27;t checked whether Redken offers non-detergent non-glycerine products.</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair volume and makes it look really piecey, which I love. It lasts all day. I put it on my short choppy hair from mid-shaft to tips in a very small amount. Too much makes hair look greasy. Also, if you rub a tiny amount on your hands and then over your hair it completely eliminates static for the entire day. Cannot live without this stuff! I just wish they made a travel size.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. This serum enhances the curls without weighing down my hair</li>
    <li> This is a great line of products for naturally curly hair- manages and controls.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this serum. Calms frizzy slightly curly hair without the stiff flaky hold of gel.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and dries my hair out.  Went back to my old reliable -- Curls Rock.  Can&#x27;t beat it for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This works awesome for medium naturally curly hair. If it is longer, go with the ringlet version by Redkin.</li>
    <li> Great Product for curly hair! Redken Curvatous helps boost curls and keep frizz away.  I received the item on time.</li>
    <li> Works well. Has a great hold and helps manage/bring out my curls.</li>
    <li> The salon I went to used this on my natural curly hair &amp; I just let it air dry.  It is by far the best product I have ever used on my curly hair.  Once dry I finish with a little pomade &amp; I have a perfect style.  I have tried lots of products for my curly hair both from the drug store &amp; from salons, this is by far the best.  It also last a long time.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM MADE MY HAIR SO STICKY AND HARD.</li>
    <li> It did a good job of keeping the frizz away, but by the end of the day it was very flaky. I also did not like the fragrance. It smells like cheap men&#x27;s aftershave. I have used drugstore products that I thought worked better and at half the price. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Es un producto para riso y proteje el pelo maltratado, el problema es que deja el pelo muy duro, producto de la proteina</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product, but unfortunately it smells like men&#x27;s cologne to me.  And it is not a \\&quot;light\\&quot; smell.</li>
