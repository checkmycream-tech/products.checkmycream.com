### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Worked wonderfully with my hair....left curves and waves just as stated....</li>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>So happy my hair dresser talked me into it!</li>
      <li>the amount of curl is perfect as if I have had a perm!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!!!</li>
      <li>If you are thinking of getting this after loving the line it is replacing, I say DO NOT DO IT!!</li>
      <li>I use the size of about two quarters on my shoulder-length hair and it takes my wavy hair to beautiful spiral curls.</li>
      <li>purchased this along a Tigi Catwalk Curl Amplifier [a serum-type product, which is also very good, but not as good as this] and a Surface Sea Salt Texturizing Spray.</li>
      <li>Expect stickiness, but this works great.</li>
      <li>great product.....</li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling sticky,with build up of the product,although smells great and keeps hold.</li>
      <li>Add&#x27;s body,lift,shine and my curls look great</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Love !!</li>
      <li>&#x27;s great!:)</li>
      <li>I did give it three stars though because I loved the curls.</li>
      <li>Good price - I would buy this product again.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a silky feel and did nothing good for my curly mane.</li>
      <li>I find I don&#x27;t have as many fly aways</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better then gel!</li>
      <li>I am IN LOVE!</li>
      <li>and I find when I put this in my hair when it&#x27;s still damp it works amazingly.</li>
      <li>I have used this alone and with a diffuser and both give amazing results.</li>
      <li>Did make hair more curly, but not in good way.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist was so enthusiastic about this product that I decided to give it a chance.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft and wonderful.</li>
      <li>things really are clearer in your 40&#x27;s ;o), life is good!</li>
      <li>I may try it again or just save it for a special occasion when I want those gorgeous curls.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>I have been using Redken products for many years and absolutely love all of their products.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I can finger comb out the curls and it looks light and natural, great product Redken!</li>
      <li>Price is better than stores or beauty parlors.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the curls I got from this.</li>
      <li>Like I said, great for humid days, but this is not for every day use unless you have highly texture hair.</li>
      <li>Due to the fineness and thinness of my hair, mousse works best.</li>
      <li>Curvaceous is WAY too strong and</li>
      <li>And honestly, those people need to stop using so much!</li>
      <li>My hair is short and it works great for me.  </li>
      <li>The end result is absolutely fabulous</li>
      <li>Having a fabulous hair dresser helps, which I do.</li>
      <li>Its a texture mouse, NOT made for fine hair to look full....</li>
      <li>, this product is FABULOUS if you use it right!</li>
      <li>This is far and beyond my favorite out of the three!</li>
      <li>, I experienced that the first couple of times I used it too... and initially thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the product because of this...</li>
      <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t found anything with this kind of hold.</li>
      <li>Paid full price at salon.</li>
      <li>It is super sticky and turns my wavy curls into a straw-like rat&#x27;s nest instead of the nice soft ringlets that the Spring Mousse created.</li>
      <li>Best mousse I&#x27;ve ever used on my lazy waves!</li>
      <li>Also, the smell of this is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Who knew following directions really is key, LOL!</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY mousse I&#x27;ve ever been able to use!</li>
      <li>Also, I miss the Fresh Curls smell...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed enough that I am considering trying other products in this line.</li>
      <li>I had never spent much money on my hair styling products until I discovered the Fresh Curls line and loved it so much I was willing to splurge.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness I bought this product at a store that will allow me to return it if I am not completely satisfied because I am anything but happy with this junk.</li>
      <li>Anyway I have recently gone blonder and chunkier so more processing</li>
      <li>, this smells like absolute HEAVEN!</li>
      <li>This is great for the most humid days, but my hair felt kind of rough and almost dirty when I used this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly sticky, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>A little dab will do amazing things.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to find good hair product, this really work</li>
      <li>and my beautician had used this on my hair, showing me how much to use.  </li>
      <li>My hair does not have much body but this creates lots of volume and staying power.</li>
      <li>It was a bit much for my 3ab hair.</li>
      <li>I admit that I may have used too much.</li>
      <li>Product is great but the nozzle is poorly designed.  </li>
      <li>You only need to use a TINY bit to coax your hair into nice waves.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I wish I would not have wasted my money on this.</li>
      <li>I then comb through it to spread it out, blow dry (with difuser) on cool and viola!</li>
      <li>I am fortunate that it lasts so long</li>
      <li>I did not expect to like this product--most of my experiences with mousse products have not been good (dried out hair, made hair brittle, not enough hold, etc).  </li>
      <li>If you want volume, its great... VERY little of this product goes a long way!</li>
      <li>I may try wetting my hair a little in the morning and applying it then to see if it works any better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell but not a good smell either, just strong.</li>
      <li>I would still recommend to people trying new products for their curls.</li>
      <li>When Redken came out with the Curvaceous line I was eager to try, after all the style is mostly about the product, of course the cut counts but we are talking about long hair with long layers</li>
      <li>I was just looking for a way to boost my natural waves that seem to be getting straighter as I get older.</li>
      <li>came quickly and was just as expected!</li>
      <li>I really think that is key.</li>
      <li>My hair has a natural wave but has never been what I would call curly.</li>
      <li>This is really the only stuff that works well for me.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>I have some natural wave but not the curly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s curly, springy and soft and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>but I still had that stiff feel however my curls were fabulous.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it even though the directions say to use a small amount I used the regular amount of mousse (heafty hand full)</li>
      <li>When they came out with the Body Full line I started using the entire line and the pump mousse really helped with the straightness that occurs over time but still not satisfying.</li>
      <li>I would normally use of a regular mousse.</li>
      <li>Many reviews complained but it was due to using too much.  </li>
      <li>The other tip which is also stated in the directions right on the bottle, imagine that, is also key which is to start mid way applying the product</li>
      <li>This made a huge difference with the stiff feel, the sticky is still there but does go away when dry.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair in place much longer than other products I have tried.  </li>
      <li>so what I do is start the application about 2-4 inches from the root of my hair work to the end and then go back directly to the root and apply what may be left on my hands while scrunching the curls.</li>
      <li>I can scrunch my hair with this product and have it hold a natural wave all day long...</li>
      <li>I am 40 have baby fine thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I do not dry my hair all the way which helps create a more refined curl when only partially dry, but when it dried comletely no more sticky feel</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best mousse I&#x27;ve ever used on my lazy waves! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am IN LOVE! I purchased this from my salon supply store and did not read any reviews until after I already had it in my possession. I was a little bit worried since everyone was saying how sticky it was... And honestly, those people need to stop using so much! I have used this product for a week straight now and not once has my hair felt sticky, thick, heavy, greasy, or any of the things others have mentioned. I use the size of about two quarters on my shoulder-length hair and it takes my wavy hair to beautiful spiral curls. I have used this alone and with a diffuser and both give amazing results. My hair feels soft, and seriously not even the least bit stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this along a Tigi Catwalk Curl Amplifier [a serum-type product, which is also very good, but not as good as this] and a Surface Sea Salt Texturizing Spray. This is far and beyond my favorite out of the three! A must try, just don&#x27;t overdo it with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this smells like absolute HEAVEN!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I LOVE the curls I got from this. It looked like I used a curling iron. But I didn&#x27;t like the heavy feeling. It made my hair feel sticky and dirty. I did give it three stars though because I loved the curls. I admit that I may have used too much. I read other reviews saying that you shouldn&#x27;t use the same amount as you would with regular mousse. I may try it again or just save it for a special occasion when I want those gorgeous curls.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY mousse I&#x27;ve ever been able to use! It keeps my hair soft and wonderful. It&#x27;s even better then gel! So happy my hair dresser talked me into it!</li>
    <li> Love !! A little goes a long way!!!! It&#x27;s a texturizing it will feel different !!</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully with my hair....left curves and waves just as stated....but I aired dried naturally.</li>
    <li> Product is great but the nozzle is poorly designed.  It breaks halfway through the can and you cannot fix it.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling sticky,with build up of the product,although smells great and keeps hold.</li>
    <li> Works well. My hair does not have much body but this creates lots of volume and staying power.</li>
    <li> this is a heavier product and leaves my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> came quickly and was just as expected!</li>
    <li> This is really the only stuff that works well for me. It&#x27;s incredibly sticky, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the worst Redken product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used their products for over 20 years.  It makes your hair feel dirty &amp; sticky.  Bring  back the Spring Mousse!</li>
    <li> So disappointed that Redken replaced the Fresh Curls line with this. It is super sticky and turns my wavy curls into a straw-like rat&#x27;s nest instead of the nice soft ringlets that the Spring Mousse created. It is very, very drying to my already dry hair, and unfortunately, Redken has also discontinued the leave-in conditioning cream of the Fresh Curls line as well. I had never spent much money on my hair styling products until I discovered the Fresh Curls line and loved it so much I was willing to splurge. Thank goodness I bought this product at a store that will allow me to return it if I am not completely satisfied because I am anything but happy with this junk. What were they thinking? Also, I miss the Fresh Curls smell... Curvaceous is WAY too strong and \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;-- it gives me a headache and makes me feel nauseous. If you are thinking of getting this after loving the line it is replacing, I say DO NOT DO IT!!</li>
    <li> It works great! Add&#x27;s body,lift,shine and my curls look great and I have no frizz!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a small amount!love it!!!!! I&#x27;m a red head it&#x27;s hard to find good hair product, this really work&#x27;s great!:)</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair and I find when I put this in my hair when it&#x27;s still damp it works amazingly. I find I don&#x27;t have as many fly aways and I have bigger curls. I asl9 find a little goes a long way. Using too much in the past has left my hair feeling greasy but I&#x27;ve learned moderation. I would still recommend to people trying new products for their curls.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after purchasing it from the salon I use... My hair has a natural wave but has never been what I would call curly. I can scrunch my hair with this product and have it hold a natural wave all day long... I read the reviews about it feeling heavy and sticky, I experienced that the first couple of times I used it too... and initially thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the product because of this... I cut back on the amount of product I had been using and the stickiness went away. I now put just a tiny bit in my hand and \\&quot;spot apply\\&quot; it to my hair as needed, once it&#x27;s dry I can finger comb out the curls and it looks light and natural, great product Redken!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It keeps my hair in place much longer than other products I have tried.  I spend less time working on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I read a lot of reviews about it and my beautician had used this on my hair, showing me how much to use.  A little dab will do amazing things.  Many reviews complained but it was due to using too much.  My hair is short and it works great for me.  Price is better than stores or beauty parlors.</li>
    <li> Expect stickiness, but this works great. You only need to use a TINY bit to coax your hair into nice waves. So far, I haven&#x27;t found anything with this kind of hold.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair wavy and I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I did not expect to like this product--most of my experiences with mousse products have not been good (dried out hair, made hair brittle, not enough hold, etc).  My hair stylist was so enthusiastic about this product that I decided to give it a chance.  I have collarbone-length curly hair that is on the heavy side and needs a product with a firm hold.  Prior to this, I had used Redken Curl Force to get the long-lasting curls, even though it dried my hair out if I used it too often.  The Curvaceous product makes my hair feel a little bit \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; but I need a lot less product to keep my curls in place and the curls look soft instead of \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m impressed enough that I am considering trying other products in this line.</li>
    <li> This is great for the most humid days, but my hair felt kind of rough and almost dirty when I used this stuff. Like I said, great for humid days, but this is not for every day use unless you have highly texture hair. It was a bit much for my 3ab hair. I&#x27;ll buy some before my next trip to Miami, but I won&#x27;t keep this around all the time.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it gives my hair texture and sometimes that is hard to achieve.  Good price - I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a waaaay low maintenance person with shoulder length wavy hair (on the thicker side). I got a sample bottle from my hairstylist and I love it. I haven&#x27;t noticed the stickiness others mention.  I put a small amount in my hand, rub it together so it&#x27;s not white anymore, then run it through my hair.  I then comb through it to spread it out, blow dry (with difuser) on cool and viola! It&#x27;s curly, springy and soft and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Do not like at all. It doesn&#x27;t have a silky feel and did nothing good for my curly mane. Still had to use multiple products.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. Paid full price at salon. Makes hair feel awful;couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out. Did make hair more curly, but not in good way. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I am 40 have baby fine thin hair.  My color is light dirty blonde and my length when curly touches the back of my bra strap. I have some natural wave but not the curly I desire so I usually get a spiral perm about once every 2 years. This helps with the straight/slightly wavy look that happens from the root to about 3-5 inches down then curly the rest of the way. I am fortunate that it lasts so long but again I have very lightweight thin hair. I also highlight my hair so it is a challenge of when the time comes for perming not to overprocess by spreading out the highlighting and perming. Having a fabulous hair dresser helps, which I do. Anyway I have recently gone blonder and chunkier so more processing and I was concerned about perming this time around.  I have been using Redken products for many years and absolutely love all of their products. When they came out with the Body Full line I started using the entire line and the pump mousse really helped with the straightness that occurs over time but still not satisfying. Due to the fineness and thinness of my hair, mousse works best. Creams and other products of that nature seam to weigh my hair down. Root lifters really make my hair stiff and feel dirty and only give you body not curl. When Redken came out with the Curvaceous line I was eager to try, after all the style is mostly about the product, of course the cut counts but we are talking about long hair with long layers, anyway I bought the mousse only. The first time I used it even though the directions say to use a small amount I used the regular amount of mousse (heafty hand full) I would normally use of a regular mousse. Yes it made my hair very stiff and had a sticky feel while drying with diffuser upside down (key for me). I do not dry my hair all the way which helps create a more refined curl when only partially dry, but when it dried comletely no more sticky feel but I still had that stiff feel however my curls were fabulous. The next day I tried a little less and then a little less the day after that. This made a huge difference with the stiff feel, the sticky is still there but does go away when dry. The other tip which is also stated in the directions right on the bottle, imagine that, is also key which is to start mid way applying the product so what I do is start the application about 2-4 inches from the root of my hair work to the end and then go back directly to the root and apply what may be left on my hands while scrunching the curls. The end result is absolutely fabulous no more straight look from the root to 3-5 inches and the amount of curl is perfect as if I have had a perm! I have never been so satisified with a product for my hair type. I no longer use hairspray to help keep the shape and refine the curl and looks like I no longer will be perming my hair!! This is the only product I have to use. Who knew following directions really is key, LOL! WOW things really are clearer in your 40&#x27;s ;o), life is good! For the ladies that are not stisfied with the product try less I really think that is key. Hope all this helps!</li>
    <li> The people that gave this product a low rating is because they dont know how to use this product. Im a hair stylist, this product is FABULOUS if you use it right! If you want volume, its great... VERY little of this product goes a long way! It does dirty your clean soft hair up so that it stays styled. Its a texture mouse, NOT made for fine hair to look full....&lt;br /&gt;A great product.....if you know how to ise it correctly!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wish I would not have wasted my money on this. It is extremely sticky, making my hair a sticky mess that I can&#x27;t even touch. I have thick, naturally wavy hair. I put the product on at night after my shower, and when I woke up in the morning I almost couldn&#x27;t comb it. I could hardly wait to wash it out that night. I always wash my hair at night or it&#x27;s way too frizzy and takes forever to dry. I may try wetting my hair a little in the morning and applying it then to see if it works any better. I was just looking for a way to boost my natural waves that seem to be getting straighter as I get older. Also, the smell of this is pretty strong. It&#x27;s not a bad smell but not a good smell either, just strong.</li>
