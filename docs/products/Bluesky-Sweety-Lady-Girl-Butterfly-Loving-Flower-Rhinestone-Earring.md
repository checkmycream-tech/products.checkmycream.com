    <li> I am so happy with this purchase the earrings are bigger than I expected, about one inch C shaped hoop style. The colors are so nice,  These a re right on trend for spring.  Please note that they come from Asia and do take a few weeks to arive, but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this to my wife, she don&#x27;t like much.so thst why i given 1 rating.&lt;br /&gt;picture looks good but when we see real not so good</li>
    <li> I just loved these earrings they are very nice I would say that you will love this deal very much I no I did</li>
    <li> These are very pretty earrings. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered them. They remind me of spring, with the butterflies and flowers.</li>
    <li> I gave these a three because the color isnt vibrant as the picture and they are a little bigger than I would like they are the length of a nickel!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute item but it is also obviously a tad cheesy. I like the idea insofar as using these in the Summer at the beach.  Other than that, it is not meant for an event of some sort unless it involves,, ,,say.....a picnic?  A family gathering?&lt;br /&gt;The grandchildren would love these!!</li>
    <li> Great value.  Was not sure of the quality because of the price.  Great product, love these earrings.  Get them while you can.</li>
    <li> fun and trendy prod &#x3D;) def recommend! makes fun and cute gifts!  loved it &#x3D;) stocking stuffer or just b/c gift!</li>
    <li> Pretty.  I think that they will be a hit with my &amp;#34;already made jewelry&amp;#34;.  I price these products much lower than the ones that I make myself.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE these earings, They are really pretty, made of good quality and I plan on buying more pairs for gifts. If you love unique and Pretty Fashion Jewelry these earrings are a MUST!!!</li>
    <li> beautiful and unique earrings, haven&#x27;t worn em yet but im sure when i do they&#x27;ll look equally as nice ....</li>
    <li> I have chozen it because it is very beautiful and elegant. it has many colours end seens so fretty on ears.</li>
    <li> Awesome product...love it..gorgeous.  cant emphasize how beutiful it is. Worth the money. Really beutiful product. I bought it for work. Showered with compliments when i wear it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in these.  It took a very long time to receive, and once I got them the quality was not very good.  Cheap looking, really.  Not nearly as lush looking as the photo.  Also the earring backs were not ones that securely fit the earrings and I lost one just opening the package.  I cannot imagine they would hold the earrings in place very well.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice and elegant not too big just the right size to make a statement very beautiful. I am actually going to order the other pair like them in a different color not to mention the price.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my sister and she loved them.they do get a long time to get here but considering they come all the way from asia doesn&#x27;t seem as bad.</li>
    <li> They werent as i expected. They were very small. I expected them to be much bigger. Over all theyre okay i guess.</li>
    <li> Cute but the backs are too think to go through my ear.. Took a while to get here too, but cute</li>
    <li> I just love these inexpensive earrings,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are so cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have even received compliments in regard to the appearance of them!</li>
    <li> I love these because they&#x27;re cute but make sure to clear coat the gems so they dont fall out and use ointment if you have sensitive ears!</li>
    <li> These are really nice. I would buy them again. though I wish i could get the same in a silver color..</li>
    <li> I order these earring to go with my peace sign necklace cause the colors look like they would match, and I was right on they go great together. Very happy!</li>
    <li> .they are so pretty but I don&#x27;t have them yet</li>
    <li> These were really cute but they came with some gems missing. Some were lose in the bag so I super glued them but one was still missing. Sad because they could be really cute.</li>
    <li> Very unusual and pretty.</li>
    <li> Look beautiful for the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, beautiful.  I love these earrings their absolutely gorgeous,  they look just like the picture. The shine and elegance thry have are amazing</li>
    <li> These are very pretty. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the back, it&#x27;s a little plastic tube and I&#x27;m afraid it will slide off and I&#x27;ll loose the EARRING(I took a star off for that). I wore them to work and got several complements . A nice quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I was afraid that these earrings were going to be cheap - turns out they aren&#x27;t, and they are darling. Got them super cheap, and I love them!</li>
    <li> they are little, but very colorful to match any outfit or necklace. i would recommend this piece to any girl , teenager or mature woman .they are elegant</li>
    <li> Decided I did not want after you said you had cancelled the order anyway.  They came from Japan anyway, just recently, causing my&lt;br /&gt;acct. to be in overdraw status and I am very upset and disappointed.  They are some little dinky trinkets that should only be around&lt;br /&gt;.50! Very unhappy with this product, and the service!</li>
    <li> Just beautiful! Can&amp;#34;t beat the price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> Not as pretty in person, but worth ever penny spent.</li>
    <li> I love it! I gave it to my mom, and she loves it! Nothing broke, and it looks exactly like the photo. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap these were and now nice they look. They are really small and classy.</li>
    <li> I wore them with a pink top and it looked great. I hope I see other ones like this in the future.</li>
    <li> i can wear these any day of the week, so beautiful and full of color! the curve is just perfect and the size is great as well.</li>
    <li> These are cute as can be, not certain why other reviewers are so negative.  If you shop Betsey Johnson on the well known auction site you will be familiar with the quality: fun but disposable (so you Willis cry if lost!) fashion jewelry.  Shipping was far faster than expected...very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> IT IS VERY NICE, AND SUMMERY. GOOD ONE TO HAVE AT A VERRY LOW PRICE.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful and I love to wear them. Very small&lt;br /&gt;The and elegant. Well go with a lot of my clothes.</li>
    <li> These earrings are so cute....butterflies are going to be big this Spring and Summer! These will look good with jeans to dresses! I love them very much!</li>
    <li> The earrings are so small that if I saw it at a store and if it cost 99 cents, I still wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Love these! I get compliments every time I wear them.These earrings are Very feminine. Great quality. Wear them all the time.</li>
    <li> I placed my order last month and it came today. I was expecting to received this on the 20th of this month. I&#x27;m very impressed with the delivery and the earrings are good quality it looks expensive. The earrings are made very well for the price I paid. I will definitely order next time from them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like butterflies on jewelry, but I love these earrings. They are very colorful and cute. They are not super heavy either, which is always good,</li>
    <li> I have worn tgese earrings every day since I bought them. Love them Im thinking of getting some for a family member.</li>
    <li> Arrived early than expected. Earrings are lovely but the stones need to be mirror image. Looks strange that they&#x27;re not. Also, my ears are alloy sensitive and these are not hyperallogenic. Too bad- they are pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I loved the colors and they have a whimsical feel. They are the same as shown in the picture. I am very satisfied with the set. The only complaint I have is that one of the stems is a bit rough. It will still go in my ear, but may not be good for new piercings.</li>
    <li> Very cute and unique earrings.  Arrived nicely packaged. Great quality and an unbelievable price! Would definately recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> it was good experience to choose any buy this product,it is unique and have great price,i would like to say its nice</li>
    <li> it looks different from the photo. I took a while to reach but it is very unique will look for the chain to match.</li>
    <li> A little to fussy for the ear. Pretty and well made though. I am small and they were too much.</li>
