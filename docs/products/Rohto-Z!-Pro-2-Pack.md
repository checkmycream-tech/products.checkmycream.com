      <li>These are an eye&#x27;s best friend.  </li>
      <li>good for start a day!</li>
      <li>You may feel great.</li>
      <li>Yes they burn but its a good burn.</li>
      <li>O don&#x27;t think it good idea buy it online without ask doctor.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>and my eyes are refreshed for most of the morning.</li>
      <li>Love love love these eye drops.</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not willing to keep using it for that reason, but if you don&#x27;t notice adverse effects, then it&#x27;s the best redness reliever I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Best product for eyes in a such hot place like San Diego!</li>
      <li>Free.  </li>
      <li>This is amazing, and I guess it is really nourishing the eyes.</li>
      <li>This eye drops is very powerful which means its not for everyone.</li>
      <li>BTW the best part of it, and the reason why it is worth the money, is that you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday.</li>
      <li>The cool mint burns away</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>It is really cooling and refreshing.</li>
      <li>The 90 seconds of Vicks vapor rub in your eye sockets is worth the result.  </li>
      <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the value!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rarely use eye drops and spend 8+ hours in front of screens.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery also!</li>
      <li>These just got to my desk and after trying them for the first time, I&#x27;m amazed how energizing they are halfway through my day.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Rohto artic, they do slightly feel like peppermint in your eyes fr a second, but really cool and feel great</li>
      <li>They are intense for sure, but after using these for several years I can apply them without losing my composure......</li>
      <li>There is a huge burning sensation that comes with these but nothing I couldn&#x27;t personally handle.</li>
      <li>even when you have been up for 72 hours straight...</li>
      <li>The Rhoto Ice didn&#x27;t have as much of an impact as these do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping is blazing fast.</li>
      <li>I really need it.</li>
      <li>One time of use can endure several days, keeping you comfortable.</li>
      <li>They REALLY refresh and sooth your eyes...</li>
      <li>Yet the fresh and clear eye feeling lasts.  </li>
      <li>having clear and bright eyes is essential in keeping a professional appearance for the public.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for tired dry eyes.</li>
      <li>My eyes feel new again!</li>
      <li>Tried only in my right eye.</li>
      <li>I would not want to live without them.</li>
      <li>The burn is greatly over exaggerated, but after a few seconds, you are left with a fresh, clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty fantastic once you get past the watery eye part!</li>
      <li>Your nose will be runny for about a minute after you use the eye drops but your eyes will be really clear, to the point where they sort of sparkle a bit.</li>
      <li>They last eight hours and have no need to really be reapplied in the meantime.</li>
      <li>I do not feel any pain even if I have red eyes after starring at computer for a whole day.</li>
      <li>Made my eyes soooo white but definitely burned for the first minute or so after using them....</li>
      <li>Very refreshing for my dry, tired eyes.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried almost every single variation Rohto offers (White, Silver, Green, Red, Blue, and the new crazy square bottles), and these are my favorite, by far.</li>
      <li>Still, it is only eyedrops - they worked and I have suffered no ill effects, but the price seems high for the small amount of product received.  </li>
      <li>Comparing these to the other rotho drops the sting is slighlty intense.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> This stuff has got to be terrible for your eyes!  Can I return it?</li>
    <li> Love love love these eye drops. Very refreshing for my dry, tired eyes. Fast delivery also!</li>
    <li> Have not tried product yet.</li>
    <li> You may feel great. But the fact this type eye drop require doctor prescription. So it may hurt you, O don&#x27;t think it good idea buy it online without ask doctor.</li>
    <li> These are my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; eye drop and follow me in my travels. When appearance is everything.....even when you have been up for 72 hours straight...having clear and bright eyes is essential in keeping a professional appearance for the public. I also rely upon my eyes for extreme long range marksmanship. Insuring the health of my eyes is something I take very seriously, and I trust Z! Pro. The burn is greatly over exaggerated, but after a few seconds, you are left with a fresh, clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is blazing fast. I opted for next day delivery, and it was delivered before lunch the next day.</li>
    <li> The drops sting a little, but they do clear up the redness and your eyes feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> These are an eye&#x27;s best friend.  I would not want to live without them.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried almost every single variation Rohto offers (White, Silver, Green, Red, Blue, and the new crazy square bottles), and these are my favorite, by far.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> Your nose will be runny for about a minute after you use the eye drops but your eyes will be really clear, to the point where they sort of sparkle a bit.</li>
    <li> The 90 seconds of Vicks vapor rub in your eye sockets is worth the result.  I discovered this stuff in Japan about 10 years ago when it was called Z! Free.  I used to have military friends buy it for me in the airport pharmacies but now I can buy this on Amazon..  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> you will quickly acclimate to using these eyedrops if you don&#x27;t psych yourself out too bad. They are intense for sure, but after using these for several years I can apply them without losing my composure...... However, I cannot tell you the number of &amp;#34;uninitiated&amp;#34; people that have unknowingly asked to use them.... It is quite a show to sit back and watch!</li>
    <li> This product has gotten a lot of hype recently so we bought some to give it a try.  The package comes with no written instruction in English and I do not read Japanese.  Still, it is only eyedrops - they worked and I have suffered no ill effects, but the price seems high for the small amount of product received.  I am underwhelmed!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the value!&lt;br /&gt;Really refreshes my eyes when used</li>
    <li> I do feel that this works really well at getting the red out of your eyes, but I&#x27;m concerned that it may actually be causing worse vision problems. Since I started using this about a month ago, my vision seems extra blurry. I&#x27;m not willing to keep using it for that reason, but if you don&#x27;t notice adverse effects, then it&#x27;s the best redness reliever I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I love it so much and I already used this product for a long time! Best product for eyes in a such hot place like San Diego!</li>
    <li> always use these eye drops. They are perfect for tired dry eyes.</li>
    <li> Pretty fantastic once you get past the watery eye part!</li>
    <li> Some of the best eyedrops I&#x27;ve ever owned. The Rhoto Ice didn&#x27;t have as much of an impact as these do. Living in Arizona, where there is little to no humidity, it is hard to keep your eyes from drying out. I&#x27;ve tried anything from allergy eyedrops to vitamins and nothing seems to work. These however are as described. There is a huge burning sensation that comes with these but nothing I couldn&#x27;t personally handle. They last eight hours and have no need to really be reapplied in the meantime.</li>
    <li> Been using these for some time now, lets clear some negative reviews from others. Yes they burn but its a good burn. They contain an astringent in them. Its a mininal amount no need to fear. Comparing these to the other rotho drops the sting is slighlty intense. Yet the fresh and clear eye feeling lasts.  I use them initially in the morning when i wake up. I go around 10 hours before i re apply 2 drops to each eye. My eyes stay anime white for hours, they truly do wonders. I plan on stocking up when I get paid again.  Had to resort to the basic green ones for now.</li>
    <li> Tried only in my right eye. Burned, and blurred my vision. Felt like my eye was coated with superglue for three days.  Probably should buy only products in which I can read the ingredients /directions!</li>
    <li> I do not feel any pain even if I have red eyes after starring at computer for a whole day. It is really cooling and refreshing. Makes me sleep without sore eyes, and get awake faster, too. BTW the best part of it, and the reason why it is worth the money, is that you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday. One time of use can endure several days, keeping you comfortable. This is amazing, and I guess it is really nourishing the eyes.</li>
    <li> good for start a day!</li>
    <li> This eye drops is very powerful which means its not for everyone. It works excellent for me. The cool mint burns away (you should take it literally) all the exhaustions in your eyes. One of the best eye drops I ever used.</li>
    <li> amazingly awesome eyedrops!</li>
    <li> Made my eyes soooo white but definitely burned for the first minute or so after using them....weird feeling!</li>
    <li> These may not be for everyone as they are an astringent (burns your eyes like astringent mouth wash burns your mouth). I think they are wonderful. I use before getting out of bed in the a.m. and my eyes are refreshed for most of the morning. Then use as needed after a day of staring at the computer screen.  Again -- may not be for everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product...Can never go back to standard eye drops or even normal(or arctic) Rohto....They REALLY refresh and sooth your eyes...If you haven&#x27;t tried Rohto artic, they do slightly feel like peppermint in your eyes fr a second, but really cool and feel great</li>
    <li> I really need it. I bought 4 times.</li>
    <li> I rarely use eye drops and spend 8+ hours in front of screens. These just got to my desk and after trying them for the first time, I&#x27;m amazed how energizing they are halfway through my day. My eyes feel new again!</li>
