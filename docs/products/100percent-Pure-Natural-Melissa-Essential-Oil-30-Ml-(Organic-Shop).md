      <li>Major bummer.  </li>

    <li> I find this product to be a good value. It has a great smell and is&lt;br /&gt;strong. If you ever had Shingles it helps with this to relieve the skin and heals&lt;br /&gt;the problem areas.</li>
    <li> wonderful item - I use essential oils in place of chemical based products - Melissa is a perfect addition too</li>
    <li> Very concentrated and strong smelling but works great! I have noticed a huge difference since I used this product a few months ago, will always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is strong.  A few drops on our beds&#x27; comforter, and we sleep great.  I put some in the cleaning solution for the floor (tile) cleaner and the whole house feels more relaxed. And clean.</li>
    <li> I love lemon balm and grow it in my garden but still wanted the concentrated benefit of the eo for different purposes.  I have ordered many eos online but this was the first time I received one that had leaked.  About 1/4 of the bottle had leaked into the packaging.  Major bummer.  The smell, however, is potent.</li>
    <li> This oil comes with a great list of properties that can help many health issues people may have. I had surgery and uses it with fish oil on the area and it has healed so well and even the scar tissue underneath is healing so well. I recommend this oil. I love the smell, it is light and goes well with the smell of fish oil; not heavy, I like using and wearing it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2, and 1 spilled 1/4 of it&#x27;s contents :/ lame, turnes out, a lid on one of them doesn&#x27;t close tightly..it&#x27;s defective.</li>
    <li> Was a reasonable price and arrived quickly, but of the 2 ordered one leaked in the package. Also the oil I received had a strong smell of citronella (like lemon pledge) which leads me to believe it may have a citronella component. So requested to return both bottles.  Return shipping is equal to half the cost of the oil so I&#x27;ve decided to keep it and try it as an insect repellent.</li>
    <li> This is not true Melissa oil. It&#x27;s another Russian scam of some type of weird oil. 30ml of true Melissa oil would cost about $500.00. If you don&#x27;t believe this do some research. 2 ml of true Melissa oil costs about $35.00. I bought this and immediately returned it. If you buy this you&#x27;re fooling yourself. Who know what this stuff is. Research first and you will see what I mean.</li>
    <li> Love these oils, it cleared up my cold sore.</li>
    <li> I give this product a rating of excellent for quality. The bottle sealed when I received. The oil really smells great. It smells pure and powerful.</li>
    <li> package not in english soi have now clue whta it says</li>
    <li> I cannot distinguish this smell from citronella. Since I have not tried any other expensive brands yet I cannot compare but it doesn&#x27;t sound like the description of what Melissa smells like in my catalogs. I think I will try another brand and update this later. I didn&#x27;t need another citronella scent.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shipper did not pack it very well at all, and the bottle leaked enough to stain the bubble envelope through to the outside of the package. I could tell it had arrived because I could smell the oil&#x27;s fragrance as I was walking up my driveway to the front porch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, when I saw how poorly as it was packed, I was very surprised the bottle did not break during shipping.</li>
    <li> this oil smells amazing, but when I opened the box I was kind of knocked out by the smell because the bottles had not been sealed quite well enough and a bit of it leaked out.. Sure does smell wonderful however!</li>
    <li> good for a lot of things</li>
    <li> Smells great and strong.</li>
    <li> This oil is really strong, and smells a lot like pine sol.  I don&#x27;t exactly know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like.</li>
    <li> It comes from Russia but smells good, top quality product.</li>
