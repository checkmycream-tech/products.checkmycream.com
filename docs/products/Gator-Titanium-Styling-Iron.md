      <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron is awesome.  </li>
      <li>Its a pretty good straightener.</li>
      <li>and I was like wow this one is great.</li>
      <li>and it really straightens my hair really good..</li>
      <li>It also heats quick as a flash!</li>
      <li>The digital temp control apparently makes all the difference allowing one to get it set to a perfect temperature for their own hair and repeat it.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s another huge plus as well.</li>
      <li>It looks smooth and shiny and keeps that look for hours.  </li>
      <li>Not as fantastic as i had hoped.</li>
      <li>so I can comfortably style my hair and the flattening plate</li>
      <li>Great flat irons</li>
      <li>This is a great flat iron!</li>
      <li>Im still keeping it though bc overall its a great straightener and gets the job done quick.</li>
      <li>It was okay at first but let me tell you in comparison to my croc it is garbage.</li>
      <li>My best friend is a professional hair stylist and she recommended this flat iron to me.</li>
      <li>This flat iron is amazing and the price is even better.</li>
      <li>I PURCHASED THIS FLAT IRON THINKING THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE AS GOOD AS CHI.  </li>
      <li>only down fall is it can leave a line from where you start to straighten the hair so best to start at the top</li>
      <li>I love my new Ion Gator!</li>
      <li>it heats up really quick</li>
      <li>The 1\\&quot; titanium Platinum flat iron is just what she wanted, and this particular model does a beautiful job on her hair.  </li>
      <li>LOVE my new straightener...</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and it works very good</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
      <li>So far I love my gator.</li>
      <li>Good quality flat iron shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know with the Ion if it was the flat iron or I just needed different finishing products on my hair to make it more effective.</li>
      <li>is exactly the right size for what I need.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly and leaves hair straight and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Heats up SUPER fast.</li>
      <li>and it arrived in stellar condition.</li>
      <li>My ends feel silky smooth and soft instead of burnt and crispy</li>
      <li>Hot</li>
      <li>However, it was delivered exactly as pictured in the listing.</li>
      <li>The iron works well but for the price it does not do a better job than cheaper flat irons.</li>
      <li>This flat iron was okay, but I ended up buying a Jilbere and was happier with that.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
      <li>The digital read out is super simple and easy, and the cord is also nice and long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much better then my chi, which is at a fixed temp of 410degrees and burns my hair and makes it stink and barely any shine to it.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t frizz and holds straight even in high humidity which is very unusual for me.</li>
      <li>IT IS ALSO VERY WELL PRICED.  </li>
      <li>I also tried curling with this and its fast and neat when you figure out what technique works for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One swipe through my sectioned strands and it&#x27;s instantly straight.</li>
      <li>My  sister recommended this one to me and I wasn&#x27;t ready to try it</li>
      <li>It heats up really fast and you can set the temperature.</li>
      <li>another huge plus is that it doesn&#x27;t tug and rip my hair out either like the conair flat iron did.</li>
      <li>This is my second Ion flat iron - my first one lasted more than six years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome! My hair has never been this soft after using the ion titanium platinum gator. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> The iron works well but for the price it does not do a better job than cheaper flat irons. My previous flat iron was purchased from a mall kiosk and worked equally as well. Maybe this is just a lower end model of the Ion brand but I am not thrilled with it. However, it was delivered exactly as pictured in the listing.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS FLAT IRON THINKING THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE AS GOOD AS CHI.  HOWEVER, WAS I EVER MISTAKEN.  THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST, ABSOLUTE BEST, FLAT IRON ON THE MARKET.  IT IS ALSO VERY WELL PRICED.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  YOU CAN STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR QUICKLY, AND THE SHINE IS INCREDIBLE.  PEOPLE ASKED ME IF I HAD HAD A BRAZILIAN BLOW-OUT DONE, AND OF COURSE I HAVE NOT.</li>
    <li> I love this iron I brought it after my sedu iron fully gave out on me and I must say It works great. It leave your hair so silky and soft! Great product, good quality !!</li>
    <li> i bought this iron thinking it could tie me over for the time being . it not only straightened my hair but gave it a beautiful shine very happy with this iron</li>
    <li> I have dry, frizzy, curly hair and other straighteners do not work well..even the chi staightener doesn&#x27;t do well at all..they always make my hair look great the first 10 minutes after its done, but as soon as I step outside my hair looks horrible and starts to curl up again no matter what hair products I use that are supposed to help it not..I used to have an ion and it worked wonderfully on my hair but sadly i lost it..but this straightener works phenomenally!! No matter the weather its still straight..I still use other serums but there really isn&#x27;t much need to..I suggest this one or any ion to anyone</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.  Priced rice and excellent results!</li>
    <li> Its a pretty good straightener. Not as fantastic as i had hoped.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. It was recommended by a girl I worked with. I have super thick curly hair and it takes about 2/3 the time my old iron took to straighten my hair.  My hair looks healthier and feels softer and smoother. It doesn&#x27;t frizz and holds straight even in high humidity which is very unusual for me. I use it with Garnier flat iron protectant spray. Love it. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> i was in need of replacing my crappy conair flat iron that just wasn&#x27;t straightening my hair decently and i was getting so sick of it lol. it was taking me forever to straighten my hair and i would have to go over the same sections of hair at least 5 times, no joke. i picked up this flat iron from ion at sally&#x27;s a week ago and i&#x27;m in love with how effortlessly it straightens my hair. it&#x27;s cut my straightening routine time in half. it heats up really quick so that saves a lot of time as well. another huge plus is that it doesn&#x27;t tug and rip my hair out either like the conair flat iron did. this also isn&#x27;t the most expensive flat iron on the market so that&#x27;s another huge plus as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome hot iron. I did a lot of research, best price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she loves it!  The 1\\&quot; titanium Platinum flat iron is just what she wanted, and this particular model does a beautiful job on her hair.  It looks smooth and shiny and keeps that look for hours.  This was a great value plus a quick delivery and made this last-minute purchase the perfect choice!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron! It works as well, if not better than, some of the really expensive alternatives. Very affordable and shipping was great...arrived before expected!</li>
    <li> I was looking up straighteners for a while since mine was getting a bit old. I had a conair infinity which worked really good in the beginning but bc it is ceramic which works great at first but then just wears down so I wanted to try a titanium which I hear is a lot better for your hair and lasts a lot longer. Came across this one on the sallys website and was immediately drawn to it. I depend a lot on other peoples reviews so I liked what I read and purchased it. Went to sallys to pick it up since they had it in stock and was on sale. I really liked it.. feels sturdy and well made. Simple to adjust the temp and buttons arent in an awkward place and gets hot in like less then like 10 sec. I have normal thick hair and its puffy and wavy and it leaves it nice and straight. Would recommend straightening hair in the front especially if it is thinned out to a layered look on a lower temp setting so that you dont damage your ends. The only problem I had with it is that for the length of the plates you cant really use all of it just maybe about a little more than half of it. When I do try and use it all it does snag your hair a bit. Not enough to hurt but its not completely snag free like it states. Im still keeping it though bc overall its a great straightener and gets the job done quick.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome.  Heats up quickly and leaves hair straight and shiny.  This is my second Ion flat iron - my first one lasted more than six years.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Chi and Global Beauty ceramic straighteners because after a year they wouldn&#x27;t get as hot as they should have. This straightener is amazing. It has a frosted outer texture to enhance your grip, and has a thumb press for even greater handling. The plates are also just a little bit longer than the Chi so you can do more hair at a time. The digital read out is super simple and easy, and the cord is also nice and long. It also heats quick as a flash! I only have to go through each section of my curly African American hair ONE TIME with these titanium plates! My ends feel silky smooth and soft instead of burnt and crispy like I noticed after using the Chi with its ceramic plates, and it&#x27;s cheaper! My only complaint is with the shipping, as it did take an unusually long time to get delivered (via UPS) compared to my other Amazon purchaces, unfortunately, but it was well worth the wait and it arrived in stellar condition. Couldn&#x27;t be happier, and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it works very good but I have only had it for a year.</li>
    <li> So far I love my gator. It&#x27;s super sleek and works great.</li>
    <li> Bought this at Sally&#x27;s with the intention of taking it back before I even bought it. Lol. I only bought Bc I have never tried titanium plates and just wanted to test it out so I can choose between a Paul Mitchell ceramic or titanium flat iron. Didn&#x27;t expect to want to keep it. It&#x27;s so much better then my chi, which is at a fixed temp of 410degrees and burns my hair and makes it stink and barely any shine to it. Since I have fine thin hair I set it at 280 degrees and does the job better then the chi. Also does great at curling my hair with no snag, only down fall is it can leave a line from where you start to straighten the hair so best to start at the top but if not the line disappears after a while so not to big of a deal.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was okay, but I ended up buying a Jilbere and was happier with that. Don&#x27;t know with the Ion if it was the flat iron or I just needed different finishing products on my hair to make it more effective. **shrug**</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing and the price is even better. My best friend is a professional hair stylist and she recommended this flat iron to me. Now I&#x27;m paying it forward. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> Great flat irons I love them to death going to get a warranty on them.  Everyone who uses them falls in love with them. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this when I was on vacation cause I forgot my other FI which was a croc. They didn&#x27;t have a croc so figured croc, gator what the heck. It was okay at first but let me tell you in comparison to my croc it is garbage. The croc does ten job in half the time and leaves my hair straight. The gator takes too long and after my hair looks damaged and dry. I would suggest getting the croc. It was a life changer hair wise. You won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> I am still trying to figure out if I got a lower-quality substitute as the item I received is not what was pictured.  It is different in both color and the design of the handle.  Will probably not go through the hassle of a return but I regret purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my new straightener...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s silver/shiny. The picture on Amazon looks white... but it&#x27;s silver and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Power button and temperature buttons are together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Heats up SUPER fast. Like snap your fingers, that fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The digital screen let&#x27;s you pick the temperature you prefer. (Mine is 160) When it&#x27;s heating up it gives you a \\&quot;count up\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. One swipe through my sectioned strands and it&#x27;s instantly straight. I also tried curling with this and its fast and neat when you figure out what technique works for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. NO SNAGS! My hair is so long it touches the center of my back and not once has it caught my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(which is amazing because I bought a straightener twice the cost from a mall kiosk and it snagged my hair like crazy and quit working on me not even 6 months after having it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. I believe in the saying \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;... This makes me feel like I got my cake and ate it too...and have some more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair this with \\&quot;Paul Mitchell- Hot Off The Press\\&quot; to help enhance what this straightener was built to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: I went to my friends house for our ritual Friday night drinks and my friends husband actually commented that my hair looks different. I told him I bought a new straightener and that&#x27;s it. So if a guy can notice the difference that is something that has definitely got to be mentioned! I&#x27;ll stop here because I just have so many great things to say about this, if I talk about it anymore I might start sounding like a sales-woman!</li>
    <li> Es perfecta, y en realidad nos a salido muy buena.&lt;br /&gt;No tengamos complejos. Y por el precio esta que pagamos esta mucho mejor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its exaclty what we needed its turned out really good. No complains and for the price we paid its great. We had another Ion which is why we chose this one but we like this one, much much better.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, and the comment was &amp;#34;best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever owned!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.. I have natural wavy hair and it really straightens my hair really good.. Will definitely recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I have used some other high priced flat irons before but this one is way better. My  sister recommended this one to me and I wasn&#x27;t ready to try it cause most of the lower priced ones don&#x27;t seem to be the best. Once I tried this one and I was like wow this one is great. It heats up really fast and you can set the temperature. Try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> This is better than my previous Ion flat iron which I spent more money on.  This doens&#x27;t seem to fry my hair out like previous ones did (previous Ion not included in hair frying)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron! I went to get my hair cut and the stylist used this flat iron. I loved how my hair looked shiny and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;i loved that this was affordable!&lt;br /&gt; Amazing bonus...I have no frizz when I&#x27;m out in humidity which would always happen with my previous straightener. No hair product prevented the frizzing I experienced. But this straightener does the trick!</li>
    <li> My mother is a cosmetologist, so naturally I am quite picky about the products that I use on my hair. I&#x27;ve had a variety of hair straighteners including Remington, Chi, Andis, and multiple Ions..but this one is definitely my favorite. I have very thick, wavy hair and it&#x27;s an absolute mess if I fail to straighten it. This is the best flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever had. My roommate recently broke the cord (got stuck in a drawer) so I&#x27;m about to purchase another. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love my new Ion Gator! Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I researched these types of irons at length before selecting this one for my daughter. The digital temp control apparently makes all the difference allowing one to get it set to a perfect temperature for their own hair and repeat it.</li>
    <li> Good quality flat iron shipping was fast</li>
    <li> The handle does not heat up so I can comfortably style my hair and the flattening plate is exactly the right size for what I need.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have very fine hair and it works great for me.</li>
