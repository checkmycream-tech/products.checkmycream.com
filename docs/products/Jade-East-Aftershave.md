      <li>best fragrance for men</li>
      <li>either is great with me.</li>
      <li>and it again smells great to me.</li>
      <li>Great aftershave and cologne.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, smells great.</li>
      <li>Great oroduct.</li>
      <li>As good as I remember.</li>
      <li>He loved it.</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t quite as good as before.  </li>
      <li>I used this years ago and loved it, as I still do like it.</li>
      <li>Not quite as good as the Cologne but still good.</li>
      <li>This was as good as I remembered.</li>
      <li>He always liked it and</li>
      <li>I always liked it but lost track of it over time.  </li>
      <li>and he was thrilled.</li>
      <li>If you liked it then, you&#x27;ll like it now.</li>
      <li>My husband was thrilled with it as it was a gift for him.  </li>
      <li>Liked it then</li>
      <li>it just dosn&#x27;t seem to have the warm rounded type smell</li>
      <li>, my expectations were fully realized.&lt;br /&gt;While the pleasant  fragrance itself reminded me of the original Jade East, the fragrance seems to disappear within minutes of applying it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved Jade East Cologne and would purchase it gladly if it were available made by Swank.</li>
      <li>Not bad but not as good as I would like.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product, thought it was not around anymore</li>
      <li>So glad it&#x27;s available once again!  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like rubbing alcohol than aftershave.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great service.</li>
      <li>Glad I found it as I still enjoy the scent.</li>
      <li>The sense of smell is often thought to be our best long term memory, and I do remember what the original Jade East smelled like,</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem as strong and no staying power.  </li>
      <li>I am thankful that Jade East is still available.</li>
      <li>Hope it remains available.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>But this was a lot like the rest of them:  a bit to loud and a bit to girly, although I have to say that my girlfriend loved it.  </li>
      <li>and it brought back many good memories.</li>
      <li>The product I used in the 1960&#x27;s was made by Swank and was a very powerful distinctive fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I use both the aftershave and cologne because I enjoy their unique scents.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, clean and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>This was a popular scent when I was in high school and college</li>
      <li>Jade East has been my favorite since I first tried it in Guam in 1969.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He was quite excited when he found it advertised in a magazine.  </li>
      <li>and i found it again.i didnt even think it was made anymore.he was so excited to see it is still out there</li>
      <li>I use to use Jade East many years ago when it first came on the market.  </li>
      <li>This is NOT the original Jade East.</li>
      <li>Similar to Canoe with a nice refreshing scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just mens&#x27; cologne - nothing special.</li>
      <li>It is lighter and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, this is mentioned in the description, but I expect more from Amazon than misleading display photos and an exception to their usual easy return policy.</li>
      <li>the other popular after shave, which was considerably more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great to have a classic aftershave back again.</li>
      <li>It was sweet, masculine, and sexy.</li>
      <li>but well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>It really smells like the original cologne.</li>
      <li>This smells exactly as I remember it in 1978.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Songo!</li>
      <li>I used Jade East for many years back in the 60&#x27;s, and it seems like into the 70&#x27;s, too.</li>
      <li>Sure didn&#x27;t bring back any memories.</li>
      <li>It was my favorite scent on my husband when I met him as a teen.  </li>
      <li>A great aftershave blast from the past!</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s at least as good as most of what&#x27;s out the now days and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the neighborhood when you&#x27;re wearing it as do some current aftershaves.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clean, refreshing citrus-y scent that seems to be very subtle and unique.</li>
      <li>I use Jade East, not so much for the fragrance....</li>
      <li>You really have to try this Jade East.</li>
      <li>Their description is very misleading.</li>
      <li>was reasonable priced</li>
      <li>It sure brought back old memories.  </li>
      <li>I bought my husbands first bottle of jade east in 1965 and was very surprised to see this on amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still the same sweet smelling aftershave you remember.</li>
      <li>If you have tried all the new ones,try Jade East!</li>
      <li>Loved this stuff when I was a young man in the late 60s</li>
      <li>One of my most favorite scents for my husband to use (for me) and difficult to find.  </li>
      <li>Have used Jade East since I was in high school in the 60&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but the it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I like on my husband...</li>
      <li>but it does take me down memory lane and that is important to me....5 Stars.</li>
      <li>really brought back memories to my high school days...</li>
      <li>/&gt;So unless you intend on carrying the bottle with you wherever you go to apply it periodically, I would steer clear of this product.</li>
      <li>I did note that this advertisement says made by Songo, but the bottles clearly say made by Regency.</li>
      <li>Smells so good--just one whiff really took me back!  </li>
      <li>but it seems much the same to me and is so close to what we remembered I gave it a 5 star.</li>
      <li>Reminded me of my days as a student in the US in early seventies</li>
      <li>It smells ok but not sure that it is the same as the orregenal scent</li>
      <li>He used it back in his high school and college days.  </li>
      <li>This \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; has only the slightest hint of the original, and overall, it literally stinks, does not have a nice odor at all, just a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; odor.  </li>
      <li>Nothing more than alcohol and water and a little  brand unknown fragrance.  </li>
      <li>While I like the aroma of this version, it seems like the original had a little more licorice or anise smell and a little less of alcohol 2 aroma.</li>
      <li>I used this stuff back in the 60&#x27;s and using it now takes me back to my high school days..</li>
      <li>Bought this for display in a 60s collection and was surprised that it came with a completely different label and box than pictured, and that it is non-returnable.</li>
      <li>The estimated delivery date was Wednesday the 18th, I waited till Saturday, the 21st to take care of returning it, and Amazon had it listed as return window closed on the 20th, only 2 days after the estimated delivery date, True, it did show up a couple days before the 18th, but \\&quot;give me a break\\</li>
      <li>Did not live up to the masculine qualities it described.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes hard to find, but worth the effort.</li>

<li> generic name tends to bring to mind \\&quot;toilet</li>

<li> I&#x27;m usually a picky, bay rum type aftershave user, and was hoping for something I&#x27;d like as much.  </li>
<li> really did not expect much in making this purchase, and, sad to say</li>
<li> Also not so expensive that you only wear it on special occasions.</li>
<li> AND, it stinks in more ways that one.  </li>
<li> Again we could not find it for a long time, now we can find it again</li>

    <li> This was as good as I remembered. I used this years ago and loved it, as I still do like it.</li>

    <li> Have used Jade East since I was in high school in the 60&#x27;s.  Enjoy the fragrance.  Just needed a refill.</li>
    <li> Been useing this for a lot of years. Sometimes hard to find, but worth the effort. A lighter smell, but one that wears well all day and into the evening. Also not so expensive that you only wear it on special occasions. Give it a try, your &#x27;other&#x27; will like it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad.  He used to wear it back in the day.  He&#x27;s not sure if it&#x27;s still the same scent but he likes the smell either way.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; has only the slightest hint of the original, and overall, it literally stinks, does not have a nice odor at all, just a \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; odor.  The sense of smell is often thought to be our best long term memory, and I do remember what the original Jade East smelled like, It was sweet, masculine, and sexy. This smells like it&#x27;s generic name tends to bring to mind \\&quot;toilet water\\&quot;, as if it was dipped out of one.  AND, it stinks in more ways that one.  The estimated delivery date was Wednesday the 18th, I waited till Saturday, the 21st to take care of returning it, and Amazon had it listed as return window closed on the 20th, only 2 days after the estimated delivery date, True, it did show up a couple days before the 18th, but \\&quot;give me a break\\&quot;, I can&#x27;t even make it to the weekend to set up a return?  I purchased both the after shave and cologne, hoping at least one of them would have the correct aroma, they both smell exactly alike, both bad, neither what I expected and neither worth sell at all well for a buck in a dollar store.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like I remember it smelling years ago.  Sure didn&#x27;t bring back any memories. It&#x27;s more like rubbing alcohol than aftershave.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my father for CHRISTMAS.&lt;br /&gt;He has been using this after shave since the late 60s. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. He loved it.</li>
    <li> product as advertised. On time delivery!</li>
    <li> My husband used to wear this after shave/cologne and it did it for me when I smelled him. Again we could not find it for a long time, now we can find it again and it again smells great to me.</li>
    <li> As a teen ager, Jade East was THE scent to wear. Even the girls wore it. In all the insuing years, it hasn&#x27;t changed a bit. It&#x27;s still the same sweet smelling aftershave you remember. It&#x27;s a little more expensive now (isn&#x27;t everything?) but well worth the cost. If you liked it then, you&#x27;ll like it now.</li>
    <li> I use to use Jade East many years ago when it first came on the market.  I always liked it but lost track of it over time.  I happen to see on Amazon so purchased the aftershave.  It sure brought back old memories.  Glad I found it as I still enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> This smells exactly as I remember it in 1978. Brings back memories of going abroad with school to France . Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great to have a classic aftershave back again. It&#x27;s a clean, refreshing citrus-y scent that seems to be very subtle and unique.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of my youth!  Similar to Canoe with a nice refreshing scent.  If you are &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a poor, low quality knock off of the original product.   Nothing more than alcohol and water and a little  brand unknown fragrance.  The product I used in the 1960&#x27;s was made by Swank and was a very powerful distinctive fragrance.  I am disappointed.  I loved Jade East Cologne and would purchase it gladly if it were available made by Swank.</li>
    <li> It smells just like I remembered from about thirty years ago.  Wearing it again makes me almost feel that much younger!  I&#x27;ve actually been getting compliments on it from some ladies I&#x27;ve met while shopping.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> As good as I remember.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff when I was a young man in the late 60s and it&#x27;s still just as I remember it.  So glad it&#x27;s available once again!  Never wore any other aftershave then, and now I can again.  Thanks, Songo!</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original Jade East.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff back in the 60&#x27;s and using it now takes me back to my high school days.. I love it.</li>
    <li> In the sixties this was the after shave everybody used (or so it seemed).&lt;br /&gt;It was affordable at $5, vs Canoe, the other popular after shave, which was considerably more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I really did not expect much in making this purchase, and, sad to say, my expectations were fully realized.&lt;br /&gt;While the pleasant  fragrance itself reminded me of the original Jade East, the fragrance seems to disappear within minutes of applying it.&lt;br /&gt;So unless you intend on carrying the bottle with you wherever you go to apply it periodically, I would steer clear of this product.</li>
    <li> I have been curious for a while about Jade East. Their description is very misleading. This bottle is filled with 4 oz of disappointment. Do not wast your time or money.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff way back when I was smitten.  Liked it then and like it now.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my nose but it doesn&#x27;t seem as strong and no staying power.  Maybe they cheapened it up a bit for the times.</li>
    <li> It was my favorite scent on my husband when I met him as a teen.  Perhaps I don&#x27;t remember it correctly, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem the same.  May be the fault of my memory though.</li>
    <li> I bought the cologne version of this Jade East product several months ago and I just now ordered the After-Shave version. I use Jade East, not so much for the fragrance....to assume that it smells the same to me today that it did 40 years ago...would be a stretch....but it does take me down memory lane and that is important to me....5 Stars.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave and cologne.Fast shipping and great service.This smells just like I remember and have a gotten a few complements in the short time I&#x27;ve used it.Plan on ordering the travel set.You really have to try this Jade East.</li>
    <li> Jade East has been my favorite since I first tried it in Guam in 1969. I use both the aftershave and cologne because I enjoy their unique scents. I did note that this advertisement says made by Songo, but the bottles clearly say made by Regency. Do not worry.... either is great with me. I am thankful that Jade East is still available.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, smells great. Love it. Hope it remains available.</li>
    <li> Eeh.  If you like it, you like it.  It&#x27;s just mens&#x27; cologne - nothing special.</li>
    <li> Bought this for display in a 60s collection and was surprised that it came with a completely different label and box than pictured, and that it is non-returnable. To be fair, this is mentioned in the description, but I expect more from Amazon than misleading display photos and an exception to their usual easy return policy.</li>
    <li> I used Jade East for many years back in the 60&#x27;s, and it seems like into the 70&#x27;s, too. While I like the aroma of this version, it seems like the original had a little more licorice or anise smell and a little less of alcohol 2 aroma. Seems like the mint might be off just a tad, too. All in all, it&#x27;s at least as good as most of what&#x27;s out the now days and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the neighborhood when you&#x27;re wearing it as do some current aftershaves.</li>
    <li> No one who has ever used the \\&quot;Old\\&quot; Jade East cologne will ever believe that the fragrance hasn&#x27;t been tampered with. It is  a weak, almost fragrant-less excuse for JE. Was very disappointed; far more than the packaging has changed.</li>
    <li> I bought my husbands first bottle of jade east in 1965 and was very surprised to see this on amazon. It really smells like the original cologne. brings back the memories.........</li>
    <li> It smells ok but not sure that it is the same as the orregenal scent it just dosn&#x27;t seem to have the warm rounded type smell it seems a little sharp.</li>
    <li> best fragrance for men</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this is NOT the same scent as back in the 60s.  It is lighter and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, I rather like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I like on my husband...</li>
    <li> Love this product, thought it was not around anymore</li>
    <li> I had hoped at least an approximate vintage cologne and look, but this redux of Jade East smells more like talcum than the lime I remember. But worse is that the bottle is nothing like the photo. No longer sold by Songo but now by Regency, it&#x27;s an ugly, generic bottle with a (wait for it) tiger on the label. Worse, you cannot return it because it is flammable or something.</li>
    <li> Difficult to out of the bottle. Maybe the opening should be a little larger.</li>
    <li> A great aftershave blast from the past! If you have tried all the new ones,try Jade East! It is timeless.</li>
    <li> Great oroduct. Reminded me of my days as a student in the US in early seventies</li>
    <li> One of my most favorite scents for my husband to use (for me) and difficult to find.  Although not that expensive, but hard to find, I got it for him for Christmas and he was thrilled.</li>
    <li> I used Jade East for years starting in 1965.  A few years ago I found it again and it wasn&#x27;t quite as good as before.  This time I find it to not even be close to the way it was before.  It&#x27;s a Very Weak quality.  Not sure I will ever buy again.</li>
    <li> when my husband and i first started going together in the late 60&amp;#34;s he was wearing jade east.after all these year he was asking about it ,and so i did a search on amzon and i found it again.i didnt even think it was made anymore.he was so excited to see it is still out there,he wears it on times when we go out.it was reasonable priced also.thank you again for having a product i was searching for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for several years.</li>
    <li> Not bad but not as good as I would like.</li>
    <li> Brings back memories.  This was a popular scent when I was in high school and college and it brought back many good memories.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as the Cologne but still good.</li>
    <li> Yes, I purchased this for my husband who used to wear Jade East in the 60&#x27;s.  He always liked it and then it disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;He was quite excited when he found it advertised in a magazine.  It was twice the price of this at amazon.  He says he thinks it is a little different but it seems much the same to me and is so close to what we remembered I gave it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> It does seem alright, but I don&#x27;t believe it is the same as the stuff we had in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Smells so good--just one whiff really took me back!  My husband was thrilled with it as it was a gift for him.  He used it back in his high school and college days.  It&#x27;s light, clean and not overpowering.</li>
