      <li>I have natural hair (3B/3C), and I blow dry/flat iron</li>
      <li>My medium fine hair is hard to straighten but also fragile</li>
      <li>it gets the job done and the spray nozzle really sprays into a fine mist but the product itself is sticky and the smell is weird; smells sort of like cough medicine.</li>
      <li>so I have to be careful when I use high</li>

    <li> I have thin hair and have beeb using this for years! This is the only thing that will not weigh my hair down but still make it so shiny without taking away the bounceness and flow of my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly satisfied with this product. Why go out and spend like 30 dollars on the more \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; products when for under ten you get the same if not better heat protection. It has a wonderful watermelon scent and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy. Plus it&#x27;s great for flat ironing your hair or even blow drying it. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Nice Fragrance very light not heavy. I use it after washing or when flat ironing works very well!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair (3B/3C), and I blow dry/flat iron it straight sometimes. While straight it&#x27;s a little past my bra strap and pretty thick. This spray makes straightening much easier, protects my hair from heat damage, gives it a gorgeous shine, and even prevents it from getting puffy when it&#x27;s exposed to humidity! A little goes a long way. I also use it when my hair is curly sometimes, for the shine. (I get compliments on my hair every day.) My cousin introduced me to it, and I&#x27;ve told everyone else I know. We&#x27;re all in love with it now.</li>
    <li> This item does smell great and does not make my hair heavy and greasy looking.  It helps with frizzies, but i would say that it doesn&#x27;t last very long,.. i maybe need to re-apply more often.  But the price was decent.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this item 5 stars just because of it&#x27;s smell - it is heavenly!!  I have coarse, brown, Caucasian, curly/frizzy hair - and while this product is easy to apply and has the best smell ever (think Bubbleyum Watermelon flavored gum aroma in a spray) - it sadly does little to help my frizzies.  Additionally, the smell does not stay on my hair, so I don&#x27;t even get the benefit of watermelon-smelling hair all day - darn!</li>
    <li> Great for flat ironing hair. Styling lasts 2-3 days. Cuts down on frizz dramatically. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Fantasia Straightening Spray for quite some time, but the store I purchased it from discontinued it. I&#x27;m very happy to find that Amazon carries it. It protects my hair from the heat and gives it a nice sheen and plenty of bounce.</li>
    <li> Horrible corny joke aside... This stuff works like wonders! I love how it smells and it literally leaves my hair feeling silky soft even days later! Great product, actually works, would def. recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> OOokay So I did not follow the instruction about applying it to damp hair. Well I already lived and learn with my type of texture damp hair plus flat iron is a no no. What I will say about this product is WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN and THANK YOU. This is the next best ting to my discovered about midol for those monthly you know what. Nonetheless, it is amazing I did a quick blowout and piece by piece, part by part I spray this potion and my hair felt like a weave (lol), I have a 3b, 4a texture of course it varies and its not a permed. I love this product purchase this and you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair is dry from years of coloring it and this makes it smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Leaves hair smooth shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product, especially with my In Styler!  It leaves my hair looking and feeling very professional!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making my hair styling easy for me!!&lt;br /&gt;Prin......</li>
    <li> Fantasia Heat protector work really well for me. It also is none greasy which is what I love. Yes great product.</li>
    <li> I guess it protects from heat but it makes the hair kinda hard to me. But it does smell like watermelon a little greasy but I like that because of the texture of my hair it gives it shine</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My hair is left so silky after using this product. The trouble? Getting it to qualify for free shipping and/or ship to our APO overseas.</li>
    <li> I like it because it works for me. It is like a polish when you spray it to your hair. Just simply follow the direction \\&quot;spray light\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought it!  it gets the job done and the spray nozzle really sprays into a fine mist but the product itself is sticky and the smell is weird; smells sort of like cough medicine.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Very light. I&#x27;m  just not convinced it&#x27;s actually protecting my hair, but it does help to get it straighter.</li>
    <li> I like IC products, and I luv the Serum. I have 4b hair and this product just seems to dry it out. I think because it&#x27;s in a spray form. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s perfect for finer textured hair. Know your hair, then choose the best product for YOU. Not what works for everybody else. I will simply pass this on to someone else who wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best decisions I have ever made for my hair.  I color it black regularly and recently I have been straightening it every 2 days.  My hair is silky, healthy, and shiny.  I spray liberally throughout my hair after I wake up when it&#x27;s still damp.  I comb through and blow dry.  I stay away from my roots (this product may weigh down your hair)  and concentrate on my ends.  My medium fine hair is hard to straighten but also fragile so I have to be careful when I use high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself running my fingers through it, and it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.  Resists high humidity as well (I live in Florida.)  I wish I would have found this sooner, when my hair was VERY damaged.</li>
    <li> It seemed to protect hair from blow dryer and straightening comb, and gave my hair a softness and sheen. I will have to continue to use to see if it actually keeps hair from breakage.</li>
    <li> I love this hair protector.  This has been perfect to give my hair the slick or curly hair look perfectly.</li>
    <li> Product works as described. Excellent heat protection and smells great too! Super fast shipping. I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair dresser uses it, it protects my hair from all that blow drying and hair straightening. Can&#x27;t be without this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff smell good and works good while strengthing my hair</li>
    <li> Perfect heat protector/conditioner</li>
    <li> IT IS SO AMAZING MY HAIR LOOKS SO HEALTHY AND SHINEY! ILOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It Also Smells very GOOD</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> Very good product.  The scent is nice.  It protects from heat damage and keeps hair looking healthy and shiny, not oily like some products do.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it smells so nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. I decided to order it online because getting to a beauty supply is not that easy in my area. This product not only protects your hair from harsh treatment like blow drying, and the flat iron but it smells really good!</li>
