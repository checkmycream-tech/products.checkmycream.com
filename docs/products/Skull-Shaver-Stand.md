<ol>
      <li>The shaver fits on it very good.</li>
      <li>Works great with my Skullshaver,Bald Eagle Pro.</li>
      <li>The Butterfly Shaver Pro was great</li>
      <li>A good buy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a stand for the shaver, which is nice to have</li>
      <li>Gives the shaver a nice place to be stored on the bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>Handy stand for my Skull Shaver.</li>
      <li>most quality shavers include a stand</li>
      <li>It works a lot better with my husband&#x27;s Shull Shaver razor because of the boxier shape of the razor.  </li>
      <li>Makes for clean, safe place for my skull machine.</li>
      <li>The stand would have worked fine but the shaver didn&#x27;t so I returned the shaver and the accessories.</li>
      <li>Great accessory for allowing your shaver to dry after a quick rinse.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Simple, but effective.</li>
      <li>Useful product.</li>
      <li>so my shaver isn&#x27;t sitting directly on the counter top.</li>
      <li>Right tool for the right job.</li>
      <li>The Skull Shaver Stand is nice, but the  Butterfly Shaver pro razor can slip out a little to easy if jostled.  </li>
      <li>Allows the blades and head to air dry nicely after the after shave rinse.</li>
      <li>The shaver wants to slide forward off the stand all the time.</li>
      <li>Having a small lip on the end would easily solve the problem, will see about super gluing something on ends to prevent slippage.</li>
      <li>Perhaps a slight lip or upward curl on the arms of the stand could help the Butterfly razor stay in place better.</li>

    <li> Handy stand for my Skull Shaver. Simple, but effective.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Skullshaver,Bald Eagle Pro. Gives the shaver a nice place to be stored on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Great accessory for allowing your shaver to dry after a quick rinse. Keeps the heads off the counter and allows air circulation.</li>
    <li> The stand would have worked fine but the shaver didn&#x27;t so I returned the shaver and the accessories.</li>
    <li> Does its intended job function, however as other reviews have pointed out, the shaver does slide off quite easily if not careful.  Having a small lip on the end would easily solve the problem, will see about super gluing something on ends to prevent slippage.</li>
    <li> Right tool for the right job. Makes for clean, safe place for my skull machine. Allows the blades and head to air dry nicely after the after shave rinse.</li>

    <li> This is the solution to drying your skull shaver. A good buy.</li>
    <li> Useful product. Worth the money. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not really much to say. It&#x27;s a stand for the shaver, which is nice to have so my shaver isn&#x27;t sitting directly on the counter top. The shaver fits on it very good.</li>
    <li> its works, but its like a universal stand. you have to put in just wright.</li>
    <li> Purchased July 4. Item stopped working today August 8th. Very disappointed, item was great until today. 30day exchange policy And stopped 2 days after the policy ended. NOT HAPPY ‼️‼️‼️</li>
    <li> The shaver&#x27;s great, the stand is a piece of crap. Works like it was designed for another product. The shaver wants to slide forward off the stand all the time. Must have been designed by a blind guy.</li>
    <li> Product is low quality and does not offer a sturdy base for the Skull Shaver.</li>
    <li> most quality shavers include a stand</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what it is.  Does the job when shaver head is mounted but not if other trimmer attachments are mounted - not tall enough.</li>
    <li> I bought the Butterfly Shaver Pro, the Skull Shaver Stand and a set of the two replacement shaver heads.  The Butterfly Shaver Pro was great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.  The Skull Shaver Stand is nice, but the  Butterfly Shaver pro razor can slip out a little to easy if jostled.  It works a lot better with my husband&#x27;s Shull Shaver razor because of the boxier shape of the razor.  Perhaps a slight lip or upward curl on the arms of the stand could help the Butterfly razor stay in place better.</li>
